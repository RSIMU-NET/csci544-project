While the Privacy Act permits disclosures to law enforcement for any type of crime, SSA only allows disclosures under certain conditions. For example, for serious and violent crimes, SSA will disclose information to law enforcement if the individual whose information is sought has been indicted or convicted of that crime. Even when information is disclosed, it might be limited to results obtained from verifying a social security number and name unless the investigation concerns fraud in SSA or other federal benefit programs, then the agency can work with law enforcement officials as part of a task force or joint investigation. However, the disclosure policies for law enforcement of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Census Bureau, both of which have requirements prescribed in their statutes, are also more restrictive than the Privacy Act and the policies of most federal agencies. SSA officials consider SSA's disclosure policy integral to carrying out the agency's mission. The various restrictions in SSA's disclosure policy create a complex policy that is confusing and could cause inconsistent application across the agency's more than 1,300 field offices. This could result in uneven treatment of law enforcement requests. Because aggregated data were not available, GAO was unable to assess the extent to which SSA does not consistently apply its policy. However, GAO was told of instances in which SSA officials in some field offices did not give law enforcement information that appeared to be permitted under the policy as well as instances in which they gave them more than what appeared to be allowed. Generally, law enforcement officials find the limited information SSA shares useful to their investigation, but many law enforcement officials, particularly state and local law enforcement officials, are not familiar with the policy or the process for requesting information from SSA. Most law enforcement officials expressed a desire for more information than is currently permitted under SSA's policy, but SSA maintains that providing more information would hurt its ability to carry out its primary mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Law enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to investigate the events of September  11th increased awareness that federal agencies collect and maintain  personal information on individuals that could be useful to law  enforcement in helping them locate and prosecute individuals responsible  for crimes.

For  example, the Social Security Administration (SSA), the federal agency  responsible for administering three major benefit programs and issuing  SSNs, is one of the country\u2019s primary custodians of personal information,  maintaining records on 290 million living individuals. To protect personal information collected by all federal agencies, including SSA, the Congress  passed the Privacy Act in 1974. The Privacy Act generally requires the  individual affected to give consent before a federal agency discloses  personal information the agency maintains in certain records and retrieves  using the individual\u2019s name or other identifying information. However,  there are 12 exceptions to the restrictions placed on federal agencies for  disclosing this personal information, one of which permits disclosure to  law enforcement agencies as long as certain criteria are met.", "The Privacy Act protects individuals\u2019 privacy while, at the same time,  allowing individuals\u2019 personal information to be disclosed for appropriate  purposes, such as assisting law enforcement.

SSA is responsible for issuing SSNs as part of its responsibility for  administering three major income support programs for the elderly,  disabled, and their dependents: the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance;  Disability Insurance; and Supplemental Security Income.

This  information is used in tax administration and is reported by individuals on  their federal income tax returns. Tax return information may only be  disclosed as permitted by the IRC.", "Information transmitted to SSA has been protected from disclosure by  statute and regulation since the inception of the Social Security program.  To maintain the confidentiality of the personal information the agency  collects to carry out its mission, in June 1937, SSA adopted its first  regulation, known as \u201cRegulation No. 1,\u201d to protect the privacy of  individuals\u2019 records and to include a pledge of confidentiality. The  regulation was reinforced by amendments to the Social Security Act in  1939, which became the statutory basis for maintaining the confidentiality  of SSA\u2019s records. For decades, the act, along with Regulation No. 1,  formed the basis for SSA\u2019s disclosure policy. However, the enactment of  subsequent legislation\u2014the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in  1966 and Government in the Sunshine Act in 1976\u2014caused SSA to  reexamine its disclosure and confidentiality policy. This legislation placed  the burden on SSA, as well as other federal agencies, to justify withholding  information requested. Still, SSA\u2019s policy is designed to protect the privacy  rights of individuals to the fullest extent possible while permitting the  exchange of records required to fulfill its administrative and program  responsibilities. Over the years, SSA\u2019s disclosure policy has been revised  to comply with about 25 statutes, including the Privacy Act.", "The Privacy Act of 1974 is the primary law governing the protection of  personal privacy by agencies of the federal government. The Privacy Act  regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal  information that federal agencies maintain in a system of records. The act  requires that, at the time the information is collected, agencies inform an  individual of the following: (1) authority for the collection and whether it  is mandatory or voluntary, (2) the principal purpose for the collection of  information, (3) what the routine uses for the information may be, and  (4) what the consequences are of not providing the information. The act  applies to systems of records maintained by federal agencies, and with  certain exceptions, prohibits agencies from disclosing such records  without the consent of the individual whose records are being sought. The  act authorizes 12 exceptions under which a federal agency may disclose  information in its records without consent, as shown in table 1. The  Privacy Act requires that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  issue guidance and oversee agency implementation of the act. The act  does not generally apply to state and local government records; state laws  vary widely regarding disclosure of personal information in state  government agencies\u2019 control.", "The Privacy Act, under the law enforcement exception, outlines the  minimum criteria that must be met by a law enforcement agency to obtain  personal information without an individual\u2019s consent. The act requires that  the request specify the information being sought and the law enforcement  activity being carried out. The request must be in writing, and signed by  the agency head. In addition, OMB guidance permits agencies to disclose  a personal record covered by the Privacy Act to law enforcement at the  agencies\u2019 own initiative, when a violation of law is suspected; provided  that such disclosure has been established in advance as a \u201croutine use\u201d  and misconduct is related to the purposes for which the records are  maintained.

Such considerations are above and beyond what is  included in the law enforcement exception to the Privacy Act. SSA  maintains that it must have a restrictive disclosure policy because much of  the information the agency collects is especially personal. In addition, SSA  officials believe that the agency must uphold the pledge it made to the  public to keep this information confidential when SSA first began  collecting it.

SSA might also disclose  information when a person violates parole and the violent crime  provisions of the original conviction have been met. SSA defines violent  and serious crimes as those characterized by the use of physical force or  by the threat of physical force causing actual injury, or coercing the victim  to act for fear of suffering serious bodily harm.

POMS is the primary  tool the field offices use to assist them in making appropriate disclosure  decisions when they receive requests from law enforcement agencies.  POMS provides detailed guidance and incorporates references to  disclosures covered by 25 different statutes, which are located in at least  15 different sections of the POMS. SSA uses Emergency Messages, usually  limited to a one-time only emergency situation, to provide implementing  guidance in emergency situations. For example, on September 19, 2001,  SSA issued an emergency message to field offices instructing them to  direct all law enforcement requests related to the terrorists\u2019 attacks of  September 11, 2001, to SSA\u2019s OIG\u2019s Office.", "SSA\u2019s regulations are designed for implementation at all levels of the  agency, including SSA\u2019s field offices, regions, and headquarters offices.  SSA can make disclosures through its headquarters, 1,336 field offices, or  10 regional offices. Disclosures can also be made through SSA\u2019s OIG, the  law enforcement component of SSA that is responsible for conducting  audits and investigations of agency programs and activities. The OIG is  authorized to handle disclosures through a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) with SSA. The OIG investigations staff conducts and coordinates  activity related to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of SSA  programs and operations. The OIG investigations staff also conducts joint  investigations with other federal, state, and local law enforcement  agencies. The OIG investigations staff is located in 60 locations that  comprise 31 field offices and 10 field divisions.", "SSA\u2019s OIG is authorized to disclose individuals\u2019 personal information to  law enforcement agencies as agreed with SSA under a MOU. In July  2000, SSA\u2019s OIG and the Commissioner of SSA signed an MOU, which  outlines the conditions under which the OIG can disclose to law  enforcement agencies certain limited information from SSA\u2019s records in  cases involving fraud of a Social Security program or misuse of an SSN.  Under the MOU, the OIG can disclose whether a given name and SSN  match the name and SSN in records at SSA, referred to as SSN verification.  The MOU delegates authority to OIG employees at all levels. SSA requires  that the OIG ensure that law enforcement requests meet the same  requirements outlined in the Privacy Act as well as those outlined in SSA\u2019s  POMS and other guidance. In addition, law enforcement requests must  include the name and SSN to be reviewed and a certification that the  individual about whom information is sought is suspected of misusing an  SSN or of committing another crime against a Social Security program.  Under the MOU, the OIG is permitted to open an investigation and  participate in joint investigations with law enforcement officials, if the OIG  determines that further investigation is warranted.", "SSA requires that the OIG submit an annual report to the Commissioner of  SSA, no later than 30 days after the end of the fiscal year. The annual  report must reflect the total number of SSN verification requests received  and responses made, if the number is different, broken down by OIG field  division. SSA also requires that the OIG maintain records from each fiscal  year for 1 year.

Except for requests involving national security  issues, which are referred to the Privacy Officer at SSA headquarters and  ultimately to the Commissioner of SSA, field locations handle requests for  disclosing information because the offices are at the local level where  information is frequently needed. Privacy Coordinators are located in the  regional offices and are available to assist the field offices on questions  about disclosures. The Privacy Coordinators report to the Privacy Officer.", "When SSA receives a request from law enforcement agencies, SSA officials  must first determine whether the request is valid, that is, in writing on the  agency\u2019s letterhead, specifies the records being requested, and is signed by  an official of the requesting office. SSA field office officials are instructed  to rely on their knowledge of local law enforcement agencies to determine  whether a request is from the proper person. For valid requests, SSA  officials must also determine whether the agency requesting the  information has jurisdiction in the particular case. Other specific criteria  considered in determining whether SSA will disclose individuals\u2019 personal  information to law enforcement agencies are outlined in figure 1. Tax  information is disclosed consistent with IRC 6103.

The  Commissioner\u2019s ad hoc authority is generally reserved for exceptional  cases approved on a case-by-case basis. For example, following the  September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Commissioner\u2019s ad hoc  authority was invoked to disclose to the FBI and other law enforcement  agencies information in SSA\u2019s files concerning suspects or other persons  who may have had information on the attacks and to help identify and  locate victims and members of their families. Certain requirements must  be met in order to invoke the Commissioner\u2019s ad hoc authority. The  request must be deemed appropriate and necessary, SSA\u2019s regulations  cannot specify what is to be done in the circumstance in question, and no  provision of law can specifically prohibit the disclosure. SSA policy  prohibits the disclosure of tax return information under the  Commissioner\u2019s ad hoc authority.

Most federal agencies would probably  provide that information from their records covered by the Privacy Act.  However, under SSA\u2019s policy, no information would be given to the law  enforcement agency because SSA has determined that these are not  crimes that warrant any disclosure of individuals\u2019 personal information.  Additionally, the Privacy Act includes a routine use exception, which  allows personal information to be disclosed on the initiative of the  custodian agency. To qualify for a routine use, the proposed use of the  information must be compatible with the purpose for which the  information was obtained.

Fourteen of the  24 major federal agencies have established law enforcement routine use  exceptions that are generally applicable to their systems of records. Some  agencies alternatively only apply the law enforcement routine use  exception to specific systems of records. Accordingly, under the Privacy  Act, disclosure of personal information to law enforcement agencies may  be permitted, depending on the agency and the circumstances, either by  the law enforcement exception or the routine use exception. SSA,  however, does not permit such disclosures from SSA program records  under either exception.

This statutory restriction serves to  protect the confidentiality of personal and financial information in IRS\u2019s  possession and ensure compliance with tax laws. A court order is  generally required to open tax returns or other tax information to federal  law enforcement officials investigating a federal nontax crime or preparing  for a grand jury or other judicial proceeding, without the knowledge or  consent of the taxpayer involved. The Attorney General, the Deputy  Attorney General, and other Justice Department officials specifically  named in the statute, are permitted to seek a court order. To obtain a court  order, the requester has to demonstrate that: reasonable cause exists to believe that a specific criminal act has been  committed and tax return information is or may be relevant to a matter  relating to the commission of the criminal act; the information being sought will be used exclusively in a federal criminal  investigation concerning the criminal act; and cannot be reasonably  obtained, under the circumstances, from another source.", "Information federal law enforcement obtains from IRS generally cannot be  shared with state and local law enforcement.

In addition, to ensure that disclosure procedures are followed, field office  managers told us that they usually handle information requests from law  enforcement officials rather than leaving this duty to staff.", "However, we noted in our survey and during selected site visits, a limited  number of instances where SSA\u2019s disclosure policy appears to have been  inconsistently applied. In some instances, law enforcement might have  received more information than permitted under SSA\u2019s policy. For  example, one SSA OIG office we visited provided a law enforcement  agency with the name, SSN, date of birth, place of birth, and parents\u2019 name  when it seemed that only the name and SSN verification results should  have been provided. In another case, an SSA official reported that a state  law enforcement officer stopped an individual and telephoned SSA  requesting information to verify the SSN, date of birth, place of birth, and  sex and was provided the results over the telephone. Although SSA\u2019s  policy permits the verification of the name and SSN, such requests are  required to be in writing. In other instances, requests that should have  been approved might have been turned down. For example, one SSA field  office manager told us that nothing could be disclosed to law enforcement  if the request for information pertained to an individual suspected of  misusing an SSN because the individual had not been indicted or  convicted of this crime. However, SSA\u2019s policy would appear to permit  disclosure in this situation. Another SSA field office manager told us that  office would not disclose any information without consent from the  individual for whom the information is being requested.", "Several possible reasons exist for the inconsistent application of SSA\u2019s  disclosure policy. Although our survey showed that most SSA field offices  receive requests for information from law enforcement, SSA field officials  we spoke with said that they do not receive requests frequently. For  example, several officials told us that they received fewer than 10 requests  in 2002. Because requests are infrequent, staff must often consult the  policy to help them to respond properly. However, many staff members  consider the policy confusing. For example, one field office manager said  that, \u201cWe have doubts as to what information should be provided to U.S.  Border Patrol.\u201d Similarly, a manager in another field office said, \u201cSSA  disclosure policy should be written in \u201cPlain English\u201d to make it easy to  understand by all readers.\u201d A different field office manager commented,  \u201c Disclosure policy is still frequently confusing for much of our  staff.\u201d This lack of clarity leads to confusion about what should be  disclosed. For example, one manager said, \u201c is quite  confusing. It\u2019s hard to know what you can disclose.\u201d Another manager  commented, \u201cI think the policy should be clearer than it is. There\u2019s too  much\u2026\u2019if this, then that, but not this and so on.\u2019\u201d", "In addition, SSA\u2019s responsibilities to both assist law enforcement and  protect individuals\u2019 privacy may be exacerbating the confusion and  inconsistent application of the agency\u2019s policy. For example, officials at  SSA headquarters said that they want to help law enforcement as much as  possible, but they believed they must also protect the privacy of the  information in their systems of records in order to perform SSA\u2019s primary  mission. Some managers in SSA field offices believed that the agency  should provide information to law enforcement. However, several field  office managers expressed their concerns and reluctance about sharing  information with law enforcement agencies. Employees who provide  information to an individual inappropriately could be subject to a penalty,  including suspension or termination from SSA. Therefore, rather than risk  disclosing information inappropriately, some officials might err on the side  of caution and not disclose information even when it is permitted under  the agency\u2019s disclosure policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Field Offices Do Not Maintain Aggregated Data, but OIG Does", "paragraphs": ["Consistent application of SSA\u2019s disclosure policy cannot be assessed  because, according to OMB guidelines, SSA is not required to maintain  aggregated data showing what requests were made, whether they were  approved, and what information was given to fulfill them. According to  SSA, disclosures of individuals\u2019 personal information are kept in  individuals\u2019 files. While SSA policy does not stipulate that field offices  must keep track of requests made by a law enforcement agency, our  survey revealed some information about these requests. For example, we  estimate that 82 percent of SSA field offices indicated that they had  received requests for personal information from law enforcement  agencies. However, 71 percent of SSA\u2019s field offices do not maintain a  record of requests made by law enforcement agencies.", "While the majority of SSA field offices do not maintain records of law  enforcement requests, results from our survey showed that 90 percent of  the SSA OIG offices maintain these data for disclosures the OIG made. The  SSA OIG is required to report to the SSA Commissioner aggregated data  annually on disclosures made. According to the OIG, it also keeps a hard  copy of requests made by law enforcement agencies for at least 1 year. On  the basis of these aggregated data, between fiscal years 2000 and  2002, SSA OIG regional divisions fulfilled almost 30,000 requests from law  enforcement agencies for name and SSN verification. Table 2 shows the  number of verifications fulfilled by SSA OIG regional divisions and  headquarters. However, no numbers are kept on denied law enforcement  requests.

For example, one officer  told us that after having his initial request for information, which was not  in writing turned down because he had not followed proper procedures,  he obtained a search warrant to obtain the information from SSA. The  officer said that no one at SSA explained to him the procedures for  obtaining information until he got the search warrant. It is unclear when or  if SSA officials let law enforcement officers know what procedures need  to be followed to get information. Federal law enforcement agencies, on  the other hand, more often understood the Privacy Act\u2019s procedures.  Further, most federal law enforcement agencies we spoke with submitted  their requests to SSA\u2019s OIG\u2014itself, a federal law enforcement agency.

The information received from SSA was considered  by law enforcement as the most accurate and up-to-date information  available to help in their investigations.", "Law enforcement was also satisfied with the time in which SSA provided  the information. In many cases, law enforcement officers we spoke with  indicated that SSA provided the information very quickly. In addition, one  SSA OIG official told us that when procedures are followed correctly, the  OIG can reply back in 24 hours or less, depending on the information  requested. SSA confirmed the timeliness of its responses to law  enforcement requests.

For example, one federal officer  who investigates nonviolent felony crimes said that SSA seems more  concerned about someone committing fraud against one of its programs  than about identity theft involving the use of someone\u2019s SSN. He also said  that SSA would not provide him with any information on the person whose  identity was being stolen. Another officer said that because he could not  get necessary information from SSA, he had resorted to other means of  gathering the information needed. The officer said that depending on  resources available, it could take up to 3 weeks to get someone\u2019s SSN  through other sources. Furthermore, the officer said that while he could  make the case without the SSA information, the information SSA can  provide would be invaluable to helping fully prosecute a case.", "Many SSA officials in the field and OIG offices agreed that SSA\u2019s  disclosure policy is too restrictive. Many believed that, for legitimate  investigations, the policy should allow for disclosures to law enforcement  officials of whatever information they need. One SSA OIG official said  that, as a law enforcement officer, he believed that he should be able to  provide information to another law enforcement officer especially when  he knew that doing so would help with a case and also because law  enforcement officers would be more willing to share information with the  OIG. While the SSA Commissioner can invoke ad hoc authority for certain  specific cases to disclose information, as was done in response to the  disclosure requests related to the September 11 terrorist attacks, SSA  officials said that the use of this authority must be limited.

SSA\u2019s disclosure policy attempts to preserve its pledge to  maintain individuals\u2019 privacy while cooperating with law enforcement and  complying with applicable statutes. The end result is a complex policy that  is more restrictive than the Privacy Act requirements and those of most  federal agencies and more like the policies of IRS and Census, agencies  that maintain personal information whose requirements are embodied in  statute.", "In addition, some SSA field office staff and local law enforcement officers  find SSA\u2019s policy confusing and sometimes frustrating. As a possible  consequence of SSA staff and local law enforcement\u2019s confusion about  SSA\u2019s policy, law enforcement may be denied requested information even  though SSA\u2019s policy permits its disclosure or law enforcement may receive  information that SSA\u2019s policy does not permit. Although we could not  assess the overall level of consistency in the application of SSA\u2019s policy,  we believe eliminating or reducing confusion about the agency\u2019s policy  would help ensure consistent application, and that this can be achieved  with relatively modest actions on SSA\u2019s part."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure consistent application of SSA\u2019s disclosure policy for law  enforcement in all of its offices and to better assist law enforcement  agencies making disclosure requests, we recommend that the  Commissioner of SSA do the following:  Take steps to eliminate confusion about the agency\u2019s disclosure policy.

These three agencies reported that they had no comments.", "SSA stated that our draft report accurately reflected the importance of  SSA\u2019s disclosure policy to the agency\u2019s mission but it presents an  incomplete description of both the statutory basis for and rationale behind  the policy. Further, SSA stated that the draft report does not take into  account the statutory basis for the nondisclosure of tax information or the  statutory support for the agency\u2019s long-standing confidentiality pledge;  therefore, SSA believes that our findings and recommendations are  \u201coverbroad.\u201d We are aware of SSA\u2019s obligation under the IRC and took this  into consideration during our review of SSA\u2019s disclosure policy; however,  we have revised the report, where appropriate, to clarify that our  observations about SSA\u2019s disclosure policy relative to the Privacy Act do  not extend to SSA\u2019s disclosure of tax information. Disclosure of tax  information is controlled by section 6103 of the IRC. We also provided  additional reference to the statutory basis and rationale behind SSA\u2019s  disclosure policy.", "SSA also commented that 42 U.S.C. 1306 provided an independent basis  for nondisclosures, apart from the Privacy Act. The report recognizes that  42 U.S.C. 1306 provides the basis for SSA\u2019s disclosure policy and we have  added a citation for this authority. Section 1306 provides SSA authority to  regulate the dissemination of information in its custody as otherwise  permitted by federal law. Other federal law includes the Privacy Act. Our  report merely points out that SSA has used this authority to regulate in a  more restrictive fashion than the Privacy Act requires.", "SSA stated that it believed that our characterizing the agency\u2019s policy as  more restrictive than most federal agencies does SSA a disservice because  many federal agencies have little interaction with the public at large. SSA  states that the only two agencies of SSA\u2019s size and scope with respect to  gathering information from the public to accomplish their missions are  IRS and Census, which have more restrictive disclosure policies and  statutes that prohibit disclosures. We believe that our comparison and  characterization of SSA\u2019s disclosure policy is fair. We compared SSA\u2019s  disclosure policy to those of the other 23 agencies covered by the Chief  Financial Officers\u2019 Act. We decided also to compare SSA\u2019s policy to those  of IRS and Census because they are similar in size and scope of data  maintained on individuals. All of the agencies we compared are subject to  the Privacy Act. As we reported, SSA\u2019s disclosure policy, as well as those  of IRS and the Census Bureau is more restrictive than most federal  agencies.", "SSA agreed in part with our recommendation that the Commissioner take  steps to eliminate confusion that may cause inconsistent application of the  policy. SSA acknowledged that the policy is complex and could lead to  occasional inconsistent application. However, SSA stated that it provides  extensive instructions in its POMS for employees and the instructions  refer staff to experts in regional and central offices for assistance when  needed. SSA also stated that its regional offices have provided employees  access to Intranet sites that clarify disclosure policy, but the agency will  consider providing additional refresher training as appropriate. In  addition, SSA stated it is currently reviewing improvements to the POMS  sections that address law enforcement disclosures that the agency  believes will address our concerns. SSA expressed concern about the  option to consider delegating \u201cdecision-making authority for law  enforcement requests to specified locations such as the OIG...\u201d SSA stated  that the Inspectors General Act of 1978 prohibits agencies from  transferring programmatic functions to the Inspector General.", "We acknowledge in our report that SSA provides guidance on its  disclosure policy in its POMS.  While we found that employees were aware  of this guidance, SSA staff told us that they found SSA\u2019s policy confusing.  We believe additional training as well as improvements to the POMS that  clarify or simplify SSA\u2019s policy should help ensure consistent application.", "With respect to SSA\u2019s concern about our recommendation to consider  delegating decision-making authority for law enforcement requests to  specified locations such as the OIG, regional privacy officers, or other  units that SSA determines would have expertise in this area, we did not  intend to imply that programmatic functions be transferred to the OIG.  Our recommendation was aimed at directing disclosure requests to units  that currently perform this function and that appear to have expertise in  SSA\u2019s disclosure policy. We simply intended to provide options for SSA to  better utilize the resources they already have in place to determine  whether law enforcement requests are permitted under SSA\u2019s disclosure  policy. The OIG, who currently responds to law enforcement requests as  authorized under an MOU with SSA, was only one of the units we  suggested as an option. We continue to believe that delegating authority to  handle disclosure requests to specified units with expertise in SSA\u2019s  disclosure policy would be a plausible option for helping to ensure  consistent application of SSA\u2019s policy. This option could reduce or  eliminate the need for SSA field office officials who receive sporadic  requests from law enforcement to relearn SSA\u2019s disclosure policy.", "SSA agreed with our recommendation that the Commissioner of SSA  should provide law enforcement with information on SSA\u2019s disclosure  policy and procedures and SSA believes the agency has done so.

Some of the  local law enforcement officials we spoke with were unfamiliar with how to  obtain information from SSA.  Therefore, we continue to believe that  information that clearly defines SSA\u2019s disclosure policy and procedures  would be helpful to law enforcement. Further, we believe that our findings  and recommendations are central to many concerns expressed by both  SSA and law enforcement officials and we view the steps that SSA  indicated that it plans to consider, or already has in process to ensure  consistent application of its disclosure policy and law enforcement\u2019s  understanding of how to obtain information from SSA as appropriate steps  toward correcting the concerns expressed.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Commissioner of Social  Security; the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury, and Homeland Security;  the U.S. Attorney General; appropriate congressional committees; and  other interested parties.
