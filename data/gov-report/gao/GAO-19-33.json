The 27 agencies reported transactions totaling about $3.1 billion. Vehicle sales accounted for $2.6 billion (about 84 percent) of that total.", "GAO found that GSA officials who procure vehicles for federal agencies and Army officials who purchase helicopters appeared to understand the exchange/sale process and used it frequently. However, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) officials expressed confusion about key aspects of the authority. For example, officials were unclear about how to sell property; this lack of clarity led to missed opportunities to use sale proceeds for replacing property. GSA OGP officials who guide agencies on the use of the authority acknowledged that the exchange/sale regulations can be confusing but GSA's plan to amend them is at least 2 years away. Because GSA does not plan to address this confusion in the near term through other means such as bulletins or outreach, agencies' misunderstanding of the authority could lead to additional missed opportunities to be effective stewards of government funds.", "Regarding monitoring of exchange and sale activities, GAO found that the Army monitored activities consistent with its policy.

Over time,  agencies\u2019 personal property may no longer adequately perform the task  for which it was used. Federal law authorizes agencies to exchange  (trade-in) or sell such property still needed to meet their missions and  apply the exchange allowance or sale proceeds in whole or in partial  payment to acquire similar replacement property. Such transactions are  known as personal property \u201cexchange/sale\u201d transactions. These  transactions facilitate the replacement of property by allowing agencies to  offset the cost of new property, resulting in savings to taxpayers. Without  this authority, agencies may have to charge the full purchase price of new  property to their appropriations, while depositing the proceeds from the  disposition of their worn property in the U.S. Treasury.", "Because exchange/sale transactions provide agencies with an  opportunity to save costs, it is important that agencies using the authority  establish policies, processes, and procedures with effective controls to  help ensure they meet applicable requirements and are good stewards of  government resources. The General Services Administration (GSA) has  issued regulations that describe the terms, conditions, and reporting  requirements for using such exchanges or sales, but agencies are to  carry out the authority and adhere to legal requirements after assessing  their own needs and making decisions about whether to use the authority.", "You asked us to review agencies\u2019 use of the personal property  exchange/sale authority.

To describe what is known about personal property exchange/sale  transactions, we analyzed annual exchange/sale summary data, as  reported to GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy (GSA OGP) by  federal agencies from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. These  data\u2014which are the only federal government-wide data available on  exchange/sale transactions\u2014identify the agency involved in the  transactions, the transaction method, and the type and value of the  property. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed GSA\u2019s  electronic template provided to federal agencies for reporting data and  the user guide and other materials related to GSA\u2019s personal property  reporting tool. We interviewed GSA officials about the process for  collecting, submitting, reconciling, verifying, and compiling annual  government-wide, exchange/sale summary reports. To assess the  reliability of selected agencies\u2019 data, we interviewed officials from these  agencies (see below) about the exchange/sale data they reported to GSA  and reconciled documentation on transactions with data reported to GSA  to identify any discrepancies. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to describe the agencies that use the authority and the  general types of property they acquire, but determined that data from the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) were unreliable.", "To examine selected agencies\u2019 experiences using the personal property  exchange/sale authority and monitoring such activities, we selected three  agencies\u2014GSA, Army, and VA\u2014based on various characteristics, such  as type, quantity, and value of personal property reported as exchanged  and sold in GSA\u2019s summary data.", "GSA: We selected GSA because it reported a high-value of  exchange/sale transactions.

In particular, the Army Program Executive Office for  Aviation (Army Aviation) accounted for the majority of high-value  aviation-related exchange/sale transactions within DOD. Beyond the  three selected agencies, we heard from other agencies when we  attended a joint GSA-DOD presentation focused on aviation that  brought together GSA, Army, Navy, and Air Force officials to discuss  their experiences using the exchange/sale authority.", "VA: We selected VA because it reported a high-number of low-value  items sold or exchanged.

Fourth, the acquired and the replaced property are designed or  constructed for the same purpose. For instance, ambulances and  station wagons adapted for use as ambulances would be considered  similar.", "The property exchanged or sold was not acquired for the principal  purpose of later exchanging or selling it using the authority. For  example, an agency cannot purchase a costly piece of equipment for  the sole reason that it will deliver a higher value when sold using the  authority.", "Proceeds from the sale can only be put toward the purchase of  replacement property and cannot be spent on services. In other  words, an agency can use proceeds from the sale of a vehicle to  purchase a new vehicle, but it cannot use proceeds to hire a  mechanic to repair an existing vehicle.", "In addition, GSA regulations, except as otherwise authorized by law,  require that proceeds from sales be available during the same fiscal year  the property was sold or the following fiscal year for replacement  property. For an item sold in fiscal year 2018, an agency has the rest of  fiscal year 2018 as well as fiscal year 2019 to purchase a replacement  item. If agencies do not spend these funds by the end of fiscal year 2019,  monies are to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury. Finally, agencies are  prohibited from using the authority to replace certain types of property  (i.e., hand tools and clothing). However, agencies may request a waiver from GSA to sell these prohibited items or to extend the time frame to  purchase replacement property.", "Agencies may choose between two transaction methods to replace  property\u2014the exchange (trade-in) or sale method, but must determine  which method provides the greater return to the government, including  administrative and overhead expenses. A typical exchange occurs when  the original manufacturer delivers a replacement item to the agency and  removes the item being replaced. The manufacturer applies a trade-in  credit (an allowance) for the purchase of a replacement item. If the sale  method is used, the agency receives the sale proceeds for the sale of the  non-excess items (needed to meet mission requirements) and applies  those proceeds to the purchase of the replacement personal property.  See figure 2.", "In conducting a sale, agencies are to follow a process similar to the  disposal process for excess property. When an agency disposes of  excess property, it makes the item available to other federal agencies and  state agencies by posting it in GSAXcess\u2014GSA\u2019s website for reporting,  searching, and selecting excess property. The disposal process generally  consists of four sequential stages in which personal property may be  transferred to another agency or eligible recipient, donated, sold, or  abandoned or destroyed.", "Similarly, agencies may use GSAXcess to facilitate the replacement of  property under the exchange/sale authority. However, unlike the disposal  process for excess property that may be offered at no cost, if another  federal agency or state agency needs the property, the agency is to pay  no more than the fair market value for the item or a negotiated fixed price,  respectively. Otherwise, the property may be listed for sale to the general  public at approved sales centers, such as GSA AuctionsSM, or through  other approved methods, such as live auctions or Internet sales. After the  sale closes, the agency receives the proceeds to apply toward the  purchase of a similar item.", "Agencies are required to submit a summary report to GSA at the end of  each fiscal year on the type, the quantity, the exchange allowances or  sale proceeds, and the original acquisition cost of items for both  exchange and sale transactions. Agencies that made no transactions  during a fiscal year must submit a report stating that they made no  transactions. Ultimately, agencies decide whether to use the  exchange/sale authority to replace property in their inventory.

Sales  by agencies accounted for about $2.9 billion (or about 91 percent), while  use of the exchange method accounted for about $275 million (or about 9  percent) of total transactions reported, primarily due to GSA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s  reporting more use of the sale method over the exchange method.", "While some agencies reported hundreds of millions of dollars in exchange  allowances and sale proceeds, the data show that 10 federal agencies\u2014 including the Department of Labor, Office of Personnel Management, and  the Social Security Administration\u2014reported relatively few transactions,  which totaled less than $100,000 in exchange allowances and sales  proceeds.", "GSA OGP officials consider the agency-reported data to provide a  representative picture of the overall exchange/sale transactions occurring  across the federal government. GSA OGP officials rely on the agencies to  ensure the accuracy and completeness of the exchange/sale information.  According to GSA OGP officials, because GSA does not have authority to  compel the agencies to report or address quality issues, it does not look  at record level data from the agency to determine the data\u2019s accuracy and  does not have a way of verifying if exchange data are accurate and  complete. Nonetheless, GSA officials said they take steps to ensure the  data are reliable and complete. For example, GSA OGP officials said they  review the data for any obvious inaccuracies and follow up with the  reporting agency to correct the inaccuracy.

For example, VA officials said they  misunderstood key aspects of the exchange/sale authority, resulting in  inefficiencies and data inaccuracies, as described below:", "Process for selling property: Officials from all three selected VA  medical centers said they did not understand the sequence of events  in selling property using the sale method, a situation that led to VA\u2019s  using a potentially less economical method to acquire new equipment.  For example, officials at two selected VA medical centers told us that  they believed that they had to sell their medical equipment prior to  acquiring replacement equipment. Officials at one medical center said  this sequence of events makes it difficult to use the sales method of  the exchange/sale authority because VA medical centers must have  medical equipment, such as x-ray machines, readily available and  fully operational for veterans at all times. However, GSA OGP officials  stated that replacement property can be purchased prior to the sale of  property. In addition, officials at a VA medical center reported they  had limited storage, making it difficult to buy replacement equipment  and store it until VA can sell the equipment. As a result, a VA medical  center official stated that they instead used the exchange method  because it provided a seamless replacement of equipment to prevent  any break in availability of medical equipment. While the exchange  method is a viable approach, in this case, the sales method could  have delivered a higher monetary return. In addition, by using the sale  method, VA could potentially have replaced equipment more  efficiently than replacing the full cost of the item with the agency\u2019s  appropriation. A VA headquarters official was also unclear about how  to use the proceeds from sales. This official was unclear whether the  sales proceeds could be used from any type of medical equipment in  a particular supply category, such as a scalpel, toward the  replacement of another item in that same classification, such as a  wheelchair, or whether the items had to be identical or serve a similar  purpose.", "Data Reporting: Officials at two selected VA medical centers did not  clearly understand the annual summary data reporting process. These  officials stated that they found GSA\u2019s reporting template confusing  because it provides minimal direction to the user and does not clearly  define some data-reporting elements. The template includes a space  for reporting \u201cexchanged/sold;\u201d however, officials at one medical  center were unaware that \u201csold\u201d referred specifically to exchange/sale  transactions only and not to other transactions referred to as sales,  such as surplus property sales; according to medical center officials,  this medical center reported about 1,000 misclassified sales in GSA\u2019s  annual summary data.", "Exchange/sale versus disposal: According to VA officials, they or  others involved in personal property management did not fully  understand the distinction between the process for acquiring  replacement property under the exchange/sale authority and the  process for declaring property as excess. Officials within all three  selected VA medical centers misunderstood the difference between  the two processes, possibly because both processes use GSAXcess  to sell property under the exchange/sale authority or to report property  as excess for disposal. As a result, one VA medical center mistakenly  reported excess disposals as exchange/sale in the GSA OGP annual  summary data. In addition, two facilities disposed of some still needed  property instead of conducting sales under the exchange/sale  authority. A VA headquarters official acknowledged that property  managers in charge of implementing the exchange/sale authority at  medical centers may be confusing these two processes or may be  unaware that the exchange/sale authority exists.", "Similarly, officials from the Air Force and Navy said they or others  involved in personal property management did not always understand the  difference between these two processes. An Air Force official stated  that DOD\u2019s policies do not clearly distinguish the exchange/sale process  from the disposal process and do not consistently define terms, such as  \u201cexcess\u201d and \u201cnon-excess\u201d property, that align with GSA\u2019s regulations. In  retrospect, Air Force officials stated that they disposed of property that  could have been replaced through the exchange/sale authority.  Generally, disposal results in (a) sales proceeds being returned to the  U.S. Treasury rather than retained by the agency and (b) services  possibly having to use their appropriation for replacement property, rather  than working directly with the vendor to obtain a replacement at a  reduced cost. We have previously reported on DOD\u2019s disposing of $855  million in excess items for which they will likely have a continuing need.", "Conversely, based on our interviews and review of their policies, records,  and transaction data, two program offices within the Army and GSA\u2014 Army Aviation and GSA Fleet\u2014appeared to understand how to use the  exchange/sale process. We found that these offices may have a greater  level of understanding for a few key reasons:", "Narrow scope: Both programs are designed around replacing one  type of item\u2014helicopters for helicopters or vehicles for vehicles.  When items are not so directly interchangeable, determining whether  or not an item sold and replaced or exchanged are \u201csimilar\u201d can be  challenging. Because the Army Aviation and the GSA Fleet  programs focus on one type of item, the determination of what  constitutes similar property under the GSA regulation is not a  challenge.", "Established programs with frequent sales: The Army Aviation and  the GSA Fleet programs have sold hundreds of aircraft and tens of  thousands of vehicles over the past several years. They have  invested resources into developing an exchange/sale process.  Conversely, programs that may sell or exchange an item or two a  year\u2014even very expensive items, such as medical equipment\u2014may  not have the same opportunities to develop processes and guidance  through repeated sales or exchanges.", "High-value items: Similarly, both the Army Aviation and the GSA  Fleet programs sell high-value items. Thus, investing resources in an  exchange/sale process makes sense, as programs benefit from the  sales and have a process to guide and track these high-value items.  For an agency like VA, which disposes of some low-value items, there  may not be the same motivation to develop a standard process. GSA  OGP officials emphasized that high-value items, such as helicopters  and vehicles, are best suited for using the exchange/sale authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Has Not Clarified Aspects of Using Exchange/Sale Authority for Agencies", "paragraphs": ["GSA OGP officials stated that they recognize some agencies, such as  VA, may experience confusion using the authority, that the regulations  are misunderstood by agencies, and that aspects of the authority need to  be clarified. According to these officials, GSA attempted to amend the  regulations in 2015 to address key areas of confusion, including:  restricting the definition of similar to ensure that items replaced are  clearly similar. GSA wanted to change the federal supply category  criteria to make agencies replace items at the more specific four digit  level rather than the broader two digit level. As an illustration, this  change would help clarify the confusion VA reported about whether a  scalpel and a wheel chair qualify as similar items.  clarifying the process for selling property; specifically, clarifying that  agencies can purchase replacement property prior to the sale of  property that no longer adequately performs its task.", "However, GSA OGP officials stated that they did not complete the  rulemaking process in order to give the incoming administration an  opportunity to review and approve any revisions.", "Since the change in administration, GSA officials said they have been  focused on evaluating the continued need and relevance of all of their  regulations as part of the administration\u2019s plan to conduct regulatory  reviews. Nonetheless, GSA OGP officials said they plan to address  these areas of confusion by amending the regulations. Specifically, they  plan to clarify the definition of similar property and the difference between  excess and non-excess property, among other changes. However,  officials estimate the rulemaking will likely not be finalized for at least 2  years. As a result, the extent to which the rulemaking process will result in  clarifying language is unknown.", "Although GSA anticipates initiating a rulemaking to amend regulations,  which could make the definition of \u201csimilar\u201d more restrictive, GSA OGP  officials told us that clarifying the issues agencies found confusing would  not necessarily require a rulemaking. They highlighted other actions they  are taking to promote the use of the authority, inform agencies of the  requirements, and train agencies on using the authority. For example,  they conduct outreach by making presentations at national conferences  (i.e., FedFleet), meet with representatives from the National Property  Management Association, and hold small group discussions with  program managers specializing in certain high-value items, such as  aircraft. GSA\u2019s presentations aim to educate agencies on what the  authority is, the conditions and requirements of the authority, and when to  use the authority. According to GSA OGP officials, as a result of their  outreach, they have seen immense growth in exchange/sale transactions  among the aviation community.", "GSA has also issued bulletins to help dispel misunderstandings related to  using the exchange/sale authority. For example, GSA issued a bulletin  in 2010 to federal agencies to remind them to submit annual reports on  exchange/sale transactions. This bulletin contained information on the  reporting requirements, frequently asked questions, and points of contact  for agencies to reach out to with additional questions. In summer 2018,  GSA OGP officials drafted a new bulletin to further address financial  aspects of the exchange/sale authority and expect to issue it in December  2018. This bulletin details why agencies should use the authority and  directs agencies to develop policies for using the authority and to consult  with the Chief Financial Officer of the agency to obtain more information.  According to these officials, an additional bulletin would take 3 to 4  months to develop and issue.", "However, neither GSA\u2019s outreach nor its draft bulletin addresses existing  confusion regarding the sales process or data reporting, or distinguishes  the exchange/sale process from the disposal process. For example,  GSA\u2019s outreach, such as the FedFleet presentation, generally describes  the authority and discusses provisions of using the authority but does not  address issues agency officials told us they found confusing. The  presentation tells agencies that they can sell property under the authority  but does not go into the mechanics of how to sell property. By making  presentations like these to address areas agencies found confusing, GSA  would have an opportunity to help clarify these issues and encourage  agencies to use the authority more.", "Moreover, GSA OGP officials told us that they believe that a lack of  knowledge of the authority is a reason why some agencies do not use it  more. As we reported earlier, 10 of the 27 federal agencies that reported  transactions had few exchange/sale transactions over the past 5 years.  According to a VA official, if VA medical centers better understood how to  use the authority, they could see a significant increase in use throughout  the agency. Furthermore, if GSA provided clearer information on using  the authority, the 10 agencies that we found that used the authority  infrequently may increase their use.", "Additionally, GSA\u2019s draft bulletin on financial issues does not address the  logistical issues agencies found confusing, such as how to sell property  using the exchange/sale authority. The bulletin addresses accounting  procedures agencies should follow when conducting transactions but  does not describe how agencies are to conduct these transactions. Until GSA takes action to address confusion, agencies may continue to  misunderstand and not use the exchange/sale authority. If agencies  continue to misunderstand aspects of the exchange/sale authority, they  may not take full advantage of the authority, thereby missing opportunities  to be more effective stewards of government property and replenish  property more efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA and VA Did Not Monitor Exchange/Sale Activities", "paragraphs": ["Agencies are responsible for managing their own personal property,  including monitoring their exchange/sale activities.

Monitoring involves regular management and supervisory activities,  comparisons, reconciliations, and other routine actions.", "We found that the Army monitored its exchange/sale activities, as  outlined in its policies. The Army\u2019s policy delegated responsibility to the  Army\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff (Logistics) to monitor and approve Army  programs seeking to use the authority. Our review of Army\u2019s policy  found that multiple Army offices monitor financial, logistical, legal, and  procurement functional areas as they reviewed and communicated on the  eligibility of exchange/sale transactions. The policy also allows program  and inventory managers to use the authority for high-value items, requires  contracting officers and attorneys to review the transactions, and uses a  management checklist for transactions. Consistent with policy, the Army\u2019s  Deputy Chief of Staff, in conjunction with offices within DOD, reviewed  and approved requests from Army Aviation to use the exchange/sale  authority to sell Black Hawk helicopters and apply proceeds to  replacement helicopters. The Army official said that the office continues to  monitor exchange/sale transactions in collaboration with the Army  Aviation program to manage the exchange and sale of their personal  property that includes Black Hawk helicopters.", "Unlike the Army, GSA OAS did not monitor its internal exchange/sale  activities. In 2009, GSA\u2019s internal policy established a position  responsible for ensuring compliance with government-wide, personal  property requirements. However, GSA officials stated that the position  was never staffed and later subsumed into GSA OAS when the office was  established in 2011 to manage personal property, including  exchange/sale activities, within the agency. Since that time, GSA OAS  officials said that they have not monitored these activities because senior  management did not prioritize personal property, including exchange/sale  transactions. For example, management did not clarify GSA OAS\u2019s  responsibilities nor did it define the scope of its authority for monitoring  exchange/sale activities. As a result, GSA OAS officials said they have  not been involved with any exchange/sale activities within the agency,  and besides GSA Fleet, they do not know the extent to which other  internal offices are using (or should be using) the authority.", "According to GSA OAS officials, they have recently focused on an effort  to rebuild an internal personal-property management program that will  take several years to develop given the current staff of two. As part of this  effort, GSA OAS revised the policy for internal personal property  management in 2018 and is drafting a standard operating procedure that  is expected to provide additional clarification for monitoring and  conducting exchange/sale activities within GSA. According to GSA  officials:  the 2018 policy provides relevant updates and more details that  distinguish between (a) the exchange/sale authority for the exchange  and sale of non-excess, non-surplus personal property and (b) the  disposal authority with a focus on the disposal of excess personal  property.  the draft standard operating procedure is to provide procedures for all  internal GSA offices to follow when using the authority. This standard  operating procedure establishes a position to, among other things,  help internal offices conduct and report exchange/sale transactions.  GSA OAS officials referred to this procedure as a work-in-progress  and were uncertain when it would be finalized.", "However, GSA OAS officials said that they do not know whether this  policy revision will allow them to monitor exchange/sale activities for two  reasons. First, GSA OAS is unclear about the scope of its authority, such  as whether the GSA Fleet program falls under its exchange/sale purview.  GSA Fleet program officials said that they are not opposed to having GSA  OAS monitor their program in the future. Second, this procedure will not  be formally approved or coordinated throughout GSA, a situation that  means there may not be consensus among all GSA offices as to GSA  OAS\u2019s responsibilities and scope of authority. As a result, the revision of  the policy and completion of the procedure may not be enough to ensure  compliance with exchange/sale requirements. In the absence of clear  responsibilities and scope of its authority, GSA OAS may not be able to  monitor exchange/sale activities or provide clear information and direction  to other offices within GSA.", "Similar to GSA, VA conducted limited monitoring of its exchange/sale  activities. VA policy states that the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Acquisition and Logistics has the departmental-wide responsibility for  personal property inventory management, utilization, and disposition as  well as to monitor VA logistics programs and policies. Within VA\u2019s  Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Office of Procurement and  Logistics assigns logistics officers at VHA Regional Offices with  monitoring responsibilities of medical centers to ensure compliance with  VA and VHA policies. However, we found that the three VHA Regional  Offices conducted limited monitoring of 23 medical centers under their  purview. According to the officials we contacted, they conducted a  cursory review of end-of-year data from medical centers before the data  were submitted through VHA to GSA for the annual summary report.", "According to officials at one Regional Office, they did not focus on  monitoring exchange/sale transactions beyond a cursory review to  see that property fell within the medical or laboratory equipment  supply categories. As previously mentioned, we found that reported  data did not reflect actual exchange/sale transactions. Specifically, we  found that none of the sale transactions reported in 2016 as  exchange/sale transactions by a selected medical center in this region  was correct. Instead, these transactions were sales of surplus  property.", "According to officials at another Regional Office, they have no reason  to review exchange/sale transactions in a more robust manner  because end-of-year reporting presented no problems in the past that  would warrant a more standardized approach. However, for the one  selected medical center in this region, we found several errors in  reporting end-of-year data from 2013 through 2017. Specifically, we  found that nearly all reported exchanges were actually sales of  surplus property, a reported exchange in 2017 was actually a transfer  to another medical center, and despite reporting no transactions in  2016, we identified an exchange valued at $500,000.", "According to officials from a third Regional Office, they monitored  various aspects of VA\u2019s personal property program\u2014inventories and  disposals, but not exchange/sale transactions. During our review, we  found that one selected medical center under their purview reported  about 1,000 sale transactions to GSA, but none was correct. Instead  of sales of needed (non-excess, non-surplus) property, they were  actually sales of surplus property. Regional officials are aware of this  error and have added four new questions about exchange/sale  transactions to the checklist used for their annual quality-control  reviews. They said they do not know whether other Regional Offices  perform similar reviews.", "An official in VA\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Logistics acknowledged that  these findings are likely not uncommon because the office has not  developed or communicated the management activities necessary for  Regional Offices to consistently monitor medical centers\u2019 exchange/sale  transactions. The lack of communication on monitoring procedures was  corroborated by two Regional Offices. An official with the Office of  Acquisition and Logistics explained that the office promulgates policy and  that VHA\u2019s Office of Procurement and Logistics helps ensure policy is  followed, but the absence of monitoring stems, in part, from these two  offices\u2019 not collaborating or communicating the activities Regional Offices  are to conduct. VHA Regional Offices monitor medical centers through  annual quality-control reviews, but the reviews did not have an  exchange/sale component. Furthermore, VA internally reviews a small  sample of the VHA\u2019s annual quality-control reviews each year. From a  Regional Office perspective, officials told us they prioritized other  activities, such as monitoring inventories or disposal of equipment, over  exchange/sale activities. The VA office has also not communicated with  VA medical centers on how to effectively use the authority to support their  medical equipment replacement needs or the benefits associated with the  authority. For example, the VA office has not provided specific guidance  beyond issuing personal property policies for how to conduct and monitor  exchange/sale transactions.", "VA officials are taking steps to improve communication to those involved  in exchange/sale transactions throughout the agency\u2014those monitoring  transactions and those initiating transactions. For example, officials within  the Office of Acquisition and Logistics stated that they plan to clarify the  use of the exchange/sale authority within the agency\u2019s policies for  personal property disposal. This clarification will be in the form of a  notice (an incremental policy change) or as part of a planned rewrite of  personal property policies. However, it is uncertain whether the  information will have a level of detail to be useful for medical centers to  understand the requirements for using the exchange/sale authority or will  delineate how the exchange/sale process differs from the disposal  process. Adding to this is the uncertainty about the time frame for  finalizing and communicating such information to medical centers.  Furthermore, VA officials said the policy changes alone will not be  sufficient and assistance from VHA will be necessary to ensure Regional  Offices understand their monitoring roles and responsibilities. A VHA  official acknowledged the need to work with Regional Offices to augment  the annual quality-control review checklists with an exchange/sale  component, but it is unclear if and when such an update will take place. Until VA and VHA work together to develop a detailed policy for  monitoring and establish time frames with milestones for communicating  information, they cannot be assured that 172 medical centers and 18  Regional Offices understand the exchange/sale authority, how to use it,  and how to monitor end-of-year reporting data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["By using the exchange/sale authority, agencies have an opportunity to be  good stewards of government property by efficiently replacing needed  property, including high-value items, that serves critical and continuing  requirements to meet agency missions.

Although GSA OGP officials acknowledge the need to amend the  regulations to address areas that require rulemaking, delay in taking  action to address areas of confusion that currently exist but do not require  rulemaking will continue to lead to misinterpretation or misunderstanding  about the authority. Moreover, until GSA specifies GSA OAS\u2019s  responsibilities and defines the scope of its authority, it will continue a  long-term pattern of not monitoring GSA\u2019s exchange/sale activities.

To address both objectives, we reviewed  applicable federal statutes and regulations pertaining to personal property  management and the exchange/sale authority, our prior work, and  reports by federal agencies\u2019 offices of inspectors general on personal  property management issues. To understand General Services  Administration\u2019s (GSA) role and responsibilities for personal property  management in support of exchange/sale activities across the federal  government, we reviewed GSA\u2019s personal property management  structure, policies, bulletins, briefings, and training materials.", "To describe what is known about the personal property exchange/sale  transactions, we analyzed annual exchange/sale summary data, as  reported to GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy (GSA OGP) from  federal agencies from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. These  data identify the agency involved in the transactions, the transaction  method, and the type and value of the property. These data are the only  federal government-wide data available on exchange/sale transactions.  Accordingly, we analyzed these summary data to characterize  transactions over a 5-year time frame, by agency, by type of transaction  (exchange or sale), by type of personal property using personal property  categories, and by amount of exchange allowances and sale proceeds.", "We assessed the reliability of these data from a government-wide  perspective and for selected agencies.", "From a government-wide perspective, we reviewed GSA\u2019s electronic  template provided to federal agencies for reporting data, viewed a  training video used to help agencies report data to GSA, and reviewed  the users\u2019 guide and other materials related to GSA\u2019s personal  property reporting tool. In addition, we interviewed GSA OGP officials  regarding their data processes\u2014such as data collection, submission,  reconciliation, verification, and compilation of annual exchange/sale  summary reports\u2014to understand the steps GSA OGP takes to  determine the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of data. We  did not independently verify all the exchange and sales data that was  provided to us because of the large quantity of detailed data  associated with each agency and because some of the data were not  within the scope of our selected agencies and personal property  categories. However, we determined that GSA\u2019s government-wide  summary data was sufficiently reliable for our purposes of describing  the agencies that use the authority, the general types of property they  acquire, and the relative order of magnitude of exchange allowances  and sales proceeds. For sales conducted through GSA sales centers,  GSA reports summary information on behalf of most agencies. GSA  officials told us all exchange transactions are self-reported by  agencies. GSA does not ensure the accuracy of this information  beyond a review for obvious errors. However, because sales account  for about 91 percent of the dollar value of all transactions, we believe  that the total value of transactions across the federal government is  sufficiently reliable for our purposes of describing exchange/sale  activity.", "To assess the reliability of GSA and other selected agencies\u2019  summary data, we compared annual exchange/sale summary data  collected by GSA OGP with detailed GSAAuctionsSM sales data  associated with the exchange/sale authority collected by GSA\u2019s Office  of Personal Property Management. We looked to see if aggregated  sales totals matched, identified similarities and gaps, and observed  individual agency and government-wide trends for using the  exchange/sale authority. We found data reported by GSA\u2019s Office of  Fleet Management (GSA Fleet) and the Army\u2019s Program Executive  Office for Aviation (Army Aviation) to be reliable. However, we found  reliability issues with data reported by the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA). As a result of our interviews with selected facilities, we  found that some reported sale and exchange data from VA did not  represent actual exchange/sale transactions.
