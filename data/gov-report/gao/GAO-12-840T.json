Other methods, such as broker price opinions and automated valuation models, are quicker and less costly but are viewed as less reliable. As a result, they generally are not used for most purchase and refinance mortgage originations. Although the enterprises and lenders GAO spoke with did not capture data on the prevalence of approaches used to perform appraisals, the sales comparison approach\u0097in which the value is based on recent sales of similar properties\u0097is required by the enterprises and the Federal Housing Administration. This approach is reportedly used in nearly all appraisals.", "Conflict-of-interest policies have changed appraiser selection processes and the appraisal industry more broadly, raising concerns about the oversight of appraisal management companies (AMC), which often manage appraisals for lenders. Recent policies, including provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), reinforce prior requirements and guidance that restrict who can select appraisers and prohibit coercion. In response to market changes and these requirements, some lenders have turned to AMCs. Greater use of AMCs has raised questions about oversight of these firms and their impact on appraisal quality. Federal regulators and the enterprises said they hold lenders responsible for ensuring that AMCs\u0092 policies and practices meet their requirements but that they generally do not directly examine AMCs\u0092 operations. Some industry participants voiced concerns that some AMCs may prioritize low costs and speed over quality and competence. The Dodd-Frank Act requires state appraiser licensing boards to supervise AMCs and requires the federal banking regulators, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to establish minimum standards for states to apply in registering them. Setting minimum standards that address key functions AMCs perform on behalf of lenders could provide greater assurance of the quality of the appraisals that AMCs provide. As of June 2012, federal regulators had not completed rulemaking to set state standards.", "The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) has been performing its monitoring role under Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), but several weaknesses have potentially limited its effectiveness. For example, ASC has not clearly defined the criteria it uses to assess states\u0092 overall compliance with Title XI. In addition, Title XI charges ASC with monitoring the appraisal requirements of the federal banking regulators, but ASC has not defined the scope of this function\u0097for example, by developing policies and procedures\u0097and its monitoring activities have been limited. ASC also lacks specific policies for determining whether activities of the Appraisal Foundation (a private nonprofit organization that sets criteria for appraisals and appraisers) that are funded by ASC grants are Title XI-related.

Real  estate valuations, which encompass appraisals and other value  estimation methods, play a critical role in mortgage underwriting by  providing evidence that the market value of a property is sufficient to help  mitigate losses if the borrower is unable to repay the loan. However,  turmoil in the mortgage market raised questions about mortgage  underwriting practices, including the quality and credibility of some  valuations. An investigation into industry appraisal practices by the New  York State Attorney General led to an agreement in 2008 between the  Attorney General, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises), and the  Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which regulates the  enterprises, that included the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC).  HVCC set forth certain appraiser independence requirements for loans  sold to the enterprises and took effect in 2009. Although the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)  declared HVCC no longer in effect, it codified several of HVCC\u2019s  provisions.

Appraisals are opinions of value  based on market research and analysis as of a specific date. Appraisals  are performed by state-licensed or -certified appraisers who are required  to follow the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice  (USPAP). A BPO is an estimate of the probable selling price of a  particular property prepared by a real estate broker, agent, or  salesperson rather than by an appraiser. An AVM is a computerized  model that estimates property values using public record data, such as  tax records and information kept by county recorders, multiple listing  services, and other real estate records.", "In 1986, the House Committee on Government Operations issued a  report concluding that problematic appraisals were an important  contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the  savings and loan crisis. The report stated that hundreds of savings and  loans chartered or insured by the federal government were severely  weakened or declared insolvent because faulty and fraudulent real estate  appraisals provided documentation for loans larger than what the  collateral\u2019s real value justified. In response, Congress incorporated  provisions in Title XI of FIRREA that were intended to ensure that  appraisals performed for federally related transactions were done (1) in  writing, in accordance with uniform professional standards, and (2) by  individuals whose competency had been demonstrated and whose  professional conduct was subject to effective supervision.", "Various private, state, and federal entities have roles in the Title XI  regulatory structure:", "The Appraisal Foundation.

Appraisals provide an opinion of market value at a point in  time and reflect prevailing economic and housing market conditions. Data  provided to us by the five largest lenders (measured by dollar volume of  mortgage originations in 2010) show that, for the first-lien residential  mortgages for which data were available, these lenders obtained  appraisals for about 90 percent of the mortgages they made in 2009 and  2010, including 98 percent of home purchase mortgages. The data we  obtained from lenders included mortgages sold to the enterprises and  mortgages insured by FHA, which together accounted for the bulk of the  mortgages originated in 2009 and 2010. The enterprises and FHA require  appraisals to be performed for a large majority of the mortgages they  purchase or insure. For mortgages for which an appraisal was not done,  the lenders we spoke with reported that they generally relied on validation  of the sales price (or loan amounts in the case of refinances) against an  AVM-generated value, in accordance with enterprise policies that permit  this practice for some mortgages that have characteristics associated with  a lower default risk.", "The enterprises, FHA, and lenders require and obtain appraisals for most  mortgages because mortgage industry participants consider appraising to  be the most credible and reliable valuation method, for a number of  reasons. Most notably, appraisals and appraisers are subject to specific  requirements and standards. In particular, USPAP outlines the steps  appraisers must take in developing appraisals and the information  appraisal reports must contain. It also requires that appraisers follow  standards for ethical conduct and have the competence needed for a  particular assignment. Furthermore, state licensing and certification  requirements for appraisers include minimum education and experience  criteria, and standardized report forms provide a way to report relevant  appraisal information in a consistent format.", "In contrast, other valuation methods such as BPOs and AVMs are not  permitted for most purchase and refinance mortgage originations. The  enterprises do not permit lenders to use BPOs for mortgage originations  and permit lenders to use AVMs for only a modest percentage of  mortgages they purchase. Additionally, the federal banking regulators\u2019  guidelines state that BPOs and AVMs cannot be used as the primary  basis for determining property values for mortgages originated by  regulated institutions. However, the enterprises and lenders use BPOs  and AVMs in a number of circumstances other than purchase and  refinance mortgage originations because these methods can provide a  quicker, less expensive means of valuing properties in active markets.", "When performing appraisals, appraisers can use one or more of three  approaches to value\u2014sales comparison, cost, and income. The sales  comparison approach compares and contrasts the property under  appraisal with recent offerings and sales of similar properties. The cost  approach is based on an estimate of the value of the land plus what it  would cost to replace or reproduce the improvements minus depreciation.  The income approach is an estimate of what a prudent investor would pay  based upon the net income the property produces. USPAP requires  appraisers to consider which approaches to value are applicable and  necessary to perform a credible appraisal and provide an opinion of the  market value of a particular property. Appraisers must then reconcile the  values produced by the different approaches they use to reach a value  conclusion.", "The enterprises and FHA require that, at a minimum, appraisers use the  sales comparison approach for all appraisals because it is considered the  most applicable for estimating market value in typical mortgage  transactions. Consistent with these policies, our review of valuation data  from a mortgage technology company\u2014representing about 20 percent of  mortgage originations in 2010\u2014indicated that appraisers used the sales  comparison approach for nearly all (more than 99 percent) of the  mortgages covered by these data. The cost approach, which was  generally used in conjunction with the sales comparison approach, was  used somewhat less often\u2014in approximately two-thirds of the  transactions in 2009 and 2010, according to these data. The income  approach was rarely used. Some mortgage industry stakeholders have  argued that wider use of the cost approach in particular could help  mitigate what they viewed as a limitation of the sales comparison  approach. They told us that relying solely on the sales comparison  approach could lead to market values rising to unsustainable levels and  that using the cost approach as a check on the sales comparison  approach could help lenders and appraisers identify when this is  happening. For example, they pointed to a growing gap between average  market values and average replacement costs of properties as the  housing bubble developed in the early to mid-2000s. However, other  mortgage industry participants noted that a rigorous application of the  cost approach might not generate values much different from those  generated using the sales comparison approach. They indicated, for  example, that components of the cost approach\u2014such as land value or  profit margins of real estate developers\u2014could grow rapidly in housing  markets where sales prices are increasing. The data we obtained did not  allow us to analyze the differences between the values appraisers  generated using the different approaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conflict-of-Interest Policies Have Changed Appraiser Selection Processes, with Implications for Appraisal Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Recently issued policies reinforce long-standing requirements and  guidance designed to address conflicts of interest that may arise when  direct or indirect personal interests bias appraisers from exercising their  independent professional judgment. In order to prevent appraisers from  being pressured, the federal banking regulators, the enterprises, FHA,  and other agencies have regulations and policies governing the selection  of, communications with, and coercion of appraisers. Examples of  recently issued policies that address appraiser independence include the  now-defunct HVCC, which took effect in May 2009; the enterprises\u2019 new  appraiser independence requirements that replaced HVCC in October  2010; provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act; and revised Interagency  Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines from the federal banking regulators  that were issued in December 2010.

AMCs are third parties that, among other things, select appraisers for  appraisal assignments on behalf of lenders. Some appraisal industry  participants said that HVCC, which required additional layers of  separation between loan production staff and appraisers for mortgages  sold to the enterprises, led some lenders to outsource appraisal functions  to AMCs because they thought using AMCs would allow them to easily  demonstrate compliance with these requirements. In addition, lenders  and other mortgage industry participants told us that market conditions,  including an increase in the number of mortgages originated during the  mid-2000s and lenders\u2019 geographic expansion over the years, put  pressure on lenders\u2019 capacity to manage appraisers and led to their  reliance on AMCs.", "Greater use of AMCs has raised questions about oversight of these firms  and their impact on appraisal quality. Direct federal oversight of AMCs is  limited. Federal banking regulators\u2019 guidelines for lenders\u2019 own appraisal  functions list standards for appraiser selection, appraisal review, and  reviewer qualifications. The guidelines also require lenders to establish  processes to help ensure that these standards are met when lenders  outsource appraisal functions to third parties, such as AMCs. Officials  from the federal banking regulators told us that they reviewed lenders\u2019  policies and controls for overseeing AMCs, including the due diligence  performed when selecting AMCs. However, they told us that they  generally did not review an AMC\u2019s operations directly unless they had  serious concerns about it that the lender was unable to address. In  addition, a number of states began regulating AMCs in 2009, but the  regulatory requirements vary and provide somewhat differing levels of  oversight, according to officials from several state appraiser regulatory  boards.", "Some appraiser groups and other appraisal industry participants have  expressed concern that existing oversight may not provide adequate  assurance that AMCs are complying with industry standards. These  participants suggested that the practices of some AMCs for selecting  appraisers, reviewing appraisal reports, and establishing qualifications for  appraisal reviewers\u2014key areas addressed in federal guidelines for  lenders\u2019 appraisal functions\u2014may have led to a decline in appraisal  quality. For example, appraiser groups said that some AMCs selected  appraisers based on who would accept the lowest fee and complete the  appraisal report the fastest rather than on who was the most qualified,  had the appropriate experience, and was familiar with the relevant  neighborhood. AMC officials we spoke with said that they had processes  that addressed these areas of concern\u2014for example, using an automated  system that identified the most qualified appraiser based on the  requirements for the assignment, proximity to the subject property, and  performance metrics such as timeliness and appraisal quality.", "While the impact of the increased use of AMCs on appraisal quality is  unclear, Congress recognized the importance of additional AMC oversight  in enacting the Dodd-Frank Act by requiring state appraiser regulatory  boards to supervise AMCs. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal  banking regulators, CFPB, and FHFA to establish minimum standards for  states to apply in registering AMCs, including requirements that  appraisals coordinated by an AMC comply with USPAP and be conducted  independently and free from inappropriate influence and coercion. This  rulemaking provides a potential avenue for reinforcing existing federal  requirements for key functions that may impact appraisal quality, such as  selecting appraisers, reviewing appraisals, and establishing qualifications  for appraisal reviewers. Such reinforcement could help to provide greater  assurance to lenders, the enterprises, and federal agencies of the quality  of the appraisals provided by AMCs.", "To help ensure more consistent and effective oversight of the appraisal  industry, we recommended in our July 2011 report that the heads of the  federal banking regulators, CFPB, and FHFA\u2014as part of their joint  rulemaking required under the Dodd-Frank Act\u2014consider including  criteria for the selection of appraisers for appraisal orders, review of  completed appraisals, and qualifications for appraisal reviewers when  developing minimum standards for state registration of AMCs. federal banking regulators and FHFA agreed with or indicated that they  would consider our recommendation but as of June 2012 had not issued  a rule setting minimum standards for state registration of AMCs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Weaknesses Have Potentially Limited ASC\u2019s Effectiveness in Performing Its Title XI Functions", "paragraphs": ["ASC has been performing its monitoring role under Title XI, but several  weaknesses have potentially limited its effectiveness.

However,  it had not included the definitions of the categories in these reports or in  its compliance review manual or policy and procedures manual, and its  definition of \u201cnot in compliance\u201d was not clear or specific. As previously noted, the definition states only that the category is to be used \u201cwhen the  number, seriousness, and/or repetitiveness of the violations warrant this  finding\u201d and does not elaborate on how these factors are weighed or  provide examples of situations that would meet this definition. These  shortcomings are inconsistent with our internal control standards, which  state that federal agencies should have appropriate policies and  procedures for each of their activities. Without clear, disclosed  definitions, ASC limits the transparency of the state compliance review  process and the usefulness of information Congress receives to assess  states\u2019 implementation of Title XI. Further, by not incorporating the  definitions into its compliance review and policy and procedures manuals,  ASC increases the risk that board members and staff may not interpret  and apply the compliance categories in a consistent manner. To address  these shortcomings, we recommended in our January 2012 report that  ASC clarify the definitions it uses to categorize states\u2019 overall compliance  with Title XI and include these definitions in ASC\u2019s compliance review and  policy and procedures manuals, compliance review reports to states, and  annual reports to Congress. In June 2012, ASC officials told us that they  had developed a revised system for rating states that included five  compliance categories (ranging from excellent to poor), each with specific  criteria.

However, determinations about what activities are Title  XI-related are not always clear-cut. For example, in 2003, the Executive  Director at the time recommended that the foundation be reimbursed for  certain legal expenses in connection with a complaint filed with the  foundation\u2019s ethics committee. However, the ASC board rejected the  reimbursement request because the expenses \u201cwere not sufficiently Title  XI-related.\u201d ASC\u2019s records do not indicate what criteria either the  Executive Director or the ASC board used as a basis for their decisions or  why they disagreed. Similarly, our review of ASC documents for more  recent grants found no supporting explanations for decisions about  whether grant activities were Title XI-related. One ASC board member  said the board had a common understanding of what activities were  eligible for grants but acknowledged that the basis for funding decisions  could be better documented. As previously noted, our internal control  standards state that federal agencies should have appropriate policies for  each of their activities. Without policies that contain specific criteria, ASC  increases the risk that its grant decisions will be inconsistent, limits the  transparency of its decisions, and lacks assurance that it is complying  with federal internal control standards. To address this limitation, we  recommended that ASC develop specific criteria for assessing whether  the grant activities of the Appraisal Foundation were related to Title XI   In  and include these criteria in ASC\u2019s policy and procedures manual.June 2012, ASC officials told us that they had been developing these  criteria and planned to finalize them by August 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Dodd-Frank Act Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The Dodd-Frank Act contains 14 provisions that give ASC a number of  new responsibilities and authorities. Some of the tasks associated with  these provisions are complex and challenging, especially for a small  agency with limited resources. One of the more complex tasks for ASC is  to establish a national appraisal complaint hotline and refer hotline  complaints to appropriate governmental bodies for further action.", "Appraisal industry stakeholders we spoke with noted that creating and  maintaining a hotline could be costly because it will likely require  investments in staff and information technology to fully ensure that calls  are properly received, screened, tracked, and referred. Stakeholders  indicated that screening calls would be a critical and challenging job  because frivolous complaints could overwhelm the system and identifying  valid complaints would require knowledge of USPAP.", "Another complex task for ASC is providing grants to state appraiser  regulatory agencies to support these agencies\u2019 compliance with Title XI.  Appraisal industry stakeholders cited challenges that ASC could face in  designing the grant program and the decisions it will need to make. Some  noted the challenge of designing grant eligibility and award criteria that (1)  do not reward states that have weak appraiser regulatory programs  because they use appraisal-related fee revenues (from state appraiser  licensing and examination fees, for example) for purposes other than  appraiser oversight and (2) will not create incentives for states to use less  of their own resources for regulation of appraisers. In addition, ASC  officials said they were unsure whether a January 2012 increase in the  national registry fee\u2014from $25 to $40 per appraiser credential\u2014would be  adequate to fund the grants and oversee them, especially in light of  recent declines in the number of appraisers.", "As of June 2012, ASC had not implemented either the national hotline or  the state grant program but had completed some initial steps. For  example, ASC officials told us that they had developed initial protocols for  handling hotline complaints and had begun work on a complaint form,  website, and call center. In addition, ASC is in the process of hiring a  grants manager.", "Chairman Biggert, Ranking Member Gutierrez, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
