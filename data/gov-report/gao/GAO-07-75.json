State officials also identified three challenges of increasing concern over the next 5 years: children's growing exposure to illegal drugs, increased demand to provide services for children with special needs, and changing demographic trends or cultural sensitivities in providing services for some groups of children in the states' child welfare systems. Most states reported that they had implemented initiatives to address challenges associated with improving the level of services, recruiting and retaining caseworkers, and finding appropriate homes for children. These initiatives, however, did not always mirror the major challenges. For example, with respect to services, states most frequently identified that they were challenged by the lack of mental health and substance abuse services for children and families, yet only a fourth of the dissatisfied states reported having initiatives to improve the level of these services. In states where evaluations of their initiatives had been completed under a federal demonstration project, the evaluations generally showed that states had achieved mixed results across child welfare outcomes. States we visited reported that HHS reviews of their child welfare systems and training and technical assistance efforts helped them improve their child welfare programs. For example, officials in three of the five states we visited reported that the CFSRs prompted them to develop interagency strategies for providing an array of needed services to children and families. Similarly, nearly all states in our survey reported that HHS-sponsored technical assistance was helpful to some degree. However, HHS officials said that several factors limited their ability to use their technical assistance tracking system as a management tool. For example, not all service providers are included in the tracking system, and some providers inconsistently enter required data into the system. As a result, HHS may be limited in its ability to determine how best to allocate technical assistance resources to help maximize states' ability to address child welfare issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Despite substantial federal and state investment in various social services,  states continue to receive more than 2 million reports of child  maltreatment each year and report having more than half a million  children in state foster care systems.

Between  March 2001 and March 2004, in its first round of Child and Family Services  Reviews (CFSR) evaluating each state\u2019s child welfare program, the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found that no state had  achieved all of the federal outcome measures for ensuring the safety, well- being, and permanency of children.", "For fiscal year 2006, Congress appropriated about $8 billion to support the  ability of state child welfare systems to provide services that protect  children from abuse and neglect, promote their physical and mental well- being, find them a permanent home, and enable families to successfully  care for their children, including those children with special needs. At the  federal level, HHS\u2019s Children\u2019s Bureau under the Administration for  Children and Families (ACF) establishes federal policy, oversees states\u2019  child welfare programs in part through its CFSRs, and provides technical  assistance to states primarily through its national resource centers (NRCs)  and HHS regional offices. State child welfare agencies administer the  programs and monitor the children and their families. States use federal  funds to support all aspects of the child welfare program, including  helping families stay together; providing financial support for families  fostering children who had been removed from their homes; finding  adoptive or other permanent homes for children; and recruiting, hiring,  and training child welfare employees.", "Given the complexity of the challenges facing state child welfare agencies,  you asked us to determine (1) the primary challenges state child welfare  agencies face in their efforts to ensure the safety, well-being, and  permanency of the children under their supervision; (2) the changes states  have made since January 1, 2002, to improve the outcomes for children in  the child welfare system; and (3) the extent to which states participating in  HHS\u2019s Child and Family Services Reviews and technical assistance efforts  find the assistance to be helpful. As part of this work, GAO also examined  the extent to which states had developed written child welfare disaster  plans for dealing with the dispersion of children under state care to other  counties or states, because of disasters.

We  achieved a 96 percent response rate. Second, we interviewed child welfare  officials in five states: California, New York, North Carolina, Texas, and  Utah. These states were selected for variance in program administration  (state-administered, state-supervised/county-administered, state- and  county-administered), the predominance of urban or rural characteristics,  the achievement of child welfare standards on the CFSRs, changes in the  number of children reported to be in foster care, and geographic location.  We interviewed federal child welfare officials and representatives from  national child welfare organizations concerning state child welfare  programs, the changes that states had made since 2002 to improve the  outcomes for children, and the extent to which states participated in  HHS\u2019s CFSRs and technical assistance efforts. In addition, we reviewed  several national studies and our previous child welfare reports to  determine the challenges that states face in their efforts to ensure the  safety, well-being, and permanency of the children under their supervision.

In these  circumstances, foster care may be provided by a family member, also  known as kinship care; caregivers previously unknown to the child; or a  group home or institution. In those instances where reuniting the child  with his or her parents is found not to be in the best interest of the child,  caseworkers must seek a new permanent home for the child, such as an  adoptive home or guardianship.

In fiscal year 2006, the federal government provided states with  about $8 billion in dedicated child welfare funds, primarily authorized  under Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. (See app. II.)  Nearly all of this funding is provided under Title IV-E, which provides  matching funds to states for maintaining eligible children in foster care,  providing subsidies to families adopting children with special needs, and  for related administrative and training costs. About 9 percent of funding is  provided under Title IV-B, which provides grants to states primarily for  improving child welfare services, including a requirement that most funds  be spent on services to preserve and support families.", "A significant amount of federal funding for child welfare services also  comes from federal funds not specifically dedicated for child welfare\u2014 including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block  grant, Medicaid, and the Social Services Block Grant. These and hundreds  of other federal assistance programs for children and families, including  many that serve low-income populations, are listed in a centralized  database administered by the General Services Administration that has a  search feature by type of assistance and eligible population. The  Congressional Research Service conservatively estimated that the median  share of total federal child welfare spending derived from nondedicated  federal funding equaled nearly half of all the federal dollars (47 percent)  expended by state child welfare agencies, based on state child welfare  agency data reported to the Urban Institute for state fiscal year 2002.", "Despite the large amount of federal funds spent on child welfare from  nondedicated sources, the Congressional Research Service reported that  attention to federal child welfare financing has focused almost exclusively  on dedicated child welfare funding streams and is driven in part by the  belief that the current structure hampers the ability of state child welfare  agencies to achieve positive outcomes for children. Common charges are  that the current structure does not grant states the flexibility needed to  meet the needs of children and their families, and encourages states to rely  too heavily on foster care. Congress authorized HHS to conduct  demonstration projects whereby states were allowed to waive certain  funding restrictions on the use of Title IV-B and Title IV-E funds under the  condition that the flexible use of funds would be cost-neutral to the  federal government. HHS reported that 24 states had participated in  demonstration projects across eight child welfare program areas, such as  caseworker training and services to caretakers with substance abuse  disorders.

After  receiving the team\u2019s assessment and findings, the state develops a program  improvement plan (PIP) to address any areas identified as not in  substantial conformity. Once HHS approves the PIP, states are required to  submit quarterly progress reports. Pursuant to CFSR regulations, federal  child welfare funds can be withheld if states do not show adequate PIP  progress, but these penalties are suspended during the PIP implementation  term.", "HHS provides training and technical assistance to help states develop and  implement their PIPs through its training and technical assistance  network.

GAO and other organizations have also previously  reported that public and private child welfare agencies face a number of  challenges recruiting and retaining qualified caseworkers and  supervisors. For example, we reported that high caseloads, poor  supervision, and the burden of administrative responsibilities have, in  some cases, prompted caseworkers to voluntarily leave their employment  with child welfare agencies. We also reported difficulties in recruiting  adoptive parents for children with special needs.", "The most important challenges identified by state child welfare agencies  are consistent with HHS\u2019s CFSR findings and states\u2019 self-assessments of  their programs. For example, according to the Congressional Research  Service, HHS reviewers found that 43 states needed improvement in  providing accessible services to children and at-risk families in all  jurisdictions of the state and 31 states needed improvement in conducting  diligent recruitment of foster and adoptive parents. The number of states  needing improvement in performance indicators related to child welfare  services, recruitment and retention of caseworkers, and placement of  children in appropriate homes is shown in table 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Large Array of Specific Services Needed by Children and Families, Especially in the Area of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, Underlie the Challenge", "paragraphs": ["State child welfare agencies identified specific services underlying their  challenge to serve children and families, citing constraints on federal  funding and limited awareness of services among eligible families as  contributing factors.

(See fig. 4.)", "States we visited reported that funding constraints were among the  reasons maintaining an adequate level of services was difficult. For  example, while maintenance payments to foster families for children  under state care is provided as an open-ended entitlement for federal  funding under Title IV-E, federal funding for family support services is  capped at a much lower level under Title IV-B. In addition, because the  proportion of children in foster care who are eligible for federal support  has been declining, states had to provide a greater share of funding at a  time when many states were experiencing budget deficits that adversely  affected overall funding for social services. In prioritizing funding needs,  child welfare officials in 40 states responding to our survey reported that  family support services, such as those that could prevent removal of a  child or help with reunification of a family, were the services most in need  of greater federal, state, or local resources. Officials from 29 states  responded that child protective services such as investigation, assessment  of the need for services, and monitoring were next in need of additional  resources.", "Officials in a state we visited indicated that some caseworkers and  families may be unaware of the array of existing services offered by  numerous public and private providers. In North Carolina, for example,  state officials reported that about 70 percent of children and families in the  child welfare system received services from multiple public agencies, and  the CFDA\u2014a repository of information on all federal assistance programs  that is periodically updated\u2014lists over 300 federal programs that provide  youth and family services. However, caseworkers and families are not  always aware of the range of services that are available to support them,  and child welfare officials cited the need for additional information to help  link children and families with needed services. In October 2003, the White  House Task Force for Disadvantaged Youth recommended that the CFDA  be modified to provide a search feature linked to locations where federally  funded programs were operating.

(See fig. 5.)", "Child welfare officials in each of the states we visited reported having  trouble recruiting and retaining caseworkers because many caseworkers  are overwhelmed by large caseloads. According to a 2006 Child Welfare  League of America (CWLA) report, some programs lack caseload  standards that reflect time needed to investigate allegations of child  maltreatment, visit children and families, and perform administrative  responsibilities. The report also cites CWLA\u2019s caseload standards of no  more than 12 cases per caseworker investigating allegations of child  maltreatment, and no more than 15 cases for caseworkers responsible for  children in foster care. However, according to the report, most states,  average caseloads in some areas are often more than double the CWLA  standards.", "State child welfare officials we interviewed also reported that increasing  amounts of time spent on administrative duties made it difficult to recruit  and retain staff and limiting the amount of time caseworkers could spend  visiting families. For example, child welfare officials in three states we  visited estimated that some caseworkers spent a significant amount of  time on administrative duties such as entering case data in automated  systems, completing forms, and providing informational reports to other  agencies. This administrative burden has limited caseworker ability to  ensure timely investigations of child maltreatment and to make related  decisions concerning the removal of children from their homes, according  to officials, and influenced caseworker decisions to seek other types of  employment.", "Some states we visited reported that the lack of effective supervision also  adversely affected staff retention and sometimes resulted in delays  providing appropriate services to children and families. Lack of  supervisory support was cited as a problem in terms of supervisor  inexperience and inaccessibility. For example, a Texas state official said  that because of high turnover, caseworkers are quickly promoted to  supervisory positions, with the result that the caseworkers they supervise  complain of poor management and insufficient support. In Arizona,  caseworkers have expressed dissatisfaction in the support they received  from their supervisors, and this has negatively affected recruitment and  retention.

In addition, these officials said that  some of the existing facilities are inappropriate for child placement  because they are old and in poor condition or provide outmoded treatment  services. Because of the absence of high-quality therapeutic settings, child  welfare officials said that it has become increasingly difficult to place  children in homes that can appropriately address their individual needs.", "Recruiting and retaining foster and adoptive parents has become an  increasingly difficult aspect of placement for a variety of reasons, such as  the lack of a racially and ethnically diverse pool of potential foster and  adoptive parents, and inadequate financial support. For example, child  welfare officials said that some locations have relatively small populations  of certain races and ethnicities, making it difficult to recruit diverse foster  and adoptive parents. Inadequate financial support also hinders  recruiting and retaining foster and adoptive families. Financial support for  foster and adoptive families varies widely among states and local areas,  and may not keep up with inflation. According to a California child  advocacy organization, for example, the state\u2019s payments to foster parents  of $450 per month per child have not been adjusted for inflation since  2001. As a result, according to the organization, the supply of foster care  providers has not increased markedly during this time.", "Obtaining permanent homes for older youth and for youth aging out of  foster care is a continuing placement challenge for states. For example,  Texas child welfare officials said that it is difficult to place adolescents  with adoptive parents because older youth can choose not to be adopted.  Finding housing for youth transitioning into independence also can be  difficult in high-cost areas or in areas where special arrangements have  not been made with housing agencies and landlords that typically require a   cosigner on the rental application or a large deposit before moving in.", "More than half of the states also reported that limitations in their ability to  identify and support placements with family members or legal guardians  limited opportunities to place children in appropriate homes. For example,  child welfare officials in Ohio reported a lack of resources to conduct  outreach to family members that may be able to provide a stable home for  children in foster care with less disruption to the child.

For example, child welfare officials reported an increasing number of  children entering state care as a result of methamphetamine use by  parents, primarily in rural areas. Child welfare agencies in these areas may  need to train caseworkers on how this drug is likely to affect parents or  caregivers who use it in order to safely investigate and remove children  from homes, as well as assess the service needs of affected families to  develop an appropriate case plan.", "State child welfare officials in all five states we visited said that finding  homes for special needs children is a growing issue because it is hard to  find parents willing to foster or adopt these children and who live near the  types of services required to meet the children\u2019s needs. For example, child  welfare officials in one of the states we visited reported that the state does  not have a sufficient number of adoptive homes for children with special  needs. As a result, these children generally stay in foster care for longer  periods of time.", "Child welfare officials we interviewed also said that the growing cultural  diversity of the families who come in contact with the child welfare system  has prompted the need for states to reevaluate how they investigate  allegations of maltreatment and the basis on which they make decisions  that could result in the removal of children from their homes. Child  welfare officials in several states reported that the current protocols for  investigating and removing children from their homes do not necessarily  reflect the cultural norms of some immigrant and other minority families.  These differences include limitations in family functioning that may be  caused by poverty, the environment, or culture as opposed to those that  may be due to unhealthy family conditions or behaviors.

The federal  resources providing technical assistance in the areas of substance abuse,  community-based child abuse prevention, and abandoned infants received  the fewest requests from states.", "HHS\u2019s Technical Assistance Tracking Internet System (TATIS) monitors  federal training and technical assistance requested and provided to states,  but several limitations that hinder its use as a management tool. One  limitation is that the system was designed to capture only assistance  provided by eight NRCs. (See app. IV.) Because TATIS does not capture  training and technical assistance provided by the remaining three NRCs,  other federal resource centers, and HHS\u2019s regional offices, HHS officials  do not have a complete picture of the assistance requested by states and  provided to them. For example, the NRC for substance abuse is not  required to enter data into TATIS, but NRC records show that it provided  47 on-site technical assistance visits to 16 states in fiscal year 2005, making  it among one of the most frequent providers of on-site federal assistance.  A second limitation is that the eight NRCs do not always enter information  into TATIS as required, raising concerns about the ability of HHS to  determine how often states use its various resources and for what  purpose. For example, an official from one of the eight NRCs we  interviewed said that his center is not as conscientious as it should be  about entering all of the required data into TATIS. HHS officials said that  without this information, it is difficult to determine how best to allocate  technical assistance resources to help maximize states\u2019 ability to address  child welfare issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["States have been facing some of the same child welfare challenges for  many years, and predict that some emerging challenges will have impacts  in the next several years. The federal government has funded hundreds of  programs to meet families\u2019 mental health, substance abuse treatment, and  other social service needs that could help prevent child maltreatment and  keep families together. However, the inability to query the federal  government\u2019s central source of information\u2014the CFDA\u2014to identify which  services across program and agencies are available in various locations  makes it difficult to determine the extent of services available at the local  level to serve children and families in the child welfare system.", "HHS has provided state child welfare systems an array of training and  technical assistance that states report as helpful for improving their child  welfare programs. Maximizing the value of its training and technical  assistance is compromised, however, because HHS\u2019s information system  does not capture all training and technical assistance provided to states  from various HHS-sponsored providers, and compliance with the reporting  requirements has not been enforced. In the absence of complete and  timely information, HHS may be limited in its ability to determine how  best to allocate technical assistance resources to help maximize states\u2019  ability to address child welfare issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to the Secretary of  Health and Human Services for improving awareness of and access to  various social services, and improving the department\u2019s ability to manage  technical assistance provided to state child welfare agencies.", "Develop a strategy to centralize information on federal assistance  programs that are available to meet child welfare program and  service needs and that can be accessed by state and local child  welfare staff and providers.

HHS\u2019s  written comments are reprinted in appendix V, and the Department\u2019s  technical comment was incorporated into the report. In its written  comments, HHS stated that the report substantially supports many of the  findings of the CFSRs, and agreed with one of our three recommendations.  The department agreed with our recommendation to establish policies and  procedures to ensure complete and accurate reporting of data into TATIS  and said it intended to provide written guidance to the resource centers  requiring this reporting. However, the department stated that the report  misconstrued the intent of the CFSRs and that the remaining  recommendations do not adequately match the articulated needs of state  welfare agencies.", "HHS disagreed with GAO\u2019s reference that no state had achieved all of the  federal outcome measures for ensuring the safety, well-being, and  permanency of children. The department stated that it makes separate  determinations regarding substantial conformity for each of the seven  outcome measures and each of the seven systemic factors reviewed. We  revised the text to reflect that no state had reached substantial conformity  on all of the federal outcome goals for state child welfare systems in lieu  of stating that no state had achieved all of the federal performance goals.", "HHS disagreed with our recommendation to increase awareness of federal  assistance programs by modifying the CFDA, stating that it was misleading  to assume that state challenges could be significantly met or appreciably  altered by a list of resources, in part because the recommendation  incorrectly implies that local child welfare agencies are not aware of many  valuable services; underestimates the substantive knowledge of resources  currently being utilized by caseworkers; child welfare staff need access to  actual services or service providers rather than general information on  federal assistance programs; resource lists quickly become outdated with  state and county programs and service providers changing annually based  on their budgets; and certain federal programs are designed to meet the  needs of very specific, and sometimes very small, populations.", "We acknowledge that increasing awareness of available federal resources  is not the only action needed to address the various challenges facing state  child welfare agencies, but believe that caseworker awareness and referral  of children and families to existing resources is an important first step in  meeting the challenge to provide an adequate level of services to them. As  our report states, our current and past work has found that some  caseworkers were unaware of the full array of federal resources, such as  health and housing services, available in their locales, or had not  coordinated with other agencies and organizations to access them. We  continue to support the view that modifying the CFDA would allow  caseworkers and others to more easily identify services and service  providers funded by federal agencies in closest proximity to the families  they serve. As the department points out, modifying the CFDA would not  address issues related to outdated listings of state or local resources;  however, the CFDA is updated biweekly or more often in response to new  or changing information regarding federal assistance. Further, while it is  true that some federal programs target specific populations, these  populations are often low-income or minority groups that are also served  by the child welfare system.", "The department also disagreed with our recommendation to require all  HHS technical assistance providers to enter data into TATIS, stating that  the system was not designed to monitor all technical assistance provided  to states, nor would it be an effective stand-alone mechanism to determine  how best to allocate technical assistance resources to states; the  recommendation does not give sufficient weight to the CFSR process;  including training and technical assistance by regional offices in TATIS  would be superfluous as these activities are in regional office job  descriptions; and the recommendation does not recognize that training  and technical assistance is provided to a variety of audiences beyond the  state child welfare agencies, and including more information would  confuse the tracking of technical assistance.", "Our report recognizes that TATIS was designed to monitor on-site training  and technical assistance provided by 8 of the 11 resource centers.  However, we continue to believe that expanding TATIS to capture the  substantial on-site assistance provided by the remaining resource centers  and other HHS providers would enhance its contribution to the  department in determining how best to allocate training and technical  assistance resources to states. We acknowledge the benefit of the CFSRs  in identifying states\u2019 technical assistance needs. However, state  implementation of program improvement plans in response to the CFSR  findings is only a part of training and technical assistance requested and  provided to states. In addition, while regional office job descriptions may  include training and technical assistance responsibilities, we do not  believe that capturing the amount and type of this assistance actually  provided to states would be superfluous, but rather provide a more  complete picture of the on-site assistance received by states. Further, our  recommendation was not intended to include training and technical  assistance provided to audiences beyond the state child welfare agencies,  and we modified the report text to clarify this point.", "Copies of this report are being sent to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, relevant congressional committees, and other interested parties.

As part of this work, GAO also examined the  extent to which states had developed written child welfare disaster plans  for dealing with the dispersion of children under state care to other  counties or states, because of disasters.

In November  2005, we also held two discussion groups with representatives from child  welfare stakeholder groups to identify any additional issues that may not  be covered in the published documents we reviewed. The stakeholders  included representatives from the Association of Administrators of the  Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, the Child Welfare  League of America, the National Association of Public Child Welfare  Administrators, the AARP Grandparent Information Center, the Pew  Commission on Children in Foster Care, the Urban Institute, American Bar  Association Center on Children and the Law, the Center for the Study of  Social Policy, the American Public Human Services Association, and Casey  Family Services.", "We worked to develop the questionnaire with social science survey  specialists.

For  example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, in the  sources of information that are available to respondents, or how the data  are entered into a database can introduce unwanted variability into the  survey results. We took steps in the development of the questionnaires, the  data collection, and data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors.  For example, prior to administering the survey, we pretested the content  and format of the questionnaire with several states to determine whether  (1) the survey questions were clear, (2) the terms used were precise,   (3) respondents were able to provide the information we were seeking,  and (4) the questions were unbiased. We made changes to the content and  format of the final questionnaire based on pretest results. In that these  were Web-based surveys in which respondents entered their responses  directly into our database, there was a reduced possibility of data entry  error.
