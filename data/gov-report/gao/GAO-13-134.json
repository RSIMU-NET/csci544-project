In 2005, DOD recommended to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission combining 26 installations into 12 joint bases to generate efficiencies and cost savings and, in 2010, completed this consolidation. GAO assessed the extent to which (1) DOD developed and implemented a plan to achieve cost savings and efficiencies at the joint bases, (2) joint base common standards provide a common framework to manage and plan for installation support services, and (3) DOD has a process to consistently identify and address any implementation challenges. GAO reviewed DOD policies and guidance on joint basing, visited 3 joint bases and obtained answers to written questions from the other 9, interviewed OSD and military service officials, and analyzed performance data on joint base support services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has not developed or implemented a plan to guide joint bases in achieving cost savings and efficiencies. The Department of Defense (DOD) originally estimated saving $2.3 billion from joint basing over 20 years, but in the absence of a plan to drive savings, that estimate has fallen by almost 90 percent. OSD also does not yet have a fully developed method for accurately collecting information on costs, savings, and efficiencies achieved specifically from joint basing. GAO previously reported that organizational transformations such as merging components and transforming organizational cultures should be driven by top leadership, have implementation goals and a timeline to show progress, and include a communication strategy. Although the joint bases anecdotally reported achieving some savings and efficiencies, without an implementation plan to drive savings and a means to collect reliable information on the specific costs, estimated savings, and efficiencies from joint basing, DOD will not be able to facilitate achievement of the goals of cost savings and efficiencies, track the extent to which these goals have been achieved, or evaluate the continuation or expansion of joint basing.", "The joint bases implemented common standards for installation support services developed by OSD, and in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 reported meeting the standards more than 70 percent of the time. However, three factors limited the usefulness of the reported standards as a common tool for managing installation support services: the lack of clarity in some standards, unclear standards that were not reviewed and changed in a timely manner, and data collection and reporting on the standards that in some cases adhered to individual service standards rather than the common standard. DOD guidance states that the purpose of the joint base common standards framework was to provide a common language to serve as a basis for planning and management across the joint bases, and GAO previously reported that performance measures should be clear and follow standard procedures. Without a consistent interpretation and reported use of the standards, OSD and the joint bases will not have reliable or comparable data with which to assess their service support levels.", "OSD and the joint bases have various mechanisms in place to address challenges in achieving joint basing goals, such as a joint management oversight structure and annual OSD-joint base review meetings, but none of these routinely facilitates communication among the joint bases to identify solutions to common challenges. The reported challenges cover a wide range of issues, from different expectations among military services as to how base support services should be provided to incompatible information technology networks. However, the absence of a formal method to routinely share information on common challenges and possible solutions, or guidance on developing and providing training for new personnel on how joint bases provide installation support, means DOD is likely to miss opportunities to develop common solutions to common challenges. Federal internal control standards state that for an entity to control its operations, it must have relevant and timely communications, and information is needed throughout the agency to achieve objectives. In addition, without processes to identify common challenges and share information across the joint bases, DOD may miss opportunities for greater efficiencies and be unable to provide uniform policies across the joint bases."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD take six actions, such as developing a plan to achieve cost savings, prioritizing review and revision of unclear common standards, and developing a strategy to share solutions to common challenges.

GAO continues to believe that the recommendations are valid as discussed further in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["GAO has designated Department of Defense (DOD) support  infrastructure as a high-risk area, and identified installation support as  one key support infrastructure category where opportunities existed for  savings. In originally citing support infrastructure as high risk, we stated  that reducing the cost of excess infrastructure activities was critical to  making use of scarce resources and maintaining high levels of military  capabilities. We reported that DOD believed that greater economies of  scale and savings could be achieved by further consolidation and  elimination of duplicate support services where military bases were  located close to one another or similar functions were performed at  multiple locations. However, we also noted that despite the potential for  reducing base operating support costs through greater reliance on  interservice-type agreements, differing service traditions and cultures and  concern over losing direct control of support assets had caused  commanders to resist such measures. In a subsequent recommendation  submitted to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)  Commission, DOD proposed that the department consolidate 26 military  installations into 12 joint bases to take advantage of opportunities for  efficiencies arising from such consolidation and elimination of duplicate  support services on bases located close to one another. DOD estimated  that by taking this action it could save about $2.3 billion over a 20-year   In its justification for the recommendation, DOD noted, among  period.other things, that because the installations either shared a common  boundary or were in proximity to at least one other installation, and  performed common support functions, there was a significant opportunity  to reduce duplication of similar support services, which could produce  savings. The BRAC Commission approved a modified version of DOD\u2019s  recommendation, which the commission found more fully reflected  statutory selection criteria and DOD\u2019s force structure plan. Through  updates to our high-risk series reports, we have continued to monitor  DOD\u2019s ability to achieve economies of scale and savings by consolidating  and eliminating duplicate installation support services. Our most recent  high-risk report, issued in February 2011, continued to designate DOD\u2019s  management of its support infrastructure as an area of high risk. One of  the reasons for this designation was DOD\u2019s lack of progress in achieving  the anticipated efficiencies and cost savings objectives associated with  consolidating installation services through the joint basing initiative.", "DOD\u2019s joint basing initiative\u2014implemented in two phases, with 5 joint  bases established in October 2009 and the remaining 7 bases  established in October 2010\u2014created 12 joint bases from the 26  installations that were originally operated by the Army, Navy, Air Force, or  Marine Corps, combining installation support services such as airfield  operations, grounds maintenance, and custodial services. The 2005  BRAC recommendation on joint basing established which military bases  would receive installation management functions from one or more other  bases. On the basis of these realignments, the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) designated the receiving military service as the lead for  delivering installation support at each joint base, and in 2008, OSD issued  further guidance for joint basing implementation. According to this  guidance, the lead service is referred to as the supporting component and  the military services receiving the installation support are referred to as  the supported components. OSD also established a set of joint base  common standards for providing consistent delivery of installation support  services to the 12 joint bases. According to the latest DOD information,  there are 280 joint base common standards grouped into 48 functional  areas. The standards cover a wide range of installation support services, from establishing the acceptable waiting time for ensuring that 100  percent of eligible children are placed within the base-run child  development program to conducting a minimum of two daily airfield  checks.", "In 2009, we reviewed DOD\u2019s progress to date toward meeting the joint  basing goals of increased efficiencies and cost savings. We reported that  the cost of installation support was expected to increase rather than  decrease due in part to the adoption of the new common standards,  which required higher levels of funding in some cases than the previous  standards, and because the services\u2019 approach to implementing joint  basing would result in additional administrative costs and the loss of  some existing installation support efficiencies. As a result, in 2009 DOD  significantly reduced its estimated 20-year cost savings projection from  $2.3 billion to about $273 million. More recently, we reported in June  2012 that our analysis based on updated DOD estimates of the one-time  and recurring costs and savings from joint basing based on DOD\u2019s fiscal  year 2011 BRAC budget submission to Congress showed that this 20- year savings estimate had fallen to $249 million.", "We are conducting this follow-on review under the Comptroller General\u2019s  authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative in order to provide  updated information on DOD\u2019s progress in achieving its joint basing  objectives. For this report, we evaluated the extent to which (1) DOD  developed and implemented a plan to achieve cost savings and  efficiencies at the joint bases and has tracked the costs, estimated  savings, and efficiencies from joint basing; (2) joint base common  standards provide a common framework to manage and plan for  installation support services at the joint bases; and (3) the joint bases or  DOD have a process in place to consistently identify and address any  implementation challenges to facilitate achievement of joint basing goals.", "To address these objectives overall, we analyzed DOD guidance and  data relating to joint basing. We also selected a nonprobability sample of  3 of the 12 joint bases to visit based on several criteria. Among these  criteria, we ensured that we would visit one base where each of the three  military departments was the supporting component and therefore had  the lead for ensuring that the joint base common standards were met, and  that we visited at least one joint base implemented in each of the two  implementation phases. We interviewed OSD officials in addition to  officials at the 3 joint bases we visited. For the remaining 9 joint bases,  we obtained written answers to our questions pertaining to these  objectives.", "To assess the extent to which DOD developed and implemented a plan to  achieve cost savings and efficiencies at the joint bases and tracked the  cost effects of joint basing, we analyzed relevant DOD guidance as well  as our prior findings on key practices and steps used by organizations to  successfully implement organizational mergers and transformations. We  also interviewed OSD and joint base officials, and obtained answers to  written questions, to determine the extent to which there was a plan in  place to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, and the extent to which  OSD or the joint bases measured and tracked costs, estimated savings,  and efficiencies achieved as a result of joint basing.", "To evaluate the extent to which joint base common standards have  provided a common framework for defining installation support services  and are used to manage and plan for those services at the joint bases,  we reviewed DOD\u2019s policy and guidance on the joint base common  standards as well as federal internal controls and data reliability  standards. We obtained joint base performance reporting on the common  standards from fiscal years 2010 through 2011 and conducted a content  analysis of these data to determine the degree of achievement of the  standards and to identify reported challenges to the joint bases\u2019 ability to  meet the standards. We analyzed OSD\u2019s processes for reviewing and  changing the standards by reviewing OSD guidance, and interviewed or  obtained written answers to our questions from OSD and joint base  officials about how they addressed reported problems with the standards.  Although we identified some problems with the joint base common  standards, which we discuss in this report, we found the data on the joint  base common standards to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  reporting on the number of standards the joint bases reported as having  met or not met and the content of the comments accompanying the  standards reporting.", "To assess OSD\u2019s process for identifying and addressing implementation  challenges, we reviewed DOD policy and guidance for joint base  oversight and management, as well as federal internal control standards.  We then identified how OSD uses its formal joint base management  structure, joint base common standards reporting, and formal review  meetings between joint base commanders and OSD to obtain information  on challenges faced at the joint bases. We analyzed performance  reporting comments, DOD documentation that identified and  demonstrated how OSD addressed these challenges, and DOD guidance  on established procedures to resolve issues. We also interviewed or  obtained written answers to questions from OSD, military service, and  joint base officials in order to determine how OSD and the military  services resolved issues with the joint bases through informal methods,  such as newsletters and direct communications.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2011 to November  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

OSD  has developed a data collection tool, called the Cost and Performance  Visibility Framework, through which the joint bases report installation  support performance data, including annually reporting on funds obligated  to provide base support services, and officials involved in management  and oversight of the joint bases can use this information to improve joint  base management. In addition, OSD can measure these data against the  level of funding the military services expect they would have had to  obligate for installation support on the joint bases if no savings resulted  from joint basing\u2014what DOD refers to as the Cost and Performance  Visibility Framework baseline. However, because of inconsistencies in the  way the joint bases reported data through the framework to date, and  because the data reported through the framework do not exclude costs  and savings that are not specific to joint basing, OSD is not yet able to  accurately isolate the effects of joint basing on the cost of providing  support services. In addition, comparing support service obligations to  the Cost and Performance Visibility Framework baselines does not show  whether overall savings were achieved as a result of joint basing since  the new support service standards themselves are a part of the joint  basing initiative. Measuring against these baselines therefore does not  provide a true picture of savings resulting from joint basing.", "The Cost Performance and Visibility Framework is a web-based  application managed by OSD which allows joint bases to report on their  performance against the joint base common standards quarterly and to  report on the funds obligated and manpower employed to meet the  common standards annually. Various levels of the joint basing Joint  Management Oversight Structure use the framework as a management  tool to review and assess performance of the joint base common  standards by category, service, and base, including comparing  performance of the standards to the funds obligated and manpower  employed to meet particular categories of standards. For example,  officials can compare the funds obligated on housing on a particular joint  base with the extent to which that joint base met the common standards  related to housing, as well as the baseline, or anticipated cost of meeting  those common standards. OSD officials told us that they use these data  to identify categories of joint base common standards where the bases  are performing especially well or poorly, and can compare this  performance to the funds obligated relative to achievement of the  standards, as well as to the baseline\u2014the level of funding the military  services anticipated they would need to obligate to meet the standards.  This information provides an initial insight and a basis for further  discussion at the working level with officials involved in joint base  management and oversight. Through further discussion, the officials said  they were able to identify the reasons why joint bases may be performing  well or underperforming in particular areas relative to the funds obligated  and the baseline. In turn, this allows the officials to make adjustments in  funding, learn from the experiences of particular joint bases in providing  support services, and improve joint base management going forward.", "For fiscal year 2011, the first year all of the joint bases had completed  implementation, the joint bases reported through the Cost and  Performance Visibility Framework obligating a total of about $4.3 billion  on support services. The military services also created baselines against  which to measure these funding levels. According to these service- developed baselines the 12 joint bases\u2019 installation services were  expected to cost $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2011, as compared with the  framework-reported actual cost of about $4.3 billion, for a reported  savings of $800 million less than the baseline.  However, this difference  between the reported baselines and the installation support funding levels  on the joint bases does not accurately reflect savings arising from joint  basing for several reasons. First, these baselines were calculated using  actual obligations in fiscal year 2008, when the joint bases were  standalone bases, and were adjusted to include increases in personnel  needed to meet the new joint base common standards and other  expected changes, such as utility rate changes. This effectively inflated  the baselines beyond what was actually obligated prior to joint basing.  Therefore, while the adjusted baselines are meant to represent the  projected costs to operate the newly established joint bases, they  overstate the actual cost to operate the bases as compared to when they  were standalone bases. As a result, these are not true baselines against  which a valid comparison can be made of the cost to operate joint bases  compared with standalone bases. Moreover, DOD officials noted that the  adjusted baselines and the reported obligations did not always exclude  one-time expenditures unrelated to the cost of providing support services,  such as military construction projects, which impairs the reliability of  comparisons using the obligations data. Finally, the framework does not  identify when costs, savings, or efficiencies occurred specifically as a  result of joint basing, as opposed to other actions such as military service- wide budget cuts. Therefore, the absence of a comparison with the funds  obligated for support services on the installations prior to becoming joint  bases, reliability problems in the data, and the inability to isolate joint- basing specific costs, savings, and efficiencies, limits the use of the  framework as a definitive tool to identify the overall effects on cost of the  joint basing initiative.", "OSD officials said that they expect to correct the data reliability problems  by the end of fiscal year 2012, and as joint basing continues these  officials believe it will be possible to compare each year\u2019s obligations at  the joint bases against prior years\u2019 obligations and therefore gain insight  into the extent that savings and efficiencies are achieved. However, DOD  officials also acknowledged that other factors have affected and will  continue to affect funding levels at the joint bases, including budget- driven reductions by the military services that do not necessarily  represent savings or efficiencies specifically from joint basing, and as a  result, OSD may not be able to determine joint basing-specific costs and  estimated savings even with its improved data collection.", "We found that the individual joint bases do not systematically track cost  savings and efficiencies achieved as a result of joint basing. However,  some joint bases have achieved efficiencies through consolidating service  contracts, combining departments, and reducing administrative overhead,  and identified anecdotal examples of such efficiencies, including the  following.", "Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. Base officials told us that by  combining telephone services under the existing Air Force contract,  call rates were substantially reduced, and that they have saved about  $100,000 annually as a result. Additionally, the officials said that  consolidating nine maintenance support contracts into one has  produced $1.3 million in annual savings.  Joint Base Charleston. Base officials stated that information  technology network upgrades resulted in improved high-speed access  and annual savings of $747,000. Additionally, these officials told us  that they consolidated multiple contracts for chaplains, resulting in  $55,000 in annual savings.  Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Base officials told us that they have  realized efficiencies and cost savings through consolidating some  offices in their Morale, Welfare & Recreation Departments. Through  this effort, they saved about $400,000 in fiscal year 2011 and expect  those savings to increase in subsequent years.", "Conversely, some joint basing officials have told us that the joint basing  initiative may be increasing rather than cutting costs because in some  cases the new joint base common standards require a higher level of  support than was previously provided by service-specific standards. As  previously noted, we reported in 2009 that the new joint base common  standards required the services to fund installation support at higher-than- previous levels.", "Even with the achievement of some efficiencies, the joint bases lack clear  direction and impetus to identify and execute cost-saving measures  because OSD has not established an implementation plan with  measurable goals to track progress toward meeting the cost savings and  efficiencies goals that it recommended to the 2005 BRAC Commission. In  the absence of such a plan, opportunities for savings and efficiencies are  likely to be missed. In addition, without a reliable method to collect data  on costs or estimated savings resulting specifically from joint basing,  DOD cannot identify the net savings, if any, associated with joint basing.

For example, the joint base may have  a contract in place for providing multimedia services, but the contract  does not provide for video production, and therefore the base chooses  not to meet the common standard because it would be too costly to  modify the contract or let an additional contract.

Clarity of a performance measure means that the  measure is clearly stated and the name and definition are consistent with  the methodology used to calculate it, so that data are not confusing and  misleading to the users of the data. Joint basing officials provided many  examples of standards that lack clarity and therefore cause uncertainty in  how the standards should be reported, including the following:", "One common standard requires that 100 percent of installations meet  a DOD requirement for at least annual exercise testing of mass  warning and notification systems.

As a result, they are unsure about  how to adequately answer this common standard and therefore report  it as not met.", "One common standard relating to awards and decorations to  recognize individual and unit achievements states that 90 percent of  awards should be posted to personnel records in accordance with  service-specific timeliness standards. However, the standard is not  clear because, according to joint base officials, not all of the services  have applicable timeliness standards. According to comments  accompanying common standard reporting from officials at Joint Base  San Antonio and Joint Region Marianas, no service standard defines  when a posting is late, and therefore they consider this standard to  always be met, regardless of when awards are posted.", "One common standard requires that 60 percent of certain service  vehicles be repaired within 24 hours. However, officials at Joint Base  McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst said the standard was unclear because it  does not take into account the priority of the vehicle. Therefore, for the  purposes of the standard, a vehicle that is essential to accomplishing  the base\u2019s mission would need to be fixed within the same time frame  as a non-mission-essential shuttle bus that transports personnel  around the base.", "One common standard related to investigations and crime prevention  requires joint bases to maintain 7 days\u2019 processing time for law  enforcement information to meet legal and command requirements for  adjudication and action. However, according to officials at Joint Base  McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, this standard does not specify whether the  timeline is in calendar or business days.

However, according to officials at several joint  bases, the OSD process to review and clarify standards does not update  standards in a time frame to allow joint bases to accurately report each  quarter on those standards that are unclear. OSD conducts a review of  selected functional areas each year. As an example, for its most recent  review for fiscal year 2012, conducted in February 2012, OSD selected  the facility operations, facility investment, and information technology  services management as the functional areas for review. Changes made  to these standards took effect in April 2012. Joint base officials stated that  since OSD selects certain functional areas to review each year and does  not review standards outside those particular functional areas, standards  in those functional areas that are not selected are not reviewed and  clarified even though clarification in those areas may be necessary. OSD  officials told us that in their most recent review, they used input from the  joint bases, military services, and functional area experts within OSD to  determine which functional areas of standards to review, among other  inputs, such as which of the standards bases were most frequently not  meeting. However, since OSD does not necessarily select all those  standards to which joint bases have requested clarification and only  reviews standards for possible updating once a year, changes to the  standards are not implemented in time for the next quarterly reporting  cycle and joint base officials in some cases are required to continue  collecting data on and reporting on standards that they have difficulty  interpreting.", "The joint bases do not always report on the common standards in ways  that produce similar results because in some cases they are using  service-specific data collection methods that are unable to provide  information on whether the joint standard is being met, and in some cases  they are reporting on service-specific performance measures rather than  the joint standard. We have previously reported that to achieve reliability  in performance reporting, measurements must apply standard procedures  for collecting data or calculating results so that they are likely to produce  the same results if applied repeatedly to the same situation. The  following are instances when joint bases may rely on data that do not  support reporting on the joint base common standard or where joint bases  are adhering to an individual service standard rather than the common  standard.", "One common standard states that joint bases should maintain a clean  and healthy environment by cleaning certain restrooms three times a  week, and should sweep and mop floors, vacuum carpets, remove  trash, and clean walk-off mats once a week; buff floors monthly; and  maintain/strip floors and shampoo carpets annually. Officials at Joint  Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst reported not meeting the common  standard because the Air Mobility Command method for data  collection differs from the information needed to report on the  common standard. Therefore, the joint base could be meeting the  standard, but officials do not know because they are not collecting the  data required to identify whether they are doing so.", "One common standard related to technical drawings requires that 98  percent of requests for location data result in no incidents of  misidentified data. Officials at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam  reported not meeting the common standard, stating that they were not  tracking this metric because the Air Force did not independently  require it and they were therefore unable to know whether they met  the metric.", "One common standard requires that 100 percent of joint bases hold  emergency management working group meetings quarterly. Joint  Base San Antonio officials reported not meeting the common standard  because the base is instead holding semiannual emergency  management working group meetings, which officials said is in  accordance with Air Force policy.", "Because some of the standards are not clear and are not reviewed and  changed in a timely fashion and in some cases the joint bases use  service-specific data and standards rather than the joint standard, the  common standards do not provide OSD and the joint bases with a  common tool to ensure that the joint bases are interpreting and reporting  on the standards consistently.

By contrast, the officials said that the Air Force removes  snow from roads and parking lots on base but not from sidewalks and  building paths. The officials told us they had to spend additional  money to contract for snow removal on sidewalks or use their own  personnel to remove the snow, which diminished productivity of  mission functions. While there is no joint base common standard  specifically on snow removal, there is one on pavement clearance,  which includes snow and ice removal, which states that joint bases  should have an installation pavement clearance plan developed in  accordance with best practices of the military components to meet  safety and mission needs.

As DOD stated in its recommendation to  the 2005 BRAC Commission, DOD anticipated that this effort represented  a significant opportunity to reduce duplication of effort and achieve  efficiencies and cost savings across the 12 joint bases. However, to date  OSD has not developed and implemented a plan to guide the joint bases  in achieving cost savings and efficiencies. OSD has developed and  implemented a framework for collecting and reporting data on  performance of joint base common standards and the funds spent and  manpower used to meet those standards. However, OSD has not yet  developed this framework to the point where it can isolate the costs,  savings, and efficiencies resulting specifically from joint basing, excluding  non-joint basing actions and using reliable data. Without this information,  OSD is not in a position to know to what extent DOD has made progress  toward achieving the joint basing objectives, and will be unable to  evaluate whether to continue or expand joint basing. Additionally, a lack  of specificity and clarity within the joint base common standards, the long  process to review and adjust the standards, and the absence of  consistently reported data hinder the standards\u2019 effectiveness as a  common framework or tool for managing support services. Without a  consistent interpretation and reported use of the standards, OSD and the  joint bases cannot ensure that they are receiving reliable and comparable  data on the level of support services provided, and as a result will not  have information necessary to make informed resource allocation  decisions so that joint base services are delivered consistently. While  OSD and the joint bases can identify challenges in implementing the joint  bases, OSD has no common strategy to ensure that the joint bases  routinely share information with each other on best practices and lessons  learned in order to resolve common challenges. Finally, OSD has not  provided guidance to ensure that bases provide consistent information to  new joint base personnel to better inform them as to procedures for  obtaining support services on joint bases.

In its comments,  DOD said such targets would restrict the authority of local commanders to  manage the merger of the formerly standalone bases into joint bases.  DOD also stated that while savings targets may be appropriate in the  future, imposing savings goals would restrict the authority of the joint  base commanders and burden them while implementing new  organizational structures, which would unnecessarily risk negative  impacts to mission support when operational effectiveness of the bases is  paramount. Moreover, DOD stated that the department should continue  its approach of being patient with obtaining savings and efficiencies at  joint bases because this approach is working. DOD cited two cost-savings  examples through personnel cuts achieved in fiscal years 2012 and 2013:  the Air Force reduced civilian positions for all the joint bases for which it is  the lead, and the Navy chose to not fill all of its civilian vacancies. Finally,  DOD stated that the creation of the joint bases from separate installations  is equivalent to the mergers of corporations with very different financial  systems, management structures, operating procedures, and cultural  differences. DOD has decided it is important to empower each joint base  commander to design, implement, and adapt cost efficient and effective  approaches to their unique situations while adopting new and cross- cutting business practices, thereby making them incubators of innovation.  Therefore, DOD has decided to allow for an extended transition period  and defer near-term savings.", "We acknowledge that establishing joint basing is a complex undertaking,  but DOD\u2019s current position of taking a patient approach and deliberately  deferring near-term savings contradicts the position it took when  requesting the BRAC Commission to approve its joint basing  recommendation. Specifically, in its justification to the Commission  (published in our report as appendix II), DOD stated that joint basing  would produce savings exceeding the cost of implementation  immediately. Moreover, as our report clearly points out, DOD projected  20-year net present value savings of over $2.3 billion although the current  20-year net present value savings estimate is now about $249 million\u2014a  decrease of about 90 percent. DOD also asserted that it is achieving  savings, as shown by the Air Force and Navy manpower reductions at the  joint bases. However, these cuts were not the result of a purposeful effort  to pare unnecessary management personnel due to the implementation  of joint basing. Air Force and Navy documents and interviews with  officials from these services indicate that the joint bases\u2019 memoranda of  agreement show increases in budget and civilian manpower required as a  result of joint basing.

Therefore, we continue to believe our  recommendation is warranted.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation, to continue to  develop and refine the Cost Performance and Visibility Framework in  order to (1) eliminate data reliability problems, (2) facilitate comparisons  of joint basing costs with the cost of operating the separate installations  prior to implementing joint basing, and (3) identify and isolate the costs  and savings resulting from actions and initiatives specifically resulting  from joint basing and excluding DOD or service-wide actions and  initiatives. DOD stated that its Cost Performance and Visibility Framework  already provides a method to collect quarterly data on performance  towards the Common Output Level Standards, annual data on personnel  assigned, and funds obligated for each joint base. However, DOD also  acknowledged that there were inconsistencies in the current data  captured in the Framework and that DOD is working through and  improving its data reliability. DOD stated that it invested considerable  effort to clarify this data and expected to have sufficient data to begin  assessing joint base efficiencies by the end of fiscal year 2012. It stated  that then it would be able to compare the current fiscal year financial and  performance data to the baseline and previous year\u2019s obligations. DOD  also stated that it could perform an additional analysis to compare the  joint bases\u2019 baseline data with the costs of operating the separate  installations prior to implementing joint basing because this information is  included in annex U of each joint base\u2019s memorandum of agreement.  However, DOD also acknowledged that this comparison still would not be  able to identify cost savings resulting solely from joint basing and  asserted that it is impractical to isolate and distinguish joint basing cost  savings from the savings that result from DOD- or service-wide actions  using the data contained in its Framework. Furthermore, DOD pointed out  that it did not believe that accounting systems are designed to track  savings, rather they are designed to track expenses and disbursements,  which DOD stated in its comments is what we concluded in a 1997  report.", "We also see that the Cost Performance and Visibility Framework  represents a good start on development of a system to measure joint  basing performance. However, as it was being used at the time of our  review, and as we clearly state in the report, it was not adequate to  reliably identify any savings.  First, DOD\u2019s proposed analysis of  comparing current operating costs to the baseline would not result in an  accurate assessment of savings from the joint bases because DOD has  included in the baseline the higher costs of implementing the higher joint  basing standards, such as expected increases in personnel and higher  utility rates. The baseline would not accurately reflect the cost of the  standalone bases prior to the joint basing initiative. Therefore, while this  analysis might show some bases spending less than the inflated baseline,  it would not show if they are spending less than what they spent as  standalone bases. Second, DOD\u2019s proposed analysis to compare the  current cost of joint basing documented in its framework to the cost of  standalone bases as captured in annex U of the memoranda of  agreement as currently planned would also produce inaccurate results.  As DOD stated, this analysis would not be able to isolate any savings  specific to joint basing since some savings have been made that are not  directly attributable to joint basing such as the general service personnel  reductions. Third, the memoranda of agreement annexes U do not  consistently and clearly show the costs of operations of each base prior to  joint basing and the respective transfers of funds between the services,  rendering them unreliable for this analysis. Finally, we agree with DOD\u2019s  statement that our 1997 report concluded that the department\u2019s  accounting systems are not designed to track savings. However, it is for  this reason that we also concluded in our 1997 report that \u201cthe absence of  efforts to update projected savings indicates the need for additional  guidance and emphasis from DOD on accumulating and updating savings  data on a comprehensive and consistent basis,\u201d and we so recommended  it then. As we believed in 1997 and continue to believe, DOD needs to  improve its ability to update savings from BRAC recommendations.  Refinements to the Cost Performance and Visibility Framework would  position the department to effectively measure savings from joint basing,  and therefore the need for our recommendation remains.", "DOD partially concurred with our third and fourth recommendations\u2014to  compile a comprehensive list of common standards needing clarification  and to prioritize the review and potentially revise those standards within  that list, respectively\u2014and stated that there is already a quarterly  feedback process on the joint base common standards and an annual  review process that incorporates input from the joint bases. Specifically,  DOD stated that standards may need changing as priorities change and  missions evolve, but that the current process strikes an appropriate  balance between the analytical burden of repeated reviews with the need  for clarity and refinement. DOD also stated that it believes that reviewing  all the standards simultaneously does not allow for the depth of analysis  required to make sound decisions. DOD suggested that GAO should  conduct a qualitative assessment of the standards because our findings  on the need to revise its process for reviewing and clarifying its standards  appear to be based on an anecdotal assessment.", "While we agree with DOD that the standards need to be continually  reviewed and adjusted as priorities and missions change, we found ample  evidence that the individuals that report on the joint bases\u2019 ability to meet  the current standards believe some of the standards need clarification  now, and that in many instances, these officials believe it is unclear what  some of the standards are measuring. It is important to note that nothing  in our recommendation requires DOD to review all the standards  simultaneously. To the contrary, our recommendation specifically states  that DOD should compile a list of standards needing clarification. In fact,  because DOD has not issued any guidance to prioritize the standards,  joint bases continue to report on and provide resources toward reporting  on all the standards whether they are problematic or not. Lastly, DOD  stated that they believed our evidence was based on an anecdotal  assessment. We disagree. We conducted a comprehensive qualitative  review of over 59,359 comments entered into the Cost Performance and  Visibility Framework from fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and categorized  them into broad themes of issues raised by the bases in reference to the  Common Output Level Standards. As shown in figure 2 of our report, the  need for clarity of the Common Output Level Standards was raised over  200 times by the joint bases during this timeframe. However, because  DOD\u2019s data is not adequate to permit us to specifically identify what types  of clarification problems were being encountered by the bases, we  supplemented our analyses with follow-up interviews to provide anecdotal  examples that added some context to our analyses and described a few  of the types of problems encountered. Moreover, our data suggested that  DOD\u2019s quarterly process had proven ineffective at addressing the need  for clarification and review of problematic standards since some  standards continue to be problematic despite the quarterly reviews which  DOD asserts are working. For these reasons, we continue to believe that  improvements are needed in DOD\u2019s current process for reviewing and  clarifying the common standards to address the bases reported concerns.", "DOD partially concurred with our fifth recommendation, to develop a  common strategy that expands routine communication between the joint  bases, and between the joint bases and OSD, to encourage joint  resolution of common challenges and sharing of best practices and  lessons learned.

DOD\u2019s joint basing policy states that problems at the joint  bases should be identified and addressed at the lowest possible level,  which can include only officials at any given joint base. Thus, the majority  of these issues may not be elevated to the working group but may still  occur at multiple joint bases leading to duplication of effort in resolving  common problems experienced in multiple locations. Moreover, those  issues that are not elevated to the working group may never be relayed to  other joint bases since there is no explicit policy or process in place to do  so. The newsletters, which we discuss in our report, only convey a limited  number of best practices, and exclude problems and solutions identified  in the course of implementing joint basing. Additionally, contributions to  the newsletters are not required and are not always comprehensive.  Moreover, the contributions tend to highlight best practices which are  good but exclude unsolved challenges, which if shared, could result in the  bases jointly resolving problems or elevating them when needed to more  senior leadership. As a result, some joint base officials told us that they  found the newsletters to be of limited usefulness. For these reasons, we  continue to believe that the joint bases could benefit from routine  communication that allows them to commonly and routinely share  identified challenges and possible solutions, rather than having such  communication occur only sporadically or be filtered through the higher  levels of the oversight structure put in place by OSD.", "DOD partially concurred with our sixth recommendation, to develop  guidance that would ensure all joint bases develop and provide training  materials to incoming joint base personnel.

We agree that the  commander of each joint base needs the flexibility to provide joint base- specific training. The intent of our recommendation is that in addition to  establishing a requirement that joint bases develop training guidance and  ensure training occurs at each base, OSD\u2019s guidance should encourage  the sharing of training materials across bases to reduce duplication of  effort, promote commonality where appropriate, and provide a means of  potentially sharing best practices.

We also  reviewed our prior findings on key practices and implementation steps for  mergers and organizational transformations. We interviewed DOD  officials at the service headquarters and the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) to obtain information about cost savings, joint basing  budget data, and guidance related to cost savings and efficiencies. We  also interviewed joint basing officials at three joint bases and obtained  answers to written questions from the remaining nine joint bases that we  did not visit in person to obtain information on actual cost savings and  efficiencies achieved and guidance and communication related to cost  savings and efficiencies. We selected a nonprobability sample of three  site visit locations based the following factors: (1) we chose to visit one  base where each military department (Army, Air Force and Navy) had the  lead responsibility for providing installation support, (2) we considered  geographic diversity, (3) we chose to visit at least one base that we did  not visit for our 2009 joint basing report, (4) we selected at least one joint  base from each of the two phases of joint base implementation, and   (5) we chose joint bases where the installations that had been combined  into the joint base were directly adjacent to each other. Based on these  factors, we chose to visit Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Joint Base  Lewis-McChord, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.", "To evaluate the extent to which joint base common standards have  provided a common framework for defining and reporting installation  support services, we reviewed DOD policy and guidance related to the  common standards; the standards themselves, including both functional  areas and specific standards; and federal internal control standards and  key elements of successful performance measures.reviewed the joint bases\u2019 reporting on the joint base common standards  for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. To determine the degree to which the  standards were achieved, we analyzed the data to determine how many  standards were met, not met, or determined to be not applicable. We  conducted a content analysis of the comments accompanying the  standards reporting from fiscal years 2010 to 2011 to identifying concerns  regarding the various standards. In conducting this content analysis, we  reviewed comments accompanying all reported standards, including  those reported as met, not met, and not applicable. Using this analysis,  we identified the most frequent reasons the joint bases provided for not  meeting the standards, as well as challenges the joint bases faced in  implementing and reporting on various standards. To conduct the content  analysis, two analysts individually coded all comments accompanying the  standards reporting into one of the 17 categories listed in table 2. After  the comments were coded, a third analyst adjudicated any differences  between the coding of the first two analysts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: BRAC Commission Recommendation on Joint Basing (Including Elements of DOD\u2019s Recommendation to the Commission)", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: BRAC Commission  Recommendation on Joint Basing (Including  Elements of DOD\u2019s Recommendation to the  Commission)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Joint Basing Installation Support Functional Areas", "paragraphs": ["The joint base common standards developed by the DOD for use by the  joint bases in managing and reporting on installation support services are  grouped into 48 functional areas of installation support.
