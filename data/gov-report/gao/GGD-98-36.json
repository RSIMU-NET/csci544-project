However, small businesses and governments can be disproportionately affected by federal agencies\u2019 regulatory requirements, and agencies may inadequately consider the impact of those requirements on small entities when the requirements are implemented.", "In response to concerns about the effect that federal regulations may have on small entities, Congress passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601-612). The RFA requires federal agencies to analyze the anticipated effects of rules they plan to propose on small entities unless they certify that the rules will not have a \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d The Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Office of Advocacy is responsible for monitoring federal agencies\u2019 compliance with the RFA and for reviewing federal rules for their impact on small businesses.", "On March 29, 1996, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) to strengthen the RFA\u2019s protections for small entities. Among other things, SBREFA requires that, before publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is to convene a small business advocacy review panel for the draft rule (5 U.S.C. 609). During the advocacy review panel process, the panel must collect the advice and recommendations of representatives of affected small entities about the potential impact of the draft rule. SBREFA requires that the panel is to consist of employees from the regulatory agency responsible for the draft rule (EPA or OSHA), the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), and SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy. The statute also requires the regulatory agencies, the Chief Counsel, and the panels themselves to undertake certain actions within specified timeframes.

Agencies are to consider the comments received during the public comment period and then publish the final rule in the Federal Register. Agencies may incorporate suggested changes in the text of the final rule or provide other insights into their consideration of public comments in the rule\u2019s preamble. After publication in the Federal Register as a final rule, the text of the rule is then to be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.", "The RFA requires agencies to prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis for each draft rule, unless the head of the agency certifies in the Federal Register that \u201cthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d If a draft rule is expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, agencies must publish their initial regulatory flexibility analysis, or a summary of it, in the Federal Register when they publish the proposed rule. Section 603 of the RFA requires that the initial regulatory flexibility analysis describes the expected impact of the rule on small entities and describes (1) why the agency is considering the regulatory action; (2) the objectives and legal basis for the rule; (3) the type and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to which the rule will apply; (4) the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule; (5) all federal rules, to the extent practicable, that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rulemaking; and (6) significant alternatives to the rule that would minimize the impact on small entities while accomplishing the purpose of the statute. Section 604 of the RFA requires agencies to conduct a similar final regulatory flexibility analysis when they promulgate the final rule and publish the final analysis, or a summary thereof, with the final rule. However, agencies do not have to conduct either the initial analysis or the final analysis if they certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and they explain the reasons for the certification.", "Before publication of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis, section 609 of the RFA, as amended by SBREFA, requires the appropriate regulatory agency (EPA or OSHA) to notify the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy and to provide information on the draft rule\u2019s potential impacts on small entities and the type of small entities that might be affected. Section 609 also requires the Chief Counsel, within 15 days of this notification, to identify representatives of affected small entities for the purpose of obtaining advice and recommendations from those individuals about the potential impacts of the draft rule. The Chief Counsel may waive the requirements to convene a panel under certain circumstances if he or she, in consultation with representatives of affected small entities and the Administrator of OIRA, finds that the panel requirements would not advance the effective participation of small entities in the rulemaking process.", "SBREFA also requires each panel to consist of full-time federal employees from the office within the agency responsible for carrying out the draft rule and from OIRA and SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy. SBREFA requires the panel to report on the comments received from small entities and on the panel\u2019s recommendations no later than 60 days after the panel is convened, and states that the panel\u2019s report shall be made public as part of the rulemaking record.

That search indicated that OSHA had published 2 proposed rules during the period, and that EPA had published more than 350 proposed rules. Because of the large number of EPA-proposed rules, we decided to limit our review of EPA rules to the 17 that were subject to review by OIRA.", "We asked SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy whether he agreed with OSHA\u2019s and EPA\u2019s certifications that these 19 proposed rules would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We interviewed officials from SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy, EPA, OSHA, and OIRA and reviewed the RFA, as amended by SBREFA, to identify any criteria that could be used to determine what constitutes a \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d We also examined the legislative history of the RFA and SBREFA to determine if there were any discussions relevant to defining this term or providing criteria for its implementation.", "To determine whether the EPA and OSHA panels, the regulatory agencies themselves, and SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy followed the advocacy review panel procedural requirements and whether there were differences in how the panels were conducted, we interviewed (1) selected officials from EPA, OSHA, SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy, and OIRA who participated in the panels that had been convened as of November 1, 1997, and (2) 32 of the 63 small entity representatives who were identified by the agencies and were asked to provide advice and recommendations to the panels. We selected the agency officials by contacting at least one official from each agency for each panel. We selected the small entity representatives by contacting every other small entity representative that EPA and OSHA listed for each panel.", "We also interviewed representatives of five associations who had been identified as possible small entity representatives so that we could determine why they decided not to participate in the panels. In addition, we interviewed 13 of the small entity representatives who provided advice and recommendations to an unofficial panel that EPA convened for a draft implementation strategy that related to EPA\u2019s rules establishing national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter.", "Finally, we reviewed documents pertaining to the panels, including the panel requirements in SBREFA; materials that EPA and OSHA provided to the small entity representatives; and the final reports prepared by each panel.", "To identify any changes that EPA and OSHA made to their draft rules as a result of the panels, we compared the recommendations in the panels\u2019 final reports with the related notices of proposed rulemaking as published in the Federal Register. As of November 1, 1997, only two of the five draft rules for which panels had been conducted had been published as proposed rules. To obtain suggestions about how the advocacy review panel process could be improved, we asked officials from EPA, OSHA, OIRA, and SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy and the 32 small entity representatives we interviewed to identify possible improvements in that process.", "Because EPA and OSHA had convened only five advocacy review panels at the time of our review (four at EPA and one at OSHA), our review results should be viewed as preliminary information on the operation of the panel provisions. Our first objective was to determine whether any EPA- or OSHA-proposed rules should have triggered the advocacy review panel requirements but did not. As previously mentioned, we limited our review of EPA rules to those that were subject to review by OIRA pursuant to Executive Order 12866. However, there may have been other EPA rules that had a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities but were not subject to OIRA review. Because EPA panel reports for three of its panels were not publicly available as of November 1, 1997, we did not include them in our report. As of November 1, 1997, OSHA had published a notice for proposed rulemaking for the panel it had held. However, EPA had not published notices of proposed rulemaking for three of the four panels it had held by that date. Therefore, we only could identify changes related to one OSHA and one EPA rule.", "We did our work between August 1997 and January 1998 in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Director of OMB, the Secretary of Labor, and the Administrators of EPA and SBA or their designees.

(See app. I for a list of these 19 proposed rules.) The agencies did not convene panels for any of these proposed rules because they certified that the rules would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy agreed with OSHA\u2019s certifications that neither of its two proposed rules required an advocacy review panel. However, the Chief Counsel said that EPA should have convened advocacy review panels for 2 of its 17 proposed rules\u2014the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and for particulate matter.", "EPA\u2019s certification of these two rules was based on EPA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cimpact\u201d under the RFA. EPA concluded that the term refers to the impact of a proposed rule on small entities subject to the rule\u2019s requirements because the purpose of a regulatory flexibility analysis is to consider ways of easing a rule\u2019s requirements as they will apply to small entities. According to EPA, that purpose could not be served in the case of rules such as these national ambient air quality standards, which do not themselves impose requirements that apply to small entities. Because, according to EPA, the only choice it has in promulgating the national ambient air quality standards is the level of the standard and not its implementation, EPA stated that there is nothing it can do in setting these standards to tailor state implementation measures as they apply to small entities. EPA said that any effect on small entities would occur only when states specifically determine how they will implement these rules.", "In a November 18, 1996, letter to the EPA Administrator, SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy said that EPA should have convened advocacy review panels for the ozone and particulate matter rules. He said that the promulgation of these proposed rules cannot be separated from their implementation, and that certain effects on small entities flow \u201cinexorably\u201d from the standards that these proposed rules would establish. Also, 6 of the 13 small entity representatives we interviewed who provided comments to an unofficial advocacy review panel on a draft implementation strategy related to these 2 rules said that they thought EPA should have convened panels for these standards. One of these representatives said that by not convening advocacy review panels for these rules, he believed that EPA had circumvented the intent of SBREFA.", "We could not determine whether EPA should have convened advocacy review panels for the ozone and particulate matter proposed rules because there are no clear governmentwide criteria for determining whether a rule has a \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d The RFA does not define \u201csignificant economic impact\u201d or \u201csubstantial number of small entities,\u201d and neither SBA nor any other agency has issued governmentwide guidance regarding the meaning of these terms. In particular, there is no governmentwide guidance or criteria about whether health standards that an agency establishes by regulation should be considered separable from implementation requirements established by state governments or other entities. Therefore, it is unclear whether EPA\u2019s ozone and particulate matter rules should have triggered the requirements for an initial regulatory flexibility analysis and, therefore, the advocacy review panel requirements.", "Officials from SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy said that they are frequently asked to define the phrase \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d However, the officials said that the Office of Advocacy has not taken a definitive position on the meaning of this phrase, and no case law has clearly established its meaning. Although no governmentwide criteria exist, both EPA and OSHA have issued guidance to help their staffs determine when a draft rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and guidance on conducting the SBREFA advocacy review panel process. Nevertheless, agencies ultimately determine the meaning of the phrase on a case-by-case basis, and their decisions are subject to comment by the public and SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy, as well as judicial review.", "In our 1991 report on the RFA and small governments, we found that each of the four federal agencies we reviewed had a different interpretation of key RFA provisions. In our 1994 report on the RFA, we noted that, although the act required SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy to monitor agencies\u2019 compliance with the act, the RFA did not expressly authorize SBA to interpret key provisions in the statute and did not require SBA to develop criteria for agencies to follow in reviewing their rules. We concluded that this lack of authority and responsibility for interpretation and guidance contributed to what the Chief Counsel considered to be some agencies\u2019 noncompliance with the RFA. We said that if Congress wanted to strengthen the implementation of the RFA, it should consider amending the act to (1) provide SBA with clearer authority and responsibility to interpret the RFA\u2019s provisions and (2) require SBA, in consultation with OMB, to develop criteria as to whether and how federal agencies should conduct RFA analyses. Although Congress amended the RFA when it enacted SBREFA, it did not adopt these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Panels, Agencies, and Chief Counsel Generally Followed SBREFA\u2019s Procedural Requirements", "paragraphs": ["By November 1, 1997, OSHA and EPA had convened five advocacy review panels. OSHA convened the first panel on September 10, 1996, to review its draft standard for occupational exposure to tuberculosis. However, OSHA had not convened any additional panels as of November 1, 1997. EPA convened panels between June 1996 and November 1, 1997, to review the following four draft rules: (1) control of emissions of air pollution from nonroad diesel engines (Mar. 25, 1997); (2) effluent limitations guidelines and pretreatment standards for the industrial laundries point source category (June 6, 1997); (3) stormwater phase II\u2014national pollutant discharge elimination system (June 19, 1997); and (4) effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the transportation equipment-cleaning industry (July 16, 1997).

As part of that notification, they provided the Chief Counsel with required information on the draft rules\u2019 potential impacts and the types of entities that might be affected.", "The Chief Counsel responded to EPA and OSHA no later than 15 days after the date of receipt of these materials and helped identify individuals representative of affected small entities for the purpose of obtaining advice and recommendations about the potential impacts of the draft rules. For each of EPA\u2019s four panels, the Chief Counsel reviewed a list of potential candidates that EPA provided and in some cases supplemented the list. The Chief Counsel initially identified most of the small entity representatives for OSHA\u2019s panel in consultation with OSHA officials.", "The EPA and OSHA panels consisted of full-time federal employees from the office within the agency responsible for carrying out the draft rule and officials from OIRA and SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy.", "Each of the five panels reviewed materials the regulatory agencies had prepared and collected advice and recommendations from small entity representatives.", "However, a few of the panels\u2019 and agencies\u2019 actions had minor inconsistencies with SBREFA\u2019s specific statutory requirements. For example, SBREFA requires that the advocacy review panels report on the comments of the small entity representatives and their findings not later than 60 days after the date the regulatory agency convened the panels. However, three of the five panels took a few days longer than the allotted 60-day period to prepare the panels\u2019 final reports. OSHA\u2019s tuberculosis and EPA\u2019s industrial laundries panels took 63 days to prepare their final reports, and the transportation equipment-cleaning panel took 69 days.", "SBREFA also required both EPA and OSHA to designate by April 29, 1996, using existing personnel to the extent possible, a small business advocacy chair to be responsible for implementing the panel requirements and to act as a permanent chair of the agency\u2019s advocacy review panels. Both agencies appointed officials as panel chairs who were already employed by the agencies. OSHA designated its chair in March 1996, before the statutory deadline. However, EPA did not designate a small business advocacy chair until June 11, 1996, about 6 weeks later than required by the statute.", "SBREFA states that the advocacy review panels shall \u201creport\u201d within 60 days, \u201cprovided that such report shall be made public as part of the rulemaking record.\u201d However, the statute does not specify to whom the report is to be directed and when the reports should be made available to the public. OSHA\u2019s panel issued its final report to the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health on November 12, 1996, and OSHA made the report publicly available on December 10, 1996\u201410 months before the draft rule was published as a proposed rule. EPA\u2019s panels issued their final reports to the EPA Administrator. However, the EPA panels decided that they would make the final panel reports available to the public by placing them in the public rulemaking docket only when the related proposed rules were published in the Federal Register. This determination appears to be consistent with SBREFA\u2019s procedural requirements and congressional intent. However, this approach has resulted in several months delay between the issuance of the panels\u2019 final reports and their availability to the public. Some of the small entity representatives that we interviewed said they would have liked to have seen how the panel reports reflected their comments as soon as the reports became final rather than having to wait until EPA published the associated notice of proposed rulemaking. To accommodate the small entities representatives\u2019 concerns regarding the delay in releasing these reports, EPA\u2019s Chair said that he briefed some of the representatives about the content of the panels\u2019 final reports and how their comments had been reflected in these reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of the Panels Differed", "paragraphs": ["Although the five advocacy review panels convened as of November 1, 1997, generally followed SBREFA\u2019s procedural requirements, there were differences among the panels in how those requirements were implemented and in the general operation of the panels. Some of those differences appeared to occur because the panel process was new and evolving, and the panels made adjustments to their procedures as they gained experience.", "One of the differences among the panels was the degree of prepanel contact that the agencies had with the small entity representatives, which in turn had implications for other aspects of the panel process. For example, although OSHA had done some outreach with small entities before its tuberculosis panel, it had not previously dealt with some of the types of small entities that were expected to be affected by the draft tuberculosis exposure rule. As a result, it was difficult for OSHA and SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy to identify representatives from those small entities to participate on that panel. In contrast, many of the small entity representatives to the EPA panel regarding stormwater phase II guidelines had worked with EPA on a related federal advisory committee for 2 years before the date that EPA convened the advocacy review panel. As a result, it was relatively easy for EPA and the Chief Counsel to identify small entity representatives to provide input to that panel. Also, because of their extensive background on this issue, some of the small entity representatives said that it was relatively easy for them to review the materials that EPA gave them.", "The panels also differed in the availability of information for the small entity representatives to review. SBREFA states that the advocacy review panels \u201cshall review any material the agency has prepared,\u201d but the statute does not specify what information the regulatory agencies must make available to the small entity representatives. In the five panels convened as of November 1, 1997, EPA and OSHA provided the small entity representatives with information about the draft rules before the representatives provided input to the panels. That information usually included a copy of the initial economic analyses or data on costs the regulatory agency had prepared for the draft rules. However, EPA did not prepare an initial economic analysis for its draft stormwater phase II rule until after the small entity representatives had provided their comments to the panel. Some of the small entity representatives to this panel said that their comments were not as valuable or as well-grounded as they could have been because they lacked the information in the initial economic analysis. This economic analysis, however, led EPA to conclude that the stormwater phase II rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, if EPA had completed its initial economic analysis before it convened the advocacy review panel in June 1997, it probably would not have convened a panel for this draft rule.", "The panels also differed in how they obtained comments from the small entity representatives. Before EPA convened its four panels, the agency held face-to-face meetings with the representatives to discuss the draft rules. Officials from OIRA and SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy were invited to attend all of these meetings, and they attended most of them. None of the EPA panels held face-to-face meetings with small entity representatives after the panels were convened. However, three of the four EPA panels had telephone conference calls with the representatives during the 60-day panel process. The panel that did not have a telephone conference call was EPA\u2019s stormwater phase II panel. The EPA Chair said that because most of the small entity representatives had worked to develop this draft rule and had previously provided their comments, he did not believe that either face-to-face meetings or a telephone conference call was necessary. Instead, he sent a letter to the small entity representatives asking them if they had any additional comments for the panel. In response, one small entity representative resubmitted his comments, which had been previously received by EPA a few days before the panel convened.", "OSHA held individual telephone conference calls with each of the small entity representatives who provided input to its panel. Unlike EPA\u2019s approach to telephone conference calling, the small entity representatives who were individually called by OSHA\u2019s panel were unable to hear the other representatives\u2019 comments. Some of these small entity representatives said that they would have liked to have been able to hear the other representatives\u2019 comments.", "Another difference among the panels was in how the small entity representatives were identified. EPA initially identified most of the small entity participants for its four panels, and then confirmed their lists of representatives with SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy. OSHA, on the other hand, collaborated with the Office of Advocacy in its initial efforts to identify potential representatives for its panel on tuberculosis exposure. OSHA officials said that they intend to identify small entity representatives and conduct outreach efforts related to the panel process before convening future panels.", "EPA and its panels changed some of their procedures as they gained experience with the panel process. For example, EPA convened its first panel on nonroad diesel engine emissions by sending a draft panel report summarizing the agency\u2019s prepanel outreach efforts to the panel members. However, EPA\u2019s Chair said that subsequent panels changed this practice because some Members of Congress and congressional staff viewed convening the panel by sending the draft report as an attempt to prejudice the panel members\u2019 considerations. For subsequent panels, EPA developed a summary of prepanel comments it received regarding the draft rules and submitted these summaries to the panels, and the panels then drafted their final reports. EPA\u2019s Chair also said that EPA plans to clarify its guidance on panel procedures for collecting input from small entity representatives. He said that by sending a letter to the small entity representatives they contacted before the panel was convened, the stormwater phase II panel followed SBREFA\u2019s requirements that the panel itself obtain the advice and recommendations from the representatives. However, after this panel, he said that EPA realized that its guidance did not specifically address how the panel should obtain small entities representatives\u2019 input. Therefore, he said that EPA plans to amend its SBREFA guidance to clarify that the panels themselves must conduct outreach to collect advice and recommendations from the small entity representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Notices of Proposed Rulemaking Contained Some Panel Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["As of November 1, 1997, two of the draft rules for which EPA and OSHA held advocacy review panels had been published as notices of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register\u2014OSHA\u2019s proposed rule on occupational exposure to tuberculosis and EPA\u2019s proposed rule to control nonroad diesel engine emissions.

The panel also recommended that OSHA examine the need for annual retraining of employees.

These agency officials pointed out that there are costs associated with the advocacy review panel process in terms of the time and resources expended. A few EPA and OSHA program officials who had each participated in one panel also said that there are other opportunities for small entities to provide input during the public comment period. For example, an EPA official said that in some cases, such as when the small entity representatives did not have the opportunity to comment to the advocacy review panel on an initial economic analysis, the representatives could provide their views and any relevant information during the public comment period after the rule is proposed.", "Although there were some individual small entities included in all but one of the groups of small entity representatives that provided input to the panels, most of the representatives to the panels were from associations, such as those associations representing the health care industry, the construction industry, or local governments.

Many of the panel participants we interviewed said they welcomed the panel process because it has provided an opportunity to identify significant impacts on small entities and has given the agencies a better appreciation of small entities\u2019 concerns.", "However, implementation of the panel process has not been without controversy or concern. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy and some small entity representatives believe that EPA should have convened advocacy review panels for two rules for which advocacy review panels were not held. EPA and three of the five panels that were held did not meet some of the specific time requirements of the statute. In addition, although consistent with the statute, the EPA panels\u2019 policy regarding when their final reports can be made public may result in reports not being made available to the small entity representatives or the public until months after the reports are provided to the EPA Administrator. Some of the small entity representatives believe that the panels should be held earlier in the rulemaking process, that the materials provided to the representatives could be improved, that they should have more time to review those materials, and that the agencies should improve the means by which they obtain small entity representatives\u2019 comments.", "Some of the concerns that small entity representatives expressed about the panel process appear to be inconsistent and may be difficult to resolve. For example, when panels are held early in the rulemaking process, some of the data and analyses that the small entity representatives said they need to have an informed discussion about a draft rule are less likely to be available than later in the process. Conversely, delaying the panels until the data are available may limit the panels\u2019 opportunity to influence key decisions.", "Some EPA and OSHA program officials who had each participated in one panel made comments regarding the panel process that indicated they did not fully appreciate the intent of the process. For example, an EPA official said that small entity representatives who did not have an opportunity to review and comment on a draft rule\u2019s initial economic analysis could do so during the standard public comment period for the proposed rule. However, this view fails to recognize that Congress established the advocacy review panel process as an addition to the public comment period to facilitate receiving the views of small entities at an earlier stage of the rulemaking process. Therefore, the standard public comment period cannot substitute for the panel process.", "How agencies implement the advocacy review panel process will have a pronounced effect on the continued viability of that process. If small entity representatives can discuss the issues related to draft rules that they believe are important and see that their input is seriously considered, it is likely that they will continue to view the panel process as a useful opportunity to provide their comments on draft rules relatively early in the rulemaking process. Similarly, if panels continue to make adjustments to the process as they learn from their experiences, they can help alleviate some of the concerns voiced by the small entity representatives.", "Many of the suggestions that small entity representatives made regarding the panel process would not require changes to SBREFA. For example, although SBREFA requires that agencies convene panels before a notice of proposed rulemaking is published, the statute does not preclude convening the panels even earlier in the rule development process, as the small entity representatives suggested. Although some of the representatives said they needed more advance notice of meetings and telephone conference calls and more time to review background materials provided by the agencies, those changes would not necessarily require increasing the 60-day period that SBREFA allows between the date the panels are convened and the issuance of their final reports. The regulatory agencies could provide representatives with materials before the panels convene; better planning could alleviate the short advance notice problem.", "The lack of clarity regarding whether EPA should have convened advocacy review panels for its two proposed rules on ozone and particulate matter is traceable to the lack of agreed-upon governmentwide criteria as to whether a rule has a \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities\u201d under the RFA. We raised this issue in our 1994 report on the RFA, in which we said that \u201cf Congress wishes to strengthen the implementation of the RFA, it should consider amending the act to (1) provide SBA with clearer authority and responsibility to interpret the RFA\u2019s provisions and (2) require SBA, in consultation with OMB, to develop criteria as to whether and how federal agencies should conduct RFA analyses.\u201d If governmentwide criteria had been established regarding when initial regulatory flexibility analyses should be prepared (and, therefore, when SBREFA advocacy review panels should be convened), the dispute regarding whether EPA should have convened additional panels would likely not have arisen. Governmentwide guidance could, for example, address the specific question at issue with regard to these two rules\u2014whether establishment of regulatory standards by a federal agency should be separated from their implementation requirements imposed by the individual states (or other entities) for purposes of compliance with the RFA and SBREFA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If Congress wishes to clarify and strengthen the implementation of the RFA and SBREFA, it should consider providing SBA or another entity with clearer authority and responsibility to interpret the RFA\u2019s provisions on a governmentwide basis.

The officials also said that their additional contacts with small entities can enable them to identify additional small entities that should be asked to provide advice and recommendations to the advocacy review panels. After considering the officials\u2019 comments and researching the legislative history of the provision, we changed the text in this report to indicate that SBA\u2019s use of draft agency lists was consistent with the statutory requirements.", "EPA officials said that they strongly believe that they correctly interpreted the RFA and SBREFA regarding the ozone and particulate matter rules, and that convening advocacy review panels for those rules was not required. In this report, we expanded our discussion of EPA\u2019s position on this issue, but we continued to describe both sides of this argument and to note that the issue was under litigation.", "EPA officials also expressed concerns regarding our draft report\u2019s Matter for Consideration section in which we suggested, conditionally, that Congress should require SBA to develop governmentwide criteria regarding RFA analyses. The officials said that EPA had developed detailed, interim guidance on the RFA, as amended by SBREFA, including guidance regarding the panel process and determination of what constitutes a \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d They stated that governmentwide criteria on what constitutes a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities cannot be both prescriptive enough to be authoritative, but flexible enough to take into account the many section-by-section, statute-by-statute, and agency-by-agency variations that must be considered. EPA officials said that EPA\u2019s guidance allows it to use its judgment in making case-by-case determinations. The officials said that they would prefer to maintain the agency\u2019s flexibility in making certifications and to rely on Department of Justice decisions resolving any disputes in interpretations among agencies as well as any case law that arises under the new judicial review provisions of SBREFA regarding agencies\u2019 interpretations of the RFA.", "Although agency-specific guidance may also be needed, we believe that governmentwide criteria regarding RFA analysis could help promote a more consistent and less contentious approach for agencies to use in complying with the RFA and SBREFA requirements. In our 1991 report on the RFA, we identified instances of agencies\u2019 interpreting key provisions of the RFA differently. Congress enacted the RFA and SBREFA to ensure that small entities\u2019 views are taken into consideration in developing notices of proposed rulemaking. Establishing governmentwide criteria could help small entities as well as agencies more clearly understand when and how the RFA and SBREFA requirements should be applied. While we recognize that governmentwide criteria need to be flexible enough to allow for some agency-by-agency variations, we believe that the criteria should be sufficiently standardized to provide for consistent implementation among federal regulatory agencies. Although challenging to develop, a set of criteria would help ensure that the intent of the RFA and SBREFA requirements is understood and fairly implemented. Therefore, we retained the Matter for Congressional Consideration section in which we suggest that governmentwide criteria be established, and we stated that those criteria should specify whether the establishment of regulatory standards by a federal agency should be separated from their implementation requirements imposed by other entities for the purpose of the RFA and SBREFA.", "EPA officials also said that, if governmentwide criteria were to be developed, SBA should not be the agency designated to develop these criteria. They said that previous SBA interpretations of the RFA have differed from those of many other agencies, and in some instances, from the language of the statute. EPA officials also said that giving SBA the authority to interpret the RFA could bind the regulatory agencies to a single (and possibly incorrect) view of the statute\u2019s requirements. For example, both EPA and OSHA officials disagree with SBA\u2019s interpretation that a \u201csignificant economic impact\u201d could be either a positive or negative impact. EPA and OSHA officials said that the language in the statute as well as the great weight of its legislative history clearly indicate that the purpose of the RFA is to consider regulatory alternatives that would minimize negative impacts on affected small entities, and the officials do not consider positive or beneficial regulatory effects to constitute a \u201csignificant economic impact\u201d under the RFA. In response to these officials\u2019 comments, we indicated in the Matter for Congressional Consideration section that Congress could establish, or could require SBA or another entity to develop, governmentwide criteria defining the phrase \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and the House Committee on Small Business\u2019 Subcommittees on Government Programs and Oversight, and Regulatory Reform and Paperwork Reduction; the Director of OMB; the Secretary of Labor; and the Administrators of EPA and SBA.

In this draft rule, EPA plans to establish new emission standards for nonroad diesel engines that are used in equipment, such as tractors, and some marine applications. The draft rule includes a program that consists of stringent new emission standards, requirements to ensure that engines maintain their level of emission performance as they age, provisions allowing compliance flexibility to engine and equipment manufacturers, and a voluntary program to encourage the introduction of low-emitting engines.", "In a letter dated November 13, 1996, EPA\u2019s Small Business Advocacy Chair notified SBA\u2019s Chief Counsel for Advocacy that this draft rule might have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, thereby triggering the SBREFA advocacy review panel requirements. The Chair also provided the Chief Counsel with a suggested list of six small entity representatives to provide advice and recommendations to the panel. As required by SBREFA, the Chief Counsel responded within 15 days and agreed with EPA\u2019s suggested list of small entity representatives. Subsequently, EPA and SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy agreed to add five additional representatives to the panel process. The 11 representatives consisted of 1 small nonroad diesel engine manufacturer, 3 association representatives, 1 individual business representative of small nonroad equipment manufacturers, 4 representatives of small businesses that modify engines for marine use (\u201cmarinizers\u201d), and 2 association representatives of engine rebuilders or remanufacturers.", "In January 1997, EPA published and sought comments on a statement of principles in a Supplemental Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register. The statement of principles, which called for more stringent emission standards, had been signed earlier by EPA, the California Air Resources Board, and members of the nonroad diesel engine industry. EPA also held a workshop in Chicago, Illinois, during the comment period for this notice that devoted a significant amount of time to discussing equipment manufacturer regulatory flexibilities and small entity issues. The written comments received from the supplemental advance notice and suggestions received at EPA\u2019s workshop and other outreach efforts resulted in 10 concepts to make emission standards for nonroad diesel engines flexible and reduce the regulatory burden for small entities.", "In a letter dated March 25, 1997, the EPA Chair convened the review panel, which consisted of the Director of the Office of Regulatory Management and Information, EPA (Panel Chair); the Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, EPA; the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SBA; and the Administrator of OMB\u2019s OIRA.

The panel\u2019s final report stated that incorporating these five concepts into the notice of proposed rulemaking would allow EPA to meet the program\u2019s emission-reduction goals while maximizing the compliance flexibility for small manufacturers of nonroad equipment and small marinizers. These concepts addressed such issues as exemption and volume allowances, equity between engine size categories, engine program credits, and relief for hardship cases.", "In the preamble of its notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA said that it was (1) requesting additional information, comments, and suggestions on the number of small entities potentially affected by the rule and the potential overlap with OSHA\u2019s carbon monoxide limits; (2) taking steps to minimize recordkeeping and reporting; and (3) proposing or soliciting comments on the five regulatory alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Panel on Stormwater Phase II (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System)", "paragraphs": ["EPA began developing proposed revisions to its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations in 1992.
