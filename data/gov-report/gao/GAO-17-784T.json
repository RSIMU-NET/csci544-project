For example,", "qualified allocation plans (developed by 58 allocating agencies) that GAO analyzed did not always mention all selection criteria and preferences that Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code requires; and", "allocating agencies could increase (boost) the eligible basis used to determine allocation amounts for certain buildings if needed for financial feasibility. However, they were not required to document the justification for the increases.

IRS has not implemented the remaining three recommendations, including improving the data quality of its LIHTC database, clarifying guidance to agencies on reporting noncompliance, and evaluating how the information HUD collects could be used for identifying noncompliance issues. In addition, because of the limited oversight of LIHTC, in its 2015 report GAO asked that Congress consider designating certain oversight responsibilities to HUD because the agency has experience working with allocating agencies and has processes in place to oversee the agencies.

For  example, syndicators help initially connect investors and developers and  oversee acquisition of projects. Once a project is acquired, syndicators  perform ongoing monitoring and asset management to help ensure the  project complies with LIHTC requirements and is financially sound.  Syndicators attempt to identify potential problems and intercede if  necessary, such as replacing under- or nonperforming general partners,  and may use their own reserves to help resolve problems.

We found that nearly all the allocating agencies that we  reviewed used points or a threshold system for evaluating applicants.  They used criteria such as qualifications of the development team,  cost effectiveness, or leveraging of funds from other federal or state  programs.", "According to Section 42, allocating agencies must notify the chief  executive officer (or the equivalent) of the local jurisdiction in which  the project is to be located. However, some agencies imposed an  additional requirement of letters of support from local officials.  Specifically, as of 2013, we found that of the 58 agencies in our  review,12 agencies noted that their review or approval of applications  was contingent on letters of support, and another 10 agencies  awarded points for letters of local support. HUD officials have cited  fair housing concerns in relation to any preferences or requirements  for local approval or support because of the discriminatory influence  these factors could have on where affordable housing is built.

IRS  officials told us that Section 42 gives allocating agencies the discretion to  determine if projects receive a basis boost and does not require  documentation of financial feasibility.

However, during our 2016 review, we observed  a range of practices for awarding discretionary basis boosts, including a  blanket basis boost that could result in fewer projects being subsidized  and provide more credits than necessary for financial feasibility.

Specifically, IRS is working  to move the database to a new and updated server, which will address  weaknesses identified in data entry and programming controls.

We also concluded that  leveraging the experience and expertise of another agency with a housing  mission, such as HUD, might help offset some of IRS\u2019s limitations in  relation to program oversight. HUD\u2019s existing processes and procedures  for overseeing allocating agencies could constitute a framework on which  further changes and improvements in LIHTC could be effected. However,  enhancing HUD\u2019s role could involve additional staff and other resources.  An estimate of potential costs and funding options for financing enhanced  federal oversight of the LIHTC program would be integral to determining  an appropriate funding mechanism.", "We asked that Congress consider designating HUD as a joint  administrator of the program responsible for oversight. As part of the  deliberation, we suggested that Congress direct HUD to estimate the  costs to monitor and perform the additional oversight responsibilities,  including a discussion of funding options. Treasury agreed that it would  be useful for HUD to receive ongoing responsibility for, and resources to  perform, research and analysis on the effectiveness of LIHTCs in  increasing the availability of affordable rental housing. Treasury noted  that such research and analysis are not part of IRS\u2019s responsibilities or  consistent with its expertise in interpreting and enforcing tax laws.  However, Treasury stated that responsibility for interpreting and enforcing  the code should remain entirely with IRS. Our report noted that if program  administration were changed, IRS could retain certain key responsibilities  consistent with its tax administration mission.", "In our 2016 report, we concluded that IRS oversight of allocating  agencies continued to be minimal, particularly in reviewing QAPs and  allocating agencies\u2019 practices for awarding discretionary basis boosts. As  a result, we reiterated the recommendation from our 2015 report that  Congress should consider designating HUD as a joint administrator of the  program responsible for oversight due to its experience and expertise as  an agency with a housing mission.", "In response to our 2016 report, HUD stated it remains supportive of  mechanisms to use its significant expertise and experience administering  housing programs for enhanced effectiveness of LIHTC. HUD also stated  that enhanced interagency coordination could better ensure compliance  with fair housing requirements and improve alignment of LIHTC with  national housing priorities. As of July 2017, Congress had not enacted  legislation to give HUD an oversight role for LIHTC.", "Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
