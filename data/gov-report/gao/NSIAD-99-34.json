In discussing a draft of this report, DOD and service officials emphasized that variances should be expected in envisioned versus actual impacts in quick reaction responses such as the May 1995 list.

Although plant officials told us that they did not receive the full amounts they had requested in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, they did not know of funding differences attributable to changes in actual funds versus requested funds made by Congress. Funding data for the plant varied by reporting source. For example, Environmental Security office data attributed $2.7 million of the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1995 to the Badger plant, increasing to $6.5 million after the $300-million rescission. Army Environmental Center data initially attributed $17.2 million to the plant rather than $2.7 million, but showed a figure similar to Environmental Security\u2019s figure after the rescission ($6.5 million).", "At the times of our visits, Army, state, and contractor officials were working together to optimize results within available funds.
