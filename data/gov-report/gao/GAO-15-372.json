This report evaluates (1) differences in responsibilities among MACs and the costs associated with these responsibilities, including any changes since the implementation of contracting reform; (2) lessons learned, if any, since CMS implemented contracting reform that could be used to increase MAC efficiency and effectiveness; and (3) alternative contracting approaches that CMS could use to enhance contractor performance. To do this work, GAO reviewed the FAR and CMS documents\u2014including contracting documentation and MAC cost reports\u2014and interviewed officials from CMS and selected MACs. GAO also reviewed the FAR to identify alternative contracting approaches."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of February 2015, 16 Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) administered claims submitted by Medicare providers and suppliers. Twelve were A/B MACs that administered Medicare Part A and Part B claims for inpatient hospital care, outpatient physician and hospital services, and home health and hospice care, among other services, in specific jurisdictions. Four other MACs administered claims for durable medical equipment (DME).", "GAO found that the A/B and DME MACs are typically expected to carry out similar key responsibilities, a few of which\u2014including claims processing and customer service\u2014have accounted for most of their reported costs. Since the implementation of contracting reform, beginning in 2006, the key responsibilities included in MACs' statements of work have generally remained consistent, with limited exceptions. Further, while similar key responsibilities accounted for the majority of A/B MACs' and DME MACs' costs, there were some differences between A/B MACs and DME MACs in the shares of total costs that were accounted for by certain responsibilities. For example, the DME MACs spent a higher portion on appeals, on average, than did the A/B MACs.", "Officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the MACs that GAO interviewed have identified lessons learned since the implementation of contracting reform, and they have made improvements to increase operational efficiency and effectiveness. For example, MACs have developed Internet-based provider portals to reduce expenditures on telephone-based provider customer service. However, both CMS and MAC officials identified challenges for continued improvements in MAC efficiency and effectiveness, such as MACs' desire to protect their competitive advantage by not sharing certain innovations or operational improvements with other MACs.", "CMS selected a cost-plus-award-fee contract structure for the MACs when it initially implemented contracting reform. This is a type of cost-reimbursement contract that allows the agency to provide financial incentives for achieving specific performance goals. While CMS has made modifications to its cost-plus-award-fee structure for MAC contracts\u2014such as revising the performance metrics included in MACs' award fee plans and adjusting the distribution of award fees across the metrics to promote performance in areas where MACs have performed poorly in the past\u2014the agency has not formally revisited its MAC contracting approach since the implementation of contracting reform. Moreover, its assessment of alternative contracting approaches has been limited. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) states that changing circumstances may make different contracting approaches more appropriate later in the course of a series of contracts or a long-term contract than they were at the outset. Further, CMS indicated in its 2007 MAC acquisition strategy that once a baseline cost and level of effort had been established, the agency would reassess whether the cost-plus-award-fee contract structure was still appropriate for the MACs. There are a number of other contracting approaches that could be introduced within or in addition to the cost-reimbursement structure. Without formally assessing the potential benefits and risks of alternative contracting approaches, CMS may be missing opportunities to enhance MACs' efficiency and effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS conduct an analysis to determine whether alternative contracting approaches could be used to help promote improved contractor performance.

Since 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS)\u2014the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) that administers the Medicare program\u2014has used regional  contractors called Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) to process  claims for health care items and services submitted by 1.5 million enrolled  Medicare providers and suppliers. Among other things, MACs are  responsible for enrolling health care providers in the Medicare program,  processing and paying Medicare Part A and Part B fee-for-service claims,  and handling the first-level of appeals for denied claims. In fiscal year  2013, these contractors processed almost 1.2 billion fee-for-service  Medicare Part A and Part B claims, which totaled more than $363.3 billion  in payments for Medicare services. CMS paid approximately $1.3 billion  to the MACs for these services in fiscal year 2013.", "When the Medicare program was established, claims administration  contractors were not selected through a competitive process, and CMS\u2019s  authority to terminate these contracts was limited. Beginning in the 1980s, HHS asked Congress to amend CMS\u2019s authority to select  Medicare claims administration contractors, seeking reforms that would  promote competition, improve contractors\u2019 services to beneficiaries and  providers, achieve cost savings, and increase CMS\u2019s ability to reward  high-performing contractors. In 2003, Congress included contracting  reform provisions in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Among other things, the MMA requires  CMS to use competitive procedures to select MACs; offer them incentives  to provide quality service and promote efficiency; develop standards to  assess their performance; and comply with the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) except where inconsistent with specific MMA  provisions. If a MAC has met or exceeded performance requirements,  the MMA authorizes CMS to renew the contract from term to term without  the application of competitive procedures, so long as CMS periodically  recompetes MAC contracts. Under the MMA, CMS was required to  recompete MAC contracts at least once every 5 years, but the Medicare  Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015,  now requires that CMS recompete these contracts at least once every   10 years.", "In 2006, CMS started transitioning Medicare claims administration tasks  from the 51 legacy contractors to the MACs. To do this, CMS established multistate, defined geographic areas, called jurisdictions, where MACs  would serve Medicare providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries. As of March  2014, there were 12 jurisdictions in which MACs administered Part A and  Part B Medicare claims (these MACs are referred to as A/B MACs) and 4  jurisdictions in which MACs administered Medicare claims for durable  medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (referred to  as DME MACs).", "In March 2010, we reported on CMS\u2019s progress and challenges in  establishing the first MAC contracts, and we found that, while the agency  had taken steps to facilitate the complex implementation of contracting  reform, the sample of MACs we reviewed did not meet all of CMS\u2019s  performance requirements at that time. We also found that CMS did not  track total costs and savings associated with the implementation of  Medicare contracting reform. Inspector General issued a report assessing the extent to which MACs  had met CMS\u2019s performance standards and evaluating CMS\u2019s monitoring  of the MACs\u2019 performance. The Office of Inspector General report  examined MACs\u2019 performance between September 2008 and August  2011 and found that MACs included in the review did not meet one- quarter of CMS\u2019s quality assurance standards, that CMS did not always  require corrective action plans for unmet standards, and that unmet  standards without corrective action plans were more likely to remain  unresolved. The Office of Inspector General also found that, while CMS  performed extensive reviews of MACs\u2019 performance, the agency had not  always completed these reviews in a timely manner.", "GAO, Medicare Contracting Reform: Agency Has Made Progress with Implementation,  but Contractors Have Not Met All Performance Standards, GAO-10-71 (Washington, D.C.:  Mar. 25, 2010). associated with these responsibilities, including any changes since the  implementation of contracting reform; (2) lessons learned, if any, since  CMS implemented contracting reform that could be used to increase MAC  efficiency and effectiveness; and (3) alternative contracting approaches  that CMS could consider to enhance contractor performance.", "To examine differences in responsibilities among MACs and the costs  associated with these responsibilities, including any changes since the  implementation of contracting reform, we compared contract documents,  including MACs\u2019 statements of work, and interviewed CMS officials about  changes to the scope of MACs\u2019 responsibilities since 2006, the year the  first MAC became operational. Additionally, we obtained information  from CMS on MACs\u2019 coordination with other Medicare contractors\u2014such  as Recovery Auditors\u2014to determine whether responsibilities have shifted  to or from MACs or whether MACs have experienced increased  workloads as a result of coordination with other contractors. We  obtained cost reports from CMS for 9 of the 12 A/B MACs and all four of  the DME MACs for which full contract year data were available during the  period of our review. The data we obtained were for costs reported by  each MAC during the most recent full contract year for which data were  available as of April 2014. The cost reports we obtained detailed the  amounts each MAC spent by key responsibility area, such as claims  processing, provider enrollment, and medical review. We analyzed these  reports to calculate the average amounts spent by the 9 A/B MACs and  by the 4 DME MACs on each responsibility area and the average  percentages of MACs\u2019 total costs that were accounted for by each  responsibility area. To assess the reliability of CMS\u2019s data on MACs\u2019  reported costs, we manually reviewed the cost reports for obvious errors  or missing data and interviewed knowledgeable CMS officials. We found  these data to be sufficiently reliable for examining differences in the costs  associated with MACs\u2019 key responsibilities. We calculated the average  amounts spent by the A/B MACs and by the DME MACs\u2014rather than  comparing the MACs\u2019 actual costs\u2014to account for any differences in  responsibilities among the MACs and differences in the dates on which  the MACs reported the costs we analyzed.", "To examine lessons learned that could be used to increase MAC  efficiency and effectiveness, we reviewed CMS documents and  interviewed CMS officials regarding experiences since the implementation  of contracting reform. Additionally, we interviewed officials from four  MACs that hold contracts for 7 of the 12 A/B MAC jurisdictions and one of  the four DME MAC jurisdictions. Collectively, the four MACs we  interviewed are responsible for about 58 percent of the estimated A/B  MAC claims volume and about 20 percent of the estimated DME MAC  claims volume. In these interviews, we discussed lessons the MACs have  learned since the implementation of Medicare contracting reform and  improvements they have implemented that have helped them operate  more efficiently and effectively. We also discussed the extent to which  CMS solicits ideas from the MACs about these operational efficiencies.", "To examine alternative contracting approaches that CMS could consider  to enhance contractor performance, we reviewed CMS documents,  including the agency\u2019s 2007 MAC acquisition strategy and contract  justification documents. We also reviewed recent award fee plans for  MACs that were operational at the time we requested these documents,  in February 2014. We then examined alternative contracting approaches  that are available under the FAR and analyzed the potential benefits and  risks of each alternative in regard to whether it could enhance MAC  performance.

Since the initial implementation of contracting reform, CMS has  consolidated some of the A/B MAC jurisdictions so that, as of February  2015, there were 12 A/B MAC jurisdictions. (See apps.

Because of uncertainty about the amount of  costs MACs would likely incur during the initial implementation of the  MAC contracts, CMS opted to structure the MAC contracts as a cost-plus- award-fee contract, which is a type of cost-reimbursement contract that  allows an agency to provide financial incentives to contractors if they  achieve specific performance goals. In its 2007 MAC acquisition  strategy, CMS stated that fixed-price contracts for MACs would be difficult  to administer because little was known about the expected costs of these  contracts in light of the concurrent implementation of several other new  Medicare initiatives, such as the Part D prescription drug benefit and  Medicare Advantage plans, among other things. Agency officials also  said that they believed a cost-plus-award-fee contract structure would  allow CMS to stress the importance of quality performance over the  course of the contracts and would accommodate frequent changes in  MACs\u2019 workloads or responsibilities that CMS anticipated handling over  the course of the contracts. CMS decided to structure each MAC contract  with a 1-year base performance period and four optional 1-year  performance periods.", "Under the cost-plus-award-fee contract, MACs receive a base fee, which  is fixed at the inception of the contract, plus reimbursement for allowable  costs. The MACs also may earn an incentive, known as an award fee,  based on their performance on standards that are defined by CMS in  advance of each 1-year performance period. During the procurement  process, MAC offerors propose to CMS the amounts of the base fees and  award fees they would like to be eligible to earn over the course of their  contracts, which are subject to negotiation to arrive at the final base and  award fee amounts with successful offerors. For the MACs that were in  operation as of January 2014, base fees represented about 1 to 3 percent  of the MACs\u2019 total contract values, while the award fees that the MACs  were eligible to earn represented about 1 to 5 percent of the total contract  values. Over the course of MAC contracts, prior to the start date for  each 1-year performance period, CMS can revise the metrics included in  MACs\u2019 award fee plans and adjust the distribution of award fees across  the metrics to promote performance in high-priority areas and to  emphasize areas where MACs may be able to influence a positive  programmatic outcome.", "For the 12 A/B MACs that were in operation as of January 2014, the total  estimated value for the 5-year contract period\u2014if all option years are  exercised\u2014is over $5.2 billion, with the total estimated contract values  ranging from about $326 million to $609 million per A/B MAC.

Under their statements of  work, each MAC is responsible for developing a quality control plan,  which must be submitted to CMS within 45 days after the contract is  awarded and updated annually thereafter, when the contract is  renewed for additional option years. CMS reviews the MACs\u2019 quality  control plans and approves them after ensuring that they include all  required elements.

Consistent with the FAR, CMS develops a quality  assurance surveillance plan to outline performance standards that all  MACs are expected to meet, in accordance with their statements of  work. At the end of each contract year, CMS assesses each MAC\u2019s  performance on the set of surveillance plan standards that CMS has  established for each of 11 different business function areas. For  example, one business function area is provider customer service,  and two of the quality assurance surveillance plan standards for that  area relate to the timeliness of the MAC\u2019s responses to telephone and  written inquiries from providers. After CMS completes its annual  surveillance plan review for each MAC, the MACs have an opportunity  to dispute CMS\u2019s assessment or provide more information that may  result in a change to the MAC\u2019s performance score.

Using information aggregated from all of these sources, CMS rates  the MACs in areas such as quality, schedule, cost control, business  relations, and personnel management. The Contractor Performance  Assessment Reporting System stores these reports electronically and  makes them available for other federal agencies to review in the event  that an entity holding a MAC contract later competes for other federal  contracts.", "The base year of each MAC contract is comprised of an implementation period and an  operational period of performance, each of which requires a separate Contractor  Performance Assessment Reporting System report, but these two reports are completed  only after the end of the base year of the contract.", "Assessing MACs\u2019 performance on metrics included in their  award fee plans. Award fees are the key performance incentive  included in the type of cost-reimbursement contract CMS selected for  the MACs under the FAR. Award fee plans include fewer performance  standards than the quality assurance surveillance plan and are  intended to (among other things) reward MACs for being innovative,  cost-effective, and collaborative for the overall benefit of the Medicare  program. CMS develops the award fee plan and, at the end of each  contract year, reviews MACs\u2019 performance on the standards included  in the plan, to determine whether each MAC is eligible to earn some,  all, or none of its available award fee pool. CMS assigns a certain  percentage of the award fee to each of the performance standards  included in the plan. To be eligible to earn any percentage of the  award fee, the MAC must achieve at least a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating in  each performance element under its most recent Contractor  Performance Assessment Reporting System evaluation, signifying  that it has substantially met all cost, schedule, and technical  performance requirements of its contract. Further, the MAC must  meet all or almost all of the significant criteria included in its award   fee plan. MACs that perform at this level are eligible to earn up to   50 percent of their award fees. Only MACs that exceed all or almost  all of the significant award fee criteria while also substantially meeting  all cost, schedule, and technical performance requirements of their  contracts are eligible to earn up to 100 percent of their award fees and  an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating for the award fee. MACs generally have not  earned all of the award fees for which they have been eligible.

In addition, MACs are responsible for  conducting medical reviews of claims to determine whether the claims are  for services covered by the Medicare program and whether the services  were medically necessary. MACs also handle first-level appeals, or  requests for redeterminations for any claims that were initially denied.  Further, the MACs are responsible for maintaining a Medicare provider  customer service program, which has three main components: a provider  outreach and education program, a contact center to handle provider  inquiries, and self-service technology for providers to access Medicare  information at any time.

One exception is  that there are slight differences between the responsibilities of the A/B  MACs and those of the DME MACs. For example, DME MACs are not  responsible for enrolling medical equipment suppliers in the Medicare  program, whereas the A/B MACs have the responsibility of enrolling  providers and suppliers. Enrollment of medical equipment suppliers is  handled centrally by the National Supplier Clearinghouse contractor.", "Another exception is that the MACs can have different jurisdiction-specific  responsibilities. For instance, some MACs serve jurisdictions in which  Medicare Strike Force teams are located. The Medicare Strike Force  teams investigate and prosecute potential fraud in specific locations with  a high historic level of program fraud. The MACs provide additional  support, perform special analyses, and carry out follow-up actions for  certain providers as requested by the Strike Force teams. Additionally,  certain MACs have had jurisdiction-specific responsibilities related to  Medicare demonstration projects regarding specific types of providers,  such as rural community hospitals, or for specific activities or services,  including enrollment of providers that offer home health services.", "Although MACs\u2019 responsibilities are generally similar across each of the  contracts, CMS officials told us that the MACs often have different  workloads for certain responsibilities, based on factors such as the  provider mixes in their jurisdictions. For example, some MAC jurisdictions  have a large number of long-term care hospitals. Since these types of  hospitals may receive higher payments for the services they provide than  other types of hospital providers, the MACs must review information  about the long-term care hospitals they serve to ensure that hospitals  qualify for the higher payments. As a result, these MACs may spend more  time and resources than MACs with fewer long-term care hospitals would  spend fulfilling contract requirements associated with processing claims  from long-term care hospitals.", "CMS officials also told us that the responsibilities of the MACs have  generally remained the same since the implementation of contracting  reform, although legislative changes have affected some of the MACs\u2019  workloads for certain responsibilities. One such change was the creation  of the nationwide Recovery Auditor Program by the Tax Relief and Health  Care Act of 2006, which changed how Medicare claims are reviewed after  they have been paid to identify any improper payments. Prior to the  implementation of the nationwide recovery auditor program in 2010, the  MACs were responsible for conducting post-payment reviews to recover  improper payments, but the Recovery Auditors now conduct the bulk of  these reviews. If the Recovery Auditor finds overpayments of certain  claims, the MACs recover those overpayments from the providers.  Although the MACs are conducting fewer postpayment reviews than they  originally did, CMS officials told us that the MACs\u2019 workload for recovering  overpayments identified by the Recovery Auditors\u2019 reviews has  increased.(PPACA) required the revalidation of providers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 eligibility to  participate in the Medicare program.

The MACs now send physicians  to administrative law judge hearings to represent the MAC and explain  why it denied payment for claims that are the subject of the hearings.  More of the MACs\u2019 initial determinations are being upheld, which  results in savings of Medicare dollars, the MAC said.", "CMS officials said that the agency includes in its MAC performance  reviews an assessment of whether the MAC has generated ideas or  process improvements that add value to the government. These ideas  and innovations are documented in the Contractor Performance  Assessment Reporting System, which may contribute to a favorable past  performance evaluation for the MAC when its contract is recompeted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS and the MACs Have Identified Some Challenges for Continued Improvements in MAC Efficiency and Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["While they have made various changes since the implementation of  contracting reform, officials we interviewed from both CMS and the MACs  described some challenges created by the structure of the MAC contracts  that may constrain continued improvements in MAC efficiency and  effectiveness. One challenge CMS officials identified was the 5-year limit  on MAC contract terms, which they said constrained their ability to  respond to issues with MACs\u2019 performance. These officials stated that  they were reluctant to decide not to exercise an option year for a MAC  based on performance issues. According to the officials, it was impractical  to award a new contract within the 5-year contract terms permitted by the  MMA because it takes approximately 18 to 24 months to solicit, award,  and implement a new MAC contract. The officials said they would be  more likely to consider replacing MACs midcontract if the contracts lasted  longer than 5 years. To illustrate this, CMS officials told us that they had  issued only one written notification to a MAC, advising that the agency  might not exercise a contract option year\u2014unless the contractor improved  its performance\u2014since the implementation of contracting reform.  According to the CMS officials, the MAC ultimately improved its  performance after receiving the notice, but CMS\u2019s decision to continue  the contract was also partially influenced by the agency\u2019s conclusion that  the potential benefit of replacing the MAC before the end of its contract  term was outweighed by the risks and costs that would be associated with  recompeting the contract sooner than planned.", "In addition, the CMS officials we interviewed stated that a potential benefit  of increasing the time between MAC contract competitions could be that  CMS and the MACs would have more time to develop innovations and  that the MACs would have more time to implement them to yield  performance improvements. The MAC officials we interviewed echoed  these sentiments. The officials we interviewed from CMS and the MACs  said they would support a legislative change to increase the maximum  time between MAC contract competitions from 5 years to 10 years. In its  January 2014 report, the HHS Office of Inspector General recommended  that CMS seek legislation increasing the limit on MAC contract duration.  The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted in  April 2015, increased the maximum time between MAC contract  competitions to 10 years.", "According to the MAC officials we interviewed, the competitive nature of  the MAC contracting environment has made MACs reluctant to share  certain innovations or operational improvements with other MACs. The  MAC officials said that they must balance CMS\u2019s desire for them to share  innovations with other MACs with trying to protect any competitive  advantages they have in the contracting environment. From the  perspective of officials from two of these MACs, collaboration and sharing  of ideas was more widespread among the legacy contractors, which were  not selected through competitive processes. After the initial transition  from the legacy contractors to MACs, officials from one MAC said that  there was a period of time when MACs may have overvalued a particular  improvement or innovation as being proprietary or a competitive  advantage and been reluctant to share ideas with other MACs. In the  view of this contractor, MACs have since become more willing to share  ideas that are retrospective and aimed at fixing past problems. However,  they still want to protect true innovations, which are ideas that address  problems more prospectively and aim to find better ways of fulfilling their  contract requirements.", "CMS officials also described their recent decision to delay for 5 years the  planned consolidation of two pairs of A/B MAC jurisdictions, based on  their experiences with the recent consolidation of three other pairs of A/B  MAC jurisdictions. In 2010, CMS announced that it planned to consolidate  the 15 original A/B MAC jurisdictions to 10 jurisdictions before 2017.  Consolidations had been implemented in three pairs of A/B MAC  jurisdictions by February 2014, but CMS decided in March 2014 that it  would delay for 5 years the consolidation of the two remaining pairs of  MAC jurisdictions. The agency gave several reasons for this decision.  First, CMS officials found that operational cost reductions associated with  the first three consolidations were smaller than expected, and they were  concerned that merging the remaining two pairs of A/B MAC jurisdictions  could affect contractor performance negatively in key areas, including  provider customer service. CMS was also concerned about the  heightened complexity of the final two MAC jurisdiction consolidations  because some of the affected jurisdictions were responsible for home  health and hospice workloads. Finally, CMS was concerned about the  business landscape that has evolved since the implementation of  contracting reform. According to the CMS officials we interviewed, MACs  conduct highly specialized work and, in the view of the officials, few other  potential contractors would be capable of performing such specialized  work successfully. The agency has already limited the share of the A/B  MAC workload that can be serviced by a single contractor or affiliated  contractors.almost the maximum workload CMS has specified that a single contractor  can hold, CMS was concerned that further A/B MAC workload  consolidations and reductions in the number of MAC marketplace  participants could constrain CMS\u2019s ability to respond to other challenges  that might arise."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Informally Considered Some Alternative Contracting Approaches but Could Do More to Assess Whether They Could Enhance MAC Performance", "paragraphs": ["While CMS has made modifications to its cost-plus-award-fee structure  for MAC contracts\u2014such as revising the metrics included in MACs\u2019 award  fee plans and adjusting the distribution of award fees across the metrics  to promote performance in high-priority areas and areas where MACs  have performed poorly in the past\u2014the agency has not formally revisited  its MAC contracting approach since the implementation of contracting  reform. According to the FAR, changing circumstances may make certain  contracting approaches more appropriate later in the course of a series of  contracts or a long-term contract than they were at the outset. Moreover,  CMS indicated in its 2007 acquisition strategy that once a baseline cost  and level of effort had been established, the agency would reassess  whether the cost-plus-award-fee contract structure was still appropriate  for the MACs. However, CMS\u2019s assessment of alternative contracting  approaches since the implementation of contracting reform has been  limited.", "In recent contract justification documents, CMS has indicated why a firm  fixed-price contract structure remains an unsuitable approach for MAC  contracts and included a limited discussion of why the use of incentive  fees\u2014a type of fee available under the cost-reimbursement contract  structure\u2014would not be appropriate for MACs.justification documents fulfill CMS\u2019s responsibility under the FAR to  document the circumstances, facts, and reasoning behind taking  individual contract actions (such as entering into a contract in a given   These contract  MAC jurisdiction). In addition, the FAR also requires agencies to perform  acquisition planning and, where a written evaluation plan is required, to  review their acquisition plans and revise them as appropriate at key dates  specified in the plan or whenever significant changes occur, but at least  annually. While CMS\u2019s decision to continue using the cost-reimbursement  contract structure for the MAC contracts may be appropriate, there are a  number of other contracting approaches that could be introduced within or  in addition to the cost-reimbursement structure. CMS officials have  discussed some of them internally but not documented any formal  assessments of the alternatives by revising CMS\u2019s 2007 MAC acquisition  strategy. A comparative evaluation of the possible costs and benefits of  alternative contracting approaches would provide a more evidence-based  rationale for CMS\u2019s chosen approach for the MAC contracts. Without  formally assessing the potential benefits and risks of alternative  contracting approaches, CMS lacks assurance that the current contract  structure is the optimal method for incentivizing MACs\u2019 performance, and  CMS may be missing opportunities to enhance MACs\u2019 efficiency and  effectiveness.", "Following are four examples of potential alternative contracting  approaches which may be permissible under the FAR, if properly  documented and approved, along with some of the potential risks and  benefits that CMS could consider. While some of these approaches are  not explicitly mentioned in the FAR, they are also not prohibited. The FAR  allows agencies to develop and test new acquisition methods, provided  they are not explicitly precluded by federal law, executive order, or  regulation.", "Using award terms. One type of incentive available to CMS is the  award term. Unlike the contract option years that exist under CMS\u2019s  current MAC contracting approach, which CMS can exercise at its  discretion once it has complied with the FAR requirements for  exercising an option, award terms would incentivize MACs\u2019  performance by automatically extending their contracts, as long as  they met preestablished performance requirements.", "CMS officials told us that, while they had not documented an  assessment of this alternative, they had discussed it internally and  concluded that the statutory 5-year limit on MAC contract terms  limited the potential of the award-term approach to serve as a greater  motivator to MACs\u2019 performance than the option years that are  available under the existing cost-plus-award-term contract structure.  We agreed that award terms may be a greater performance motivator  if MAC contracts lasted longer than 5 years; however, there was  nothing that would have precluded CMS from adopting the award- term approach within the 5-year terms for MAC contracts. For  example, CMS could have restructured MAC contracts so that years  two and three would be option years, and years four and five would be  award-term years. CMS had not formally analyzed the potential risks  and benefits of the award-term approach in the context of the 5-year  contract term or compared these to the current option year approach.  Given the recent legislative change that will permit MAC contracts to  last up to 10 years, the award term approach may have more potential  than CMS previously thought. Among the factors that CMS could  consider would be whether this incentive could increase or decrease  CMS\u2019s administrative costs associated with monitoring MACs\u2019  performance over the course of their contracts and the extent to which  the agency may need to revise its performance metrics or thresholds,  if at all, in order to accommodate the implementation of award terms.", "Implementing negative performance incentives. Under the FAR,  agencies can also establish cost-reimbursement contracts with  negative performance incentives. For example, under this type of  contract, CMS theoretically could deduct from MACs\u2019 base fees if they  failed to meet certain performance thresholds. Alternatively, CMS  could include nonmonetary negative incentives in MAC contracts,  such as reducing the length of the contract if the MAC failed to meet  established performance thresholds. For example, the contract could  provide that, if a MAC\u2019s performance fell below a certain level, CMS  could reduce the length of the last option year of the contract by   3 months. For even lower levels of performance, CMS could impose  reductions of 6 months, 9 months, or 1 year.", "The CMS officials we interviewed had not documented an  assessment of whether monetary or nonmonetary negative incentives  for poor performance would be appropriate for MAC contracts.  However, they said that they had discussed it internally and  concluded that the targets for existing MAC performance metrics are  too high to accommodate negative performance incentives. For  example, the CMS officials said that, while other federal contracts  may require contractors to meet a certain requirement 80 percent of  the time, MACs are required to meet many of their requirements 95 to   100 percent of the time.", "Transitioning certain elements within the MAC contracts to a  fixed-price structure. In 2007, CMS documented its rationale for  using a cost-reimbursement contract structure for the MAC contracts.  However, while maintaining the overall cost-reimbursement contract  structure, CMS could use a fixed-price contract structure for separate  contract components; that is, CMS could set a firm price separately  for certain contract responsibilities. In that case, the MACs would only  be paid according to the fixed price for each contract component that  was set at the beginning of the contract.", "In its 2007 acquisition strategy and more recent contract justification  documents, CMS concluded that it would be too difficult to predict at  the outset of each contract the workloads and specific costs that could  be incurred for each of the MACs\u2019 responsibilities. That is, CMS has  stated that the fixed-price contract structure is not appropriate  because legislative changes in Medicare coverage and payment  policy, as well as other factors outside CMS\u2019s and the MACs\u2019 control,  could cause the agency to make near-constant technical changes to  MACs\u2019 contracts over the course of each contract term.", "CMS officials we interviewed said they had engaged in some internal  discussions about whether there were any elements within MACs\u2019  contracts that could be transitioned from a cost-reimbursement to a  fixed-price contract structure, but they had not formally analyzed the  feasibility of doing so or which contract responsibilities have the  potential to be appropriate for a fixed-price contract structure. Given  that CMS has been collecting MAC cost reports for more than 8 years,  the agency has the data it would need to analyze the potential  benefits or risks of transitioning certain MAC responsibilities to a fixed- price structure. For example, while it may not be appropriate to  transition the responsibilities of provider enrollment or medical review  to a fixed-price structure\u2014because of the unpredictability of future  workloads MACs could incur for these particular responsibilities\u2014 CMS could evaluate whether it would be appropriate to transition  certain other MAC requirements\u2014such as certain claims processing  production activities\u2014to a fixed-price approach.", "Transitioning certain elements of the MAC contracts to an  incentive fee structure. Another contracting approach available to  CMS is the incentive fee. Under this arrangement, CMS would  establish target costs that it would expect each MAC to incur for each  contract responsibility. Using an agreed-upon formula that CMS would  negotiate with each MAC, if the total costs reported by the contractor  were less than the target costs, the contractor would earn a total fee  that is greater than the target fee. If the total costs were greater than  the target costs, the MAC would earn a total fee that is less than the  target fee. For example, each MAC is required to have a Provider  Customer Service Program to educate providers on Medicare  requirements and respond to their inquiries. Using historical cost data,  CMS could establish a target cost for these programs and incentivize  the MACs to reduce costs in this area through techniques such as  encouraging providers to use self-service information portals rather  than seeking information through written inquiries.", "CMS officials told us that they initially decided against using the cost- plus-incentive-fee contract structure for MACs because they believed  that changing Medicare requirements precluded the establishment of  specific cost, schedule, or performance targets from the outset of  contracting reform, and CMS\u2019s recent contract justification documents  continue to reflect that belief. There is no indication, however, that  CMS has engaged in an analysis that might help identify whether  there are certain MAC responsibilities for which the cost-plus- incentive-fee approach might be feasible, without transitioning to this  approach for all MAC contract responsibilities. Now that CMS has  more experience with MAC contracts and has more data on past  costs and performance for MACs\u2019 key responsibilities, CMS may be  able to identify selected responsibilities that could be transitioned to  an incentive fee structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["CMS has accumulated a considerable amount of data on MACs\u2019 reported  costs and performance under the cost-plus-award-fee contract structure  the agency established when the first MACs became operational 8 years  ago.
