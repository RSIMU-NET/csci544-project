However, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. Doing so would help IRS clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits. Further, while IRS regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications, it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence channels, including mechanisms to collect reliable, useful data to monitor authentication outcomes. As a result, IRS may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system.", "IRS can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters. While IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) new guidance for secure digital authentication, it does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement it by June 2018, as required by the Office of Management and Budget. As a result, IRS may not be positioned to address its most vulnerable authentication areas in a timely manner. Further, IRS lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies. Industry representatives, financial institutions, and government officials told GAO that the best authentication approach relies on multiple strategies and sources of information, while giving taxpayers options for actively protecting their identity. Evaluating alternatives for taxpayer authentication will help IRS avoid missing opportunities for improving authentication."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 11 recommendations to IRS to estimate resources for and prioritize its authentication initiatives, address internal control issues to better monitor authentication, develop a plan to fully implement new NIST guidance, and develop a process to evaluate potential authentication technologies.

IRS also uses authentication to  verify a person\u2019s identity before allowing access to a resource, such as an  information technology (IT) system.", "The risk of fraud has increased as more personally identifiable  information (PII) has become readily available as a result of, for example,  large-scale cyberattacks on entities including IRS, the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), and, recently, Equifax. In May 2015, IRS  temporarily suspended its Get Transcript service after fraudsters used  personal information obtained from sources outside IRS to pose as  legitimate taxpayers and access tax return information from up to 724,000  accounts. In June and July 2015, OPM announced two data breaches  affecting approximately 22.1 million current or former federal employees  and contractors and their family members. Among the data stolen were  Social Security numbers (SSN) and financial and personal health  information. In September 2017, Equifax announced that criminals had exploited a vulnerability in its systems and obtained PII on 145.5 million  individuals including names, SSNs, birth dates, addresses, and in some  cases, driver\u2019s license information. In March 2018, Equifax announced,  after further investigation, that criminals stole partial driver\u2019s license  information for an additional 2.4 million individuals. The proliferation of  stolen PII poses a threat to the tax system by making it difficult for IRS to  distinguish legitimate taxpayers from fraudsters. This threat is particularly  acute during the filing season when IRS and taxpayers interact the most.", "IRS estimates that at least $12.2 billion in identity theft (IDT) tax refund  fraud was attempted in calendar year 2016, and that it prevented the theft  of at least $10.5 billion of that amount. However, IRS reports that at least  $1.6 billion was paid out to fraudsters. IRS\u2019s ability to continuously  monitor and improve its approach to taxpayer authentication is a critical  step in defending the agency against evolving cyber threats and fraud  schemes and in protecting billions of taxpayer dollars. To further address  IDT refund fraud, IRS held a Security Summit in March 2015 with state  tax administrators and industry partners, including tax preparation and  software firms and financial institutions. This ongoing effort is intended to  improve information sharing and collaboratively address critical issues,  including authentication and fraud detection.", "Within this context, you asked us to examine IRS\u2019s efforts to authenticate  taxpayers.

In this report, we refer to both steps  collectively as \u201cauthentication.\u201d", "For high-risk interactions, such as access to prior year tax information,  authentication can help IRS avoid improperly disclosing PII or issuing a  fraudulent refund. Authentication is particularly important for combatting  IDT refund fraud, which occurs when a fraudster obtains an individual\u2019s  SSN, date of birth, or other PII and uses it to file a fraudulent tax return  seeking a refund. IDT refund fraud can also affect businesses.  Specifically, fraudsters can use business information to file a fraudulent  corporate return requesting a refund. According to IRS officials, fraudsters  can file false employer Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statements (W-2) to  support fraudulent individual returns seeking refunds. We have previously  reported that when IRS suspects that a tax return is fraudulent, it will stop  the return from further processing, and attempt to notify and authenticate  the taxpayer before issuing the refund.", "Authentication can be accomplished using different methods depending  on the risk of the interaction.", "Single-factor authentication: Useful when someone wants to  access a low-risk system or service, this method may require only a  user name and password.", "Multi-factor authentication: For high-risk interactions such as  access to systems that include PII or financial information, this  method requires at least two of the following: \u201csomething you know\u201d  (e.g., a user name and password); \u201csomething you have\u201d (e.g., a  mobile phone or cryptographic key); or \u201csomething you are\u201d (e.g., a  fingerprint or other biometric data).", "Designing authentication programs involves a balancing act\u2014IRS needs  to prevent fraudsters from passing authentication using stolen taxpayer  information, but it must balance that against the burden on legitimate  taxpayers who must also authenticate. If IRS makes the authentication  process too stringent, legitimate taxpayers may not be able to  successfully authenticate to, for example, access their prior year tax  information or have IRS release a frozen refund. Conversely, if the  process is too easy, fraudsters will likely be able to authenticate as easily  as legitimate taxpayers.", "Industry representatives told us that identity proofing and authentication  are becoming more difficult with the wide availability of PII. Further,  according to NIST, it is challenging for organizations to authenticate users  remotely via a web application because the processes and technologies  to establish and use digital identities offer multiple opportunities for  impersonation or other attacks. These interactions may become even  more difficult and risky for organizations like IRS, who may interact with a  taxpayer only once a year.", "As shown by the data breaches discussed at the beginning of this report,  fraudsters are persistent in their efforts to exploit weaknesses in online  systems and, in the context of IRS, access sensitive taxpayer information.  For example, IRS reported that, between January and March 2017,  fraudsters were able to use PII to access information from 100,000  taxpayer accounts through IRS\u2019s Data Retrieval Tool. According to the  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, identity thieves may  have used PII obtained outside the tax system to start the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application process and  access tax information through the Data Retrieval Tool. Further, we have  previously reported that fraudsters can use PII obtained in a data breach  to more easily create fraudulent returns that resemble authentic tax  returns, making it more difficult for IRS to detect potential fraud.", "Even as IRS has adapted its IDT defenses, fraudsters have developed  more complex and sophisticated methods to bypass those defenses and  commit fraud undetected.

According to industry representatives, as these entities improve security  in one area prone to fraud, fraudsters\u2019 methods evolve to target a weaker  area. For example, in March 2016, IRS alerted payroll and human  resource professionals of a phishing e-mail scheme in which fraudsters  posed as company executives and requested personal information on  employees via e-mail, including W-2s. With this information, fraudsters  can imitate the legitimate taxpayer and file fraudulent tax returns seeking  refunds. In January 2018, IRS reported that the agency received about  100 reports of W-2 phishing schemes in 2016 and about 900 reports in  2017.

The interactions range in risk level  and IRS categorized them based on the potential for incorrect payment of  refunds, disclosure of taxpayer information, and critical impacts on IRS  operations. High-risk interactions include when an individual taxpayer  establishes an online account with IRS, which provides access to prior  year tax information and other PII, or when a taxpayer is asked to confirm  his identify before IRS processes what the agency considers to be a  potentially fraudulent tax return. Lower-risk interactions include paying a  tax bill online. According to IRS, as the risk level of taxpayer interactions  increases\u2014for example, interactions that involve sensitive financial  information\u2014the authentication process becomes more rigorous.

IRS performs authentication through  the following channels.", "Telephone. Taxpayers can authenticate via telephone with a customer  service representative (CSR) for selected higher-risk interactions with  IRS, such as in cases of suspected IDT refund fraud. Telephone  authentication can require taxpayers to respond to knowledge-based  questions that a fraudster would not likely know. For example, for high- risk interactions, taxpayers must answer additional tax return-related  questions. Taxpayers who fail to respond correctly to these questions are  then required to authenticate in person at a Taxpayer Assistance Center.  For certain lower-risk interactions, taxpayers can authenticate through an  automated telephone system.", "In-person. For some interactions with IRS, taxpayers can authenticate  their identity directly with an IRS employee at 1 of IRS\u2019s approximately  400 Taxpayer Assistance Centers located throughout the country.  Taxpayers may need to present one or more government-issued forms of  identification and other documents, such as a utility statement, depending  on the level of authentication required for the specific interaction.", "Online. IRS authenticates taxpayers online for both high-risk and lower- risk interactions. For high-risk interactions such as requesting a tax  transcript or looking up an Identity Protection Personal Identification  Number (IP PIN), taxpayers must pass a multi-factor authentication  process using IRS\u2019s Secure Access platform. IRS launched Secure  Access in June 2016 following the Get Transcript data breach and, as of  April 2018, was using it for 11 applications including authentication for  Get Transcript, IP PIN, and the online account. Officials told us they plan  to implement Secure Access for other IRS applications in 2018.  Taxpayers authenticating through Secure Access establish an account by  providing IRS with a valid e-mail address, basic personal information, and  personal financial information. Taxpayers then provide IRS a mobile  phone number and IRS sends the phone an activation code that the  taxpayer enters online. This step validates that the taxpayer possesses  the mobile phone. IRS authenticates returning users via a security code.  For lower-risk interactions, taxpayers may authenticate online by  answering several knowledge-based questions, such as questions about  their current return to learn the status of their refund.", "Correspondence. In some cases, taxpayers can submit documents or  request tax information via correspondence, which are then reviewed by  IRS and authenticated by matching against information in IRS\u2019s systems.  This method can require that IRS send the requested documents (such  as a tax transcript) only to the taxpayer\u2019s address of record, or require the  taxpayer to include a photocopy of identification. For example, in some  instances, taxpayers who cannot authenticate via telephone and cannot  travel to a Taxpayer Assistance Center in person may be able to  authenticate by mail.", "Each authentication channel requires different IRS resources. These  resources include IRS staff and overhead; contracts with vendors that  provide identity verification services; and costs inherent to the specific  channel, such as mailing costs. Figure 1 summarizes IRS\u2019s authentication  channels and illustrates a number of the interactions that taxpayers or tax  professionals can accomplish through one, or several, channels. It also  illustrates the differences in costs per transaction. According to IRS data,  in-person authentication at a Taxpayer Assistance Center is the most  expensive way to authenticate taxpayers (about $89 per interaction),  followed by telephone (about $54 per interaction). Online authentication  costs the least, at less than $1 per interaction.

IRS sends a letter notifying taxpayers that they must  authenticate their identity before IRS will process the return or issue a  refund. According to IRS, in fiscal year 2017, more than 1.9 million  taxpayers received such a notification, and IRS authenticated about  1.17 million of them. These taxpayers could verify their identity via  telephone, in-person, and correspondence. In August 2016, IRS  suspended its TPP online authentication service because of potential  system security weaknesses. In mid-March 2018, IRS relaunched the  first phase of a more secure TPP online authentication service, which  is discussed later in this report.", "Get Transcript.

As discussed earlier, IRS\u2019s 2016 Roadmap  is the agency\u2019s plan for developing a modern and secure authentication  environment for all taxpayers regardless of how they interact with IRS.  The Roadmap outlines six core authentication objectives, followed by 10  high-level strategic efforts, and 14 foundational initiatives to help IRS  address its authentication challenges and identify opportunities for future  investment. (See appendix II.) Further, IRS has identified about 90  activities to support its foundational initiatives and the responsible  organizations and general duration to complete them. These initiatives  include, for example,  implementing a risk assessment framework that can be applied  across all authentication channels and services; developing a framework of identity proofing and authentication  requirements for third parties accessing and using IRS data and  services; and  improving taxpayer assurance by sending automated electronic alerts  to taxpayers, such as when they file a return.", "To support implementation of these initiatives, IRS established a 12- member executive governance board.

Leading practices also call for  agencies to develop estimates of benefits and costs to help prioritize new  investments. Following these practices can help agencies establish  priorities in a complex environment.", "IRS has made progress on some of the strategic efforts identified in its  Roadmap. For example, consistent with its core objectives, IRS has taken  steps to enhance fraud detection by improving telephone authentication  procedures and expanding its online authentication services. In October  2016, IRS implemented a new process for high-risk telephone  authentication, which includes generating questions for the taxpayer  using data from internal IRS systems instead of from third-party data or  credit reporting agencies. In addition, in March 2018, IRS launched the  first phase of its improved online authentication service for TPP, called ID  Verify. According to IRS officials, the first phase of the service will be  available to taxpayers who did not file the return in question and appear  to be victims of IDT refund fraud. The second phase, which IRS plans to  implement later in 2018, will expand the service to all taxpayers selected  for TPP.", "While IRS\u2019s Roadmap demonstrates the breadth of the agency\u2019s strategic  vision and core objectives, it does not articulate the resources IRS needs  to implement any of its 14 foundational initiatives and their supporting  activities. For example, one of IRS\u2019s foundational initiatives is to send  event-driven notifications to taxpayers, such as when they file a return or  request a tax transcript. Such notifications could help IRS detect  potentially fraudulent activity at the earliest stage and improve  authentication of tax returns. The Roadmap identifies seven supporting  activities for this foundational initiative. One is to provide taxpayers with  greater control over their online accounts. Another supporting activity is to  determine methods for sending notifications to taxpayers about activity on  their account. However, IRS has not identified the resources required to  complete these activities, and the Roadmap notes that six of the seven  activities will take between 6 months to 3 years to complete. In December  2017, IRS officials stated that they had developed business requirements  for the foundational initiative to give taxpayers greater control over their  online accounts. However, IRS has not identified funding for the  initiative\u2019s other supporting activities\u2014such as developing requirements  to send push notifications to taxpayers\u2014and implementing them will  depend on the availability of future resources.", "Further, while IRS has developed a business process that would help the  agency prioritize initiatives, the process has not been fully implemented.  In 2015, we recommended that IRS estimate and document the costs,  benefits, and risks of possible options for taxpayer authentication, in  accordance with OMB and NIST guidance. Consistent with our  recommendation and its Roadmap, IRS developed a process to assess  the costs, benefits, and risks of current and potential authentication tools.  In May 2017, IRS implemented its business decision model to analyze  and improve its online taxpayer authentication services and provided us  with results from an analysis for implementing a text-to-voice functionality  for IRS\u2019s Secure Access online authentication platform. This function  would allow taxpayers the option of receiving an automated voice code  for authentication on a verified landline (instead of a text message on a  mobile phone). As a result of this analysis, IRS approved the proposal to  implement this tool. However, in December 2017, IRS officials stated that  the text-to-voice tool is not moving forward because of other competing IT  improvements and funding constraints. Further, IAO has not yet applied  the business decision model to other potential authentication initiatives,  such as those identified in its Roadmap.", "In December 2017, IRS officials stated that each of the strategic efforts  and foundational initiatives identified in the Roadmap are a high priority,  and they are working to address them concurrently while balancing the  availability of resources against the greatest threats to the tax  environment. We recognize that a strategy is necessarily high-level and  that IRS must remain flexible and use necessary resources to respond to  unexpected threats. At the same time, clearly identifying resources and  prioritizing its initiatives and activities will help clarify the relationships  between IRS\u2019s authentication efforts and resource needs relative to  expected benefits.

Federal guidance directs  agencies to regularly assess and address the risks of government IT  systems. Specifically, OMB requires agencies to conduct annual risk  assessments on IT systems performing remote authentication. The  assessments should also be conducted when the agency plans to modify  its business processes or technology. This includes reviewing new and  existing electronic transactions to ensure that authentication processes  provide the appropriate level of assurance outlined in NIST guidance.  While federal guidelines broadly require agencies to identify and manage  risks and establish specific requirements for programs using online  authentication, no corresponding federal guidelines exist for telephone,  in-person, and correspondence authentication, although we have  previously reported that federal guidance and standards are applicable to  IRS\u2019s phone authentication.", "Similarly, our Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs  directs agencies to conduct fraud risk assessments at regular intervals  and when there are changes to the program operating environment, as  assessing fraud risks is an iterative process. Previously, such risk assessments have helped IRS identify security weaknesses and, in some  cases, have led the agency to take an authentication service offline. For  example, in response to a recommendation we made in May 2016, IRS  performed an updated risk assessment on TPP\u2019s online authentication  service, a key defense against IDT refund fraud. Based on the results of  this assessment, IRS disabled its online authentication service until it  could appropriately address the security weaknesses that it identified.", "Consistent with federal guidance, IRS has identified and analyzed risks  associated with services and programs requiring online authentication,  including TPP, Get Transcript, and IP PIN, among others. Further, IRS  has made recent progress in updating risk assessments and improving  security for its online authentication applications. Specifically, between  June 2017 and April 2018, IRS reassessed authentication risk levels for  some online applications, mitigated risks by moving additional  applications behind its Secure Access authentication platform, and  identified other compensating controls to appropriately protect its  systems. In December 2017, IRS officials stated that they were working  to bring remaining authentication applications in line with their most  recent risk assessment. They expected to complete this work by the last  quarter of fiscal year 2018.", "IRS has efforts underway to identify risks for telephone, in-person, and  correspondence authentication, but has made limited progress  implementing its process for assessing risks for all taxpayer  authentication channels. As previously discussed, in 2016, IRS identified  over 100 interactions that require taxpayer authentication and categorized  these into three high-level risk outcomes. According to IRS\u2019s risk  assessment process, the next step is for IRS business units to assess the  effects of incorrect authentication for each interaction or program, identify  gaps in existing processes, and develop options to address the gaps. IRS  officials stated that this process involves conducting scenario-based  workshops with subject matter experts.", "However, as of March 2018, this process has only been applied to TPP  and one other IRS business practice. In early 2017, IRS conducted a 2- day, internal, scenario-based workshop to assess risks and impacts and  to identify gaps for TPP authentication. Workshop participants identified  45 short-, medium-, and long-term potential enhancements to TPP\u2019s  authentication processes. However, IRS had not performed similar risk  impact assessments for other programs that rely on telephone, in-person,  and correspondence authentication\u2014including Get Transcript and IP  PIN\u2014and officials do not have a plan or timeline for conducting these  assessments. Further, IRS has not developed a plan with time frames to  address the deficiencies it identified for TPP. In December 2017, IRS  officials stated they are reviewing the 45 TPP enhancements identified by  workshop participants, but have no clear plans to implement them  because of resource constraints.", "IRS has made limited overall progress on this front because it does not  have a policy that requires regular assessments and timely mitigation of  identified issues for telephone, in-person, and correspondence  authentication, as is required for online authentication programs and  services. IRS also does not have guidelines for mitigating authentication  risks to these channels in a timely manner. In late November 2017, the  Director of IAO stated that IAO alone does not have the authority to  create and implement a policy that compels other IRS business units to  use its risk assessment process or mitigate issues in a timely manner.  Officials from other IRS business units stated that they continually assess  risks to telephone, in-person and correspondence authentication, even  without a policy to do so. However, IRS could not provide evidence of  such prior risk assessments or risk mitigation plans. IRS\u2019s Roadmap  states that it will implement a secure authentication platform for taxpayers  regardless of how they interact with IRS\u2014online, via telephone, in- person, or correspondence\u2014to help ensure that information is secure and  that the agency is interacting with a legitimate taxpayer. Without a policy  for conducting risk assessments for these channels and addressing  deficiencies in a timely manner, IRS may underestimate known risks and  overlook emerging threats to the tax environment.

Federal  standards for internal control call for agencies to design their information  systems in a way that meets operational needs and allows the agency to  respond to risks. Further, agencies are to collect and use quality  information to make informed decisions. Quality information is  appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a  timely basis. Further, to have an effective internal control system,  agencies should also establish procedures to monitor and evaluate the  performance of programs and systems as part of the normal course of  operations. To this end, monitoring should be performed on an ongoing  basis, and any deficiencies the agency has identified should be  addressed in a timely manner. Monitoring activities are even more critical  in an environment where the risk of fraud is high because such efforts  allow an agency to quickly respond to emerging risks to minimize the  impact of fraud. Further, IRS\u2019s Strategic Plan calls for its organizations  to use analytics and research to improve program effectiveness and  foster a timely, data-driven decision-making environment.", "According to IRS documentation and discussions with officials, the  Secure Access online authentication platform allows IRS to conduct near  real-time monitoring of taxpayer authentication outcomes. Specifically,  for each online service using Secure Access, IRS is able to monitor on a  daily basis how many taxpayers registered for an account; rates of  successful and unsuccessful identity proofing and verification; and  suspicious user patterns, such as multiple login attempts. IRS is also able to monitor system error codes for specific steps in the authentication  process, such as when the secure messaging process fails. IRS officials  stated that this enhanced performance monitoring of online authentication  began in June 2016, and it is helping IRS determine where in the  authentication process taxpayers may be having difficulties and potential  causes of the problem.", "However, IRS does not have comparable procedures and mechanisms to  monitor authentication outcomes for telephone, in-person, and  correspondence authentication, particularly for TPP, one of IRS\u2019s key  defenses against IDT refund fraud. Further, since August 2016,  taxpayers have been able to authenticate using only these channels. IRS  currently uses its Account Management Services (AMS) to capture  telephone and in-person authentication outcomes for TPP; however, as  discussed below, this is not an effective mechanism for monitoring  authentication outcomes.", "AMS is IRS\u2019s primary application for recording, storing, and retrieving  information on all types of taxpayer interactions over time. IRS\u2019s customer  service representatives (CSR) use AMS to, among other things, record  information related to taxpayer authentication performed over the phone  or in person for TPP. According to IRS documentation, AMS includes a  field where the CSR is to enter the authentication outcome and also an  area where the CSR enters notes on the details of the taxpayer  interaction. In the context of TPP, IRS officials stated that CSRs use the  notes field to record, for example, the reason why the taxpayer failed the  authentication process, and other information important for other CSRs to  know. IRS also relies on another application to review the status of TPP  cases, such as if a case is open or closed.", "To better understand how CSRs are implementing procedures to capture  TPP authentication outcomes in AMS, we analyzed data in AMS from  January through October 2017. The result of our analysis and related  discussions with IRS officials indicate three primary internal controls  issues. First, IRS does not have a reliable, direct mechanism to collect  data on the number of taxpayers who pass and fail telephone, in-person,  and correspondence authentication. Second, data quality issues make it  difficult for IRS to understand why taxpayers may be failing these  authentication processes. Third, the IRS organizations responsible for  monitoring these channels do not have access to complete AMS data,  making it difficult for IRS to identify potential authentication issues and  develop solutions to address them.", "No mechanism to collect reliable, direct data on authentication  passes and failures. As previously discussed, when a taxpayer calls IRS  or visits a Taxpayer Assistance Center in regard to a TPP letter, the CSR  is to enter the result of the authentication (i.e., pass or fail) into AMS with  one of nine codes that accurately reflects the authentication outcome.  However, AMS does not have a separate, discrete field where the CSR is  to enter this information. The field available to capture authentication  information is shared with 68 other issue codes, increasing the likelihood  that the CSR may select a more generic issue, such as \u201cidentity theft\u201d  instead of one of the nine codes designated for TPP. Further, one of the  TPP outcome codes, called \u201cother issue,\u201d may be too broad for useful  analysis. Of the data we reviewed, we found that about one-third of TPP  authentication cases were categorized as \u201cother issue,\u201d which provides  no information on the authentication outcome. According to IRS\u2019s  procedures, this category is to be used in various scenarios, including  when IRS does not have enough information to generate questions for  authenticating the taxpayer, and in other cases when a taxpayer fails  telephone authentication and must go to a Taxpayer Assistance Center.  However, by combining all of these issues into one broad category, IRS  has limited insight into the size of each particular problem and may be  underestimating the number of taxpayers who fail TPP authentication.  Further, IRS does not directly capture the results of correspondence- based authentication in AMS and is therefore unable to monitor pass and  failure rates for this channel.", "Issues with data quality. We selected a generalizable random sample of  AMS cases identified as TPP authentication failures for January through  October 2017 and identified several data quality issues based on our  analysis. First, we found that an estimated 19 percent of cases were  categorized as an authentication failure, but the content of the CSR notes  indicated otherwise. Further, we could not determine a clear match  between the TPP authentication outcome and the CSR notes in an  additional estimated 18 percent of cases. For example, in these  instances, the CSRs\u2019 notes provided no information on why the taxpayer  failed authentication, or the notes were clearly unrelated to TPP.", "Second, we found that CSRs do not consistently enter useful information  in the notes explaining why a taxpayer failed authentication, which could  provide IRS management with valuable feedback on characteristics of  potential fraud or problem areas for legitimate taxpayers. Specifically, our  analysis showed that in an estimated 63 percent of cases, CSRs\u2019 notes  contained information that was useful or somewhat useful for helping IRS  understand why a taxpayer failed authentication. In the estimated 37  percent of cases where we determined that the notes were not useful,  CSRs generally documented the outcome (i.e., authentication failure) but  not the details on why the taxpayer failed. We recognize that a portion of  the TPP authentication failures may represent fraudsters trying to  authenticate as a legitimate taxpayer. However, given that IRS\u2019s fraud  detection systems have a history of high false positive rates, these  failures may also represent legitimate taxpayers who may be having  trouble authenticating.", "Further, while the CSR notes could provide IRS potentially valuable  information on why taxpayers may be failing authentication, further data  analysis may prove difficult. This is because this information is captured  in a free-text notes field, rather than in a drop-down list or other  standardized way to record data that can then be analyzed. Further,  during our analysis of AMS data, we found variation in the way CSRs  enter notes, particularly in their use of abbreviations and shorthand on  why a taxpayer failed authentication. Such variation makes systematic  data analysis difficult.", "According to IRS officials and documents we reviewed, there may be  several causes for the data quality issues. For example, as noted earlier,  CSRs may not be selecting the correct TPP authentication outcome code  because there are too many options and procedures may be unclear. IRS  officials also noted that when a taxpayer contacts IRS about TPP  authentication, they may want to discuss multiple issues. In these cases,  the CSR may choose to record information on another issue instead of  the authentication outcome.", "Complete AMS data sets are not readily available for analysis. In  addition to the issues described above, the organizations responsible for  monitoring TPP telephone and in-person authentication data do not have  access to complete AMS data for TPP. IRS officials responsible for  managing TPP told us that they do not have direct access to AMS data  reports because they are not the system\u2019s business owner. Instead, they  receive a weekly extract of AMS data from IRS\u2019s IT department. However,  officials stated that this weekly data extract is limited to approximately the  first 5,000 records for each issue area or outcome code, including the  codes for TPP. IRS IT officials stated that they limited the file size of the  AMS weekly report because it became too large to share internally via e- mail. IT officials stated that the free-text notes entries in AMS were the  main cause for large file sizes. However, this procedure of emailing an extract of the data, rather than providing direct access to AMS, makes it  difficult for IRS to perform comprehensive analyses and ongoing  monitoring for TPP using AMS.", "To put this into further context, IRS officials reported that in fiscal year  2017, they authenticated about 1.13 million taxpayers for TPP via  telephone and at Taxpayer Assistance Centers. However, we found  only about 471,600 records with a TPP outcome code in the AMS data  IRS provided to us. This represents only about 42 percent of the records  we were expecting to see in AMS. IRS officials stated that the  discrepancy was likely due to the AMS record limit described above. Yet,  in the course of our analysis, we found that only a small number of  outcome codes over 42 weeks appeared to be affected by this record  limit. (See appendix I for details.) IRS officials could not confirm additional  explanations for the discrepancy in the number of records.", "IRS\u2019s Office of Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics (RAAS)  performs research and quantitative analysis on TPP and has studied  authentication performance. For example, in April 2017, RAAS reported  results of a newly implemented TPP authentication procedure and found  that while the new procedures helped to reduce call times, CSRs were  not following the procedures correctly in an estimated 44 percent of the  calls. According to IRS officials, RAAS\u2019s research efforts provide IRS  management with insight into TPP performance and officials have  identified areas where TPP can be improved. However, officials face  similar data limitations we described above. Further, officials from IRS\u2019s  RAAS division stated that they must submit a formal data request with IT  in order to receive additional data beyond what is included in the AMS  weekly extract. While valuable, these research efforts are not a substitute  for ongoing monitoring using complete, reliable data, which would allow  IRS to identify and address potential problems in a more timely manner.", "IRS officials acknowledged that AMS has limitations and stated that they  are in the process of planning a new capability in another system to  analyze how taxpayers perform on specific questions during the high-risk  authentication process. However, this capability will not address the  issues in AMS we described above. Further, as of late November 2017,  officials were uncertain when this capability would be implemented  because of IT funding constraints. Without effective internal control  procedures and mechanisms for collecting authentication outcome data,  ensuring data quality, and using these data to perform comprehensive  analyses and ongoing monitoring of TPP, IRS will continue to have limited  insight into its taxpayer authentication operations.

These elements included,  for example, trusted customer requirements and other characteristics of  the return. In addition, in 2016 the authentication workgroup worked with  software providers to improve authentication procedures to protect  taxpayers against their accounts being taken over by criminals.

As  discussed earlier, IRS\u2019s online account offers taxpayers several  services, including the ability to set up a payment plan and make  payments to IRS and view their tax history. In fiscal year 2017, about  808,000 taxpayers created online accounts, and IRS expects this  number to grow. IRS\u2019s Roadmap has identified enhancing taxpayer  assurance by expanding authentication, such as generating and  sending event-driven notifications to taxpayers to help IRS  authenticate returns, which could help IRS quickly validate legitimate  returns.", "With this option, IRS may be able to further protect taxpayers from  IDT refund fraud. For example, IRS could develop additional  functionality for the online account that allows the taxpayer to  designate a bank account or a preference for a paper check for  receiving a tax refund. If a fraudster filed a return with different  information, the return would automatically be rejected. In February  2018, IRS officials stated that their strategic vision includes  empowering taxpayers to manage their online account; however,  when these services offer the ability to change personal or financial  information, there is greater potential for fraudsters to exploit them.", "Federated model. A federated authentication approach allows an  organization to rely on trusted authentication credentials from another  entity to log into its systems, potentially without needing to save  information from the trusted source. (See figure 3.) One example of  a federated authentication model is when people use their Google or  Facebook credentials to log into a different website or mobile  application. IRS could use a trusted authentication credential from the  private or public sector, or another federal agency. The General  Services Administration (GSA) has developed a single sign-on  authentication platform for federal agencies called Login.gov. In  March 2018, GSA officials told us that the Office of Personnel  Management and Customers and Border Patrol were using Login.gov  and that several other agencies plan to use the authentication  platform. According to IRS officials, IRS and Department of the  Treasury officials have met with GSA to discuss whether Login.gov  could meet IRS\u2019s authentication needs. In December 2017, IRS IT  officials said they are tracking Login.gov\u2019s progress and capabilities  and want to ensure that GSA officials understand IRS\u2019s requirements.  IRS officials said that the agency is interested in being able to  federate with different organizations, but does not want to limit  federating to one entity, since different taxpayers will want to use  different credentials. IRS officials also noted that the agency will need  to implement additional IT infrastructure to support a federated model  for authentication.", "Possession-based authentication. This type of authentication offers  users a convenient, added layer of security when used as a second  factor for accessing websites or systems that would otherwise rely on  a username and password for single-factor authentication. As  shown in figure 4, Universal Authentication Framework (UAF)  solutions use biometrics, such as an embedded fingerprint, facial  recognition, or voice recognition sensor on a computer or smart  phone, eliminating the need for a password. Similarly, authentication  with a Universal Second Factor (U2F) uses a trusted device or  \u201csecurity key\u201d for authentication in addition to a username and  password. According to a representative from the Fast Identity Online  (FIDO) Alliance, UAF standards and U2F devices comply with NIST\u2019s  new guidance for digital authentication. While IRS is not likely to  provide the devices to taxpayers, it could enable its systems to accept  these types of standards-based authentication technology for  taxpayers who elect to use UAF or U2F devices. For example,  taxpayers could use a UAF or U2F device when logging into their IRS  online account for additional protection.", "States\u2019 strategies for authentication. When we met with  representatives from five states to discuss how they authenticate  taxpayers, representatives from three states volunteered that they use  driver\u2019s license information to help authenticate taxpayers and tax  returns. One state we met with compares driver\u2019s license information  to other state agency data to help authenticate returns. IRS could  investigate making driver\u2019s license information, or other government  identification, a requirement when filing a federal return, and work with  states and other outside organizations to assist with authentication.  This information could be a key factor in verifying that the legitimate  taxpayer is filing the return. While some industry representatives told  us driver\u2019s license information is a good credential for identity- proofing, this information can be compromised. For example,  fraudsters can use stolen PII to obtain fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses.", "Contracting with outside organizations. Several private-sector  organizations offer identity proofing and authentication services. We  spoke with officials from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and  representatives from the State of Alabama\u2019s Department of Revenue,  both of which are currently using such services. VA is using a third-  party service to identity proof and authenticate veterans accessing  services through www.vets.gov. For the 2018 filing season, Alabama  has contracted with a third-party organization to offer taxpayers a  service that sends them an alert when a return is filed using their  name, and authenticates the return as legitimate using a selfie. This  photo is then digitally compared to their driver\u2019s license photo. IRS  could evaluate these services to see if any meet their needs.", "Working with trusted partners. IRS could partner with organizations  it trusts that are accessible to taxpayers and enable the partners to  identity-proof and authenticate taxpayers. Trusted partners could  include tax preparers, financial institutions, or other federal agencies.  In November 2017, IRS officials told us that they had been discussing  an in-person identity proofing study with the Social Security  Administration (SSA), where SSA would identity proof taxpayers and  transmit the authentication data to IRS. However, in June 2018, IRS  officials stated that discussions with SSA are ongoing, and they have  not made a decision about next steps because SSA is concerned  about resources. IRS is also exploring working with the U.S. Postal  Service on an information-sharing initiative that could help IRS identify  potential IDT.", "Throughout the course of our work, IRS officials stated that improving the  security of IRS\u2019s online authentication applications is a high priority and  further noted that IRS must ensure that the highest-risk authentication  improvements are completed first. In January 2018, IRS officials stated  that the agency\u2019s priority is implementing tax reform, which will use IRS\u2019s  limited IT resources. Further, officials noted that priorities, including  resources required to develop project estimates, are determined by IRS\u2019s  appropriate executive steering committees.", "Developing a repeatable, comprehensive process to identify and evaluate  different alternatives for taxpayer authentication, such as the ones  described above, is consistent with leading practices and can help IRS  ensure that it has a sound rationale for its investment decisions. It can  also help ensure that IRS has the resources it needs to make  authentication improvements in a timely manner. For example, these  evaluations may involve developing and documenting a business case for  selected initiatives in IRS\u2019s Roadmap. Such a process could compare  options for in-house authentication solutions with solutions available in  the private sector based on estimates of cost, schedule, and benefits, as  applicable. By identifying options and performing such an evaluation, IRS  may find, for example, that an authentication technology available in the  private sector already complies with the new NIST guidelines, offers IRS  additional fraud detection capabilities, or is less expensive than  developing a similar capability in-house. On the other hand, the process  may show that minor improvements to a technology IRS is already using  can provide the most secure option in relatively short time, given  appropriate resources. This information could be communicated to IRS\u2019s  executive steering committees, as well as to Congress, to help IRS  identify resource needs and ensure it is pursuing the most efficient and  effective authentication improvements to protect IRS and taxpayers  against evolving threats.", "IRS\u2019s authentication environment is one component of a broad, complex  IT infrastructure, and the agency faces many challenges as it modernizes  its tax systems. However, given the availability of PII and the prevalence  of cyberattacks, developing a repeatable, comprehensive process to  identify and evaluate alternative options for taxpayer authentication and  implementing improvements can help IRS ensure it is authenticating  taxpayers in the most secure manner. IRS documentation acknowledges  that a hybrid authentication approach using in-house solutions, third-party  services, and working with trusted partners is the best approach to  implementing the new NIST guidance and expanding IRS\u2019s authentication  coverage. However, without a process to comprehensively identify and  evaluate available or emerging authentication technologies and models,  IRS may be missing an opportunity to implement the most secure, robust  technologies to authenticate and protect taxpayers. Further, including  these authentication options and prioritizing them with other initiatives  included in IRS\u2019s Roadmap would help IRS ensure it is working on the  highest priority authentication improvements first. It also provides a way  for IRS to communicate its strategy and plan for authentication to IRS  management and external stakeholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Each year, IRS authenticates millions of taxpayers via telephone, online,  in-person, or correspondence to verify potentially fraudulent tax returns,  provide taxpayers access to a tax transcript, or issue a replacement IP PIN. IRS\u2019s cost to authenticate taxpayers varies widely, with in-person  authentication at a Taxpayer Assistance Center costing about $89 per  interaction and online authentication costing less than $1 per interaction.  The challenge for IRS is to provide taxpayers with options to interact with  the agency, while providing IRS with reasonable assurance that it is  authenticating the legitimate taxpayer.", "In its Roadmap, IRS has identified high-level strategic efforts and  numerous foundational initiatives to address its most pressing  authentication challenges. IRS has made progress in several areas  identified in its Roadmap. However, identifying the resources the agency  will need to complete its foundational initiatives and further prioritizing  them would help IRS better understand the relationship between its  competing priorities and limited IT resources. Further, while IRS has  made progress in identifying risks and establishing internal control  activities to monitor online taxpayer authentication, it has not established  equally rigorous controls for telephone, in-person, and correspondence  authentication. First, IRS does not have a policy for identifying, assessing,  and mitigating risks for these authentication channels. Second, IRS does  not have effective internal controls for collecting reliable, useful data on  telephone, in-person, and correspondence authentication outcomes for  TPP and for using these data to monitor authentication operations.  Without effective controls for collecting these data and using it for  monitoring, IRS may not be positioned to identify potential vulnerabilities  in its operations and the necessary improvements.", "Given the widespread availability of PII that fraudsters can use to  perpetrate tax fraud, it is essential for IRS to strengthen taxpayer  authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters\u2019 schemes. Completing an  analysis of IRS\u2019s current authentication procedures relative to new NIST  guidance may help IRS identify and prioritize which improvements are  most critical. Developing a timeline with milestones and resource needs  to implement NIST\u2019s new guidance can help guide IRS\u2019s implementation  and help officials gauge progress and ensure the most critical  improvements are made in a timely manner. Further, implementing  NIST\u2019s new guidance can help IRS ensure its online authentication  applications are appropriately protecting IRS information. While improving  IRS\u2019s current authentication programs would help IRS further protect  taxpayer information and identify and prevent fraud, IRS may not need to  conduct all of its taxpayer authentication activities in-house nor build IRS- specific authentication solutions: there are many additional tools and  partners IRS could consider. Further, developing a repeatable,  comprehensive process to identify and evaluate potential authentication  technologies and services will help IRS avoid missing opportunities for  improving authentication.

IRS documents and policies we reviewed included IRS\u2019s Authentication  Strategy: Current State Touchpoints, IRS\u2019s Identity Assurance Strategy  and Roadmap (Roadmap), and Internal Revenue Manuals related to  taxpayer authentication. For this report, we focused on the following four  IRS programs and services because they require taxpayer authentication,  verify a significant number of taxpayer identities each year, and illustrate  IRS\u2019s different approaches to authentication: the Taxpayer Protection  Program (TPP), Get Transcript, Identity Protection Personal Identification  Number (IP PIN), and IRS\u2019s online services. We reviewed IRS-reported  data and information on taxpayer authentication volumes and per  transaction costs for these programs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.

We interviewed IRS officials in IRS\u2019s Return Integrity  and Compliance Services (RICS), Identity Assurance Office (IAO), and  Information Technology (IT) knowledgeable about the agency\u2019s taxpayer  authentication programs. For additional context and informational  purposes, we visited IRS\u2019s Andover, Massachusetts call center to  observe IRS customer service representatives (CSR) authenticating  taxpayers for TPP.

This was the most  recent and complete set of data at the time of our review. We reviewed  AMS records coded with any of the nine TPP authentication outcome  codes for tax years 2015, 2016, or with \u201c0.\u201d We assessed the reliability of  the data by: (1) performing electronic testing of key data elements,  including checks for missing, out-of-range, or logically inaccurate data; (2)  reviewing documents for information about the data and IRS\u2019s systems;  and (3) interviewing officials knowledgeable about the data to discuss any  limitations. During these discussions, IRS officials stated that the AMS  data we received may not include all available records in AMS. This is  because the IRS office that creates the weekly AMS data report includes  only the first 5,000 records for each outcome code. To assess whether  this was an issue for our data set, we reviewed record counts for each of  the nine TPP outcome codes for the 42 weeks of data IRS provided us.  We found 12 out of these 378 instances (3 percent) where the data  appeared to be affected by the 5,000 record cutoff. Each of these  instances occurred in the \u201cTPP- Other \u2013 Sent to TAC\u201d issue code for  which we planned no further analysis.

We stratified the population into  two groups: (1) high-risk authentication failures, and (2) all other  authentication failures. From each population, we drew a random sample  of 96 records independently, reflecting the population size of each  stratum and to be able to detect a 10 percent difference in absolute value  between the sample estimate and true population number with a 95  percent confidence level; that is, a 1 out of 20 chance of failure. Because  we followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our  sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn.
