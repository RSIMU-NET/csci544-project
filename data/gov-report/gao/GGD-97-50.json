Derivatives include futures contracts that traditionally have been traded on organized exchanges and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). They also include swaps and other over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts that resemble exchange-traded futures in their economic function but are privately negotiated between counterparties outside organized exchanges. As we and others have reported, derivatives can serve a useful risk-management function, but their use can pose risks to participants and the markets. The total notional/contract amount of derivatives contracts outstanding worldwide was an estimated $55.7 trillion as of March 31, 1995.", "Because of their resemblance to exchange-traded futures, swaps and other OTC derivatives faced the possibility of falling within the judicially crafted definition of a futures contract. As a result, they faced the legal risk of being unenforceable under the CEA due to its requirement that futures be traded on exchanges to be legal and thus enforceable. The Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-546) provided CFTC with authority to reduce this legal risk, which the agency subsequently used. At the same time, developments in the exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives markets brought regulated financial institutions into these markets, leading to a greater array of derivatives contracts and greater competition among those providing such contracts. Consequently, some of the distinctions among market participants and between exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives have become blurred\u2014raising questions about the appropriate regulatory structure for these contracts, markets, and market participants. Because of the Committees\u2019 interest in the CEA and congressional interest in the continued vitality and integrity of the U.S. exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives markets, we initiated this review to provide Congress a context for addressing these questions. Specifically, we focused on (1) the extent to which CFTC has reduced the legal risk surrounding the enforceability of OTC derivatives under the CEA and (2) issues related to the appropriate regulation for exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives contracts, including their markets and market participants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Futures Market Is Regulated Under the CEA", "paragraphs": ["Futures contracts first appeared in the United States in the mid-1800s and were based on grains. They provided producers (farmers) and commodity users with a means of reducing the risk of financial loss arising from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, called hedging. They also provided a more efficient and transparent means of determining commodity prices based on supply and demand factors, called price discovery. Because of concerns about price manipulation and other trading abuses in the futures market, including the operation of bucket shops, Congress passed the CEA in 1936 to amend the Grain Futures Act of 1922. Like its predecessor, the CEA required that futures trading in specified commodities\u2014such as corn, rye, and wheat\u2014be conducted only on federally designated markets. To receive such a designation, an exchange had to meet certain self-regulatory requirements that included providing for the prevention of manipulation and fraud. Congress periodically amended the act to bring futures trading in additional commodities under the CEA. For example, Congress amended the act in 1968 and brought futures trading in livestock, livestock products, and frozen concentrated orange juice under federal regulation.", "By the early 1970s, futures trading had expanded to include nonagricultural commodities, such as precious metals and foreign currencies. Although contracts on these commodities were traded on futures exchanges, they were not covered by the act and, thus, were not federally regulated. In 1974, Congress amended the CEA to ensure that all futures contracts\u2014whatever their underlying commodity\u2014would be federally regulated. It accomplished this goal by expanding the list of commodities covered by the act to include virtually anything, tangible or intangible. As a result, the class of instruments that could be defined as futures and subject to the act\u2019s exchange-trading requirement was broadened. Any contract that was legally categorized as a futures contract could be traded only on federally designated exchanges, making the off-exchange trading of futures illegal.", "The 1974 amendments to the CEA also created CFTC to administer the CEA.The CEA gives CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over futures and establishes a comprehensive regulatory structure designed to protect the futures market and its participants. Historically, CFTC\u2019s regulatory structure was designed to assure that all futures contracts were traded on self-regulated exchanges and through regulated intermediaries, which were subject to capital, examination, recordkeeping, registration, reporting, and customer protection requirements. The CEA\u2019s exchange-trading requirement was intended to foster both market integrity and customer protection by creating a centralized market that could be protected against excessive speculation, price manipulation, and other abusive trade practices. According to the act, regulation of the futures market was necessary to protect the public interest, because futures prices were susceptible to excessive speculation and could be manipulated to the detriment of producers, consumers, and others. Moreover, the act\u2019s legislative history noted that the fundamental purposes of the act were to ensure fair practices and honest dealing in the futures market and to control those forms of speculative activity that demoralize the market to the detriment of producers, consumers, and the markets.", "While providing for their regulatory oversight, the CEA does not define the term futures contract. Instead, CFTC and the courts have identified certain elements as necessary, but not always sufficient, for defining a futures contract. These elements are the obligation of each party to fulfill the contract at a specified price set at the contract\u2019s initiation, the use of the contract to shift or assume the risk of price changes, and the ability to satisfy the contract by either delivering the underlying commodity or offsetting the original contract with another contract.", "CFTC and the courts have also identified additional elements of exchange-traded futures contracts, including standardized terms, margin requirements, use of clearinghouses, open and competitive trading in centralized markets (such as futures exchanges), and public price dissemination. These additional elements facilitate futures trading on exchanges but do not define what makes a contract a futures contract. Also, according to CFTC and the courts, the requirement that a futures contract be exchange-traded is what makes the contract legal, not what makes it a futures contract. Because CFTC and the courts have defined a futures contract in a way that reflects its risk-shifting function, the CEA potentially covers a broad range of risk-shifting products that are not exchange-traded.", "The CEA also provides CFTC with jurisdiction over commodity options,except options on securities and options on foreign currencies traded on a national securities exchange. CFTC\u2019s options jurisdiction is further limited by the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in CFTC v. Dunn. Commodity options include options to acquire futures contracts (called options on futures) and options to acquire the actual commodity, excluding securities. CFTC has issued regulations to allow futures exchanges, subject to its approval, to trade options on futures in any commodity and options on actual commodities other than domestic agricultural commodities. Futures exchanges have been trading options since 1982, and virtually all options traded on futures exchanges are options on futures. CFTC has also issued regulations to allow certain options on commodities other than domestic agricultural commodities (called trade options) to be traded off-exchange. These OTC options are to be offered and sold to commercial counterparties who enter into transactions for purposes related solely to their business.", "Since the 1974 amendments to the CEA and the creation of CFTC, the U.S. futures market has evolved far beyond its agricultural origins and is now dominated by futures based on financial products. In 1975, the largest commodity group was domestic agricultural commodities, accounting for nearly 80 percent of total trading volume. By 1996, the largest group was interest rate contracts, accounting for 54 percent of total trading volume. At the same time, agricultural commodities accounted for about 19 percent of total trading volume. According to the exchanges and others, the participants in the futures market have changed as the market evolved. They noted that the participants are now largely institutions and market professionals, with retail customers representing a smaller proportion of total market participants than they did when the act was amended in 1974.", "During this period, the CEA has remained the primary statute specifically created to regulate the trading of derivative products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OTC Derivatives and Exchange-Traded Futures Can Be Used as Substitutes for and Complements to Each Other", "paragraphs": ["OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures have similar characteristics and economic functions but differ in other ways. The market values of both products are determined by the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index. The economic uses of both products include hedging financial risk and investing with the intent of profiting from price changes, called speculating. OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures differ in the way they are traded and cleared as well as in their degree of standardization. OTC derivatives, which include forwards, options, and swaps, are privately negotiated contracts. They are entered into between counterparties, also called principals, outside centralized trading facilitiessuch as futures exchanges. Counterparties negotiate contract terms\u2014such as price, maturity, and quantity\u2014to customize the contracts to meet their specific economic needs. Because OTC derivatives are entered into on a principal-to-principal basis, each counterparty is exposed to credit risk\u2014the risk of loss resulting from the other party\u2019s failure to meet its financial obligation. In contrast, futures traditionally have been traded on organized exchanges as well as cleared and settled through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses manage counterparty credit risk, in part by substituting themselves as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. They also guarantee daily settlement of price changes, thereby eliminating the need for the original counterparties to monitor each other\u2019s creditworthiness. Exchange-traded futures generally have standardized terms\u2014except for price, which the market determines.", "The exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives markets have followed similar evolutionary paths. Exchange-traded futures developed from forward grain contracts that were customized and traded on a principal-to-principal basis. They evolved into contracts that have standardized terms, except for price, and are traded on centralized exchanges. Similarly, OTC derivatives originated as customized contracts that involved brokers finding and matching counterparties. Today, almost all OTC derivatives are traded through dealers. An industry association has developed standardized documentation for certain OTC derivatives, including swaps. However, each contract, including its material terms, continues to be privately negotiated between the two counterparties. The less complex interest rate and foreign-exchange swaps, called plain vanilla swaps, have become more homogeneous in terms of underlying reference rates or indexes and maturities. The majority of both swaps and exchange-traded futures are settled without delivery of the underlying commodity or financial asset.", "Because OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures serve similar economic functions, they can be used as substitutes for one another and thus may compete in the marketplace. However, they are not perfect substitutes because of potential differences in their contract terms as well as transaction costs, regulations, and other factors. OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures can also complement each other. For example, swaps dealers use exchange-traded futures to hedge the residual risk resulting from unmatched positions in their swaps portfolios. Similarly, food processors, grain elevators, and other commercial firms use exchange-traded futures to hedge their forward positions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address our two objectives, we reviewed the CEA and its legislative history, Federal Register notices, comment letters, and other material related to CFTC\u2019s exemptions for hybrid, OTC energy, swaps, and exchange-traded futures contracts.

These contracts were developed in the 1980s to meet the risk-management, financing, and other needs of market participants. Swaps evolved from parallel loans that involved two parties making loans to each other in equal amounts but denominated in different currencies. Over time, swaps were developed based not only on foreign currencies but also on interest rates, commodities, and securities. These contracts, like forwards, were entered into between two counterparties outside an exchange and could be viewed as serving a similar economic function as a series of forwards. However, swaps differed from forwards in that they typically did not entail delivery of the specified underlying commodity, a hallmark of traditional forwards. As such, swaps generally were not considered forwards for regulatory purposes. Consequently, they did not fall under the CEA\u2019s forward exclusion (discussed below), which would have excluded them from regulation under the act. Nor did many swaps fall under the CEA\u2019s Treasury Amendment (discussed below), which excludes certain OTC transactions in foreign currencies and other financial instruments from regulation under the act.", "Swaps that could not qualify for an exclusion from the CEA under its forward exclusion or Treasury Amendment faced the possibility of falling within the judicially crafted definition of a futures contract, because they, like futures, served a risk-shifting function.

If such swaps were found to be futures, they would be illegal and unenforceable, because they would have been traded off-exchange in violation of the CEA\u2019s exchange-trading requirement. Given the legal uncertainty surrounding the status of swaps as futures, swaps counterparties faced legal risk from two sources.

As such, swaps were not suitable for exchange trading and, in turn, not appropriately regulated as exchange-traded futures contracts. In this regard, CFTC identified conditions (collectively called a safe harbor) that swaps settled in cash could meet to avoid regulation under the CEA. These conditions were that the swaps have individually tailored terms, be used in conjunction with the counterparty\u2019s line of business, not be settled using exchange-style offset or a clearinghouse, and not be marketed to the general public.", "CFTC\u2019s swaps policy statement did not eliminate all legal risk of unenforceability.

This finding heightened the legal risk of unenforceability for swaps and other OTC derivatives because of the possibility that a court could also find them to be futures and subject to the CEA\u2019s exchange-trading requirement. Judicial proceedings began in 1986 when commercial participants in the Brent oil market were sued for violating, among other laws, the CEA\u2019s antimanipulation provisions. The participants responded by claiming that the contracts were forwards and excluded from the CEA because no contractual right existed to avoid delivery. In April 1990, a federal district court rejected the claim and found that the contracts were futures, not forwards. The court concluded that even though the contracts did not include a contractual right of offset for avoiding delivery, both the opportunity to offset the contracts and the common practice of doing so were sufficient to determine that the contracts were futures. Furthermore, the court found that the Brent oil contracts, like futures, were undertaken mainly to assume or shift price risk without transferring the underlying commodity. The contracts had highly standardized terms, which facilitated their settlement without delivery and reflected their use for risk-shifting or speculative purposes.", "On September 25, 1990, CFTC issued a statutory interpretation for forwards that adopted the view that the Brent oil contracts were forwards, not futures. CFTC did not dispute the court\u2019s findings that these contracts were highly standardized and routinely settled by means other than delivery. Rather, it found that the contracts fell under the CEA\u2019s forward exclusion because they required the commercial parties to make or take delivery, even though the parties did not routinely do so. CFTC noted that the contracts did not include any provisions that enabled the parties to settle their contractual obligations through means other than delivery, and the settlement of contracts without delivery was done through subsequent, separately negotiated contracts. In that regard, CFTC noted that these contracts served the same commercial function as forwards covered under the CEA exclusion, notwithstanding the fact that many of the individual contracts were settled routinely without delivery.

As discussed earlier, the policy statement removed the legal risk that CFTC would take enforcement action against certain swaps, but it did not remove the risk that a court could invalidate such contracts by deeming them to be illegal futures. In addition, the legal enforceability of equity swaps could be jeopardized indirectly through a finding that an exempted swap is a futures contract. For example, CFTC had proposed amending its swaps exemption to include a stand-alone, antifraud rule that would apply to exempted swaps. According to other federal regulators and market participants commenting on the proposal, the rule would have suggested that the exempted swaps were futures. This, in turn, would have suggested that equity swaps were also futures.

It noted that this could result in substantial losses and a market disruption. At a June 1996 hearing held by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, the association testified that the legal risk surrounding equity swaps has inhibited their evolution and that this uncertainty needs to be addressed.

CFTC officials told us that swaps market participants did not want the agency to take any action against the swaps dealer that would suggest swaps were futures for fear of increasing legal risk for equity swaps.

In 1995, CFTC took enforcement action against MG Refining and Marketing for selling illegal, off-exchange futures to commercial counterparties. The firm sold contracts that purportedly required the delivery of energy commodities in the future at a price established by the parties at initiation. These contracts provided counterparties with a contractual right to settle the contracts in cash without delivery of the underlying commodity. This right could be invoked if the price of the underlying commodity reached a preestablished level. Based largely on this provision, CFTC found these contracts to be illegal, off-exchange futures. CFTC\u2019s conclusion was consistent with prior court and CFTC decisions; it identified the contractual right to offset as a critical feature distinguishing forwards from futures.

In response to the congressional inquiry, the then CFTC chairman wrote that the case had nothing to do with swaps. She noted that, with regard to swaps generally, CFTC had not taken a position on whether swaps were futures and continued to adhere to its 1989 swaps policy statement.

Absent a definition of a forward contract in the CEA, CFTC and the courts have generally defined these contracts in reference to futures contracts. Traditionally, they distinguished forwards from futures based on whether the parties intended to make or take delivery of the underlying commodity when they entered into the contract. Forwards served primarily a commercial function and, as such, entailed delivery of the underlying commodity in normal commercial channels, but delivery was to occur at a later date. In contrast, futures were used primarily to shift or assume price risk without transferring the underlying commodity; thus, actual delivery was not expected to occur. In short, CFTC and the courts defined a forward as a contract that bound one party to make delivery and the other to take delivery of the contract\u2019s underlying physical commodity. Since forwards were commercial transactions that resulted in delivery, CFTC and the courts looked for evidence of the contracts\u2019 use in commerce.

For example, changes in U.S. farm policy, increased globalization of the agricultural markets, and other factors may have increased price volatility in the agricultural markets and created a demand for more innovative risk-management contracts. According to agricultural market participants, traditional forwards do not provide producers with sufficient flexibility because of their delivery requirement. In response to participants\u2019 needs, the forward market for agricultural commodities has evolved to include variations of forwards that may not routinely result in delivery. Contracts that routinely allow parties to offset, cancel, or void delivery obligations rather than transfer the underlying commodity may be viewed as futures contracts or trade options, depending on their pricing structure. CFTC permits the sale of trade options on nonagricultural commodities, but prohibits the sale of such options on domestic agricultural commodities. This prohibition was intended, in part, to protect producers from unscrupulous parties who might try to take advantage of their lack of knowledge about these options.", "One variation of a forward experiencing increased use is the hedge-to-arrive contract. Although varying in design, these are privately negotiated contracts in which a producer agrees with an elevator to deliver grain on a future date at an agreed-upon price, and the elevator uses exchange-traded futures to hedge the sale on behalf of the producer. Some of these contracts have allowed producers to defer the delivery dates on their contracts beyond the current crop year, which has exposed producers to significant price risk because their contracts were no longer tied to the current crop year. According to market observers, unusual factors, such as high grain prices and poor weather conditions, have resulted in financial problems for some parties that deferred delivery into future crop years. In May 1996, CFTC staff issued a policy statement for hedge-to-arrive contracts to allow counterparties experiencing losses to settle their contracts without delivery by entering into subsequent, separately negotiated contracts. CFTC noted that it would not find hedge-to-arrive contracts existing as of May 15, 1996, to be illegal based solely on the cash settlement of such contracts for the purpose of unwinding them, but may find them to be illegal based on other factors.", "CFTC or a court could find some hedge-to-arrive contracts or other variations on agricultural forwards to be futures or agricultural trade options. Either finding would make them illegal and unenforceable, provided the contracts did not qualify for the swaps exemption. For example, in November 1996, CFTC filed three administrative complaints, two of which alleged, among other things, that two elevators had offered and sold hedge-to-arrive contracts that were illegal, off-exchange futures. In these two complaints, CFTC noted that the elevators sold the hedge-to-arrive contracts to some producers who lacked the intent or capacity to make delivery of the grain.

As illustrated by the Brent oil and hedge-to-arrive contracts, the difficulty in distinguishing between forwards and futures can result in legal risk. Under its 1990 statutory interpretation for forwards (discussed above), CFTC tried to reduce the legal risk and regulatory constraints that forwards face because of the delivery requirement, thereby permitting them to evolve to better meet the economic needs of end-users.

This regulatory structure covers not only certain market participants but also the products and markets on which they trade. Unless exempted, futures must be traded on designated exchanges and through regulated intermediaries, subject to minimum capital, reporting, examination, and customer protection requirements. The CEA and CFTC specify certain self-regulatory duties\u2014including providing for the prevention of manipulation, making reports and records on market activities, and enforcing exchange rules\u2014that an exchange must perform to become and remain a designated exchange. The CEA also requires CFTC to review and approve products traded on a designated exchange."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFTC\u2019s Exchange Exemption Is One Approach to Rationalizing OTC and Exchange-Traded Futures Market Regulations but Illustrates the Challenges in Doing So", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, two futures exchanges separately requested that CFTC exempt from most of the CEA\u2019s regulatory requirements certain exchange-traded futures that are traded solely by institutional and other sophisticated market participants. The exchanges indicated that they needed regulatory relief to compete fairly with the less regulated OTC market. In response to the exchange requests, CFTC provided the exchanges with regulatory relief under an exemption issued in November 1995. CFTC, however, did not provide the exchanges with the broad regulatory relief they requested. CFTC based its position, in part, on comments it received on the exchange requests from various government agencies, members of Congress, and the public, as well as on the 1992 act\u2019s legislative history. In the latter, Congress cautioned CFTC to use its exemptive authority sparingly and not to prompt a wide-scale deregulation of markets falling under the act.", "The exchange exemption is to be implemented under a 3-year pilot program. It is intended to enable qualifying exchanges to list new contracts with greater ease and construct OTC-like trading procedures, permitting market participants to negotiate prices privately and execute trades off of the exchange floor. The exchange exemption limits access to the exempted futures market to specified participants, which are generally the same institutional and sophisticated participants that may use exempted swaps. In addition, the exemption is intended to streamline requirements for registering brokers and disclosing risks when opening new customer accounts. However, with the exception of these regulatory changes, all other CEA provisions and CFTC regulations would continue to apply to the exempted futures market. For example, the requirements related to recordkeeping and audit trails as well as transaction reporting would continue to apply.", "According to CFTC, the exchange exemption would enable the exchanges to compete more effectively with the OTC derivatives market, while maintaining basic customer protection, financial integrity, and other protections needed for trading in an exchange environment. Furthermore, CFTC noted that the pilot program would provide it with an opportunity to (1) test the operation of the exemption, (2) determine the effect of exempted transactions on the integrity of the market as a whole, and (3) determine whether continued trading under the exemption would be in the public interest. To date, CFTC has not received any proposals under the exchange exemption.", "In a joint statement released at the June 1996 Senate Agriculture hearing (discussed above), 10 futures exchanges noted that the exchange exemption does not provide a level playing field for exempted exchange-traded and OTC derivatives contracts. They noted that exempted exchange-traded contracts would continue to be subject to the bulk of CFTC regulations, even though such contracts, like exempted OTC derivatives, would not be traded by public customers. The exchanges also maintained that CFTC\u2019s exchange exemption is not consistent with the 1992 act\u2019s legislative history\u2014noting that, among other things, Congress intended CFTC, in consideration of fair competition, to use its exemptive authority in a fair and even-handed manner to products and systems sponsored by exchanges and nonexchanges.", "As mentioned earlier, Senators Lugar, Harkin, and Leahy as well as Congressman Ewing recently introduced bills to amend the CEA. Each bill includes a provision that would largely exempt from regulation under the act certain exchange-traded futures that are traded solely by institutional and sophisticated market participants. In a joint statement released at the February 11, 1997, hearing on reforming the CEA, 10 futures exchanges noted that the Senate bill \u201cmoves exchanges a long way toward achieving a regulatory balance with the OTC markets.\u201d They noted that the exempted market would rely on market discipline and self-regulation, with the exchanges having a business incentive to operate a fair, financially sound, and competitive market. At the same hearing, CFTC testified that, if enacted, the bill would likely cause a broad elimination of federal regulation of the exchange-traded futures market and create significant risks by doing so.", "CFTC\u2019s exchange exemption represents one approach to rationalizing regulatory differences between the exchange-traded futures and swaps markets but illustrates some of the challenges in doing so. The exchange and swaps exemptions raised similar policy questions that CFTC approached from opposite viewpoints, in part because of the existence of a regulatory structure for one but not the other. For futures, the basic question was: \u201cWhat is the appropriate regulation for futures traded on exchanges solely by institutional and other sophisticated market participants?\u201d In this regard, CFTC\u2019s approach to exempting exchange-traded futures focused on determining which CEA requirements could be eliminated without compromising the public interest, as defined in the CEA. Under this approach, the exchanges were tasked, in part, with demonstrating which existing regulations were unnecessary. In comparison, the basic question for swaps was: \u201cAre swaps appropriately regulated under the CEA?\u201d In this regard, CFTC\u2019s approach to exempting swaps focused on determining whether CEA requirements needed to be imposed on the market.", "Another related challenge in rationalizing regulations between the two markets arose from the similar nature of the participants. As required under its exemptive authority, CFTC considered the nature of the market participants in exempting swaps. It limited the swaps exemption to participants it deemed sophisticated or financially able to bear the risks associated with these transactions. Likewise, it considered the exclusion of unsophisticated participants from the exempted exchange-traded futures market as the most important factor supporting its exchange exemption. However, CFTC noted that, unlike a dealer market, a centralized market composed solely of sophisticated market participants did not obviate the need to ensure market integrity, price dissemination, and adequate protections against fraud, manipulation, and other trading abuses. It further noted that CFTC regulations serve other vital functions, even where such markets include only sophisticated participants, in that the regulations substitute for individualized credit determinations and increase market access. The exchanges have disagreed with CFTC\u2019s conclusions. They have stated that their safeguards\u2014including clearinghouse guarantees and price transparency\u2014provide greater protections than available in the OTC market but, at the same time, prevent them from obtaining regulatory relief comparable to that which CFTC provided to the OTC market."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CFTC has used its exemptive authority to reduce or eliminate legal risk in the OTC derivatives market arising from the combination of the CEA\u2019s judicially crafted futures definition and exchange-trading requirement. Through its efforts, CFTC has enhanced the legal enforceability of most OTC derivatives contracts and, in doing so, has enabled the OTC derivatives market to continue to grow and develop. Nonetheless, several legal and regulatory issues involving the CEA remain unresolved. These include the legal uncertainty facing equity swaps, the CEA\u2019s lack of clear criteria for distinguishing unregulated forwards from regulated futures, the uncertainty surrounding the scope of the Treasury Amendment, and the extent to which CFTC should use its exemptive authority to provide greater regulatory relief to the futures exchanges. Ongoing congressional efforts to amend the CEA could provide specific solutions to these unresolved issues. Further, such efforts could provide a forum for addressing the broader policy question of what the appropriate regulation is for exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives contracts, including their markets and market participants.", "The appropriate regulation for the exchange-traded and OTC derivatives markets should flow from the need to protect the public interest in these markets. The CEA identifies the public interest in the futures market as the need to protect the market\u2019s price discovery and risk-shifting functions from market abuses, such as excessive speculation, manipulation, and fraud. However, articulating the public interest in this way may no longer provide a sufficient basis for regulating all aspects of the futures market, given market developments and regulatory changes. As discussed, the exchange-traded futures market is now dominated by financially based futures and institutional participants. Because of the greater liquidity of the underlying cash markets for financial products, the exchange-traded futures markets for these products may not serve the same price discovery function as exchange-traded futures based on agricultural and other physical commodities. Accordingly, they may not serve the price discovery function that Congress intended to protect when crafting the CEA. In addition, CFTC now has the authority to allow futures to be traded off-exchange and free from the comprehensive regulatory structure applicable to exchange-traded futures. Because of the way they would be traded and other factors, off-exchange futures may not raise the same risks or regulatory concerns that exchange-traded futures raise and for which regulation under the CEA was deemed necessary to protect the public interest. Nonetheless, off-exchange futures may raise other risks, such as systemic risk, or regulatory concerns that warrant federal regulation.", "To address the broader policy question of the appropriate regulation for the exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives markets, more fundamental questions concerning the goals of federal regulatory policy need to be answered. These questions include:", "What is the current public interest in the exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives markets that needs to be protected?", "What type of regulations are needed, if any, and what is the most efficient and effective way to implement and enforce any needed regulations? To what extent are the answers to these questions affected by the nature of the market participants; trading environment; and products, including their function, type of underlying commodity, and degree of standardization?", "These fundamental questions provide a framework for systematically determining the appropriate regulation for exchange-traded futures and OTC derivatives, including their markets and market participants. Moreover, answers to these questions would also provide a basis for considering an array of options for amending the CEA. These options include (1) expanding the act\u2019s jurisdiction to cover specified swaps and other OTC derivatives but tailoring their regulation to the circumstances under which they trade and other appropriate factors; (2) excluding swaps and other specified OTC derivatives from the act\u2019s jurisdiction and providing for their oversight, as appropriate, by other federal regulators; and (3) tailoring the level of regulation for exchange-traded futures to the nature of the market participants and/or other appropriate factors.", "Swaps and other OTC derivatives involve institutions and activities in which federal bank regulators and SEC have traditionally had a supervisory or oversight role, while futures trading and futures market regulation have fallen under the CFTC\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. As a result, any policy questions raised by the ongoing development of the OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures markets cross traditional jurisdictional lines and involve not only CFTC but also federal bank regulators and SEC. The cooperative efforts of these agencies, working with the Department of the Treasury and the financial industry, will be required to address such questions. As discussed, the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets provides one forum through which to coordinate interagency activities and address policy questions that cross jurisdictional lines.", "As we concluded in our May 1994 OTC derivatives report, the U.S. financial regulatory structure has not kept pace with the dramatic and rapid changes in the domestic and global financial markets. We noted that one issue needing to be addressed is how the U.S. regulatory system should be restructured to better reflect the realities of today\u2019s rapidly evolving global financial markets. Our conclusion was based partly on the finding that the development of new types of financial derivatives and their use by a variety of once separate industries, such as banking, futures, insurance, and securities, have made it more difficult to regulate them effectively under the current U.S. regulatory structure. The potential legal and regulatory issues raised by the evolving OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures markets under the CEA further illustrate such difficulty and reinforce the need to examine the existing U.S. regulatory structure. Ultimately, maintaining a globally competitive U.S. derivatives market will require balancing the goal of allowing the U.S. financial services industry to innovate and grow with the goal of protecting customers and the market, including its efficiency, fairness, and financial integrity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Industry Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the heads, or their designees, of CFTC, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and SEC.

CFTC, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and SEC provided us with written comments under a joint response as members of the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets.

The Working Group noted that it is effectively addressing intermarket financial coordination issues and that further discussion in that forum of issues we identify would be useful.", "The Futures Industry Association commented that the draft did not adequately address the question of whether or to what extent additional regulation of the OTC derivatives markets is warranted, and to the extent warranted, whether the CEA is the appropriate vehicle for such regulation. Similarly, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association stated that there has been no demonstration that participants would benefit from subjecting swaps to any form of regulation under the CEA. Our overall objective was to provide Congress with information on the legal and regulatory issues involving the CEA, not to determine the appropriate level of regulation for the OTC derivatives market or the specific vehicle for any such regulation. We identified regulatory gaps in this market in our May 1994 report on OTC derivatives and recently issued a report that discusses the actions taken by federal regulators and the industry since that time. Nonetheless, the issues that we discuss lead to the broader policy question of what the appropriate regulation is for the OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures markets. In our conclusions, we provide a framework for addressing this policy question and, in turn, related questions, such as whether the CEA is the appropriate vehicle for regulating swaps and other OTC derivatives.", "In a related comment, the Futures Industry Association noted that our draft asserts that financial products serving a risk-shifting function should be subject to similar regulatory treatment, even though the CEA has recognized through its statutory exclusions that the regulation of such products may appropriately differ depending on their nature and underlying market. Correspondingly, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association commented that risk-shifting activities related to foreign exchange and other transactions were specifically excluded from the CEA pursuant to the Treasury Amendment, demonstrating that Congress did not intend for the CEA to govern all financial transactions involving the transfer of risk. We do not assert that risk-shifting contracts should be subject to similar regulation. Rather, we note that the CEA covers futures contracts, which have been defined in a way that reflects their risk-shifting function. As a result, OTC derivatives serving a similar risk-shifting function as futures may fall within the definition of a futures contract and be subject to the CEA. We agree that the CEA\u2019s statutory exclusions demonstrate that Congress did not intend for the CEA to govern all risk-shifting contracts. However, these exclusions are not broad enough to provide similar treatment for all OTC derivatives, many of which, including swaps, did not exist when the exclusions were created. CFTC has exempted most swaps and other OTC derivatives from virtually all the CEA\u2019s requirements to provide them with greater legal certainty, but a question remains about whether swaps are futures and subject to the CEA. As we discuss, the possibility that swaps are futures continues to be a source of legal risk for equity swaps.", "In another related comment, the Chicago Board of Trade, Futures Industry Association, and Managed Futures Association noted that the CEA provides CFTC with the authority and flexibility to address issues raised by the evolving OTC derivatives and futures markets. We agree that the CEA, with its exemptive authority provision, does not prevent CFTC from addressing regulatory concerns raised by the OTC derivatives market, as needed. In our report, we state that CFTC could use its exemptive authority to address regulatory concerns raised by a swaps market development that is inconsistent with the conditions of the existing swaps exemption. However, we note that this approach could suggest that swaps are futures and introduce jurisdictional questions. We also note that the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets provides one forum through which to address such questions.", "The Chicago Board of Trade commented that, contrary to the impression created in the draft, jurisdictional ambiguities in the act (the definition of a futures contract and the Treasury Amendment) are not solely responsible for the disparate regulatory treatment of exchange and OTC markets. Instead, it cites the manner in which CFTC has chosen to use its authority as leading to this disparity. According to the exchange, CFTC did not use its exemptive authority in a way that is consistent with the 1992 act\u2019s legislative history\u2014that is, it did not use its authority in a fair and even-handed manner to products and systems sponsored by exchanges and nonexchanges. In a related comment, the Futures Industry Association noted that it agrees with the draft report\u2019s implicit assumption that CFTC\u2019s exchange exemption could be broadened. However, it stated that the exchanges must provide CFTC with greater specificity as to the nature of the products, trading mechanisms, and clearing structure that would be subject to exemptive relief. We agree with the Chicago Board of Trade that the act\u2019s jurisdictional ambiguities are not solely responsible for the regulatory differences between the OTC derivatives and futures markets. Our report states that CFTC provided less regulatory relief under its exchange exemption than it did under its OTC derivatives exemptions. We also agree with the Futures Industry Association that greater specificity could aid CFTC in the use of its exemptive authority to provide additional regulatory relief to the exchanges. However, in granting the exchange exemption, CFTC followed the congressional admonition to use its exemptive authority sparingly and not to cause a wide-scale deregulation of markets falling under the act. Given the different ways of interpreting the 1992 act\u2019s legislative history, we note in our conclusions that one of the unresolved issues involving the CEA is the extent to which CFTC should use its exemptive authority to provide greater regulatory relief to the futures exchanges.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairperson of CFTC, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Chairman of SEC, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other interested parties.

As we discuss in our conclusions, Congress and federal regulators will need to consider the similarities and differences between the OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures markets in addressing the broader policy question concerning the appropriate regulation for these markets. We agree that important distinctions exist between OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures that have policy implications, and we amplified our discussion of these distinctions. 2. The association commented that our draft cited the CEA as embracing the principle of functional regulation. We eliminated the term functional regulation because of the confusion over its meaning, but our message has not changed. That is, the CEA covers futures, which CFTC and the courts have defined in a way that reflects their risk-shifting function. As a result, contracts serving a similar risk-shifting function as futures may fall within the definition of a futures contract and be subject to the CEA. 3. The association commented that our draft report listed the necessary elements of a futures contract without mentioning that such elements are not necessarily sufficient to define a futures contract. We modified the report accordingly. 4. The association commented that section 3 of the CEA specifically identifies transactions in contracts for future delivery \u201ccommonly conducted on a board of trade\u201d as the type of activity requiring regulation under the CEA. It further noted that this statement reflects a sensitivity to the regulatory significance of distinctions between exchange trading and private negotiation of contracts that is equally relevant today. We agree that the exchange-trading requirement is central to the CEA\u2019s regulatory structure and recognize that differences exist between OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures that may warrant differences in their regulation. In that regard, our conclusions provide a framework for determining the appropriate regulation for the OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures markets, focusing on the public interest in these markets that needs to be protected. As part of that framework, we note that the nature of the market participant, trading environment, and other factors should be considered in determining the regulations needed to protect the public interest. 5. The association noted that the draft report overstated the current level of convergence between the OTC derivatives and futures market. We revised the report to amplify our discussion of the similarities and differences between the OTC derivatives and futures markets. 6. The association disagreed with the draft report\u2019s observation that participation of dealers in the OTC derivatives markets implies that such markets are centralized. We did not intend to imply that the swaps market is centralized and have revised the draft accordingly. We recognize that swaps continue to be privately negotiated between counterparties and are neither traded on a centralized facility nor cleared through a clearinghouse. We note that swaps have followed a similar evolutionary path as exchange-traded futures. However, we recognize that the extent to which the swaps market, or some part thereof, will continue to evolve in the same way as the exchange-traded futures market is unknown. 7. The association commented that, with respect to the distinction between futures and forwards, our draft report sometimes fails to distinguish between the nature of the obligation to make delivery and what constitutes delivery. Our discussion of the disagreement between CFTC and the federal district court on where to draw the line regarding the delivery requirement for Brent Oil contracts was meant to illustrate this difference. We also note in our conclusions that one of the unresolved issues is the CEA\u2019s lack of criteria for distinguishing unregulated forwards from regulated futures. 8. The association commented that the losses associated with hedge-to-arrive contracts do not appear to arise from the character of the delivery obligations. We note that unusual factors, such as high grain prices and poor weather conditions, have resulted in financial problems for parties to these contracts. However, we also note that the legal risk facing some hedge-to-arrive contracts due to the possibility that they could be illegal futures or trade options has complicated matters. This legal risk may persist, even in the absence of the factors contributing to financial risk. 9. The association commented that the Treasury Amendment\u2019s scope was broader than the restricted view presented in the draft report.

We agree that important distinctions exist between OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures that have policy implications, and we amplified our discussion of these distinctions. 2. The association commented that, although OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures serve a similar risk-shifting function, many other financial transactions, including those involving securities, loans, guarantees, and various types of insurance contracts, can serve such a function. It further noted that attempting to implement a regulatory framework that would subject every form of financial or commercial activity that involves the transfer of risk to regulation under the CEA would clearly be inappropriate. We agree that it would be inappropriate to subject all instruments that can serve a risk-shifting function to the CEA. However, as CFTC and others have recognized, swaps and other OTC derivatives resemble futures not only in terms of their economic function but also in terms of their design. Given the market\u2019s continued growth and development, questions remain about the extent to which additional regulation of the OTC derivatives market is needed. In our conclusions, we provide a framework for determining the appropriate regulation for the OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures markets, focusing on the public interest in these markets that needs to be protected. 3. The association commented that the draft report\u2019s assertion that swaps are a centralized market is not true. We did not intend to imply that the swaps market is currently centralized and have revised the draft accordingly. We recognize that swaps continue to be privately negotiated between counterparties and are neither traded on a centralized facility nor cleared through a clearinghouse.

The association commented that the draft report portrayed swaps as a centralized market by incorrectly asserting that swaps participants are actively discussing the possibility of establishing a swaps clearinghouse. We discuss the potential for a swaps clearinghouse to illustrate an example of a development that could trigger a greater federal interest in the market. It was not intended to suggest that the swaps market has evolved into a centralized market, and we revised the draft accordingly. 5. The association noted that more corporations use swaps than exchange-traded futures to meet their risk-management needs, disproving the draft report\u2019s assertion that swaps and exchange-traded futures share the same general market participants. Our point was that swaps and exchange-traded futures are used by many of the same general types of market participants, not that swaps and exchange-traded futures are used by all of the same market participants. We revised the report to clarify this point. We still note that some of the same firms, namely banks and other financial firms acting as dealers, use both swaps and exchange-traded futures because of the complementary relationship of the contracts. 6. The association commented that few incidents exist where swaps participants believed that they were treated unfairly by their counterparties, which demonstrated both the ability of swaps participants to protect their rights and the fact that such incidents represent bilateral disputes with no implications for third parties. It added that the draft report offers no evidence that additional regulatory protection is needed or desired by swaps participants. We are currently reviewing OTC derivatives sales practices and will report our findings separately. 7. The association commented that the swaps activities of institutions that are thought to be subject to systemic risk and/or are supported by public insurance are closely supervised by various regulatory agencies. As we discussed in our May 1994 report on OTC derivatives, regulatory gaps existed in the OTC derivatives market that could heighten the potential for systemic risk. We have issued a report that updates our 1994 report and discusses actions taken by federal regulators and the industry since that time. 8.

In our conclusions, we provide a framework for determining the appropriate regulation for the OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures markets, focusing on the public interest in the markets that needs to be protected. 2. The association noted that the swaps exemption must be periodically revisited to make sure that the conditions set by CFTC for the exemption continue to make sense. It also noted that CFTC must also reexamine the exemption granted to exchange-traded products. We agree that one alternative is to have CFTC revisit the exemptions, as needed, to address regulatory concerns raised by market changes and to ensure regulations do not impede market innovation and competition. However, we note that using such an approach for exempted swaps could suggest swaps are futures and introduce jurisdictional questions.
