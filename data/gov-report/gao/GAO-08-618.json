GAO was asked to determine if Medicare providers have unpaid federal taxes and, if so, to (1) determine the magnitude of such debts, (2) identify examples of Medicare providers that have engaged in abusive or potentially criminal activities, and (3) determine whether CMS prevents delinquent taxpayers from enrolling in Medicare or levies payments to pay taxes. To determine amount of unpaid taxes owed by Medicare providers, GAO compared claim payment data from CMS and tax debt data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In addition, GAO reviewed policies, procedures, and regulations related to Medicare. GAO also performed additional investigative activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of data provided by CMS and IRS indicates that over 27,000 health care providers (i.e., about 6 percent of all such providers) paid under Medicare during calendar year 2006 had payroll and other agreed-to federal tax debts totaling over $2 billion. The $2 billion in unpaid tax debts only includes those debts reported on a tax return or assessed by IRS through its enforcement programs. This $2 billion figure is understated because some of these Medicare providers owed taxes under separate tax identification numbers (TIN) from the TINs that received the Medicare payments or they did not file their tax returns. We selected 25 Medicare providers with significant tax debt for more in-depth investigation of the extent and nature of any abusive or potentially criminal activity. Our investigation found abusive and potentially criminal activity, including failure to remit to IRS payroll taxes withheld from their employees. Rather than fulfill their role as \"trustees\" of this money and forward it to IRS as required by law, these Medicare providers diverted the money for other purposes. Willful failure to remit payroll taxes is a felony under U.S. law. Furthermore, individuals associated with some of these providers at the same time used payroll taxes withheld from employees for personal gain. Some of these individuals accumulated substantial wealth and assets, including million-dollar houses and luxury vehicles, while failing to pay their federal taxes. In addition, some providers received Medicare payments even though they had quality-of-care issues, such as losing track of a patient in their care who has not been found. CMS has not developed a policy to require contractors (1) to obtain consent for IRS disclosure of federal tax debts and (2) to screen providers for unpaid taxes. Further complicating this issue, absent consent by the taxpayer, which CMS does not require, federal law generally prohibits the disclosure of taxpayer data to CMS or its contractors. IRS can continuously levy up to 15 percent of each payment made to a federal payee--for example, a Medicare hospital--until that tax debt is paid. However, CMS has not incorporated most of its Medicare payments into the continuous levy program. As a result, for calendar year 2006, the government lost opportunities to potentially collect over $140 million in unpaid taxes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report continues a body of work that has identified federal  contractors, grant recipients, and exempt organizations with unpaid  federal taxes. In hearings held by this subcommittee, we testified that  Department of Defense (DOD), federal civilian agency and General  Services Administration (GSA) contractors abused the federal tax system  with little consequence. Because of the significance of the issues raised  during these hearings, you asked us to provide additional information  about whether health care providers who were paid by the government for  Medicaid and Medicare-related services were engaged in similar tax  abuses and to provide recommendations to increase the effectiveness and  efficiency of tax revenue collections from federal contractors under the  Federal Payment Levy Program.", "This is the third in a series of reports and testimonies to respond to your  request. In March 2007, we testified that Medicare physicians, health  professionals, and suppliers paid under the Supplemental Medical  Insurance program, also known as Medicare Part B, had abused the  federal tax system while doing business with the federal government. In  November 2007, we testified and reported on Medicaid health care  providers from seven selected states that also abused the federal tax  system.

We matched the list of Medicare providers with IRS  tax debts using taxpayer identification numbers (TIN). To identify specific  instances of abusive and potentially criminal activities by selected  Medicare providers and their owners, we performed investigative work on  a nonrepresentative selection of 25 Medicare providers. We selected these  25 providers using primarily the amount of tax debt and number of  delinquent tax periods as selection factors. For these 25 cases, we  reviewed copies of automated tax transcripts and other tax records (for  example, revenue officers\u2019 notes) and performed additional searches of  criminal, financial, health care, and public records. To determine whether  CMS prevents health care providers from enrolling in Medicare or levies  Medicare payments to pay taxes, we examined the CMS regulations,  policies, and procedures for conducting determinations in the enrollment  approval process. We also interviewed officials from CMS, two large CMS  Medicare contractors, IRS, and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  (Treasury) Financial Management Service (FMS) concerning any barriers  to levying Medicare payments. To determine the potential levy collections  on Medicare payments during calendar year 2006, we used 15 percent of  the total paid claim or total tax debt amount reported to the continuous  levy program, whichever was less.

Medicare benefits are divided into four parts: (1) Part A consists of  inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, qualified home health  care, and hospice care; (2) Part B includes physicians\u2019 services, outpatient  hospital services, treatment for end-stage renal disease, laboratory  services, durable medical equipment, certain elements of home health  care, and other medical services and supplies; (3) Part C, the Medicare  Advantage program, includes traditional health maintenance  organizations, preferred provider organizations, and private fee-for-service  plans; and (4) Part D offers beneficiaries an outpatient prescription drug  benefit through private plans that contract with Medicare.

Employers are subject to civil and criminal penalties if they do not  remit payroll taxes to the federal government. When an employer  withholds taxes from an employee\u2019s wages, the employer is deemed to  have a responsibility to hold these amounts \u201cin trust\u201d for the federal  government until the employer makes a federal tax deposit in that amount.  When these withheld amounts are not forwarded to the federal  government, the employer is liable for these amounts as well as the  employer\u2019s matching Federal Insurance Contribution Act contributions for  Social Security and Medicare. Individuals within the business (e.g.,  corporate officers) may be held personally liable for the withheld amounts  not forwarded and assessed a civil monetary penalty known as a trust  fund recovery penalty (TFRP). Failure to remit payroll taxes can also be a  criminal felony offense punishable by imprisonment of not more than 5  years, while the failure to properly segregate payroll taxes can be a  criminal misdemeanor offense punishable by imprisonment of up to a  year.", "The law imposes no penalties on an employee for the employer\u2019s failure to  remit payroll taxes since the employer is responsible for submitting the  amounts withheld. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds are  subsidized or made whole for unpaid payroll taxes by the general fund.  Thus, personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and other  government revenues are used to pay for these shortfalls to the Social  Security and Medicare trust funds.", "A substantial amount of the unpaid federal taxes shown in IRS records  owed by Medicare providers had been outstanding for several years. As  reflected in figure 2, about 54 percent of the $2 billion in unpaid taxes  were for tax periods from calendar year 2000 through calendar year 2004,  and approximately 32 percent of the unpaid taxes were for tax periods  prior to calendar year 2000.", "Our previous work has shown that as unpaid taxes age, the likelihood of  collecting all or a portion of the amounts owed decreases. This is, in part,  because of the continued accrual of interest and penalties on the  outstanding tax debt, which, over time, can dwarf the original tax  obligation. The amount of unpaid federal taxes reported above does not  include all tax debts owed by Medicare providers because of statutory  provisions that give IRS a finite period under which it can seek to collect  unpaid taxes. Generally, there is a 10-year statutory collection period  beyond which IRS is prohibited from attempting to collect tax debt.  Consequently, if the Medicare providers owe federal taxes beyond the 10- year statutory collection period, the older tax debt may have been  removed from IRS\u2019s records. We were unable to determine the amount of  tax debt that had been removed.", "As shown in figure 3, Medicare providers did not disclose to IRS a  significant amount of taxes owed instead the taxes were discovered  through IRS examination or investigation. Specifically, $784 million, or  about 39 percent of the $2 billion in unpaid taxes, was assessed by an IRS  examination or investigation. Medicare providers did report about   $857 million of the tax debt amount.

The IRS tax database reflected only the  amount of unpaid federal taxes either reported by the individual or  business on a tax return or assessed by IRS through its various  enforcement programs. The IRS database does not reflect amounts owed  by businesses and individuals that have not filed tax returns and for which  IRS has not assessed tax amounts due. For example, during our audit, we  identified several instances from our 25 case studies in which Medicare  providers failed to file tax returns for a particular tax period and IRS had  not assessed taxes for these tax periods. Consequently, while these  providers had unpaid federal taxes, they were listed in IRS records as  having no unpaid taxes for those periods. Further, our analysis did not  attempt to account for businesses or individuals that purposely  underreported income and were not specifically identified by IRS as owing  the additional federal taxes. According to IRS, underreporting of income  accounted for more than 80 percent of the estimated $345 billion annual  gross tax gap. Finally, our analysis did not attempt to identify Medicare  providers that owed taxes under separate TINs from those that received  the Medicare payments. For example, sole proprietors and certain LLCs  may file Medicare claims under their employer identification numbers. If  these Medicare providers owe personal income taxes the analysis will not  capture the amount of the personal income taxes owed.

All of these  cases involved Medicare providers that had unpaid payroll taxes, many  dating as far back as the early 1990s. Rather than fulfill their role as  \u201ctrustees\u201d of this money and forward it to IRS as required by law, these  Medicare providers diverted the money for other purposes. IRS had TFRPs  in effect for 11 of the 25 business cases at the time of our review. In  addition, as discussed previously, willful failure to remit payroll taxes is a  criminal felony offense punishable by imprisonment up to 5 years.", "Our review of selected Medicare providers revealed significant challenges  that IRS faces in its enforcement of tax laws, a continuing high-risk area  for IRS. Although the nation\u2019s tax system is built upon voluntary  compliance, when businesses and individuals fail to pay voluntarily, IRS  has a number of enforcement tools, including the use of levies, to compel  compliance or elicit payment. Our review of the 25 Medicare providers  found that IRS attempted to work with the businesses and individuals to  achieve voluntary compliance, pursuing enforcement actions later rather  than earlier in the collection process. Our review of IRS records with  respect to the 25 cases showed that IRS did not issue paper levies to the  Medicare contractors to levy the payments of Medicare providers for 10 of  the 25 cases. As a result, many of the Medicare providers in our case  studies continued to receive Medicare payments while failing to pay their  federal taxes.", "Our investigations revealed that despite owing substantial amounts of  federal taxes to IRS, some owners of Medicare providers had substantial  personal assets\u2014including multimillion-dollar homes and luxury cars. For  example, the auditor for one Medicare provider found that the owner  misappropriated assets for personal gain. At the same time as owing taxes,  the owner was building a multimillion-dollar residence and had over   $1.5 million in home furnishings and artwork.", "In addition to failure to pay taxes, our investigations also revealed that  certain Medicare providers had significant quality-of-care and other  problems. For example, several cases involved quality-of-care problems,  including patient neglect, for example, losing track of a patient in the  provider\u2019s care who has not been found and not taking appropriate actions  to prevent a patient\u2019s suicide. In addition, a couple of nursing homes were  cited by regulators for violating patient health and safety regulations. In  another case, an owner of one Medicare provider was excluded from the  Medicare program for submitting false Medicare claims, and in another  case a provider continued to receive Medicare payments even though it  was barred from receiving government contracts. In yet another case, the  owner used funds from the business to fund the owner\u2019s statewide  political campaign during the time the business was not paying its payroll  taxes.", "Table 1 highlights 10 of the 25 cases of Medicare providers with unpaid  taxes.

IRS records indicated that the company owners  attempted to conceal assets through questionable business entities  such as trusts, partnerships, LLCs, and other fictitious entities. While  the nursing home owed taxes, the owner possessed a $1 million  personal residence and an additional $1 million piece of real estate. IRS  records also showed that the owner purchased luxury cars and other  personal items from money funneled through a charitable foundation.  Specifically, the company owner donated large sums of money to the  foundation then claimed the deductions on their personal tax return  while purchasing expensive personal items.", "Case 5: The nursing home has a history of tax noncompliance since the  late 1990s. The nursing home received over $1 million in Medicare  payments while owing more than $11 million in tax debt. IRS records  indicated that the nursing home owner has attempted to shield income  through partnerships, tiered agreements, and leasehold agreements. In  addition, the owner has various companies using over 100 bank  accounts, wire transfers, an overseas billing company, and a large  financial transaction to an overseas bank account. The nursing home  has been sanctioned by regulators for quality-of-care deficiencies so  serious that the home was barred from accepting new admissions.", "Case 6: The nursing home received over $4 million in Medicare  payments and hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal government  contracts while simultaneously owing over $4 million in tax debt.  Although the owners of the nursing home claimed an inability to pay  delinquent taxes because of lack of resources, one owner constructed a  $4 million home while the other owner lived in a multimillion-dollar  home while owing taxes. IRS records indicated that the owners also  underreported income on their personal tax returns and received  financial compensation, such as salary and bonuses, from another  company to disguise reporting of income. IRS records indicated that  one company owner may relocate overseas to avoid paying taxes.", "Case 10: The company received over $21 million in Medicare payments  while simultaneously owing over $15 million in tax debt.

Even if such requirements did exist, absent taxpayer consent,  federal law generally prohibits IRS from disclosing taxpayer data, and  consequently, CMS and its contractors have no access to tax data directly  from IRS. In addition, CMS has not fully participated in the continuous  levy program. Specifically, CMS has not incorporated Medicare fee for  service payments in the continuous levy program. As a result, the federal  government potentially lost opportunities to collect over $140 million in  unpaid taxes during calendar year 2006.", "CMS Medicare contractors are generally responsible for screening  Medicare providers prior to enrollment into the Medicare program.  However, as part of the screening process, neither CMS policies nor CMS  regulations require Medicare contractors to consider the tax debts or tax- related abuses of prospective Medicare providers or conduct any criminal  background checks on these individuals. Medicare contractors are  required to review the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) exclusion  list and the GSA debarment list; however, these lists do not include all  individuals or businesses that have abused the federal tax system.", "Exclusion of certain individuals and entities from participation in  Medicare programs is made by statute. The statute provides for both  mandatory and permissive exclusions. Mandatory exclusions are confined  to health-related criminal offenses, while permissive exclusions concern  primarily non-health-related offenses. The Federal Acquisition Regulation  cites conviction of tax evasion as one of the causes for debarment;  indictment on tax evasion charges is cited as a cause for suspension.  Moreover, while a felony offense, the deliberate failure to remit taxes, in  particular payroll taxes, will likely not result in an individual or entity  being placed on the OIG exclusion or GSA debarment lists unless the  taxpayer is convicted. Based on our work, we believe that it is unlikely  that companies will be excluded or debarred for failure to pay delinquent  payroll taxes.", "Even if a taxpayer is convicted of tax evasion or other tax-related crime,  the individual or business still may not be placed on the OIG exclusion or  GSA debarment lists. To place them on these lists, federal agencies must  identify those individuals and businesses and provide them with due  process. As part of due process, the agency must determine whether the  exclusion or debarment is in the government\u2019s interest. For example, in  our March 2007 testimony, we noted several cases involving conviction of  tax-related crimes where the providers were not reported on the OIG  exclusion or GSA debarment lists.", "Further complicating CMS decision making on the consideration of tax  debts for Medicare, federal law does not permit IRS to disclose taxpayer  information, including tax debts, to CMS or Medicare contractor officials  unless the taxpayer consents, which CMS does not currently require.  Thus, certain tax debt information can only be discovered from public  records if IRS files a federal tax lien against the property of a tax debtor or  a record of conviction for tax offense is publicly available. Consequently,  CMS and its contractors do not have ready access to information on  unpaid tax debts to consider in making decisions on Medicare providers.", "Further, CMS has not implemented a process for continuously levying  payments made by Medicare contractors. As a result, IRS does not  capture at least a portion of payments made to Medicare providers that  owe federal tax debts. Thus, none of the 25 providers on which we  performed a detailed review had their Medicare fee-for-service payments  subject to the continuous levy program. As stated earlier, federal law  allows IRS to continuously levy federal vendor payments until the tax debt  is paid. IRS implemented this authority by creating a continuous levy  program that utilizes FMS\u2019s Treasury Offset Program system. In July 2001,  we reported that CMS did not have any plan to participate in the  continuous levy program and we recommended that the Commissioners of  IRS and FMS work with CMS to develop plans to include Medicare  payments in the continuous levy program. In July 2006, IRS began to  pursue HHS participation in the continuous levy program through the  Federal Contractor Tax Compliance (FCTC) Task Force, a multiagency  group dedicated to improving the continuous levy process. In response to  IRS\u2019s request, and a month before your subcommittee\u2019s hearing on  Medicare physicians, health professionals, and suppliers that owe federal  taxes, CMS began to participate in the FCTC Task Force meetings in  February 2007.", "According to CMS officials, CMS plans to incorporate all payments made  through HIGLAS, Medicare\u2019s central accounting system, into the levy  program by October 2008.

Our analysis included all Medicare  providers (i.e., Parts A, B, C and D) that were paid during calendar year  2006. We matched the Medicare payment data to the IRS unpaid  assessment data using the taxpayer identification number (TIN) field. To  avoid overestimating the amount owed by Medicare providers with unpaid  tax debts and to capture only significant tax debts, we excluded from our  analysis tax debts and paid claims meeting specific criteria to establish a  minimum threshold in the amount of tax debt and in the amount of paid  claims to be considered when determining whether a tax debt is  significant. The criteria we used to exclude tax debts are as follows:  tax debts that IRS classified as compliance assessments or memo  accounts for financial reporting,  tax debts from calendar year 2006 tax periods, and  total unpaid taxes and Medicare paid claims of less than $100.", "The criteria above were used to exclude tax debts that might be under  dispute or generally duplicative or invalid and tax debts that are recently  incurred.

We have revised the report to state that CMS reported that it received  970 paper levies from IRS revenue officers totaling $109 million. We  also noted that while CMS did not report the amount it actually  collected from these paper levies, we do not believe paper levies are a  significant source of revenue collection.  3.  We have revised the report to include the amount of Medicare  payments that are subject to the continuous levy program.  4.  IRS provided documentation that showed that in July 2006 IRS began  to pursue Department of Health and Human Services participation in  the continuous levy program through the Federal Contractor Tax  Compliance Task Force.  5.  The IRS/CMS/SSA data match program is not used to collect  delinquent federal taxes. Therefore, a discussion of this program is not  relevant to our report.  6.  We have revised the report to clarify that the 27,000 Medicare  providers with unpaid federal taxes encompasses all Medicare  providers that have received payments during calendar year 2006. This  includes all Medicare providers for Parts A, B, C, and D. Our analysis  only included Medicare providers that had TINs that received Medicare  payments greater than $100. As our draft report states, we believe that  our estimate is substantially understated because, among other things,  our analysis does not include Medicare providers that owed taxes  under separate TINs from those that received the Medicare payments.  7.  In our draft report, we stated that we believe that it is unlikely that  companies will be excluded or debarred for failure to pay delinquent  payroll taxes. Although we appreciate CMS\u2019s solicitation, we are not  making any recommendations on the use of the existing debarment  system to collect unpaid taxes at this time.  8.
