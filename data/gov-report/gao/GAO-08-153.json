Accordingly, GAO cannot determine the extent to which the Iraqi government is spending its 2007 capital projects budget. In its September 2007 Iraqi benchmark assessment, the administration reported that Iraq's central government ministries had spent 24 percent of their 2007 capital projects budget, as of July 15, 2007. However, this report is not consistent with Iraq's official expenditure reports, which show that the central ministries had spent only 4.4 percent of their investment budget as of August 2007. The discrepancies between the official and unofficial data highlight uncertainties about the sources and use of Iraq's expenditure data. The government of Iraq faces many challenges that limit its ability to spend its capital project budget. Violence and sectarian strife delay capital budget execution by increasing the time and cost needed to implement contracts. Recent refugee flows and the de-Ba'athification process have contributed to the exodus of skilled labor from Iraq. In addition, U.S. and foreign officials also noted that weaknesses in Iraqi procurement, budgeting, and accounting procedures impede completion of capital projects. For example, according to the State Department, Iraq's Contracting Committee requires about a dozen signatures to approve projects exceeding $10 million, which slows the process. U.S. agencies have undertaken a variety of programs to help Iraq execute its capital projects budget, although it is not clear what impact these efforts have had to date. U.S. agencies supported new efforts in 2007 targeting Iraq's ability to spend capital budget funds, including an office to provide procurement assistance to ministries and provinces and a new position in the U.S. Embassy to coordinate with senior Iraqi government officials on budget execution and oversee related U.S. assistance efforts. In addition, improving Iraqi government budget execution is part of a broader U.S. assistance effort to improve the capacity of the Iraqi government. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has trained 500 ministry officials in procurement or budget execution. USAID also led an effort to implement an automated financial management information system for the Iraqi government, although this program was suspended in June 2007 following the kidnapping of five contractors involved in the project. In addition, U.S. advisors work directly with key Iraqi ministries to assist with budget execution and procurement, among other responsibilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The President\u2019s February 2007 New Way Forward strategy for Iraq  identified Iraq\u2019s inability to spend its resources to rebuild infrastructure  and deliver essential services as a critical economic challenge to Iraq\u2019s  self-reliance.

A  World Bank report notes that corruption undermines the Iraqi  governments\u2019 ability to make effective use of current reconstruction  assistance. According to a State Department document, widespread  corruption undermines efforts to develop the government\u2019s capacity by  robbing it of needed resources, some of which are used to fund  insurgency; by eroding popular faith in democratic institutions, perceived  as run by corrupt political elites; and by spurring capital flight and  reducing economic growth.", "U.S. and international officials have cited many weaknesses in Iraqi  procurement procedures and practices. The World Bank found that Iraq\u2019s  procurement procedures and practices are not in line with generally  accepted public procurement practices, such as effective bid protest  mechanisms and transparency on final contract awards. Iraqi procurement  laws and regulations are composed of a mixture of Saddam Hussein-era  rules, CPA Order 87 requirements, and recent Iraqi government budgetary  practices. The complexity of Iraq\u2019s contracting regulations combined with  the inexperience of many new Iraqi officials has led to a pervasive lack of  understanding of these laws and regulations, according to State officials.  The Iraqi government has sponsored conferences on budget execution in  2007 to clarify budgeting and procurement rules and procedures and  issued regulations for implementing Order 87. However, laws and  regulations are still complex and are frequently confusing to implement in  practice, according to a Treasury official.", "U.S., coalition, and international officials have identified difficulties in  complying with Iraqi procurement laws and regulations as a major  impediment to spending Iraqi capital project budgets. For example,  according to an Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) official,  the Iraqi procurement process often requires a minimum of three bids  through a competitive bidding process. However, when less than three  technically qualified bids are received, all bids are thrown out and the  project cycles through a new round of bidding. The result has been fewer  bids submitted in subsequent rounds. In addition, Iraqi procurement  regulations require about a dozen signatures to approve oil and electricity  contracts exceeding $10 million, which also slows the process, according  to U.S. officials. Procurements over this amount must be approved by the  High Contracting Commission, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister,  which causes further delays. U.S. advisors to the Ministry of Oil noted that  the $10 million threshold is far too low, given the size of infrastructure  projects in the energy sector. In June 2007, the Council of Ministers raised  the dollar thresholds for contracts requiring High Contracting Commission  approval from $10 million to $20 million for the Ministries of Defense,  Electricity, Oil, and Trade, and raised the level from $5 million to $10  million for other ministries. However, the embassy noted that the  increased thresholds may not improve budget execution without an  increase in the number of trained personnel or technical assistance from  the Ministry of Planning.", "Other features in the Iraqi budgetary and accounting systems adversely  affect the tracking of capital projects spending. For example, government  spending on reconstruction projects is not coordinated with spending for  donor-financed projects, according to the World Bank. As a result,  significant donor-financed expenditures are not included in the budget. In  addition, according to U.S. officials, the budget is appropriated and  tracked at too high a level of aggregation to allow meaningful tracking of  decisions because multiple projects can be combined on a single line.  Reconciliation of budget accounts is often impossible as budget execution  reports are submitted late or with incomplete information. In addition, as  discussed earlier, in response to IMF requirements, the government of Iraq  began implementing a new budget classification and chart of accounts in  2007 that does not provide a separate breakout of capital projects  spending.

U.S. officials reported that the government of Iraq  uses a manual reporting system to audit expenditures, which does not  provide for real-time reports. According to a Treasury official, the Iraqi  government reports capital expenditures by ministry but not by specific  project, which limits its ability to track capital projects expenditures. The  World Bank reported that reconciliation of government of Iraq accounts is  impossible because the government lacks consolidated information on the  exact number of government bank accounts it has and the balances in  them. The World Bank also noted that provincial governments do not  provide an accounting of funds they receive. In addition, the independent  public accounting firm for the Development Fund for Iraq reported  numerous internal control weaknesses in Iraqi ministries for 2006,  including that Iraqi ministries do not have policies and procedures  manuals that detail comprehensive financial and internal controls. It also  reported that the ministries do not have unified procurement policies and  procedures, do not have proper project management and monitoring  systems, and lack written project management policies and procedures  manuals.

However, it is not clear what impact these efforts have had to date due to  limitations with available data, outlined earlier in this report, and because  much of this assistance specifically designed to improve budget execution  was established too recently for U.S. agencies to fully evaluate them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["To support continued economic growth and improve the delivery of  services, the government of Iraq needs to make significant investment in  its infrastructure. Such investments come from the government\u2019s efficient  execution of its capital budget. The administration\u2019s September 2007  Benchmark Assessment Report concluded that the government of Iraq had  steadily improved its ability to execute capital projects spending as a  result of U.S. technical assistance. However, the additional information  provided by Treasury and State in commenting on a draft of this report did  not reassure GAO that accurate and reliable data on Iraq\u2019s budget exists.  State and Treasury continue to cite unofficial expenditure data to support  assertions that the government of Iraq is becoming more effective in  spending its capital project budget, even though the data differ  significantly from the official expenditure figures generated under a new  IMF-compliant chart of accounts. The discrepancies between the  unofficial and official data highlight the ambiguities about the extent to  which the government of Iraq is spending its resources on capital projects.  Thus, we do not believe these data should be used to draw firm  conclusions about whether the Iraqi government is making progress in  executing its capital projects budget. The lack of consistent and timely  expenditure data limits transparency over Iraq\u2019s execution of its  multibillion dollar 2007 capital budget and makes it difficult to assess the  impact of U.S. assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure more accurate reporting of the government of Iraq\u2019s  spending of its capital projects budget, we recommend that the Secretary  of Treasury work with the government of Iraq and relevant U.S. agencies  to enhance the Treasury department\u2019s ability to report accurate and  reliable expenditure data from the ministries and provinces. This reporting  should be based on the IMF-compliant standards rather than unofficial  data sources that are of questionable accuracy and reliability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Departments of Defense, State, the  Treasury, and USAID. Treasury and State provided written comments,  which are reprinted in appendixes IV and V. Treasury, State, and USAID  also provided technical comments and suggested wording changes that we  incorporated as appropriate. DOD did not comment on the report.", "Treasury and State raised several concerns in commenting on our draft  report. First, Treasury stated that our analysis of Iraq\u2019s budget execution  was based on incomplete and unofficial reporting, in particular, the  unofficial July 15, 2007 data used to comply with a congressional reporting  requirement (the September 2007 Iraq Benchmark Assessment Report).  The administration highlighted this unofficial data in the September 2007  benchmark report to Congress to assert that Iraq\u2019s central government and  provinces were becoming more effective at spending their capital budgets.  We do not believe these data should be used to draw firm conclusions  about the Iraqi government\u2019s progress in spending its capital budget. We  agree that the unofficial data the administration used in the report to  Congress do not portray a full and accurate picture of the situation.  Accordingly, we compared these data with official Iraqi Ministry of  Finance data to assess the extent to which the Iraqis had spent their  capital projects budget. Since the spending gap between the  administration\u2019s unofficial data and the Ministry of Finance\u2019s official data  is strikingly large, we recommend that the Department of Treasury work  with the Ministry of Finance to reconcile these differences.", "Second, Treasury stated that our report incorrectly concluded that capital  spending is only contained in the Iraqi budget item for \u201cnonfinancial  assets\u201d (which we refer to as \u201cinvestment\u201d). State made a similar  comment. Treasury and State asserted that capital spending is spread  through many chapters in the new chart of accounts and that the amount  is higher than the 4.4 percent cited in our report. However, State and  Treasury did not provide us with evidence to demonstrate which Iraqi  accounts included additional capital expenditures.", "Third, Treasury questioned our comparison of 2006 and 2007 Iraqi  spending as displayed in appendix II. Treasury stated that it is misleading  to compare 2006 and 2007 spending levels because of changes in Iraqi  spending accounts between the 2 years. We added this note of caution to  appendix II. However, we also made adjustments to account for the  differences in the budget classification systems, thereby enabling valid  comparisons between 2006 and 2007 data. Table 4 outlines the key  differences in the 2006 and 2007 classification systems. After updating the  draft report with data through August 2007, budget execution ratios in  2007 are still lower in most cases than corresponding ratios in 2006. We  believe this analysis provides additional perspective on the comparisons  between 2006 and 2007 expenditures made in the administration\u2019s  September 2007 Benchmark Assessment Report to Congress.", "State also raised several concerns in commenting on a draft of this report.  First, State commented that the draft report fails to accurately portray the  \u201ctangible progress\u201d that the central government and provincial  governments have made in budget execution. State commented that this  progress represents a tangible example of Iraq\u2019s leaders working together  successfully. However, we do not believe these data are sufficiently  reliable to conclude that U.S. assistance efforts have already achieved  success helping the Iraqi government execute its capital budget.", "Second, State attributed the discrepancy between the official and  unofficial data cited in our report to \u201ca time lag in data collection\u201d and  asserted that the July 15 data are representative of the government of  Iraq\u2019s performance as of the publication of the administration\u2019s September  2007 Benchmark Assessment Report. After providing our draft report to  State for comment, we received updated data from Treasury that clearly  refutes State\u2019s comment. These updated data show that the central  ministries spent 4.4 percent of their investment budget through August  2007, raising questions about the unofficial data reported to Congress in  the administration\u2019s September 2007 benchmark report.", "Finally, State commented that the amount of money committed and  dispersed in the provinces during 2007 is \u201cespecially impressive.\u201d  However, as we noted in our report, commitments do not represent  expenditures. The absence of provincial spending data in official Ministry  of Finance reporting makes it difficult to determine the extent to which  the Iraqi government was spending its 2007 capital projects funds. As  Treasury noted in their comments, the official Ministry of Finance  reporting does not show provincial spending and is working to determine  the discrepancy.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees.

We undertook this review under the  Comptroller General\u2019s authority to conduct reviews on his own initiative,  and in recognition of broad congressional interest in Iraq and the critical  importance of Iraqi capital expenditures in rebuilding its infrastructure.", "To examine the data the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad uses to measure Iraqi  government spending, we obtained expenditure data from the U.S.  Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and  interviewed knowledgeable U.S. agency officials. We reviewed three  different sets of data on Iraqi government expenditures: official monthly  expenditure reports from the Ministry of Finance through August 2007;  unofficial Ministry of Finance data on expenditures by central ministries,  as of July 15, 2007; and U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) data  on expenditures by Iraq\u2019s provincial governments, as of October 21, 2007.  The official Ministry of Finance expenditure reports reflected a much  lower rate of spending on capital projects than the unofficial Ministry of  Finance and unofficial PRT data showed. We did not independently verify  the precision of the data on Iraq\u2019s budget execution. However, the  disparity between the different sets of data calls into question their  reliability and whether they can be used to draw firm conclusions about  the extent to which the Iraqi government has increased its spending on  capital projects in 2007, compared with 2006. We are presenting the PRT  data in appendix III for informational purposes, even though our field  work raised questions about their reliability. To obtain a better  understanding of Iraqi capital budget and spending data and Iraqi practices  in developing expenditure data, we interviewed U.S. officials with the  Departments of Defense (DOD), State (State), and the Treasury  (Treasury); and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in  Washington, D.C., and Baghdad. We also interviewed advisors to the  Ministry of Finance, working under a contract with the United Kingdom\u2019s  Department for International Development.

Tables 2 and 3 provide a  breakdown of budget execution for the first 8 months of 2006 and 2007,  respectively. While we were not able to determine the reliability of these  official Iraqi expenditure data, we are presenting this analysis because it  raises additional questions about the data presented by the administration  in its September 2007 assessment of Iraqi benchmarks.

As explained in the report, beginning in 2007,  the Iraqi government adopted a new chart of accounts as recommended by  the IMF, which complicates efforts to compare 2006 with 2007. Column 1  in table 4 shows the nine categories of expenditures reported in 2006 and  their combination into the four groups presented in the table; column 2  shows the eight categories used in the 2007 chart of accounts.", "The percentage of the budget expended as of August 31 is the ratio used to  measure budget execution for 2006 and 2007 in tables 1 and 2,  respectively. Only in the category of goods and services did budget  execution appear to increase, from 22 percent in 2006 to 27 percent in  2007. In general, the Iraqi ministries have compensated their employees.  However, even in that category, budget execution decreased from 65  percent in 2006 to 53 percent in 2007.", "As mentioned previously, the expenditures for capital projects are no  longer reported as a separate category in official Ministry of Finance  accounts. The 2007 budget provides separate categories for capital goods  and capital projects. However, the reported expenditures in the category  nonfinancial assets, which we refer to as investment, combine capital  goods and capital projects. The capital projects budget of $10.1 billion  represents 88 percent of the combined investment category of $11.4  billion. The budget execution ratio of this investment category was 5  percent for the first 8 months of 2007, compared with 13 percent for the  first 8 months of 2006.", "The expenditure performance of the Iraqi government from January  through August 2007 may even be worse than the dollar expenditure  figures suggest.
