Since 2013, OCI has completed approximately 380 investigations of allegations of sexual assault at the request of state National Guard officials and 5 assessments of state National Guard units to review the current culture, policies, and practices for the handling of sexual assault, among other things. State National Guard officials told GAO that OCI provides the states with an unbiased or impartial third-party review of reported incidents of sexual assault. OCI is primarily funded through amounts made available for the Sexual Assault Special Victims' Counsel Program in the Department of Defense's (DOD) annual defense-wide Operation and Maintenance appropriation. This funding has increased from approximately $1.4 million in fiscal year (FY) 2014 to almost $5 million in FY 2018; which OCI officials attributed to increasing demands for OCI's services. OCI uses trained National Guard members temporarily assigned to the office as investigators.", "NGB guidance establishes OCI investigation policies and OCI has implemented controls to help ensure key policies are followed. However, OCI has inconsistently documented how case acceptance criteria have been met. GAO's analysis of a sample of 27 case files from 5 states from FY 2016 and FY 2017 found that OCI generally adhered to key investigation policies. For example, in accordance with its policies, in all 27 case files GAO reviewed, OCI had included the state National Guard's requests to initiate an OCI investigation and executive summaries explaining OCI's determination of whether or not the allegation was substantiated. Furthermore, NGB has established two case acceptance criteria\u2014specifically that a National Guard nexus exists and that coordination with at least one criminal investigative organization occurred. According to OCI officials, state National Guard officials are to verify these criteria are met before submitting requests for OCI to initiate an investigation of sexual assault. NGB has developed a template with standardized language that includes these criteria that the states should use. While OCI's case files included the request letters with standardized language from state National Guards indicating the state National Guard staff had determined the case acceptance criteria were met, they did not consistently include supporting documentation to verify how the case acceptance criteria were met. This is because NGB policy does not require such documentation to be included in OCI's case files. Without such documentation, OCI does not have reasonable assurance that the cases it accepts for investigation adequately meet the two criteria for case acceptance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD require OCI to include supporting documentation in case files to verify a National Guard nexus exists and referral to the appropriate law enforcement organization occurs.

The National  Guard Bureau (NGB) established the Office of Complex Administrative  Investigations (OCI) in 2012 to conduct administrative investigations\u2014primarily allegations of sexual assault\u2014involving National Guard  members which the military justice system or local law enforcement  cannot or will not investigate. Specifically, OCI helps fill a gap by  addressing cases involving National Guard members who (1) are not  subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice; (2) were not investigated  by a military criminal investigative organization due to the lack of  jurisdiction; (3) were declined a criminal investigation by civilian law- enforcement organizations; or (4) were not sufficiently investigated by the  civilian law enforcement agency with jurisdiction. While OCI does not  conduct criminal investigations, OCI\u2019s administrative investigations are  intended to provide the Adjutants General with sufficient information to  take administrative actions as appropriate to maintain good order and  discipline within their National Guard units.", "In February 2017, we reported that the timeliness of investigations was a  challenge for OCI and that 57 percent of investigations conducted in fiscal  year 2015 took 6 to 9 months to complete. We recommended that the  Chief of the NGB, in collaboration with the secretaries of the military  departments, as appropriate, reassess OCI\u2019s timeliness and resources to  determine how to improve the timeliness of processing sexual assault  investigations involving members of the Army National Guard, and  identify the resources needed to improve the timeliness of these   investigations. DOD agreed with our recommendation. We provide  additional details about OCI\u2019s backlog of investigations later in this report.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a  provision that we review the purpose and structure of OCI, its adherence  to guiding policies, and the criteria and legal authority under which it  conducts investigations.

We reviewed OCI\u2019s budget data and  information\u2014including how the office is funded\u2014and documentation of  the office\u2019s organizational structure and staffing for fiscal years 2014  through 2018. We also interviewed relevant officials to determine the  budgetary and staffing resources used by the office. In order to assess  the reliability of OCI\u2019s investigations and budget data, we interviewed  knowledgeable officials within OCI about the controls the office uses to  ensure the validity and reliability of the data. We conducted testing of the  data, which included comparing OCI\u2019s budget numbers with those  received from DOD and the NGB Joint Staff for consistency, errors, and  logic. We also interviewed officials in the Office of the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO),  coordinated with officials from the NGB Joint Staff, and obtained  corroborating information to further support our data reliability  determination. We determined the budget data related to the amount of  funding OCI received for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 were sufficiently  reliable for reporting and attributing these data to OCI. We were unable to  determine the reliability of the discretionary funding OCI received, and  therefore did not include these in our report. We also interviewed OCI  officials about the steps the office takes to help ensure the reliability of its  data on the number of completed investigations. We determined that the  data on the number of investigations OCI had completed as of September  7, 2018, were sufficiently reliable for reporting and attributing these data  to OCI.", "For our second objective, we analyzed current and previous versions of  Chief of the NGB guidance to determine key policies for OCI  investigations and controls the office has in place. Primary among these  are Chief National Guard Bureau Instruction (CNGBI) 0400.01B, National  Guard Complex Administrative Investigations (the NGB Instruction) and  Chief National Guard Bureau Manual (CNGBM) 0400.01A, National  Guard Complex Administrative Investigations Procedures (the NGB  Manual). We also interviewed OCI, NGB, and DOD officials to identify  the criteria OCI established for determining which investigations and  assessments to conduct and evaluated their efforts to determine whether  they met federal internal control standards, including that management  should design appropriate types of control activities to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives, such as conducting top-level reviews, assigning  responsibilities, and using quality information, as well as the need for  documentation. We interviewed Army Criminal Investigation Command,  Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and NGB officials about  jurisdiction and legal authorities related to criminal and administrative  investigations of reported allegations of sexual assault involving National  Guard members. We also interviewed National Guard state officials and  reviewed a sample of 27 case files from five states for fiscal years 2016  and 2017. We selected these states based on the following criteria: (1)  the number of cases the states had referred to OCI, including states with  a low and high number of cases; (2) the size of the state\u2019s National Guard  population, both large and small member populations; and (3) geographic  dispersion across the five census regions. We reviewed these case files  for documentation and other evidence and compared them with a  selection of key OCI policies to determine the extent to which the office is  following those policies for the select case files we reviewed.", "We identified policies as key based on whether the policy met specific  criteria, including whether (1) adherence to the policy was measurable in  some way, for example, written documentation was produced; (2) the  policy was relevant to the reporting requirements of our statutory  mandate; (3) the policy was deemed essential to each phase of the  investigation; (4) compliance data or information was available and could  be shared with GAO in a timely manner; and (5) the policies were  determined to be generally consistent across the 2012 and 2018 versions  of OCI\u2019s policy documents, with a few exceptions for policies that were  relevant to our mandate or essential to the investigative process. We  evaluated the 27 case files against these selected key policies to  determine if OCI followed these policies in our sample of OCI  investigation case files. Our findings from these case files are provided  solely as illustrative examples and are not generalizable to all of OCI\u2019s  investigations, to the other states and territories, or to investigations  conducted in the states we sampled any time before 2016 or after 2017.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2018 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

All 27  written requests from the Adjutants General included in the sample of  case files we analyzed included a statement that used this standardized  language and indicated that the state National Guard staff had  determined the existence of a National Guard nexus and confirmed  coordination with at least one criminal investigative organization prior to  requesting OCI\u2019s assistance, consistent with NGB policy.", "However, we found that OCI\u2019s case files do not consistently include  supporting documentation to show how the case acceptance criteria\u2014 specifically the determination of a National Guard nexus and verification  of coordination with the appropriate criminal investigative organizations\u2014 were met. This is because NGB policy does not require that OCI collect  and include any additional documentation for verification purposes in its  case files. In our review of OCI\u2019s case files, we found that 12 of the 27  case files did not include additional supporting documentation, such as  police reports or e-mail correspondence with the appropriate criminal  investigative organizations. We also found that 7 of the 27 case files did  not include supporting documentation of both the nexus determination  and coordination with the appropriate criminal investigative organizations.  According to OCI officials, the office relies on state National Guard  officials\u2019 evaluation and determination about the nexus criteria and does  not always receive supporting documentation to verify the criteria have  been met before initiating an investigation. OCI officials further stated that  this is due, in part, to the fact that the NGB and Adjutants General cannot  require local law enforcement to produce documentation related to their  investigations because neither entity has subpoena power over state law  enforcement organizations. However, in response to our concerns about  the lack of supporting documentation to verify the state National Guard  officials\u2019 evaluations of the criteria, in October 2018, OCI officials shared  a draft memorandum template that they developed for verifying how the  two case acceptance criteria were met.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks. More specifically, documentation of such activities  should be readily available for examination, properly managed, and  maintained. Those standards state that documentation is a necessary  part of an effective internal control system and is required to demonstrate  design, implementation, and operating effectiveness. Without a  requirement that supporting documentation related to the National Guard  nexus and criminal investigative organization coordination efforts is  included in each case file, OCI does not have reasonable assurance that  the cases it is investigating adequately meet the two criteria for case  acceptance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Through the creation of the Office of Complex Investigations in 2012, the  NGB has taken steps to address a gap by exercising its investigative  authority to address those instances of sexual assault involving National  Guard members that the military justice system or local law enforcement  could not or would not investigate.

However, the  NGB does not require OCI to include supporting documentation in its  case files for verifying how state National Guard officials determined that  case acceptance criteria have been met.
