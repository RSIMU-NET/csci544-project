Yet a key challenge for the Department of Defense (DOD), as for many federal agencies, is to strategically manage its human capital. DOD's proposed National Security Personnel System would provide for wide-ranging changes in DOD's civilian personnel pay and performance management and other human capital areas. Given the massive size of DOD, the proposal has important precedent-setting implications for federal human capital management. This testimony provides GAO's observations on DOD human capital reform proposals and the need for governmentwide reform."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO strongly supports the need for government transformation and the concept of modernizing federal human capital policies both within DOD and for the federal government at large. The federal personnel system is clearly broken in critical respects--designed for a time and workforce of an earlier era and not able to meet the needs and challenges of today's rapidly changing and knowledge-based environment. The human capital authorities being considered for DOD have far-reaching implications for the way DOD is managed as well as significant precedent-setting implications for the rest of the federal government. GAO is pleased that as the Congress has reviewed DOD's legislative proposal it has added a number of important safeguards, including many along the lines GAO has been suggesting, that will help DOD maximize its chances of success in addressing its human capital challenges and minimize the risk of failure. More generally, GAO believes that agency-specific human capital reforms should be enacted to the extent that the problems being addressed and the solutions offered are specific to a particular agency (e.g., military personnel reforms for DOD). Several of the proposed DOD reforms meet this test. In GAO's view, the relevant sections of the House's version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 and the proposal that is being considered as part of this hearing contain a number of important improvements over the initial DOD legislative proposal. Moving forward, GAO believes it would be preferable to employ a governmentwide approach to address human capital issues and the need for certain flexibilities that have broad-based application and serious potential implications for the civil service system, in general, and the Office of Personnel Management, in particular. GAO believes that several of the reforms that DOD is proposing fall into this category (e.g., broad banding, pay for performance, re-employment and pension offset waivers). In these situations, GAO believes it would be both prudent and preferable for the Congress to provide such authorities governmentwide and ensure that appropriate performance management systems and safeguards are in place before the new authorities are implemented by the respective agency. Importantly, employing this approach is not intended to delay action on DOD's or any other individual agency's efforts, but rather to accelerate needed human capital reform throughout the federal government in a manner that ensures reasonable consistency on key principles within the overall civilian workforce. This approach also would help to maintain a level playing field among federal agencies in competing for talent and would help avoid further fragmentation within the civil service."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss legislative proposals to help the  Department of Defense (DOD) address its current and emerging human  capital challenges.

As  the House of Representatives has reviewed DOD\u2019s legislative proposal, it  has added a number of important safeguards, including many along the  lines we were suggesting, that will help DOD maximize its chances of  success in addressing its human capital challenges and minimize the risk  of failure. Furthermore, the proposed National Security Personnel System  Act that is the subject of this hearing also includes a significant number of  improvements over DOD\u2019s initial proposal.

DOD has  almost 700,000 civilian employees. The Department of Homeland Security,  which also has broad human capital flexibilities, has about 140,000 civilian  employees. Other federal agencies that have been granted broad  authorities, such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the Internal  Revenue Service, have many thousands more federal employees. In  essence, we are fast approaching the point where \u201cstandard  governmentwide\u201d human capital policies and procedures are neither  standard nor governmentwide. In this environment, we should pursue  governmentwide reforms and flexibilities that can be used by many  government agencies, subject to agencies having appropriate  infrastructures in place before such authorities are put in operation.  Considering certain proposed DOD reforms in the context of the need for  governmentwide reform could serve to accelerate progress across the  government while at the same time incorporating appropriate safeguards  to maximize the ultimate chances of success and minimize the potential  for abuse and prevent the further fragmentation of the civil service.", "More directly, agency-specific human capital reforms should be enacted to  the extent that the problems being addressed and the solutions offered are  specific to a particular agency (e.g., military personnel reforms for DOD).

This  institutional infrastructure includes, at a minimum, a human capital  planning process that integrates the agency\u2019s human capital policies,  strategies, and programs with its program goals and mission and desired  outcomes; the capabilities to develop and implement a new human capital  system effectively; and a modern, effective, and credible performance  management system that includes adequate safeguards, including  reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms, to  ensure the fair, effective, and nondiscriminatory implementation of the  system.", "My recent statements before the Congress have discussed DOD\u2019s human  capital challenges and have provided comments and suggestions on the  initial DOD proposal to create a National Security Personnel System  (NSPS).

Secretary Rumsfeld and the rest of DOD\u2019s leadership are clearly  committed to transforming how DOD does business. Based on our  experience, while DOD\u2019s leadership has the intent and the ability to  transform DOD, the needed institutional infrastructure is not in place  within a vast majority of DOD organizations. Our work looking at DOD\u2019s  strategic human capital planning efforts and looking across the federal  government at the use of human capital flexibilities and related human  capital efforts underscores the critical steps that DOD needs to take to  properly develop and effectively implement any new personnel  authorities. In the absence of the right institutional infrastructure,  granting additional human capital authorities will provide little advantage  and could actually end up doing damage if the authorities are not  implemented properly.", "The following provides some observations on key provisions of the  proposed National Security Personnel System Act in relation to the House  version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004.  First, I offer some comments on the overall design for a new personnel  system at DOD. Second, I provide comments on selected aspects of the  proposed system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Overall Human Capital Program", "paragraphs": ["The House version of DOD\u2019s authorization bill would allow the Secretary  of Defense to develop regulations with the Director of OPM to establish a  human resources management system for DOD. The Secretary of Defense  could waive the requirement for the joint issuance of regulations if, in the  Secretary\u2019s judgment and subject to the decision of the President, it is  \u201cessential to the national security\u201d\u2014which was not defined in the  proposed bill.  As an improvement, the proposed National Security  Personnel System Act also requires that the new personnel system be  jointly developed by the Secretary of Defense and the Director of OPM,  but does not allow the joint issuance requirement to be waived. This  approach is consistent with the one the Congress took in creating the  Department of Homeland Security.", "The proposed National Security Personnel System Act requires the  Secretary of Defense to phase in the implementation of NSPS beginning in  fiscal year 2004. Specifically, the new personnel authorities could be  implemented for a maximum of 120,000 of DOD\u2019s civilian employees in  fiscal year 2004, up to 240,000 employees in fiscal year 2005, and more  than 240,000 employees in a fiscal year after fiscal year 2005, if the  Secretary of Defense determines that, in accordance with the bill\u2019s  requirement that the Secretary and the Director of OPM jointly develop  regulations for DOD\u2019s new human resources management system, the  Department has in place a performance management system and pay  formula that meets criteria specified in the bill.  We strongly support a  phased approach to implementing major management reforms, whether  with the human capital reforms at DOD or with change management  initiatives at other agencies or across the government.  We suggest that  OPM, in fulfilling its role under this section of the bill, certify that DOD has  a modern, effective, credible, and, as appropriate, validated performance  management system with adequate safeguards, including reasonable  transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms, in place to  support performance-based pay and related personnel decisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Employee Appeals Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The proposed National Security Personnel System Act states that the  Secretary of Defense may establish an employee appeals process that is  fair and ensures due process protections for employees.

The DOD appeals  process must be based on legal standards consistent with merit system  principles and may override legal standards and precedents previously  applied by MSPB and the courts in cases related to employee conduct and  performance that fails to meet expectations.  The bill would allow appeal  of any decision adversely affecting an employee and raising a substantial  question of law or fact under this process to the Merit Systems Protection  Board under specific standards of review, and the Board\u2019s decision could  be subject to judicial review, as is the case with other MSPB decisions.

We believe an evaluation and reporting requirement  would facilitate congressional oversight of NSPS, allow for any midcourse  corrections in its implementation, and serve as a tool for documenting best  practices and sharing lessons learned with employees, stakeholders, other  federal agencies, and the public. Specifically, the Congress should  consider requiring that DOD fully track and periodically report on the  implementation and results of its new human capital program. Such  reporting could be on a specified timetable with sunset provisions. These  required evaluations could be broadly modeled on the evaluation  requirements of OPM\u2019s personnel demonstration program. Under the  demonstration project authority, agencies must evaluate and periodically  report on results, implementation of the demonstration project, cost and  benefits, impacts on veterans and other Equal Employment Opportunity  groups, adherence to merit principles, and the extent to which the lessons  from the project can be applied elsewhere, including governmentwide.

Doing so will be essential if we expect to maximize the  performance and assure the accountability of the federal government for  the benefit of the American people. DOD has said that broad banded  performance management and pay for performance systems will be the  cornerstone of its new system.", "Reasonable people can and will debate and disagree about the merits of  individual reform proposals. However, all should be able to agree that a  modern, reliable, effective, and validated performance management  system with adequate safeguards, including reasonable transparency and  appropriate accountability mechanisms, must serve as the fundamental  underpinning of any successful results-oriented pay reform. We are  pleased that both the House version of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2004  authorization bill and the proposed National Security Personnel System  Act contain statutory safeguards and standards along the lines that we  have been suggesting to help ensure that DOD\u2019s pay for performance  efforts are fair to employees and improve both individual and  organizational performance.", "The statutory standards described in the National Security Personnel  System Act proposal are intended to help ensure a fair, credible, and  equitable system that results in meaningful distinctions in individual  employee performance; employee involvement in the design and  implementation of the system; and effective transparency and  accountability measures, including appropriate independent  reasonableness reviews, internal grievance procedures, internal  assessments, and employee surveys. In our reviews of agencies\u2019  performance management systems\u2014as in our own experience with  designing and implementing performance-based pay reform for ourselves  at GAO\u2014we have found that these safeguards are key to maximizing the  chances of success and minimizing the risk of failure and abuse.", "The proposed National Security Personnel System Act also takes the  essential first step in requiring DOD to link the performance management  system to the agency\u2019s strategic plan. Building on this, we suggest that  DOD should also be required to link its performance management system  to program and performance goals and desired outcomes. Linking the  performance management system to related goals and desired outcomes  helps the organization ensure that its efforts are properly aligned and  reinforces the line of sight between individual performance and  organizational success so that an individual can see how her/his daily  responsibilities contribute to results and outcomes.", "The proposed National Security Personnel System Act includes a detailed  list of elements that regulations for DOD\u2019s broad band pay program must  cover.  These elements appear to be taken from DOD\u2019s experience with its  civilian acquisition workforce personnel demonstration project as well as  the plan, as described in an April 2, 2003 Federal Register notice to  integrate all of DOD\u2019s current science and technology reinvention  laboratory demonstration projects under a single human capital  framework.  Many of the required elements in the proposed National  Security Personnel System Act are entirely appropriate, such as a  communication and feedback requirement, a review process, and a  process for addressing performance that fails to meet expectations.  However, other required elements, such as \u201cperformance scores\u201d, appear  to imply a particular approach to performance management that, going  forward, may or may not be appropriate for DOD, and therefore may have  the unintended consequence of reducing DOD\u2019s flexibility to make  adjustments. Congress has an important and continuing role to play in the  design and implementation of the federal government\u2019s personnel policies  and procedures.  Congress should consider how best to balance its  responsibilities with agencies\u2019 needs for the flexibility to respond to  changing circumstances.", "Finally, under the proposed act, for fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the  overall amount allocated for compensation for civilian employees of an  organizational or functional unit of DOD that is included in NSPS shall not  be less than the amount of civilian pay that would have been allocated to  such compensation under the General Schedule. After fiscal year 2008,  DOD\u2019s regulations are to provide a formula for calculating an overall  amount, which is to ensure that employees in NSPS are not disadvantaged  in terms of the overall amount of pay available as a result of their  conversion into NSPS while providing DOD with flexibility to  accommodate changes in the function of the organization, the mix of  employees performing those functions, and other changes that might  affect pay levels.", "Congress has had a longstanding and legitimate interest in federal  employee pay and compensation policies and, as a result, there are  provisions consistent with that interest in the National Security Personnel  System Act.  However, as currently constructed, the proposed bill may  have the unintended consequence of creating disincentives, until fiscal  year 2009, for DOD to ensure that it has the most effective and efficient  organizational structure in place. This is because, based on our  understanding of the bill\u2019s language, if DOD were to reorganize, outsource,  or undertake other major change initiatives through 2008 in an  organizational or functional unit that is part of NSPS, DOD may still be  required to allocate an overall amount for compensation to the  reorganized unit based on the number and mix of employees in place prior  to conversion into NSPS. In other words, if priorities shift and DOD needs  to downsize a unit in NSPS significantly, it may still be required that the  downsized unit\u2019s overall compensation level remain the same as it would  have been in the absence of the downsizing. While pay protections during  a transition period are generally appropriate to build employee support for  the changes, we believe that, should the Congress decide to require overall  organizational compensation protection, it should build in additional  flexibilities for DOD to make adjustments in response to changes in the  size of organizations, mix of employees, and other relevant factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Senior Executive Service Performance and Pay Reforms", "paragraphs": ["The current allowable total annual compensation limit for senior  executives would be increased up to the Vice President's total annual  compensation (base pay, locality pay, and awards and bonuses) in the  proposed National Security Personnel System Act and the House National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004.

It allows DOD greater flexibility to (1) hire experts and pay them  special rates for temporary periods up to six years, and (2) define benefits  for certain specialized overseas employees. Specifically, the Secretary  would have the authority to establish a program to attract highly qualified  experts in needed occupations with the flexibility to establish the rate of  pay, eligibility for additional payments, and terms of the appointment.  These authorities give DOD considerable flexibility to obtain and  compensate individuals and exempt them from several provisions of  current law. Consistent with our earlier suggestions, the bill would limit  the number of experts employed at any one time to 300.

To obtain additional authority, an agency should be required  to have an OPM-approved human capital plan that is fully integrated with  the agency\u2019s strategic plan. These plans need to describe the agency\u2019s  critical human capital needs and how the new provisions will be used to  address the critical needs.
