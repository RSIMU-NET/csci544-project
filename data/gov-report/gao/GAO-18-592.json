DOD was statutorily required to review the services and supplies each DAFA provides to ensure there is a continuing need for each and that the provision of services and supplies by each DAFA, rather than by the military departments, is more effective, economical, or efficient. A DOD directive requires the recording of the review. DOD previously issued biennial reports to Congress to record its review. Since 2012, DOD has relied on existing processes to fulfill the requirement; such as the annual budget process and the day-to-day management of the DAFAs. However, DOD did not provide sufficient evidence that these processes satisfy the statute. For example, while DOD reviews the DAFAs during the budget process, it does not specifically review the provision of services by the DAFAs rather than the military departments. Further, DOD does not have internal guidance that provides clear direction for conducting and recording its response to the statutory requirement. Without such guidance, DOD is limited in its ability to clearly define or target the scope of its reviews and any resulting reports. As such, DOD and congressional decision makers may not have reasonable assurance of a continuing need for the DAFAs, or that the provision of services and supplies is effective, economical, and efficient.", "There is fragmentation and overlap within the DAFAs that provide human resources services to other defense agencies or organizations within DOD. At least six DOD organizations, including three DAFAs, perform human resources services for other parts of the department. One DAFA receives human resources services from all six organizations. This has resulted in negative effects, such as inconsistent performance information regarding hiring, fragmented information technology systems, and inefficiencies associated with overhead costs. For example, DOD officials stated that there are over 800 fragmented information technology systems used to store and record training records across the department, which are costly to maintain. DOD established a reform team to reduce inefficiencies within this business function. However, the team lacks comprehensive information on overhead costs that could guide reform and does not have time frames or deliverables for completing certain reform initiatives. With consistent human resource performance information, comprehensive information on overhead costs, and clear time frames in place, the team would be better positioned to thoroughly assess the department's system for human resources service delivery and develop and implement long-term solutions for better coordination or consolidation of this function.", "DOD has taken some steps to monitor and evaluate the results of key efficiency initiatives that affect the DAFAs. However, DOD has not always established baselines or performed ongoing monitoring of its initiatives. Further, DOD has focused on whether steps have been taken, rather than outcomes achieved. For example, DOD did not evaluate whether a prior efficiency initiative called the Core Business Process Review achieved any of its intended savings or led to expected efficiencies. Without ensuring that efficiency initiatives are fully monitored and evaluated against established baselines over time, DOD lacks a systematic basis for evaluating whether its various initiatives have improved the efficiency or effectiveness of its programs or activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including for DOD to develop internal guidance to conduct and record its reviews of DAFAs; collect consistent performance information and comprehensive overhead cost information; establish time frames and deliverables for key reform efforts; and ensure routine and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of ongoing efficiency initiatives.

Regarding the methodology of the past reports, for the first five  biennial reports, from 1987 to 1995, DOD relied on a research team to  identify findings and provide recommendations on the structure and  composition of the DAFAs. The four reports issued from 1997 to 2004  relied on a survey of the DAFAs\u2019 customers across DOD. From 2005 to  2010, DOD issued three reports that alternated between a senior  management assessment of the DAFAs and the customer survey  approach. In addition, the 2009-2010 report recorded activities relevant to  the statutory review requirement, with a focus on a major DOD efficiency  initiative that was ongoing at that time.", "Regarding quality, we found that the most recent report, dated 2012,  generally did not reflect key elements of quality evaluations, which we  identified in our prior work and compiled as part of this review.

Further, the  report relied on data obtained from appropriate sources for the evaluation,  to include survey information from the DAFA directors and military  department officials. However, we found that the report did not assess the  reliability of the data used, define key terms, clearly state criteria used for  analysis, or make recommendations. For example, OCMO officials  familiar with the report told us that some DAFAs and military departments  surveyed for the report provided more detail and information in their  responses than others, but there was no assessment of the reliability of  this information.

According to DOD officials, they  discontinued issuing biennial reports in 2012 because the reports were  not a leadership priority, given the resources required to produce them. In  addition, OCMO officials acknowledged that the department does not  currently record fulfillment of the statutory requirement through a  centralized process, such as the development of a report that responds to  the requirement. However, a DOD directive tasks the former Director of  Administration and Management, whose functions have now been  integrated into the CMO office, to oversee the biennial review of the  DAFAs and to record the fulfillment of that review. Further, Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that documentation  is a necessary part of an effective internal control system and is required  for effective operations. OCMO officials told us that they are considering  renewing the issuance of biennial reports, but that there are no firm plans  to do so at this time, nor are there any associated time frames.", "In the absence of biennial reports, OCMO officials stated that since 2012  they have relied on existing departmental processes to address the  statutory requirement to review the DAFAs.

When we  assessed the processes, we determined that DOD did not provide  sufficient evidence that it has met the statutory requirement. These  processes include the following:", "Annual budget process: Some OCMO officials stated that DOD\u2019s  annual budget process is a means of addressing the statutory  requirement to review the DAFAs, but one senior official from the  OCMO disagreed. Although DOD reviews the budget proposals for  each DAFA, DOD could not provide evidence that the annual budget  process includes a specific review of the continuing need for each  DAFA, or that the use of the DAFAs ensures the most efficient  provision of services across DOD.", "Day-to-day management of the DAFAs: One OCMO official stated  that day-to-day management of the DAFAs provides a means of  addressing the statutory requirement to review the DAFAs. However,  we found that the documentation provided by OCMO officials does not  demonstrate that a review and recording of DAFA services and  supplies takes place through day-to-day management of the  department. Moreover, some OCMO officials stated that the day-to- day management activities of a large organization can actually detract  from leadership\u2019s ability to focus on needed reviews and reform.", "Reform or efficiency initiatives: Some OCMO officials stated that prior  reform efforts that were focused on the DAFAs exemplify the  department\u2019s response to the statute. However, although certain  reform initiatives, such as the Business Process and Systems  Reviews, affected the DAFAs, we found that the stated purposes of  these reform initiatives, discussed in more detail later in this report, do  not reference the continuing need for DAFAs or examine whether  services should be performed instead by the military departments.  Further, some OCMO officials acknowledged that prior reform efforts  did not examine the continuing need for DAFAs.", "DAFA reorganizations: OCMO officials cited certain reorganizations of  the department as evidence that they review the DAFAs. However,  the examples they cited were congressionally mandated  reorganizations, such as the replacement of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics with two new  Under Secretary positions. As these were congressionally mandated  reorganizations and therefore required, we found that they do not  demonstrate that changes resulted from an internal comprehensive  assessment of the continuing need for the DAFAs or their provision of  services and supplies.", "Management of services through executive agents: Finally, OCMO  officials stated that the existence of executive agents throughout the  department shows that DOD focuses on ensuring efficient delivery of  services and supplies. Multiple heads of DAFAs serve as  designated executive agents. However, OCMO officials did not  provide documentation that these executive agents assess the  continuing need for the DAFAs.

In contrast to DOD\u2019s  biennial reports on DAFAs for 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 192(c), we found that the DOD  combat support agency reports for 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 193(a) we reviewed  generally reflect key elements of quality evaluations that we identified.  For example, the most recent combat support agency reports we  reviewed generally have clear evaluation questions, use sufficient and  appropriate data, and support conclusions with data and analysis. Last,  all of the DOD combat support agency reports we reviewed contain  actionable recommendations.", "Recommendations from the Joint Staff included in combat support  agency reports resulted in reported efficiencies. For example, in response  to the findings and recommendations of a combat support agency report,  officials from the Defense Information Services Agency created a new  office to serve as a single point of contact for its customers. These  officials reported that the office has reduced paperwork and helped to  build relationships with customers. Joint Staff officials reported a variety  of other positive results from combat support agency report  recommendations. These results include an increase in the speed of  specific deliveries from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to DOD  customers outside the continental United States; improved navigational  charts provided by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency to the  Combatant Commands to ensure safety; and the establishment of clear  policy related to fuel additives, including the clarification of specific roles  and responsibilities.", "OCMO officials stated that the statutory requirement for combat support  agency reports is more specific and smaller in scope than the statutory requirement to review the DAFAs. As a result, the officials told us that  they have not been able to conduct targeted and potentially more useful  analysis for DAFAs, such as the evaluations they conduct of the combat  support agencies. However, we found that while the statutes differed in  some ways\u2014for example, a report is specifically required for the combat  support agencies, but was not for the DAFAs\u2014both statutes prescribed  broad requirements for the review processes.", "While each statute requires a periodic assessment, we found differences  in the direction that DOD provides to guide the department\u2019s response to  these statutes. Specifically, a Joint Staff Instruction describes  requirements for the combat support agency reports and provides  direction for the associated process. In many cases, the Joint Staff  Instruction requirements reflect the key elements for evaluations that we  identified. For example, the instruction provides general guidance on the  criteria that reports should use, as well as specific examples. To ensure  data reliability, the instruction requires validation of findings, issues,  recommendations, and observations. Further, the instruction describes  key terms included in the statute, such as responsiveness, readiness, and  operating forces. In contrast, DOD has not issued internal guidance that  details requirements for the required review of DAFAs.", "The Joint Staff has also developed a strategy for scoping and timing its  combat support agency reviews to make the work manageable and the  outcome of the reviews useful to the combatant command. Specifically,  the Joint Staff focuses each report on one combat support agency at a  time, rotating the focus so that each agency is reviewed every several  years. Joint Staff officials stated that the focus areas of the reports also  vary depending on the needs of warfighter, senior leader direction, and  actions taken as a result of the previous assessments. Additionally, when  conducting its reviews, the Joint Staff primarily assesses the combat  support missions within each combat support agency, rather than all  functions implemented by the agency.", "Conversely, DOD has not developed any internal guidance for a similar  process that would allow for a more manageable approach to the  requirement to review the DAFAs. As a result, previous biennial reviews  examined all services and supplies of all DAFAs in each report, an  approach that CMO officials acknowledged prohibited more detailed  analysis. Through the development of internal guidance that provides  clear direction for conducting and recording DOD\u2019s response to the  required review of the DAFAs, the department could more clearly define  or target the scope of those reviews and any resulting reports to make  effective use of the resources devoted to that process. For example, DOD  could choose to follow a risk-based approach, focus on the department\u2019s  key priorities for reform, or rotate the focus of each report as the Joint  Staff does with the combat support agency reports.", "Without clear internal guidance that defines the requirements for a high- quality review of its DAFAs and the associated recording of the results of  those reviews, DOD and congressional decision makers may not have  reasonable assurance that there is a continuing need for the DAFAs and  that the provision of services and supplies is effective, economical, and  efficient.

For instance, one DAFA measures 12 different phases of the entire  process to fill a job opening, with a different measure for each of the 12  phases. Other DAFAs choose to begin or end their measurement process  at different points within the hiring process.

Agency officials stated that these  overhead costs pay for management salaries, other personnel-related  costs, and administrative costs, such as IT support and facilities costs.  These overhead costs are separate from the \u201cdirect labor\u201d costs that  represent the personnel and other expenses required to perform the  service requested. For example, DFAS officials stated that about 7  percent of the fees charged by DFAS to human resources service  customers goes for \u201cgeneral and administrative costs\u201d that are separate  from the direct labor expense required to perform services. Similarly,  about 20 percent of the costs charged to DLA\u2019s human resources  customers covers indirect costs. As such, organizations pay overhead  and administrative expenses for several human resources providers,  thereby using financial resources that could be diverted to higher priority  needs. According to DOD officials, using one provider would likely reduce  inefficient expenses for human resources services paid by defense  organizations. However, according to those officials, more comprehensive  information and analysis is needed to determine the extent of inefficient  overhead costs that occur. Comprehensive information about the extent  of these and other possibly redundant or otherwise inefficient expenses  would help identify a human resources service delivery model that is  effective, economical, and efficient."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Efforts to Reform Human Resources Have Some Limitations", "paragraphs": ["In January 2018, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established a Human  Resources Management Reform Team to initiate key reform efforts within  the department.  This team is one of nine cross-functional teams  established by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to drive reform  throughout the department. The human resources management reform  team is led by a senior DOD human resources official and comprised of  representatives from DFAS; DLA; WHS, the Departments of the Army, Air  Force, and Navy; and the OCMO, among others. According to the  team\u2019s charter, the team will work to modify human resources processes  and move toward enterprise service delivery of human resources  services, which is expected to reduce costs. Team members told us that  their initial focus is to carry out projects focusing on high-priority  challenges, such as pursuing the optimal IT systems for DOD human  resources services department-wide and identifying legislative and  regulatory changes needed to streamline processes and procedures.  After progress is made in these areas, the team plans to review service  delivery across the department and determine the most effective and  efficient system. Senior leaders from the human resources directorates of  DFAS, DLA, and WHS all stated that increased consolidation was  possible, if properly reviewed and implemented, especially for tasks such  as entering personnel data and other hiring-related tasks, which could be  conducted through a shared service model. This work may lead to  increased coordination among, or consolidation of one or more,  organizations.", "DOD has not assessed or identified the most effective, economic, or  efficient provision of this business function. DOD officials stated that  assessing the provision of human resources in the department has not  previously been a priority of senior leadership. A memorandum from the  Deputy Secretary of Defense that established the human resources  management reform team required that the team move the department  toward a shared service delivery model. Specifically, this required a \u201ctime- phased way forward,\u201d with outcomes and time frames for converting the  mission to an enterprisewide service delivery model. The new reform  team reflects a commitment from senior leaders within the department to  address longstanding problems in the human resources area. However,  we identified limitations in how the human resources management reform  team is planning and managing its work.", "First, one goal of the reform team is to reduce the time-to-hire averages  across the department and determine a method to measure the quality of  hiring. DOD officials stated that performance measure improvements are  an important focus of their efforts and that they will share best practices  for time-to-hire and will require a standard measure of quality of hiring.  However, team plans we reviewed do not include steps for ensuring that  the DAFAs and military departments adopt standardized processes to  develop a consistent time-to-hire measure. Standardized quality  information would be valuable in determining which organizations may be  best placed to provide department-wide human resources service  delivery, and without this information DOD may not have assurance that  its hiring practices are effective and efficient. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government emphasizes that managers should  identify the information required and obtain it from relevant and reliable  sources.", "Second, the team has not set clear time frames for some of its work. As  we reported in July 2018, agency reform efforts should have  implementation plans with key milestones and deliverables to track  implementation progress, and clear outcome-oriented goals and  performance measures for the proposed reforms. While one of the  team\u2019s projects is to determine the best strategy for providing IT solutions  for human resources, the team has not identified time frames for  completing the assessments needed to inform a new strategy, or  deliverables for finalizing and implementing the IT strategy. DOD officials  stated that they will develop project plans for completing assessments  needed and identify time-frames with the reform team focused on broader  department-wide IT. The human resources management reform team has  also not set clear time frames or deliverables for developing and moving  toward an optimal service delivery model for the department, which may  be a long-term effort that goes beyond the expected 2 year duration of the  reform team. Draft documents of the team we reviewed discussed  obtaining relevant data in 2018, reviewing the effects of policy changes in  2019, and pursuing undefined pilot projects in 2020. However, DOD  officials told us that the team plans to begin focusing on assessing  optimal service delivery models possibly in 2019. No specific time frames  for completion of this effort have been identified, and team members  stated that completion of IT efforts and regulatory reforms takes  precedence. Further, it is unclear how implementation of long-term efforts  will be managed.", "Third, although one of the team\u2019s charges is to determine the optimal  model for department-wide delivery of human resources services, team  members are not considering key pieces of information that would be  useful in doing so. For example, team members we contacted were not  aware that some DOD organizations were making potentially redundant  and inefficient payments to the DAFAs for human resources services as  overhead charges collected by multiple providers. As discussed  previously, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  emphasizes the importance of quality performance information. When  we raised the issue of overhead charges with team members, they noted  that if such redundant payments are occurring, that would occur only  within the department\u2019s \u201cFourth Estate,\u201d and that they are initially focusing  on issues that affect the department as a whole. However, considering  the size and scope of the Fourth Estate, which DOD reported includes  more than $100 billion in funding annually, identifying comprehensive  information regarding the extent of inefficient overhead costs would be  important information for the reform team to consider in addressing  inefficiencies and pursuing enterprise-wide solutions to determine the  most effective, economical, and efficient model of service delivery.", "With consistent human resources performance information, clear time  frames in place, and comprehensive information on overhead costs, the  team would be better positioned to thoroughly assess the department\u2019s  system for human resources service delivery, and to develop and  implement long-term solutions for better coordination or consolidation of  this function.

For some of the  efficiency initiatives, DOD ensured that there was ongoing monitoring and  worked to evaluate results. For example, as part of the former Secretary  Gates Efficiencies initiative, the military departments and the Special  Operations Command were required to prepare briefings on the status of  initiatives, and the offices of the then Deputy CMO and Comptroller  directed them to enter information regarding their efficiency initiatives into  a database designed to capture performance management data.  Officials stated that this information was designed to allow them to track  the progress of the initiatives, including milestones, risk assessments,  and the roles and responsibilities of those implementing the initiatives.", "While implementing its More Disciplined Use of Resources initiative, DOD  took some ad hoc steps to evaluate the effect of some of the efforts, such  as establishing performance measures to assess their effect on achieving  desired outcomes. An official in the office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) later issued a memorandum that established a  requirement to report on the initiatives, including performance goals,  measures, and accomplishments. This memorandum was issued based  on a recommendation we made in a prior report that the military  departments and the Special Operations Command develop approaches  for evaluating the effect of their efficiency initiatives, such as establishing  performance measures or other indicators, collecting related performance  information, and using this information to measure progress in achieving  intended outcomes associated with their initiatives until implemented.", "However, for other efficiency initiatives, DOD did not consistently ensure  that the agency established a baseline from which to measure progress,  use ongoing monitoring, or evaluate results. For example, in the case of  DOD\u2019s Core Business Process Review initiative, DOD has not evaluated  whether the effort achieved any of its intended savings or led to expected  efficiencies. According to OCMO officials, DOD ultimately concluded that  potential savings opportunities identified as part of this review could not  entirely be achieved through these means. As a result, it is unclear what  savings, if any, the department achieved. DOD\u2019s Business Process and  Systems Reviews ended with a briefing to the Deputy Secretary of  Defense and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that included a  summary of how the organizations would measure progress toward  outcomes. While the office of the then Deputy CMO and the principal staff  assistants were responsible for monitoring the effort up to the briefing,  officials from the Deputy CMO\u2019s office stated that following the briefing  any monitoring that occurred would be the responsibility of the principal  staff assistants. However, not all principal staff assistants continued  monitoring. For example, although the CMO is the principal staff assistant  for two of the agencies reviewed\u2014WHS and the Pentagon Force  Protection Agency\u2014OCMO officials were unable to provide a list of  initiatives related to each agency and the status of those initiatives.", "DOD also did not consistently ensure that the agency monitored and  evaluated efforts associated with the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2016 requirement to save at least $10 billion from  headquarters, administrative, and support activities for fiscal years 2015  through 2019. One of the efforts that DOD took pursuant to this  requirement was for DAFAs to review their service contracts and present  recommendations for cuts to a Senior Review Panel. Under this initiative,  called the Service Requirement Review Boards, the panel either  approved the proposed cuts or directed alternative reductions, and  DCMO then monitored the organizations to ensure that the cuts were  taken. However, other efforts DOD took pursuant to the requirement  were not well monitored. For example, as part of the required savings,  DOD identified approximately $5.3 billion that it later determined to be  \u201cnot auditable\u201d because the baseline for the reductions had not been  established. Congress mandated DOD to report on its efforts with its  budget submissions for fiscal years 2017 through 2019. DOD submitted  its first report on May 22, 2018, and it included the $5.3 billion in savings  that it had deemed \u201cnot auditable.\u201d", "According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  agencies should monitor and evaluate the quality of performance over  time. As part of this effort, agencies should establish a baseline from  which to measure progress, use ongoing monitoring, and evaluate  results. Further, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires agencies  to regularly monitor their progress in achieving goals. Our previous work  has noted that having a process with written guidance for monitoring  achieved savings from efficiency initiatives can help organizations  evaluate actual performance against planned results. We have also  previously noted that without guidance that clearly outlines the  information to be provided for evaluation, DOD cannot be assured that  senior leaders are getting complete information needed to enhance their  visibility over the status of efficiency initiatives.", "Although DOD has not consistently ensured that the agency established a  baseline from which to measure progress, use ongoing monitoring, or  evaluate results, OCMO officials stated that the department is working to  do so. The officials stated that previous efforts to track reform had been  more focused on assessing whether steps had been taken, rather than on  measuring progress and evaluating the results. In its most recent budget  request, DOD emphasized the importance of using goals and  performance measures to assess the benefit and value of reforms, along  with the importance of relevant, accurate, and timely data. In addition,  the chartering documents for DOD\u2019s reform teams highlight the  importance of monitoring and evaluation, and senior DOD officials are  echoing this point. We recently reported that outcome-oriented goals and  performance measures and an implementation plan with key milestones  and deliverables are important when considering agency reform. While  the reform teams\u2019 focus on monitoring and evaluation is a positive step,  officials stated that the teams are expected to exist for approximately 2  years, and monitoring and evaluating results of some reform efforts may  take a significant amount of time to appropriately assess the effects of the  reform. In addition, OCMO officials have not provided evidence of plans  to fully monitor efforts that began before the reform teams were created  and should still be in process. These efforts include savings related to the  requirement to save at least $10 billion from headquarters, administrative,  and support activities for fiscal years 2015 through 2019.

With establishment of the new CMO  position, the department has an opportunity to address long-standing  weaknesses in its business operations, including those performed by the  DAFAs. The department\u2019s effort to establish reform teams that can drive  change, as well as a senior-level reform management group to direct and  oversee these efforts, is a positive step forward. Having comprehensive  and quality information would help the CMO and other senior leaders  make important decisions regarding the direction of reform efforts and to  assess whether efforts are achieving desired results. However, the  human resources management reform team has not collected  comprehensive information, such as performance information on hiring  time frames and overhead costs for providing human resources services  and time frames for these efforts, which would enable the department to  best address inefficiencies among the DAFAs that provide human  resources services. Moreover, DOD has not consistently ensured that the  agency established a baseline from which to measure progress, used  ongoing monitoring, or evaluated results.

For our selection from the 27 DAFAs  within DOD, we excluded DAFAs that have been previously identified as  focus areas from our body of work on duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation. We selected 7 DAFAs that are larger in size and budget  than others and that focus on the traditional business areas of DOD, such  as logistics or financial management. From those 7 DAFAs we reviewed  the chartering directives for each of those agencies and DOD\u2019s most  recent biennial report on DAFAs to identify terms and phrases that  appeared duplicative or repetitive in nature.

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 191 , whenever the  Secretary of Defense determines that it would be more effective,  economical, or efficient to provide for the performance of a supply or  service common to multiple military departments by a single agency, then  the Secretary can create a DAFA to provide that supply or service.
