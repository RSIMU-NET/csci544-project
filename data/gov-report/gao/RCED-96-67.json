However, for nearly two decades, HANO has been one of the country\u2019s poorest performing housing authorities and currently ranks the lowest among the large housing authorities in the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) performance measurement system. Moreover, HANO\u2019s performance has improved only marginally in recent years, despite large federal grants to HANO, hands-on management assistance from professional property managers, the Secretary of HUD\u2019s personal involvement with HANO, and substantial technical assistance to HANO from a new office in HUD established for that purpose.", "HUD\u2019s relationship with HANO, as with all housing authorities, is a contractual one governed by statute and regulation. In return for federal grants and subsidies from HUD, housing authorities agree to efficiently manage and operate decent low-income housing for their residents. Although most housing authorities meet HUD\u2019s performance standards, about 3 percent do not and are classified as \u201ctroubled.\u201d To encourage improved performance at troubled housing authorities, HUD uses a variety of administrative tools, including memorandums of agreement, budget limitations, sanctions against the housing authorities\u2019 governing boards, and declarations of a breach of contract. Declaring a breach is a rare legal step that HUD has used in a limited number of cases. It can lead to HUD\u2019s takeover of a housing authority\u2019s assets and ultimately propel the housing authority into receivership.", "In your letter to us of January 23, 1996, you stated that the causes of HANO\u2019s problems needed to be determined and the solutions identified.

In return, housing authorities agree to provide residents with decent, safe, and sanitary housing. These agreements are formalized in a contract between HUD and the housing authority stipulating that housing authorities will operate in a manner that promotes serviceability, efficiency, economy, and stability. In New Orleans, as in many other cities, the mayor appoints a governing body or board of commissioners which, in turn, hires the local housing authority\u2019s executive director and may approve other top management positions. The board provides for policy guidance, while the executive director is responsible for the day-to-day operations. Both are responsible for complying with the terms of the contract with HUD.", "In 1979, HUD began tracking housing authorities\u2019 performance and providing corrective action for those that performed poorly. HUD\u2019s current monitoring system\u2014the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP)\u2014evaluates 12 performance indicators, calculates a numerical score for each, and relates the total score to a 100-point scale. Poor performers under PHMAP are classified as troubled, and under current law, HUD must negotiate with them a Memorandum of Agreement that includes performance targets for improving the poor performers\u2019 operations. This process establishes a joint responsibility between HUD and the housing authority for improving the performance. However, if HUD determines that a troubled authority cannot, within a reasonable time and with reasonable resources, improve its operations, make effective use of federal funds, and adequately house its residents, HUD can declare the authority in breach of its contract. This legal step allows HUD either to take direct control of the housing authority\u2019s operations and assets or to appoint (or petition a court to appoint) a receiver to control and manage the housing authority.", "HUD\u2019s field offices and Office of Distressed and Troubled Housing Recovery (ODTHR) use the results from PHMAP to oversee and assist housing authorities. HUD\u2019s field offices oversee troubled housing authorities\u2019 performance, ensure that these authorities comply with such agreements as the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), and provide them with technical assistance. ODTHR, which was formed in 1994 to focus resources on assisting large troubled housing authorities and to administer a special grant program aimed at rehabilitating distressed properties, can marshal resources from city governments, HUD, and housing authorities to improve the troubled authorities\u2019 operations. During 1995, ODTHR provided for the funding to support and temporarily place experienced public housing officials and independent consultants in the Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, and Puerto Rico housing authorities.", "On the basis of its size and need, HANO received over $245 million in federal modernization grants and other subsidies during 1992 through 1994. HANO has been designated as troubled since 1979 and is currently ranked by HUD as the worst performing large housing authority. As a result, HANO operated under an MOA which HUD first signed in 1988; a special partnership agreement with the Secretary since September 1994; and, as of February 8, 1996, a new cooperative agreement with the Secretary to help it improve its housing conditions. (See app. I for an abbreviated time line for significant events at HANO over the past 17 years.)", "In the future, troubled housing authorities may not have as many years as HANO has had to improve their performance before the Secretary of HUD is legally compelled to declare the housing authority in breach of its contract. HUD and both houses of the Congress have proposed reform legislation for public housing that includes the stringent treatment of long-troubled housing authorities. In legislation proposed by HUD and in a bill passed by the Senate, a 1-year period is proposed as the grace period within which a housing authority would be allowed to demonstrate improvement or suffer the mandatory declaration of a breach of contract. A pending House bill contains similar language but limits the grace period to 180 days. All three of these proposals are consistent with a September 1993 report of the National Performance Review that recommended that \u201cHUD should make a hard-hitting, targeted effort to resolve the severe difficulties of those few public housing agencies identified as problem.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HANO\u2019s Most Serious Operational Problems Are Ineffective Maintenance and Modernization", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 12 years, the problems at HANO have been well documented in numerous audit reports by HUD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), HUD\u2019s Office of Public and Indian Housing, and private consultants. The audit reports show a continuous decline in HANO\u2019s management performance and the condition of HANO\u2019s housing stock. Among the many significant problems at HANO, the reports consistently cite the lack of an effective maintenance program and HANO\u2019s inability to operate a program to carry out major modernization and rehabilitation projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Preventive Maintenance Is Blamed for High Vacancy Rate", "paragraphs": ["The OIG\u2019s first review of HANO, released in December 1983, detailed four operational and managerial deficiencies related to poor maintenance of the housing stock. These problems included the deteriorating condition of two housing developments, an ineffective maintenance operation, excessive utility costs, and poor tenant selection and eviction procedures. Five years later, a management review of HANO\u2014initiated at HUD\u2019s headquarters and implemented by an interdisciplinary team of 31 people from HUD\u2019s headquarters and field offices\u2014reported 241 findings of deficiencies that reiterated many of the same problems noted in the OIG\u2019s 1983 report.", "When the OIG auditors from HUD returned to HANO in 1994, they found that the housing authority and its management contractor were still not effectively administering the maintenance program and that, as a result, HANO had breached its contract with HUD. For example, the OIG\u2019s June 1994 audit report stated that all 150 housing units randomly selected for inspection failed to meet HUD\u2019s housing quality standards in one or more areas. Under these areas were structural problems such as missing ceilings and holes in walls, loose and peeling paint, steady leaks from faucets, and roach infestations. In addition, the report determined that HANO still had not established a preventive maintenance program and that no maintenance improvements had been realized at HANO in the past 10 years. The report concluded that a lack of preventive maintenance resulted in the continued deterioration of the buildings and HANO\u2019s inability to \u201cturn around\u201d vacant units in fewer than 140 calendar days. In addition, the OIG estimated that HANO had lost over $3 million in potential rental income because vacant units were not occupied in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HANO Is Unable to Conduct an Effective Modernization Program", "paragraphs": ["In addition to day-to-day maintenance deficiencies, the OIG\u2019s 1994 audit found that HANO and the private firm that was hired in accordance with the MOA to manage HANO did not follow certain federal regulations and standards in contracting for modernization work on HANO\u2019s properties. For example, the private manager approved the construction of private balconies, which are prohibited in public housing, and the disposal of valuable steel railings without recouping the salvage value of at least $50,000. In its report, the OIG recommended that HUD recover nearly $5 million in federal payments. In addition, the OIG discovered HANO modernization projects whose costs exceeded the upper limits established by HUD. Moreover, HANO had failed to follow proper procurement procedures, such as obtaining competitive bids for major expenditures and price quotes for small purchases. HANO also did not expend its modernization funding\u2014between $20 million and $30 million per year\u2014in a timely manner or within about 3 years after HUD obligated the funds to the housing authority.", "On the basis of these findings, the OIG concluded that HANO was incapable of carrying out an effective modernization program. Since the OIG\u2019s report, HANO\u2019s ability to use its modernization funding efficiently has not improved. HANO currently has nearly $200 million in unexpended funds. Furthermore, an independent consultant hired by HUD to review HANO\u2019s performance cited ineffective maintenance and modernization programs as serious problems. The consultant\u2019s review shows that HANO\u2019s PHMAP score dropped from 47 in 1993 to 26 in 1994, despite the presence of a property management contractor hired to operate HANO as specified in the housing authority\u2019s MOA with HUD.

Thus, when the Mayor appointed HANO\u2019s most recent seven-member board\u2014four of whom were HANO residents\u2014in May 1994, HUD staff conducted a 1.5-day briefing session for the board at the Mayor\u2019s request. The topics covered during the training included a review of the 1937 Housing Act, HANO\u2019s contract with HUD, HANO\u2019s by-laws, the provisions of the MOA, and the state\u2019s enabling legislation. In addition, the briefing session detailed the board\u2019s responsibility to develop policies and procedures to ensure that HANO operates efficiently and economically and provides for housing in accordance with the existing laws and regulations.", "Despite the emphasis on the board\u2019s expected role, HUD\u2019s headquarters and field office staff began in June 1994 to document inappropriate actions by the board. For example, the board overstepped its bounds by directing HANO\u2019s private manager to hire and fire staff, stop payment on contracts, and disregard proper procurement procedures. In addition, the minutes of board meetings documented that board members, contrary to their governance role, directed HANO staff to move tenants from one housing unit to another as well as into larger units without regard to HANO\u2019s waiting list for potential tenants. HUD\u2019s OIG recently documented additional inappropriate involvement by the current board in HANO\u2019s contracting activities. The OIG concluded that because of the board\u2019s inappropriate involvement in modernization activities, including canceling several contracts, HANO is susceptible to multimillion-dollar lawsuits, and partially completed units have remained unoccupied and exposed to the weather for an extended period. The OIG also concluded that current board members (1) directed the preferential placement of individuals into subsidized units ahead of hundreds of people on the waiting lists or (2) were involved in this activity.", "During the confirmatory review of HANO\u2019s 1994 PHMAP score, an independent consultant who specializes in public housing management and assessment and was hired by HUD also cited the board\u2019s intrusion into HANO\u2019s day-to-day operations, hiring, and contracting. The review concluded that this behavior impeded HANO\u2019s recovery and that the board was preventing effective performance by HANO staff. In August 1995, HUD sent an official to HANO to help revise the housing authority\u2019s by-laws to (1) better define the board\u2019s policy and monitoring role and (2) include a clause describing the ethical conduct expected of the board. According to the OIG, the board had not adopted the revisions as of December 8, 1995.", "Finally, the board had not ensured that HANO has sound policies and procedures for improving its management operations and housing stock, as illustrated by the following example. One of the board\u2019s first actions was to commission, with HUD approval, a strategic plan for HANO that (1) would address its operational deficiencies and (2) develop a plan for improving physical and other living conditions in the housing developments. HUD\u2019s field office believed that this strategic plan also could provide the information needed to resolve many of the recommendations in the OIG\u2019s June 1994 audit report on HANO. The final plan, as accepted by the board from the contractor, was a large document costing approximately $490,000. But our review showed that the plan did not contain the necessary policies and procedures contracted for and that we believe would help improve HANO\u2019s day-to-day maintenance operations and the long-term condition of the housing units. Similarly, the independent consultant\u2019s confirmatory review stated that although the plan was a good guide for HANO\u2019s future, it did not address HANO\u2019s operational deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight by HUD\u2019s New Orleans Field Office Has Not Helped HANO\u2019s Performance", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s field offices are responsible for enforcing compliance with the federal housing regulations, monitoring the performance of all housing authorities, and providing housing authorities with technical assistance.

In response to the report and to avoid declaring a breach, the Secretary of HUD entered into a partnership agreement with the Mayor and the city, which the Secretary confirmed in a letter of August 1, 1994, to the Mayor. As part of the partnership, the Secretary and the Mayor of New Orleans agreed to form an executive council that would provide policy guidance for HANO\u2019s board, maintain the private manager on a month-to-month basis for continuity in critical operations until a permanent executive director could be hired, and develop a 6-month strategic plan. However, because the board allowed the private management contract to expire and had not hired necessary top managers at HANO, HUD subsequently revised the partnership agreement with the Mayor to include a transitional management structure.", "The following are highlights of the events that occurred under the partnership and transitional management:", "The transitional management team, formed by ODTHR and staff from the city, remained at HANO from October 1, 1994, through April 4, 1995. The team comprised more than 15 individuals\u2014both full- and part-time\u2014from a variety of sources, including well-performing housing authorities, HUD offices, and city offices. HUD provided over $220,000 to pay for the salaries and living expenses of the transitional staff loaned from other housing authorities and to cover the expenses of HUD staff. In addition, HANO provided over $260,000 to compensate nine city employees.", "The transitional management team stabilized, to some extent, HANO\u2019s critical operations by addressing two-thirds of the authority\u2019s 21,000 outstanding work orders for routine repairs and implementing standard contracting procedures for HANO.

However, the board did not approve the strategic plan\u2014which would become the foundation of a new MOA\u2014for submittal to HUD until November 1995, about 10 months later.", "The partnership agreement also provided for HANO to hire a permanent executive director within 90 days. HUD helped HANO to obtain waivers from Louisiana\u2019s Civil Service System to hire the executive director and upper-level managers at salaries higher than the system allowed. However, the new executive director, who was formerly a member of HANO\u2019s transitional management team and has significant experience in managing public housing, was not hired until April 1995, about 4 months later than agreed.", "As part of a routine confirmation of HANO\u2019s 1994 PHMAP score, an independent private consultant estimated that HANO\u2019s performance scores for 1995 would be low. HUD officials also estimated that the score would be low\u2014about 29\u2014and now note that their estimate is being confirmed.

Included in that record are minutes of scheduled meetings held by HANO\u2019s board of commissioners at which residents and other interested parties were given the opportunity to participate and share their views and concerns. We also relied on the record of numerous and varied actions taken to resolve and remedy those problems. We supplemented our analysis with discussions with HUD, OIG, and HANO officials.", "The Mayor made a number of other comments that were not directly related to the accuracy of our report but which were germane to HUD\u2019s oversight of public housing and the measurement of HANO\u2019s performance. For example, he believes that HUD has too many approval layers and that this review process caused significant delays to HANO\u2019s modernization program. The Mayor, however, was pleased with the approach that the Secretary is taking toward public housing and his willingness to try innovative funding methods in areas such as modernization.", "In connection with performance measurement, the Mayor does not believe that the PHMAP system measures critical actions taken by housing authorities to improve the quality of residents\u2019 lives. To illustrate, he said that by using police substations located within public housing, HANO has reduced the murder rate by 80 percent in its Desire Development. He noted, however, that HANO has received no recognition for improving this important facet of HANO\u2019s mission. Nevertheless, on the basis of this success, the Mayor said that HANO is planning to implement the police substation concept in HANO\u2019s other housing developments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify HANO\u2019s major operational problems, HUD\u2019s actions to address these problems, and the problems\u2019 underlying causes, we collected data from many sources.
