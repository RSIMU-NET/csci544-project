In addition, DOE facilities have had to reduce their workforce in response to overall cuts in the federal budget. At the end of fiscal year 1998, total employment by contractors at both DOE defense and nondefense facilities was estimated at about 103,000, down from a high of nearly 149,000 since the beginning of fiscal year 1993.

The act stipulates, among other things, that changes in the workforce should be accomplished to minimize social and economic impacts and, when possible, should be accomplished through the use of retraining, early retirement, attrition, and other options to minimize layoffs; employees should, to the extent practicable, be retrained for work in environmental restoration and waste management activities, and if they are terminated, should be given preference in rehiring; and", "DOE should provide relocation assistance to transferred employees and should assist terminated employees in obtaining appropriate retraining, education, and reemployment.", "While the act refers only to defense nuclear facilities, the Secretary of Energy determined that, in the interest of fairness, the workforce restructuring planning process would be applied at both defense nuclear facilities and nondefense facilities.

These funds included $10 million that was unobligated and $62 million that was obligated but not yet spent (called uncosted balances). The Office of Worker and Community Transition and other DOE programs each provided about half the total funding. Combined, these programs spent about $853 million on worker assistance, and the remaining $179 million went to community assistance.", "Of the $1.033 billion spent on worker and community assistance, about $460 million was provided by the Office of Worker and Community Transition.

One of these criteria is to minimize layoffs through early retirement incentives, voluntary separations, and retraining. However, if layoffs are to occur, the restructuring plans are to provide for adequate notification and funding for education, relocation, and outplacement assistance. DOE criteria were not prescriptive and gave field offices substantial autonomy to determine benefit levels. These plans had to be approved by the Secretary of Energy.", "For fiscal years 1997 and 1998, we found that the 10 plans we reviewed offered the same types of benefits. Separation benefits were provided under three types of programs: enhanced retirement, voluntary separation, and involuntary separation. Enhanced retirement provided for full retirement benefits with fewer years of eligibility or service. One plan had provisions that enhanced workers\u2019 eligibility by adding 3 years to both their age and years of service. Nine plans had some type of separation payment based on length of service and base pay for those employees voluntarily or involuntarily separated. All plans also included extended medical benefits, which require the contractor to pay its full share of a separated employee\u2019s medical insurance payments for the first year after separation and half the contribution during the second year. In all plans, educational assistance was available, usually for up to 4 years after separation. All of the plans included outplacement assistance, some of which consisted of resume-writing workshops, job bulletin boards, and employment search strategies\u2014many provided by an outside contractor. A hiring preference for involuntarily separated workers at other DOE contractors\u2019 work sites was provided for in 8 of the 10 restructuring plans.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California based its voluntary separation pay on years of service, with employees receiving 2 weeks\u2019 pay for each year of service, subject to a limit of 52 weeks.

However, table 2 shows that formulas in DOE\u2019s workforce restructuring plans allow for potentially more generous benefits than offered in some of the other benefit plans highlighted in the table. For example, we noted that some of DOE\u2019s workforce restructuring benefits had formulas that could provide more benefits than the amount separated federal civilian employees could expect to receive. Some of DOE\u2019s benefit formulas would allow for larger severance payments than do federal civilian packages. Voluntarily separated federal civilian employees received a one-time severance payment of 1 week of annual salary per year for up to 10 years\u2019 service and 2 weeks of salary per year for more than 10 years\u2019 service; with an adjustment for age. This benefit was paid out in a lump sum and was capped at $25,000. In contrast, while half of the DOE defense workforce restructuring plans we reviewed for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 had caps based on weeks of pay, these caps could exceed $25,000, depending on a contractor worker\u2019s base pay and years of service. As a result, seven workers who received voluntary separation payments at one DOE defense facility averaged $64,907 each in fiscal year 1998. Furthermore, 65 percent of the 748 employees voluntarily separated during fiscal year 1998 received an average separation payment of over $25,000.", "Among the DOE plans we reviewed, one plan offered enhanced retirement benefits that added years to a contractor worker\u2019s age and eligibility to allow for early retirement without penalty and with a cash payment. While federal workers could retire early and receive a separation payment, they were not given added years of age or eligibility and their annuity amount was reduced.", "In addition, the formula for extended medical coverage and the provisions for relocation assistance offered by DOE were more generous than the benefits offered to separated federal civilian employees. For extended medical coverage for eligible contractor workers, DOE pays the full employer cost for the first year of separation and about half of that cost in the second year.

DOE\u2019s February 1997 Policy and Planning Guidance for Community Transition Activities refined the Department\u2019s criteria for evaluating all project and program funding requests in community transition plans. DOE requires communities requesting funds to submit plans describing the impact of the Department\u2019s downsizing. These plans \u201cmay be based upon community needs and may incorporate an analysis of the socio-economic strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\u201d In developing their plans, communities are asked to identify the primary and secondary economic impacts likely to result from DOE\u2019s downsizing. Communities are instructed to use local information sources to establish a baseline of primary impacts and project factors, such as net job loss, changes in unemployment, loss of wages and disposable income, and business closings. In addition, communities should identify secondary impacts, such as decreases in tax revenues and property values.", "Although DOE requires communities to develop plans that include economic impact, DOE focuses its review on the merits of a plan\u2019s individual projects, not on a community\u2019s relative economic need. DOE uses a number of written criteria to evaluate individual projects. These include the project\u2019s ability to create at least one job for each $10,000 to $25,000 received and to provide jobs for separated DOE workers, induce investment or growth in the production of goods and services, and reduce the community\u2019s dependency on DOE. In addition to DOE\u2019s written guidance, the Director of the Office of Worker and Community Transition told us that DOE formally uses four criteria prior to submitting a recommendation to the Secretary: (1) economic distress measured by unemployment and the loss of income; (2) job loss relative to the size of the community affected as a measure of economic dependence on DOE; (3) the diversity of employment within a community and the impact of job loss on the economic base; and (4) the overall size of the workforce reduction. However, while the Director said that these are formal criteria, they are not published in the Department\u2019s guidance nor are the communities evaluated against these four criteria in the memorandums sent to the Secretary for funding approval.", "After completing its review, DOE submits a community\u2019s plan to EDA for its independent review. Under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998, EDA is required to review and approve DOE\u2019s community plans. However, rather than using its own criteria, EDA evaluates the community plans using DOE\u2019s criteria, set out in DOE\u2019s February 1997 guidance.", "Table 3 shows the relative disparity between DOE\u2019s assistance to the affected communities and communities\u2019 unemployment rates or job losses. For example, the communities surrounding Rocky Flats had an average unemployment rate of 3.3 percent for fiscal years 1995 through 1998, lost 2,922 contractor jobs, and received about $25 million in DOE assistance. In contrast, the communities surrounding Richland had more than twice the unemployment rate and nearly twice the job loss of Rocky Flats during this same time but received only about $18.5 million in community assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Community Assistance Would Have Been Ineligible Under Other Criteria", "paragraphs": ["Applying EDA\u2019s job loss and unemployment criteria to DOE\u2019s community assistance funding decisions for fiscal years 1995 through 1998, we found that some communities that received assistance under DOE\u2019s criteria would not be eligible under EDA\u2019s criteria. EDA\u2014which helps communities recover from the effects of job losses\u2014has threshold criteria for its economic assistance that are based on job loss and unemployment. Under EDA\u2019s regulations in effect during this period, communities in a standard metropolitan statistical area suffering from sudden and severe economic distress were eligible for EDA\u2019s assistance if, among other things, they met one of the following tests: (1) the area\u2019s unemployment rate was equal to or less than the national average and 1 percent of the employed population, or 8,000 jobs, were lost or (2) the area\u2019s unemployment rate was greater than the national average and .5 percent of the employed population, or 4,000 jobs, were lost. While EDA\u2019s internal guidance further stated that employees subject to DOE downsizing were eligible for assistance, this provision was not a legal requirement until February 1999. Using EDA\u2019s criteria to assess DOE\u2019s funding decisions for the eight communities that received assistance for the fiscal year 1995 through 1998 period and where comparable data were available, we found that nine of the 21 decisions (some communities had more than one funding decision), representing four of the eight communities, did not meet these criteria. Appendix IV shows this analysis.", "These nine decisions provided about $51 million to five communities surrounding the Mound, Pinellas, Nevada, Oak Ridge, and Rocky Flats facilities. The remaining 12 decisions provided about $57 million to the four other communities surrounding the Los Alamos, Nevada, Richland, and Savannah River facilities. In the Secretarial decision memorandums we reviewed, DOE justified awarding some of its funds on the basis of economic conditions at the county level and impacts on the economic diversity of the communities surrounding a facility, rather than on the standard metropolitan statistical areas.

Because of the strong national and local economies, DOE\u2019s contribution to job growth was uncertain in communities that received its assistance. For example, table 3 shows that six of the eight communities (excluding communities surrounding the Fernald and Idaho facilities) that received community assistance had a local unemployment rate lower than the national average of 5.19 percent for the 1995 through 1998 period. As discussed in appendix III, defining DOE\u2019s contribution to community job creation is difficult because job creation measurements have not differentiated between jobs that DOE created, those created by other assistance, or those created by the economy as a whole.", "While determining DOE\u2019s contribution to overall job growth is difficult, comparing the number of jobs created in the local communities with the ones DOE reports it has created or retained provides a rough measure of DOE\u2019s impact. In doing this comparison, we found that DOE\u2019s contribution had a relatively small impact on the growth of jobs in three of the six communities surrounding nuclear defense facilities for which we had comparable data. For the six sites for which comparable data on local job creation were available, DOE was responsible for about 1.8 percent of the total jobs created. For example, although the overall economy in the Denver area surrounding the Rocky Flats facility created 170,367 jobs, DOE\u2019s contribution to that growth was 1,191 jobs, or .7 percent. However, in Richland, DOE\u2019s contribution appears to be more significant. At this location, DOE contributed to about 36.1 percent of the job growth. Table 4 compares the increase in the number of jobs created in local economies with the number of jobs that were created or retained by DOE\u2019s community assistance program.", "While DOE estimated that it helped to create or retain 8,392 jobs in the communities surrounding the sites listed in table 4, it is difficult to directly link DOE\u2019s community assistance to job creation and retention. To illustrate this point, the Director of DOE\u2019s Office of Worker and Community Transition mentioned the difficulty in showing a direct relationship to job creation at the Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. plant near Savannah River. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. is investing $435 million in a new tire facility that will eventually employ 800 workers.

The most effective and efficient use of federal resources would be to provide relatively more funding to those communities that have a greater need. Need-based criteria exist for DOE to use in developing an allocation formula that targets needs to these communities, such as that used by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration. Furthermore, if DOE believes that other factors, such as diversity of employment within a community, more accurately reflect the economic impact of DOE restructuring, then it needs to identify these factors in its criteria.

Furthermore, the Department said that it does consider economic need in awarding community assistance grants. We are not disputing the criteria\u2019s conformance with statute or regulation. However, we believe that these criteria could be improved. While approval memorandums for individual projects discuss some of the affected communities\u2019 economic conditions, DOE\u2019s written criteria do not. For example, DOE\u2019s March 18, 1998, memorandum allocating $4.5 million for fiscal year 1998 for assistance to communities surrounding the Department\u2019s Portsmouth facility, found that a four-county area surrounding the facility experienced unemployment rates double the state\u2019s average and that one in four people in this area lived in poverty. If DOE believes such county-level economic factors are important, then it needs to make these factors part of its written criteria for allocating community assistance. DOE should also demonstrate that these factors document the best allocation of community assistance resources to those with the greatest economic need. Therefore, we believe that DOE\u2019s criteria could be improved by explicitly describing the economic factors it will consider in determining relative need when allocating funds among affected communities.", "Second, the Department said that the benefits it provides to separating contractor employees were consistent with the practices of other private and public organizations and are comparable in value.

We did not compare the value of the benefits offered to DOE contractor employees with all the other benefit packages offered by the public and private employers we reviewed. However, some of the formulas in DOE\u2019s workforce restructuring plans, such as those determining voluntary separation benefits and extended medical coverage, potentially allow for more generous benefits than offered in some of the other benefit plans we describe in the table.", "DOE\u2019s comments and our evaluation of them are provided in appendix V."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the amount of funds DOE has obligated and expended in support of its worker and community assistance program for fiscal years 1994 through 1998, we reviewed budget records and talked to officials in DOE\u2019s Office of Worker and Community Transition and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer.", "To determine who received benefits during fiscal year 1997 and 1998 and to compare the types of benefits with the benefit packages of other federal and private organizations, we reviewed program criteria and reports from the Office of Worker and Community Transition, federal laws, and Office of Personnel Management publications governing federal civilian and military benefits.

While the study\u2019s methodology reasonably estimates the number of jobs that DOE \u201cwas helping\u201d to create or retain, it is difficult to know the extent to which DOE should receive full credit for these jobs because the consultant was not asked to (1) measure the impact of other assistance in creating or retaining jobs or (2) analyze the extent to which a strong economy helped to produce these jobs. The consultant\u2019s report, Study of the Effects of the Department of Energy\u2019s Work Force Restructuring and Community Transition Plans and Programs, was based upon the consultant\u2019s visits to affected DOE sites, related communities, and their new businesses.

However, the consultant used the category job retention because DOE collected information for jobs retained and one of the objectives of the act that originally authorized the worker transition program was, to the extent practicable, to retain workers in other jobs at the site to avoid layoffs. DOE defined created jobs as those that did not previously exist and retained jobs as those that held the existing work force in place and provided substitute employment for at-risk or displaced workers within a defined geographic area.

Both the consultant and DOE acknowledged the difficulty in estimating job creation and retention for specific programs. Therefore, the consultant and DOE both used the qualifier that the Department\u2019s program \u201cwas helping\u201d to create or retain these jobs. The Director of DOE\u2019s Office of Worker and Community Transition told us that it is difficult to directly link program stimulus to job creation and retention. To illustrate this point, Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. is investing $435 million in a new tire facility that will eventually employ 800 workers near Savannah River. South Carolina, Aiken County, the Department of Commerce, and DOE are also contributing funding for infrastructure development in support of this facility. In this case, DOE, along with three other government entities, each helped to create these jobs.", "Second, another difficulty is separating DOE\u2019s contribution to job creation from the effects of a strong economy. Since 1993, jobs in the national economy grew rapidly, bringing unemployment rates to their lowest levels in decades. While Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. received government assistance, the company may not have been looking to expand its tire production capacity without a strong national economy in which to sell its tires. Furthermore, the local economy can be a significant factor in creating jobs.

In its comments, DOE asserted the following:", "The report draft did not accurately portray the Department\u2019s Worker and Community Transition Program and contained numerous factual errors that, along with inappropriate comparisons, raises basic questions about the validity of the recommendation and major findings.", "The Department\u2019s criteria are consistent with statutory direction and Department of Commerce regulations, and the benefits provided to separated employees were consistent with the practices of other private and public organizations.", "In this appendix, we address each of the comments made in the attachment to DOE\u2019s letter. In addition, DOE provided us with additional detailed comments that elaborated on the points made in the attachment to its formal response. We used this supplemental material where appropriate to revise our report. 1. DOE challenges our recommendation for four reasons. First, the Department commented that its criteria for awarding community financial assistance are consistent with the congressionally mandated criteria of the Economic Development Administration Reform Act of 1998 and ensure that aid is focused on economic need. The act makes communities affected by DOE\u2019s defense-related reductions eligible for the Economic Development Administration\u2019s (EDA) assistance, regardless of the local unemployment rate, or the per capita income in the affected communities. The Department commented that its criteria are consistent with the act, but it appears that DOE\u2019s claim to consistency is based on a provision of the act that allows communities affected by DOE\u2019s defense-related funding reductions to qualify for assistance. However, the act was not effective until February 11, 1999. Furthermore, DOE\u2019s guidance does not have any economic threshold criteria for determining affected communities\u2019 need. Most other communities that suffer economic hardships not caused by defense-related funding reductions are required to meet economic threshold criteria, such as an unemployment rate above the national average.", "Second, DOE commented that EDA must approve each community proposal before funding is provided and that economic need criteria are a key factor in its approval process. While EDA assesses the economic condition of the DOE community applying for assistance, the degree of, or relative, economic need is not a criteria in determining funding levels. We noted in our draft report that DOE submits the community plans to EDA for independent review and approval. However, EDA reviews the community plans using DOE\u2019s criteria for reviewing projects and programs, set out in DOE\u2019s Policy and Planning Guidance for Community Transition Activities. These criteria address projected job creation from the project, the amount of local participation in the project, and the ability of the project to become self-sufficient, not whether the communities requesting assistance meet threshold economic need.", "Third, DOE notes that its Policy and Planning Guidance for Community Transition Activities contains explicit criteria for ensuring that economic assistance is provided to communities suffering economic hardship. Furthermore, DOE added that each Secretarial decision memorandum approving community assistance formally addresses the economic need fulfilled by the funding to be provided. As we noted in our draft report, DOE\u2019s criteria focus on the merits of the community\u2019s individual projects, such as projected job creation, and not on the community\u2019s relative economic need. Our analysis shows that communities differ in their degree of economic strength, and DOE\u2019s criteria for determining community assistance funding do not result in the most assistance going to the communities most in need. We do note that several Secretarial decision memorandums included a general discussion of economic conditions, including job losses, and loss of economic diversity. For example, the June 1997 decision for Rocky Flats stated, \u201cAlthough unemployment in Colorado is comparatively low, new jobs are being created primarily in retail and service industries, not the high-wage manufacturing and engineering sectors. Wage growth is not keeping pace.\u201d However, none of the memorandums we reviewed considered threshold criteria or relative economic need.", "Fourth, DOE notes that a 1998 independent audit found, \u201cThe principal criteria for providing assistance to DOE sites and adjacent communities was degree of need, driven by how many workers were impacted by the transition.\u201d On the basis of our review of Secretarial memorandums, we concur that the primary consideration for determining assistance was that workers were separated. However, our analysis shows that there was no correlation between the actual number of workers separated and the amount of assistance provided to communities. 2. DOE reports in its table 1 that each community it provided with community assistance met at least one economic threshold criterion established \u201cby the Congress for such assistance.\u201d We disagree with DOE\u2019s response on several points. First, DOE\u2019s table 1 uses criteria that did not exist at the time the Department made its funding decisions. These congressionally-mandated criteria, which included the DOE special need criterion, were not effective until February 11, 1999. However, our analysis applies economic threshold criteria, such as those used by EDA, to show funding decisions based on relative economic need. We used the administration\u2019s economic threshold criteria that were in existence during fiscal years 1995 through 1998, when the bulk of DOE\u2019s community assistance money was allocated. When we applied these criteria, the communities surrounding the Los Alamos, Richland, Savannah River, and Nevada facilities (one the three decisions for the Nevada facility) met EDA\u2019s criteria for economic need.", "Second, DOE\u2019s analysis misapplies EDA\u2019s economic threshold criteria in two ways. DOE\u2019s comments applied EDA\u2019s 1999 criteria to individual counties around their Los Alamos and Oak Ridge facilities. If the facility is located within a standard metropolitan statistical area, then that area should be used to determine eligibility. As noted in the report, EDA uses standard metropolitan statistical area data when determining funding eligibility for communities located in these statistical areas. By using the larger standard metropolitan statistical areas as provided for in EDA\u2019s guidance, our analysis is more likely to reflect the total impact of separating workers in the communities surrounding those facilities. If DOE believes that the county-level analysis more accurately reflects the economic impact of its restructuring than does the use of metropolitan statistical areas, then it may want to consider using counties\u2019 economic strength in its community assistance allocation criteria.", "Additionally, DOE\u2019s comments use the unemployment rate only for the year in which the majority of the workforce restructuring occurred at each DOE facility and compares it with the average national unemployment rate for that year. This provides a comparison for only one year out of the six that community assistance programs have been in existence. As shown in appendix IV, if economic and DOE restructuring information are compared against the appropriate administration criteria for each funding decision made since the beginning of fiscal year 1995 (soon after the Office of Worker and Community Transition was created), only four sites (Richland, Los Alamos and Savannah River, and one allocation decision for the Nevada facility) would have been eligible for funds. 3. According to DOE\u2019s comments, our table showing funding allocations to communities for the period 1995 through 1998 contained a basic factual error by including funds that were spent since the beginning of the program. The data contained in table 3 of our draft report were derived from community assistance allocation figures contained in the Office of Worker and Community Transition\u2019s annual reports. Since the receipt of DOE\u2019s comments, the Office provided us with figures for the 1995-98 period. Table 3 has been revised accordingly but still shows that communities with relatively low unemployment rates generally received more funds per worker than those with higher rates of unemployment.", "According to DOE, using data for comparable periods (1995 through 1998) yields starkly different results for total community assistance funding and funding per job lost. Even with the revised allocation figures, we disagree with DOE for two reasons. First, to support its assertion, DOE commented that its table shows that communities generally received between $5,000 and $10,000 per employee separated. However, DOE\u2019s table shows a wide disparity in the range of community assistance per job lost\u2014ranging from $949 to $14,601. Importantly, DOE\u2019s table does not show the allocation amounts with the communities\u2019 unemployment rates. For example, the communities surrounding the Mound facility had an overall unemployment rate of 4.13 percent for the 1995-98 period and received $10,302 in community assistance per separated worker. In contrast, while the communities surrounding the Richland facility, which had an unemployment rate of 7.92 percent, received only $3,098 per separated worker. Even among communities with comparatively low unemployment rates, our revised table 3 shows that there is a wide range of community assistance allocations. For example, the communities surrounding the Oak Ridge and Rocky Flats facilities had aggregate unemployment rates of 4.17 percent and 3.33 percent, respectively, and separated roughly the same number of workers\u20142,832 and 2,922\u2014respectively. However, the communities surrounding Oak Ridge received $5,932 per separated worker versus $8,500 per separated worker for communities around the Rocky Flats facility.", "Finally, DOE states that Richland received less funding because its downsizing started later than in other communities. The fact that some facilities started their restructuring earlier than others may help explain some of the disparity in the allocation of community assistance funds. Nevertheless, because of the criteria DOE uses in providing community assistance, the disparity in the allocation of funds is not likely to be made up over time. In addition, the Secretary\u2019s memorandums approving community assistance allocations generally do not describe the communities\u2019 economic conditions nor do they discuss threshold or relative economic need in the decisions to fund community development. 4. DOE asserted that our comparison of the assistance provided to Richland and Oak Ridge was inaccurate for two reasons\u2014incorrect allocation and unemployment data. First, as discussed under comment 3, we incorporated DOE\u2019s community assistance figures. Even though Richland received more community funding than Oak Ridge, it received less per worker separated\u2014Richland received $3,098 per job lost and Oak Ridge received $5,932 per job lost. Second, DOE challenged our analysis of these two facilities by using a single county\u2019s (Roane) unemployment data for its Oak Ridge facility. As discussed in our second comment, this is a misapplication of EDA\u2019s criteria. Following EDA\u2019s criteria, we used the standard metropolitan statistical area for our analysis. Using the unemployment rate for the standard metropolitan statistical area surrounding Oak Ridge, rather than the unemployment rate for Roane County, results in an unemployment rate for Oak Ridge of 4.2 percent instead of 7.3 percent. Furthermore, DOE\u2019s May 9,1997, Secretarial memorandum justifying $10 million in community assistance does not even discuss Roane County. However, as discussed in comment 2, if DOE believes that the county-level analysis more accurately reflects the economic impact of DOE\u2019s restructuring than does the use of the standard metropolitan statistical area, then it should include this factor in its community assistance criteria. 5. DOE states that we inaccurately reflect how it assists workers displaced by defense-related reductions. It cites the consultant\u2019s study that shows DOE\u2019s program helped create more than 22,000 jobs. Like the consultant\u2019s study, our draft report concurred that DOE helped to create and retain these jobs. However, the consultant\u2019s study did not provide information on the extent to which DOE should receive credit for the jobs created and retained. We noted in the draft report that the DOE data contain jobs created and retained, while the local employment data we used from the Bureau of Labor Statistics include only jobs created. Therefore, our analysis is likely to overstate the impact of DOE\u2019s job creation efforts in any given area. Furthermore, the consultant\u2019s study did not measure the impact of other assistance in creating or retaining jobs, or analyze the extent to which a strong economy helped to produce these jobs. We maintain that DOE\u2019s contribution had a relatively small impact on the overall growth of jobs in three of the six communities surrounding nuclear defense facilities for which we had comparable data. However, for three other communities, our draft shows that DOE contributed significantly to job growth. 6. DOE commented that our draft report incorrectly characterized enhanced retirement offerings. DOE provided us with additional information comparing its enhanced retirement offerings with those of other organizations, and we have revised the report accordingly. However, the formula for extended medical coverage and the provisions for relocation assistance offered by DOE were more generous than the benefits offered to separated federal civilian employees. For extended medical coverage for eligible contractor workers, DOE pays the full employer cost for the first year of separation and about half of that cost in the second year. Separated federal workers who are eligible and wish to retain extended medical coverage must pay the full cost, plus an administrative fee, for the coverage upon separation.", "DOE also commented that 17 of the 25 public and private sector employers identified in our 1995 report offered enhanced retirement. DOE\u2019s interpretation is not exact. The report states that 17 of the 25 organizations offered early retirement programs and at least 10 of these programs offered some incentive for early retirement. The incentives generally gave employees credit for a specified number of years of service and/or a specified number of years added to their age; however, nine organizations also imposed penalties on the annuities of early retirees. 7. DOE said that the draft report is factually incorrect concerning involuntary separation benefits. DOE provided us with additional information on involuntary separation benefits offered at other organizations, and we revised our draft accordingly. 8. DOE contends that its management contractors offered extended medical benefits before the enactment of the worker and community transition program. The Office of Worker and Community Transition has since provided us with information supplementing its official comments indicating that a medical benefits program for displaced workers was approved by the Secretary of Energy on July 29, 1992. According to DOE\u2019s comments, these benefits are limited to contractor-separated employees who cannot obtain coverage through an employer or spouse. We have revised our report accordingly.", "DOE also commented that our draft report did not include the wide range of additional benefit categories offered by other organizations. Based on DOE\u2019s comments we revised table 2 that compared DOE benefits with other public and private sector severance packages offered from fiscal years 1993 through 1998. The revised table provides more detail of the benefits that were offered by the number of organizations that we identified. However, the benefit formulas in some of DOE\u2019s workforce restructuring plans, such as those determining voluntary separation benefits and extended medical coverage, potentially allow more generous benefits than those offered for federal civilian employees. 9. DOE\u2019s comment focuses on the overgeneralization of the data presented in table 2 of our draft report. This table compared DOE benefits with other public and private sector severance packages offered from fiscal years 1993 through 1998. DOE asserted that, overall, the frequency with which DOE contractors offered classes of benefits has not been substantially different than the frequency offered by other employers captured by private surveys. We agree and revised this table, as noted in comment 8.", "Finally, DOE commented that only a limited number of its sites offered some benefits. However, we note that DOE did not count benefits offered to its workforce when fewer than 10 individuals, or 1 percent of the separated workers, received benefits. Furthermore, DOE stated that because of qualification requirements, a large number of separated DOE workers were not provided with certain benefits, even when offered at a site. While these qualifications may preclude some separated workers from receiving a specific benefit, the benefit was still offered at a specific site.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
