In  fiscal year 2000, IRS was able to produce for the first time combined  financial statements that were fairly stated in all material respects. This  achievement was the result of the dedication and months of efforts of IRS\u2019  management and staff working around serious systems deficiencies and  internal control weaknesses, many of which have plagued IRS since we  first began auditing its financial statements in 1992. Although this effort  produced reliable financial statement balances, they were reliable only for  a single point in time and fell short of addressing the fundamental  weaknesses in IRS\u2019 systems and internal controls. As a result, we gave an  unqualified opinion on IRS\u2019 fiscal year 2000 financial statements but also  concluded that IRS did not maintain effective internal controls. We also  found two instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations relating  to IRS\u2019 structuring of installment agreements and the timing of the release  of tax liens.", "During our fiscal year 2000 audit, we noted that IRS had made many  improvements to address some of the financial management issues we  have raised in previous reports. For example, IRS had significantly  improved its controls over reconciling its appropriated fund balance with  Treasury accounts and in minimizing the number and dollar amount of  transactions held in suspense accounts. Additionally, IRS had significantly  improved the quality of its documentation of unpaid tax assessments. IRS  had also made important improvements in its handling of taxpayer receipts  and data, and had made progress in addressing both long-standing  weaknesses in controls over its property and equipment and weaknesses in  budgetary controls. IRS\u2019 progress is attributable to the extraordinary  efforts of IRS senior management and staff and the continued strong  commitment by senior management to address the agency\u2019s financial  management issues.", "Despite this progress, a continued high level of effort by IRS is necessary to  implement long-lasting solutions to serious systems deficiencies and  internal control weaknesses. Because of the seriousness of these issues, we  continue to designate IRS financial management as high risk.  Furthermore, until these problems are addressed, IRS cannot achieve the  overriding objective of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act and other  reform legislation enacted during the last decade\u2014to produce reliable,  useful, and timely financial and performance information for day-to-day  decision-making.

Although most of the  revenue was collected by intermediaries such as financial depository  institutions and transferred directly to the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  general fund, IRS offices and lockbox banks collected $435 billion in fiscal  year 2000. IRS has 10 campuses nationwide that have collection, refund,  and enforcement responsibilities.

Additionally, significant delays and errors in recording taxpayer payments  and other information adversely affected the accuracy of taxpayer  accounts and thus IRS\u2019 ability to ensure taxpayers were not unduly harmed  or burdened. Also, the lack of valid and timely cost-benefit data hindered  IRS\u2019 ability to make or justify resource allocation decisions that directly  affect the management of unpaid assessments and, thus, the collection of  federal revenue.

Throughout the year, detailed  records in the subsidiary ledger would then support key account balances  in the general ledger. However, throughout fiscal year 2000, IRS continued  to lack an effective subsidiary ledger system that could accumulate and  track the status of unpaid assessments on an ongoing basis. This deficiency  continued to necessitate the use of an extensive workaround process in  order for IRS to derive the balances in the three categories of unpaid  assessments as defined by federal accounting standards\u2014taxes receivable,  compliance assessments, and write-offs\u2014for year-end financial reporting.", "This workaround process is costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. It  involves the use of a specialized computer program to extract all unpaid  assessment data from IRS\u2019 master files\u2014its only detailed database of  taxpayer information\u2014and classify them for financial reporting. However,  the master files do not contain all the details necessary to properly and  fully classify unpaid assessment accounts. Therefore, the workaround  process also includes the need to select statistical samples of IRS\u2019 unpaid  assessments and manually review the sampled accounts to (1) determine  their proper classification and (2) estimate collectibility for those  assessments properly classified as taxes receivable. As in past years, this  statistical sampling has resulted in the need to materially adjust the  amounts generated by the computer extraction program\u2014by tens of  billions of dollars\u2014to produce reliable amounts for taxes receivable and  other unpaid assessments. In fiscal year 2000, of a total of 474 unpaid  assessment sample items selected for detail testing that IRS\u2019 computer  extraction program originally classified as taxes receivable, 158 items were  misclassified and were actually write-offs or partial write-offs,  compliance assessments, or were deemed not to be unpaid assessments.  Based on our work, we estimate that 12.6 percent of unpaid assessments  originally classified by IRS\u2019 computer extraction program as taxes  receivable were misclassified.", "Figure 1 below illustrates the problem by showing the level of adjustments  needed to the amounts generated by the computer extraction program in  fiscal year 2000 to arrive at reliable amounts for each category of unpaid  assessments.", "Although the workaround processes allowed IRS to report reliable year-end  information for unpaid assessments in its financial statements, these  balances are reliable only for a single point in time and are not available  until several months after the end of the fiscal year.

However,  significant delays and errors in updating taxpayers\u2019 accounts further  exacerbated problems related to the reliability of unpaid assessment  balances in general and the reliability and management of individual  taxpayer accounts in particular throughout the fiscal year. Errors and  delays in recording activity also continued to lead to instances in which tax  liens were not promptly released or not released at all during the period  covered by our audit. These conditions continued to result in instances of  taxpayer burden and lost opportunities to collect outstanding taxes owed.", "As in previous years, we found delays and errors in recording payments for  unpaid payroll taxes where separate accounts are established and  assessments recorded for a related tax liability. IRS' systems cannot  automatically link to each other the multiple assessments made for the one  tax liability. Consequently, IRS\u2019 systems are unable to automatically reduce  the balance in the related account (or accounts) if the business or an  officer pays some or all of the outstanding taxes. To compensate, IRS  established procedures to manually link the related accounts. However, we  still found many instances in which payments were not posted to accounts  that had been linked. The statistical sample of 474 unpaid tax assessment  cases reviewed included 68 unpaid payroll cases involving multiple  assessments. Of these 68, we found that   29 cases contained payments that IRS either had not recorded, or had  failed to record in a timely manner, to all related accounts. Some of  these amounts were paid by taxpayers in the late 1980s. Based on the  results of our work, we estimate that 42 percent of the population of  unpaid payroll tax accounts involving multiple assessments as of  September 30, 2000, had this characteristic; and  of these 29 cases, 28 (96 percent) had a manual code cross-referencing  them to related accounts, yet the payments were still not recorded in all  of the related accounts.", "We also found other delays and errors. For example, we found that IRS\u2019  failure to enter or reverse status or freeze codes into the taxpayers\u2019  accounts resulted in improper refunds being issued\u2014in two cases, more  than $4,000 each\u2014to taxpayers who had other outstanding liabilities. In  another case, IRS recorded an estate payment of $68 million to the wrong  taxpayer account. Though the taxpayer\u2019s estate was owed a refund of  almost $7 million, this error was not corrected until almost 2 years later,  and thus the refund was not issued for nearly 2 years after it was owed.", "Delays and errors in recording activity in taxpayer accounts complicate  IRS\u2019 efforts to derive a reliable balance for taxes receivable and other  unpaid assessments in its financial statements. The accuracy of taxpayer  accounts affects the determination of both the appropriate classification of  these accounts under federal accounting standards and the basis for  estimating collectibility for those accounts determined to represent taxes  receivable. For example, to determine whether an unpaid payroll tax  liability related to a defunct business should be classified as a write-off, IRS  must first determine that no outstanding penalty assessments against  officers of the business exist or have any future collection potential. If the  accounts representing penalty assessments against officers continue to  show outstanding balances solely because payments have not been  appropriately recorded in these accounts, IRS could erroneously conclude  that the unpaid tax owed by the business still has some collection potential  from the officers and thus erroneously classify the account as a tax  receivable.", "Delays in updating taxpayer accounts and taking appropriate actions also  led to instances in which IRS did not release federal tax liens applied  against the property of taxpayers within 30 days after the taxpayers had  satisfactorily discharged their tax liabilities as required by Section 6325 of  the Internal Revenue Code. In fiscal year 2000, we found that IRS continued  to experience significant delays in releasing some tax liens. Specifically, in  3 of the 38 tax lien cases we reviewed in fiscal year 2000, we found that it  took IRS more than 100 days, and in one case 583 days, to release the liens  against the taxpayers\u2019 properties after the taxpayers had satisfied their  outstanding tax liabilities. Based on our work, we estimate that during  fiscal year 2000, for 11 percent of resolved unpaid assessment cases that  had tax liens, IRS did not release the liens within the 30-day requirement.  The failure to promptly release liens could cause undue hardship and  burden to taxpayers who may want to sell property or apply for  commercial credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pursuing Collections of Unpaid Taxes", "paragraphs": ["As with any large agency, IRS is confronted by the ongoing management  challenge of allocating its limited resources among competing priorities.

This type of case closure is referred to as \u201cshelving.\u201d The process of  shelving cases began in mid 1999 in response to an increasing inventory  workload and IRS\u2019 assessment that resource constraints and decisions  regarding where to deploy these resources would not permit it to actively  pursue the cases. According to IRS records, as of September 30, 2000,  1.8 million cases totaling $8.6 billion\u2014compared to 648,000 cases totaling  $2.4 billion at September 30, 1999\u2014were shelved because IRS judged that  resource constraints would not allow it to actively pursue collection on  these cases.", "We also continued to find unpaid assessment cases that had collection  potential but were not being actively worked by IRS. We found at least six  cases in our testing of unpaid assessments constituting taxes receivable for  which information in the case files indicated some collection potential, but  for which IRS had taken no collection action. In two of these cases, IRS  was not actively pursuing collection of taxpayers who owed $23,000 and  $88,000, respectively, in outstanding taxes and who each had annual  incomes in subsequent years of at least $110,000.", "How IRS derives its balance for taxes receivable in its financial statements  is affected by actions taken by IRS to collect outstanding taxes. In  estimating collectibility for those accounts in its statistical samples that are  appropriately classified as taxes receivable, IRS reviews case file  information and considers whether the agency is pursuing collection  through such means as levies, seizures, offers-in-compromise, or  installment agreements. To the extent these files contain no evidence of  such efforts, IRS must assess collectibility for the account at zero. This  ultimately affects the balance of both net taxes receivable and the related  allowance for doubtful accounts reported in its financial statements.", "IRS\u2019 failure to pursue delinquent taxpayers with at least some ability to pay  is part of a broader and continued decline in IRS\u2019 enforcement activities  and disposition of delinquent tax cases. For example, according to IRS  records, between fiscal years 1998 and 2000, enforcement activities such as  levy notifications experienced a substantial decline, from more than 9  percent to less than 1 percent of these unpaid assessment accounts. During  the same period, the dispositions of delinquent accounts and  investigations as a percentage of total outstanding cases decreased from  6.1 to 3.5 percent, a reduction of more than 43 percent. According to IRS  records, collections on delinquent taxpayer accounts also decreased by  28 percent during this period, from $5.3 billion in fiscal year 1998 to  $3.8 billion in fiscal year 2000.", "While there is a point at which it ceases to be cost effective to pursue  collection, we believe that these decisions should be based on reliable cost- benefit data. Without valid cost-benefit analyses, IRS is hindered in its  ability to make sound comparisons among competing priorities and to most  effectively allocate resources among these priorities. One element that is  critical to such a cost-benefit analysis is a measure of taxpayers\u2019 voluntary  compliance with the nation\u2019s tax laws. However, as we have previously  reported, IRS lacks such a measure. Consequently, it does not know the  impact of the recent declines in enforcement activities and delinquency  collections on taxpayer compliance. Congress and tax practitioners have  expressed concerns that declines in pursuing potential unpaid taxes and in  enforcing and collecting on delinquent accounts may increase incentives  for taxpayers either to not report or to underreport their tax obligations.  The lack of reliable cost-benefit information with which to make informed  decisions could result in billions of dollars in outstanding amounts going  uncollected and could lead to further erosion in taxpayers\u2019 confidence in  the equity of the tax system and adversely affect future compliance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Controls Over Refunds and Earned Income Tax Credits", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2000, IRS disbursed over 101 million tax refunds totaling  about $194 billion. However, because of long-standing weaknesses in IRS\u2019  controls over refund disbursements and other management challenges, the  federal government continued to be exposed to material losses through the  issuance of improper refunds, particularly with respect to EITC claims.  Time constraints, high volume, reliance on information supplied by  taxpayers, and the timing of filing of information returns by third parties  create inherent limitations in IRS\u2019 options for addressing the problem of  improper refunds. Consequently, in fiscal year 2000 IRS continued to  (1) issue improper refunds associated with invalid EITC claims and (2) rely  extensively on post-refund (detective) controls that were not fully effective  in identifying and limiting the losses associated with improper refunds.  This, in turn, continued to expose the government to financial losses,  possibly in the billions of dollars, through the disbursement of improper  refunds.", "Table 2 summarizes issues we found relating to refund processing controls,  their effects, and IRS\u2019 actions to address these issues.

For example, while it processes  hundreds of millions of tax returns each filing season, IRS must also issue  refunds within certain time constraints or be subject to interest charges. At  the same time, IRS must contend with the fact that third-party information,  such as form 1099s, are not required to be filed prior to the start of the tax  filing season. Comparison of such information with tax return data is  problematic because IRS does not have time to prepare the third-party data  for matching prior to the receipt of individual tax returns. Nonetheless, IRS  does have some preventive controls which, if effectively implemented,  could help to reduce the level of risk associated with issuing improper  refunds related to EITC claims. For example, IRS\u2019 Examination Branch is  responsible for performing examinations on tax returns with potentially  invalid EITC refund claims to determine the validity of the claim.  However, it has not performed a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether  it is focusing the appropriate level of resources on this effort. Without this,  IRS is unable to determine the extent to which refunds associated with  invalid EITC claims could be prevented or minimized had IRS devoted  more resources to its examination efforts.", "The Electronic Fraud Detection System (EFDS) is an automated  screening tool IRS\u2019 Criminal Investigation Division (CI) uses to identify  EITC refund claims with the highest potential to be fraudulent or invalid. CI  uses EFDS to score each EITC claim, using a set of screening criteria. CI  retains those cases that indicate a high potential for fraud for follow-up and  forwards all other cases that score above a certain level to the Examination  Branch. For each of its 10 campuses, the Examination Branch determines a  set number of cases that it perceives as the workload each campus\u2019s  resources can handle. It then refers cases to each campus for examination  up to that campus\u2019s established workload amount.", "During fiscal year 2000, the Examination Branch reduced the number of  cases referred by CI for examination by choosing a higher minimum score  level for each case and reviewing other factors such as how recently the  taxpayer was last examined. Additionally, it discontinued referring cases  associated with a particular campus once it reached the determined  workload level it established for that campus. Consequently, the number of  EITC refund claims subject to examination by IRS was predetermined by  the available resources rather than based on an analysis of what the  optimum score level should be for selecting cases to examine based on the  expected yield at each level and the associated resource cost.", "The government could be losing billions of dollars through improper  refunds associated with invalid EITC claims. For example, in a study of tax  year 1997 returns, IRS estimated that of approximately $30.3 billion EITC  claims received, about $9.3 billion (30.6 percent) were invalid claims. IRS  did not know the exact amount of the related improper refunds, but based  on IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1998 refund rate of about 78 percent of EITC claims, we  estimate the amount of improper EITC refunds to be about $7.3 billion. In  the same study, IRS estimated that it would not be able to recover 84  percent of the total invalid EITC claims. Applying this rate to the refunds  portion only, we estimate that $6.1 billion of the improper refunds could be  unrecoverable. With such a potential for invalid refunds, IRS must better  ensure that it is devoting the appropriate level of resources to examining  these claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detective Controls", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 primary detective controls are its automated matching programs to  match tax returns against third-party data.

However, IRS did not perform follow-up examinations on millions of  identified tax returns estimated to have billions of dollars of underreported  tax liabilities.

During a fingerprint check, an applicant\u2019s  fingerprints are processed through the FBI\u2019s national database to identify  those with arrest records. However, further review of the disposition of the  case is necessary to determine if the applicant was convicted of the crime.   We previously reported on several weaknesses related to this fingerprinting  process. Although IRS significantly improved the turnaround time for  obtaining the fingerprint results, other weaknesses persisted. IRS issued  new policies to address these weaknesses. However, we found that the new  policies were not consistently applied throughout IRS during fiscal year  2000. Additionally, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  (TIGTA) auditors found that the IRS\u2019 current fingerprinting process was  ineffective in screening out juvenile applicants with questionable  backgrounds.", "In response to a recommendation we had made previously, IRS issued, on  April 3, 2000, a policy that prohibited the hiring and placement of an  applicant at any IRS location until the applicant\u2019s fingerprint checks had  been received and case disposition evaluated. This policy applied to  permanent and temporary employees. However, we found that IRS offices  did not consistently comply with this new hiring policy. Out of the  approximately 19,600 employees hired during fiscal year 2000, about 4,900  (25 percent) were hired and began working prior to IRS\u2019 receipt and  evaluation of their fingerprint checks. As IRS did most of its hiring from  October through April in preparation for the peak tax-filing period, the new  policy was not in place in time to affect many of these new hires.   Nonetheless, there were about 2,700 persons hired after the April 2000  policy was issued, of which 145 (5 percent) were hired and began working  with taxpayer receipts and sensitive taxpayer data without IRS first  receiving the results of their fingerprint checks. The following table shows,  on a monthly basis, the number of persons who were hired and reported for  duty without IRS having first received the results of their fingerprint checks  out of the total number hired after the issuance of the April 3, 2000, hiring  policy. Although the table shows a downward trend in the number of  violations after the April 2000 policy, we cannot determine to what extent  this is due to compliance with the new policy or due to IRS\u2019 not hiring as  many staff in May through September.", "To compound this problem, IRS staff also did not comply with its April and  June 1999 policies which require the fingerprinting of all filing season  applicants at the earliest possible time in the job application process.  According to IRS\u2019 personnel database, about 2,200 employees out of  approximately 19,600 (11 percent) hired during fiscal year 2000 were not  fingerprinted until they first reported for duty or several days\u2014and in some  instances months\u2014later. The delays in initiating the fingerprinting process  delayed IRS management\u2019s receipt of the fingerprint results. This,  combined with the pressing need for more resources to meet the increased  workload during the tax-filing period, was a contributing cause for new  employees entering on duty before the results of fingerprints were  received. Consequently, as a result of noncompliance with IRS\u2019 hiring  policies, IRS managers could have unknowingly allowed employees with  unsuitable backgrounds to handle cash, checks, and sensitive taxpayer  information, thus increasing their risk of theft and misuse. In fact, from  April through September, of the 145 persons who entered on duty before  IRS received their fingerprint checks, 22 (15 percent) were subsequently  found to have had potentially unsuitable backgrounds, such as drug use  and assault.", "Additionally, a TIGTA audit completed in May 2000 found that IRS\u2019  fingerprint prescreening procedures were ineffective for juvenile  applicants, i.e., those under 18 years of age, due to mitigating  circumstances involving the release of juvenile records. IRS campuses  often hire high school students to fill short-term positions to process  income taxes. IRS\u2019 policy to complete fingerprint prescreening checks  applies to all new hires, even short-term temporary employees.", "As of April 2000, TIGTA found that at the two campuses it reviewed, 192  juveniles were hired to work in the receipts processing areas and all of  them had fingerprint checks completed. However, 18 U.S.C. 5038 states  that information about a juvenile\u2019s record may not be released when the  request for information is related to an application for employment. It  further states that responses to such inquiries shall not be different from  responses made about persons who have never been arrested. Therefore,  the case disposition from any juvenile arrest could not be released or  otherwise known. According to TIGTA, because juveniles\u2019 records are  sealed, it was not certain whether local authorities, which provide  information for the FBI\u2019s national database, forward juvenile arrest records  to the FBI. Even if the fingerprint check identified a juvenile arrest record,  current laws prevent investigators from determining whether the juvenile  was convicted or acquitted. TIGTA recommended that IRS develop a  process to more effectively screen out juvenile applicants with  questionable backgrounds for receipt processing positions.

Table 8 summarizes the issues we identified in this  area, together with their effects and IRS\u2019 actions to address these issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reporting Year-End Balances", "paragraphs": ["As the table above indicates, IRS does not have an adequate financial  management system. As a result, IRS is hindered in its ability to produce  reliable financial statements and to generate timely and accurate  information needed to make management and operational decisions.", "An adequate financial management system is one that can provide  complete, reliable, consistent, timely, and useful financial management  information. Such a system comprises, among other elements, an  integrated general ledger system using common data elements and  transaction processing that is supported by transactional details and a  system of internal controls to ensure that reliable data are obtained,  maintained, and disclosed in reports. Such a system is also capable of  capturing and reporting reliable performance information. However, IRS\u2019  financial management system is made up of two independent general  ledgers\u2014custodial and administrative\u2014that are not integrated with each  other nor with their supporting records for material balances. Specifically,  IRS\u2019 custodial general ledger does not have adequate audit trails for federal  taxes receivable, federal tax revenue, or federal tax refunds, while its  administrative general ledger lacks audit trails for P&E and program costs.", "For example, as discussed earlier in this report, the lack of clear  traceability between the general ledger and underlying financial  transactions required IRS to use extensive ad hoc procedures and  statistical methods to derive reliable balances for taxes receivable and  other unpaid assessments. In addition, as discussed further below, because  of weaknesses in internal controls, IRS could not demonstrate that  reported performance indicators were reliable. Consequently, neither of  IRS\u2019 two general ledgers complies with the requirements of the U.S.  Government Standard General Ledger (SGL) at the transaction level and  cannot be used to support the preparation of financial statements without  material financial reporting adjustments, nor do they comply with the  requirements of FFMIA.", "One important requirement of an effective financial management system is  that it can be relied upon to support the timely production of auditable  financial statements. At IRS, this is not the case. Although IRS was able to  produce financial statements that were fairly stated in all material respects  for fiscal year 2000, these statements required monumental human efforts  that extended well after the September 30, 2000, fiscal year-end. In  addition, information produced by IRS\u2019 financial management system  required billions of dollars in adjustments to derive reliable financial  statement balances. As mentioned earlier, substantial adjustments totaling  billions of dollars had to be made to reliably report the balance for taxes  receivable. These adjustments, as well as the balance in net taxes  receivable, were not available until well after the fiscal year had ended.  Similarly, fiscal year 2000 administrative activities totaling over $3.7 billion  were either recorded in the wrong general ledger accounts or were not yet  recorded in IRS\u2019 general ledger as of September 30, 2000. For example, as  of fiscal year-end, accrued payroll and depreciation expenses totaling  $480 million had yet to be recorded in IRS\u2019 general ledger, while P&E  acquisitions that should have been capitalized were recorded as expenses.  These activities had to be analyzed and recorded or reclassified, a time- consuming process that took several months to complete.", "Though IRS achieved an important milestone in receiving an unqualified  opinion on its fiscal year 2000 financial statements, the approach used to  achieve this goal did not address the underlying purpose of sound financial  management as envisioned by the CFO Act\u2014to produce reliable, useful,  and timely financial and performance information on a routine basis for  day-to-day decision-making. Furthermore, until lasting improvements are  achieved, IRS will have to continue to rely on extensive efforts to produce  reliable financial statements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintaining Accurate and Timely Financial Data", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2000, IRS did not timely record transactions and perform  the necessary reconciliations to ensure that the data contained in its  general ledger systems were up-to-date and accurate. Consequently, IRS  did not have reliable, timely, and routine financial information to effectively  manage its operations.", "GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government requires  that transactions and events be recorded accurately and timely and that  ongoing monitoring occur in the course of normal operations to provide  reasonable assurance that financial reporting is reliable. These internal  control processes and procedures are crucial to ensuring that an agency\u2019s  financial management systems produce information that is reliable, timely,  and useful. Without these processes and procedures, a modern and  integrated financial management system by itself does not guarantee that  an agency will be able to prepare financial statements that are fairly stated  and generate financial data that can be relied upon for day-to-day decision- making.", "During fiscal year 2000, IRS\u2019 internal controls over financial reporting were  not consistent with these standards. Specifically, IRS did not record  material transactions in the general ledger until months after they  occurred. For example:   Depreciation expenses totaling more than $350 million were not  recorded throughout the year, but only at year-end. As a result, the  balance in depreciation was inaccurate at interim periods during the  year.", "Imputed financing costs totaling nearly $400 million were not recorded  in the general ledger throughout the year but rather as a lump sum  amount several months after the fiscal year-end. While IRS made the  necessary adjustments to produce reliable year-end financial  statements, the balance for imputed financing costs was incorrect  throughout fiscal year 2000.", "In addition, IRS lacked adequate policies and procedures for ensuring that  financial data would be adequately reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Specifically, IRS management informed us that it did not have policies and  procedures requiring systematic reviews and analyses of account balances  at interim periods. Consequently, errors and omissions were allowed to  arise without prompt detection and correction, and adjusting entries that  should have been made throughout the year were allowed to build up until  they became material and time-consuming to correct. IRS also did not have  policies and procedures requiring reconciliation between its proprietary  and budgetary accounts during fiscal year 2000. IRS had to make  adjustments totaling more than $160 million several months after the fiscal  year-end to bring the net cost of operations derived from the budgetary  accounts and the net cost of operations derived from the proprietary  accounts into agreement. The failure to maintain accurate and up-to-date  financial data impeded IRS management in its ability to use the general  ledger as a reliable source of financial data at interim periods to make  managerial and operational decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reporting on and Managing Performance", "paragraphs": ["IRS did not track the cost accounting information needed to prepare cost- based performance information consistent with GPRA. Deficiencies in IRS\u2019  systems and internal controls discussed above mean that IRS cannot  routinely generate reliable financial and performance data for cost-benefit  analyses. This could adversely affect IRS management\u2019s and Congress\u2019  ability to make informed management decisions related to resource  allocation and other aspects of IRS\u2019 operations throughout the year.", "The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program\u2019s (JFMIP) System  Requirements for Managerial Cost Accounting requires that, at a  minimum, agencies have cost accounting information to support the  aggregation of financial information related to programs and projects, each  of which could have several levels, such as subprograms. In order for IRS  to aggregate cost information by program and project to conform to this  standard, it must first capture costs at the detail level as they are incurred.  However, IRS did not have a systematic process in place to capture costs at  the project level during fiscal year 2000. Though IRS had a Project Cost  Accounting Subsystem (PCAS) coding structure that can capture personnel  costs at the detailed project and subproject level, IRS did not require that  all of its employees use PCAS to itemize the time spent on specific projects  on their time cards. Consequently, during fiscal year 2000, IRS staff did  not use PCAS codes for time charged to either of IRS\u2019 two largest  appropriations, which collectively accounted for 74 percent of IRS\u2019  budgetary resources.", "Similarly, except for information technology projects, PCAS did not collect  nonpersonnel costs such as equipment depreciation, rent, and utilities by  projects and subprojects. At year-end, IRS extracted data from its  accounting system, imported the data into a database, and used a  spreadsheet to allocate these nonpersonnel costs to the different projects  and subprojects in an effort to derive reliable net operating cost data for  the Statement of Net Cost. However, these data were not available until  months after the fiscal year-end, were only reliable for a single point in  time, and thus were not available on an ongoing basis for management  purposes. The failure to fully and accurately capture cost at the project  level affected IRS\u2019 ability to produce reliable cost data. Specifically, IRS  was unable to report on the costs associated with each of the 15 key  performance indicators it reported in the \u201cManagement Discussion and  Analysis\u201d that accompanied its fiscal year 2000 financial statements. As a  result, IRS cannot be consistent with GPRA in reporting cost-based  performance measures related to its various programs.", "In addition, IRS was unable to provide evidence that supervisory review  was performed to ensure that the performance indicators, and data used to  derive these indicators, were complete, accurate, and reliable. For  example, IRS did not have documentation demonstrating that a responsible  official had reviewed the data to ensure that all data that should be  collected for a specific performance indicator was collected, and that only  pertinent data was included. This increases the risk that any errors or  omissions affecting IRS\u2019 key performance indicators will not be detected  and corrected in a timely manner.", "Finally, IRS faces an additional challenge in the fact that its custodial and  administrative general ledgers are independent of each other and are not  integrated. Since cost data are primarily contained in the administrative  general ledger while critical performance data comes from the custodial  general ledger, IRS needs to be able to link these two general ledgers before  it can calculate reliable, cost-based performance measures. IRS plans to  implement a major portion of an integrated financial and taxpayer account  management system by fiscal year 2005. Consequently, this link between  the custodial and administrative general ledgers will not occur before then."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reporting Tax Revenues", "paragraphs": ["IRS continues to be unable to determine the specific amount of revenue it  actually collects for Social Security, Hospital Insurance, individual income  taxes, and excise tax trust funds.

Although the tax returns,  which the taxpayers file months after the deposits are made, do contain a  breakdown on the type of tax, this information pertains only to the amount  of the tax liability and not to the amount of taxes paid to IRS. This  condition restricts IRS\u2019 ability to report actual collections of significant  taxes, such as Social Security, that would be of interest to many parties,  including Congress.

However, we continued to find weaknesses  in the excise tax certification process. For example, due to delays in  recording tax return information in its systems, the amount IRS certified to  the Highway Trust Fund for the quarter ended September 30, 1999,  included nearly $346 million in collections from previous quarters. These  delays resulted in delays in transferring these amounts to the trust funds,  thus reducing the amount of interest income the trust funds earn on these  receipts.

The modernized environment is expected to  provide IRS with, among other things, the ability to (1) track and report on  the status of each unpaid assessment category, amount, and taxpayer,  (2) record P&E transactions in its general ledger accounts as they occur,  and (3) prepare cost-benefit analyses and cost-based performance  measures. However, these systems will take years to implement.", "IRS continues to make progress in addressing its financial management  challenges. The strong commitment and dedication to financial  management reform by IRS senior management has played a crucial role in  the progress the agency has made to date and is critical for future  improvements.", "IRS has developed many workaround processes that resulted in its ability  to produce reliable financial statements for fiscal year 2000. However,  these processes take considerable time, effort, and expense and do not fix  many of the fundamental financial management issues that continue to  plague the agency. Until these issues are addressed, IRS cannot achieve the  overriding objective of the CFO Act and other reform legislation enacted  during the last decade\u2014to produce reliable, useful, and timely financial  and performance information for day-to-day decision-making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, IRS agreed that, in order to  improve financial management, it must sustain a high level of effort to  implement solutions that will address systems deficiencies and internal  control weaknesses. IRS also provided information regarding past and  current initiatives to address GAO\u2019s audit recommendations. For example,  during fiscal year 2000, IRS (1) routinely reconciled its fund balance,  (2) reviewed and managed suspense items, (3) eliminated unneeded  obligations, (4) installed and used live-scan fingerprint equipment, and  (5) implemented procedures and processes to improve the reliability of  P&E records. IRS also noted that it has undertaken additional initiatives to  address remaining internal control deficiencies. For example, it noted that  it implemented a new inventory system for its P&E and enforced standards  to improve inventory practices, developed a standard checklist and  conducted monthly security reviews in fiscal year 2001, and hired  additional staff to support the master file extract process. We will follow up  during our fiscal year 2001 audit to assess the effectiveness of these  initiatives.", "While agreeing with the overall thrust of our report, IRS disagreed with  some of the specific report findings and recommendations. Specifically, in  the area of P&E, IRS disagreed that in the short term, property acquisitions  should be recorded as capital assets as the transactions occur. IRS noted  that, until an integrated property management system is acquired, it should  continue the current practice of recording property acquisitions as  expenses and then transferring these expenses to capital assets in the  general ledger after a review process. We disagree. As our report states,  IRS\u2019 process for deriving a reliable P&E balance for its annual financial  statements involves the use of extensive manual procedures by a  contractor to extract and analyze IRS\u2019 data on expenses to identify items  that should be classified as assets. This process is time-consuming, occurs  months after the acquisition of the assets, and only provides a reliable  balance for P&E for a single point in time. This process does not provide  IRS with reliable P&E data on an ongoing basis for use in operational  decision-making.", "IRS also disagreed with our conclusions regarding the timeliness of IRS\u2019  recording of obligations. IRS believed that the 2 instances we cited of IRS\u2019  failure to timely record obligations were isolated and thus did not  constitute a material weakness in controls over appropriated funds. The 2  instances cited in our report were illustrative examples of IRS\u2019 failure to  record obligations before goods and services were received, and did not  represent the total number of errors found in our testing. In fact, we found  10 instances in which IRS failed to record obligations before goods and  services were received. These exceptions were brought to the attention of  IRS staff and management, in writing, throughout the audit. These 10  instances together represent more than isolated instances of IRS\u2019 not  recording obligations before goods and services are received. It is also  important to note that we did not characterize in our report the issue of IRS  not timely recording obligations in and of itself as a material weakness.  However, taken collectively, this, plus other issues in the area of  appropriated funds management, constitute a material weakness in IRS\u2019  internal controls over its appropriated funds that preclude IRS from  providing reasonable assurance that material misstatements would be  prevented or detected on a timely basis.", "In addition, IRS disagreed that we should include its failure to properly  record adjustments to obligations as a material weakness. IRS also  requested that we reconsider our recommendation that it include in its  systems modernization blueprint the capability to differentiate between  valid and invalid adjustments to prior-year obligations. IRS stated that the  issue stemmed from our and its different interpretations of the definition of  upward and downward adjustments. IRS believed that it had successfully  resolved this issue because it made audit adjustments we proposed prior to  issuing its final fiscal year 2000 financial statements and stated that it  would continue to make these adjustments in the future.", "While we agree that IRS made the audit adjustments we proposed to its  financial statements, we disagree that this issue has been resolved and  should be excluded from our report. As discussed above, our report does  not characterize this issue in and of itself as a material weakness. As stated  in our report, we requested that IRS make adjustments in instances  involving changes in accounting codes and travel entries that do not meet  the definition of upward and downward adjustments. IRS made these  adjustments to its fiscal year 2000 financial statements. These adjustments  eliminated the type of known errors found during our testing and reduced  the dollar amounts of these accounts to levels not considered material for  purposes of fairly presenting the financial statements as a whole. These  adjustments do not, however, correct the underlying problems that gave  rise to the errors in these accounts that required adjusting. Also, while IRS  took exception to our recommendation, it noted that the CFO has included  this issue in the functional requirements for IRS\u2019 new financial  management system, and that, in the short term, it will continue to make  these adjustments manually. These corrective actions, if effectively  implemented, should address our recommendation regarding this issue. We  will evaluate the effectiveness of these actions during the fiscal year 2001  audit.", "IRS also contested our including an example in the report to illustrate its  failure to record the liability for goods and services when received. IRS  stated that it had entered into an agreement with us to exclude invoices  received after November 30, 2000, from fiscal year 2000 audit procedures.  As the invoice for this particular transaction was received on December 6,  2000, IRS believed that this transaction fell outside the agreed-to cutoff  date and should thus not be cited.", "We disagree with IRS\u2019 characterization of what was agreed to. The  agreement between IRS and us related to our testing of subsequent  disbursements. In previous years, we tested disbursements made within  the 3 months following fiscal year-end to identify transactions that should  have been, but were not, recorded as a transaction in the year under audit.  In fiscal year 2000, we agreed to reduce the test period to 2 months  following the fiscal year-end, that is, we would test only subsequent  disbursements made from October 1 through November 30 after the fiscal  year-end. However, the particular example in our report that IRS is taking  issue with was identified during our testing of IRS\u2019 ending undelivered  orders balance\u2014this was separate and apart from the testing of subsequent  disbursements. Further, lockbox services are recurring transactions  covered by 5-year contracts. Consequently, IRS had the capability to accrue  for these services without waiting for the invoice. As our report states, the  most likely misstatement of the ending undelivered orders balance  resulting from the failure to timely record receipt of undelivered orders  was $47 million, with an upper error limit of $87 million. The magnitude of  these errors reinforces the need for IRS to act to ensure that goods and  services are recorded when received.", "With respect to financial reporting, IRS took issue with our findings that  material inaccuracies were found in the fiscal year 2000 financial  statements and that these inaccuracies were not effectively detected in IRS\u2019  review of these financial statements. IRS disagreed that these findings  should be cited as a material reporting weakness. IRS further stated that it  was aware of only two material adjustments we proposed that fell within  the purview of financial reporting.", "Again, we disagree. Each of the internal control deficiencies over financial  reporting cited in our report do not individually constitute a material  weakness\u2014it is the combination of these deficiencies that constitutes a  material weakness. Further, as our report states, IRS\u2019 draft financial  statements contained material inaccuracies and the review procedures  instituted by IRS were not effective in identifying and addressing errors and  omissions material to the financial statements. For example, the first two  draft financial statements prepared in January and early February 2001  omitted a material footnote comparing IRS\u2019 Statement of Budgetary  Resources with the President\u2019s Budget as required by U.S. generally  accepted accounting principles and OMB 97-01, despite the fact that we  had indicated to IRS in October 2000 that the footnote was necessary. An  effective review procedure would have identified this material omission.  Further, we proposed not 2, but 14 audit adjustments, which IRS accepted  and recorded. The aggregate absolute value impact of these adjustments  was (1) $160 million to assets and liabilities, (2) $140 million to net cost,  and (3) $227 million to the statements of financing and budgetary  resources.", "In the area of refunds, IRS disagreed with our finding that IRS does not  screen all EITC claims through EFDS. IRS stated that all EITC claims are  run through the EFDS program, which prioritizes returns according to  criteria that were based on the 1997 EITC Compliance study. We agree that  all cases with EITC refund claims are run through the EFDS program by  IRS\u2019 Criminal Investigation Division and assigned a score to assist in  prioritizing which cases to work. CI, in turn, refers cases above a certain  score to the Examination Branch for examination. However, the  Examination Branch only examines a subset of those cases referred for  examination based upon its perceived level of available resources without  collecting the data necessary to determine whether it is focusing the  appropriate level of resources on this effort. Without such data, IRS is  unable to determine the extent to which refunds associated with invalid  EITC claims could be prevented or minimized had IRS devoted more  resources to its examination efforts. We have modified our report to  provide a more detailed explanation of the EITC examination selection  process.", "IRS also disagreed with our recommendation that it implement policies and  procedures requiring all employees to itemize their time on their time  cards. IRS stated that it currently tracks itemized information for most  employees through its functional tracking systems. We will follow up  during our fiscal year 2001 audit to assess the adequacy of this approach.", "Again, we recognize that IRS achieved an important milestone in producing  for the first time combined financial statements in fiscal year 2000 that  were fairly stated in all material respects. However, as we state in our  report, the tremendous efforts undertaken by IRS staff and management to  produce reliable financial statements do not result in reliable, useful, and  timely financial and performance information IRS needs for decision- making on an ongoing basis. This approach does not address the  underlying financial management and operational issues that adversely  affect IRS\u2019 ability to effectively fulfill its responsibilities as the nation\u2019s tax  collector. As we have reported for several years, long-term and systematic  improvements in IRS\u2019 processes and systems are needed to address the  management challenges we have identified.", "During fiscal year 2000, IRS demonstrated a strong commitment to address  the operational and financial management issues raised by us in previous  financial statement audits.
