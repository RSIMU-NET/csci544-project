SSA reduced the total square footage of its facilities by about 1.4 million square feet (or about 5 percent) from fiscal years 2012 to 2016, according to GAO's analysis, by applying new standards for determining the size of offices and consolidating facilities (see figure). SSA has also expanded the services it offers remotely, and online use has increased for certain services such as disability and retirement applications. Despite this increase, in-person contacts at field offices have not changed substantially, with about the same number in fiscal year 2016 as in fiscal year 2007 (approximately 43 million). This may be due to growing demand for services as well as certain services not yet being fully available online.", "SSA's steps to reconfigure its footprint do not fully incorporate changes in service delivery, such as the expansion of remote service delivery. As mentioned above, SSA has been expanding the services it delivers online. While SSA has a strategic goal of re-thinking its footprint as it expands remote service delivery, it lacks a facility plan that links to this goal, as called for by facility planning criteria. Without a plan that considers the increasing use of online services and wide variation in online service use across field offices, SSA may miss opportunities to further reduce its footprint.", "SSA is taking steps to make remote services easier to use, for example by adding new features to its website and offering alternate approaches for accessing services, but does not consistently evaluate them, which could limit its ability to shift more services online and further reconfigure its footprint. For example, SSA has added features allowing online customers to interact directly with SSA staff. However, SSA does not track staff follow-ups to deal with any errors in online benefit applications in order to improve them, as called for by federal internal control standards. To enhance access to remote services, SSA has introduced alternate service approaches such as videoconferencing in third-party sites; however, it does not have performance goals for these approaches. GAO has previously identified performance goals as a best practice, which may help agencies improve their customer service."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that SSA develop a facility plan for reconfiguring its footprint as it expands remote service delivery, track staff follow-ups of online applications, and develop performance goals for alternate service approaches.

We analyzed SSA data on SSA facilities for fiscal  years 2006 to 2016 including square footage, number of facilities, and  rent. We analyzed SSA data on service delivery for fiscal years 2006 to  2016, including the number of benefit applications and other transactions  completed online and through field offices and the number of visits to field  offices. We assessed the reliability of these data through electronic  testing and interviews with SSA staff, and found them to be sufficiently  reliable for our reporting objectives. We interviewed SSA headquarters  staff involved in facilities and service delivery planning, as well as officials  at the General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and three other  federal agencies that have co-located their offices with SSA or are also  taking steps to reduce their footprints. We visited seven field offices as  well as some other SSA facilities, such as hearing offices, where we  interviewed local managers and staff and observed interactions with  customers. We also conducted phone interviews with senior managers  responsible for these seven field offices plus an additional six field offices.  In sum, we interviewed managers who oversee 13 of SSA\u2019s  approximately 1,200 field offices. These offices were selected to achieve  diversity in geography, visitor to staff ratio, and proportion of local  residents with Internet access, among other factors. The results of these  site visits and interviews are not generalizable to SSA\u2019s full portfolio of  field and hearing offices. To assess SSA\u2019s efforts related to its facilities  and remote services, we applied criteria previously identified by GAO for  facility planning and customer service standards, as well as standards for  internal control in the federal government.

In fiscal year 2012, SSA  began centralizing its facility planning process, moving responsibility for  this process from the regional offices to OFLM. This shift included  establishing one signatory for all requests for office space and monitoring  changes to the amount of office and warehouse space in its inventory.", "SSA\u2019s facility planning is guided by factors including:  (1) Leasing cycle. SSA\u2019s typical leasing cycle, according to interviews  with SSA officials as well as agency documentation, begins approximately  36 months before a lease expires. SSA begins developing alternatives for  future space use, which could mean renewing the lease for the current  space, moving to a new location, or adjusting the current space (e.g.,  consolidating or co-locating offices). Facilities officials at each SSA  regional office work with area directors and field office managers to  determine an office\u2019s space needs. For field offices, regional facilities  officials then apply space allocation standards (space standards) to  determine the size of the office based on the current number of staff on  board. After determining the space needs and applying the space  standards, OFLM officials provide final approval before a request is  submitted to GSA. Then GSA officials work directly with SSA regional  facilities officials to complete the process for renewing a lease, including  identifying potential sites if a field office needs to change location due to,  for example, a shift in the service area population.  (2) Service area review. SSA policy requires area directors to conduct  service area reviews\u2014which assess the need for office changes based  on service delivery conditions\u2014at least every 10 years for each field  office in their area of responsibility to determine whether the service  area\u2019s needs are being met by the field office. However, area directors  can decide to conduct these reviews on an ad hoc basis, such as when  an office\u2019s lease is expiring. Service area reviews consider a wide variety  of factors, including demographics, workload, and the physical  accessibility of the office. They can result in an internal recommendation  that, among other things, an office be consolidated with another office or  move location. Recommendations to change location or consolidate,  made by the area director, must be approved by the regional  commissioner and, as needed, headquarters officials. Headquarters  officials would approve, for example, a recommendation to establish a  new field office or change the location of an existing field office to a new  congressional district. For approved location changes or consolidations,  SSA then works with GSA as described above to identify sites for its  potential use.  (3) Space reduction initiatives. Two OMB government-wide initiatives also  guide SSA\u2019s facilities planning. The Freeze the Footprint (2012) and  Reduce the Footprint (2015) policies were developed to help federal  agencies more efficiently use their excess and underutilized properties in  light of a fiscally-constrained environment and changes in how agencies  conduct business, including the utilization of technology to deliver  services to the public. The policies required SSA to initially avoid  increasing the square footage in domestic offices and warehouses  beyond a baseline established in 2012, and then to set and meet annual  reduction goals. The Freeze the Footprint policy was in effect until 2015;  the Reduce the Footprint policy took effect in 2016. SSA determines its  annual reduction goals in consultation with GSA and OMB. In fiscal year  2015, OMB and GSA re-categorized over half of SSA\u2019s facilities as  \u201cpublic-facing\u201d\u2014primarily used to serve and interact with the public\u2014and  exempted these facilities from its Reduce the Footprint baseline and  reduction targets. As a result of this change, the fiscal year 2016  reduction target for SSA\u2019s facilities was lowered from 260,000 to 120,000  square feet."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA Has Reduced Its Physical Footprint and Expanded Remote Service Delivery", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA Has Reduced Its Total Square Footage and Number of Facilities Since 2012", "paragraphs": ["SSA reduced its square footage and the number of its facilities from fiscal  year 2012, when the overall federal effort began to limit agencies\u2019  physical footprint, to fiscal year 2016. SSA is continuing to reduce its  footprint to align with these federal efforts and to reduce costs, according  to agency documents and interviews with agency officials.", "SSA reduced its footprint by about 1.4 million square feet (or 5.2 percent)  from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016, according to our analysis (see  fig. 1). These space reductions met both its Freeze the Footprint and  Reduce the Footprint goals, according to SSA. SSA officials said over  600,000 square feet of its space reduction since 2012 was in field offices,  with the remainder in headquarters space. According to SSA, the agency  issued revised space standards for its field offices in 2012 in response to  OMB\u2019s Freeze the Footprint policy; the revised standards contributed to  these reductions. The application of the revised standards as field office  leases come up for renewal has helped reduce SSA\u2019s overall field office  space. While the revised standards expand the space in public reception  areas, the standards\u2019 larger reductions in space for personnel and  support space reduce the overall field office footprint. For example, the  2006 space standards allocated 125 square feet per SSA staff member,  which the 2012 standards reduced to 120 square feet; the 2006  standards allocated 7 square feet per filing cabinet, while the 2012  standards include no space for filing cabinets as SSA\u2019s digitization of data  has reduced the need to store paper. Similarly, the revised standards  applied to large facilities, such as the headquarters facilities, reduce office  space needs by lowering allocations for personnel and support space.", "SSA also decreased the number of occupied buildings by 4.7 percent  (1,634 to 1,558) from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016, according to  our analysis of SSA facilities data (see fig. 2). For example, SSA  decreased the number of field offices through consolidations from 1,273  in fiscal year 2012 to 1,245 in fiscal year 2014, with no further reductions  from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016. Additional reductions in space  and the number of occupied buildings resulted in part from consolidating  leased office and warehouse facilities into federally-owned facilities at  headquarters.", "Despite the overall decrease in space, SSA\u2019s inflation-adjusted rental  costs remained essentially steady until fiscal year 2016, when they  decreased, according to our analysis of SSA data. The total inflation- adjusted cost of SSA\u2019s leases was 3 percent lower in fiscal year 2016  than in fiscal year 2012. However, the cost per square foot was slightly  higher in fiscal year 2016 than in fiscal year 2012, according to our  analysis (see fig. 3). For example, the cost of a lease might increase,  due to increased market rates, even if it is renegotiated for less space. In  Queens, New York, annual rent for a field office increased by 15 percent  in 2015 despite its using 12 percent less space under the terms of a  renegotiated lease.", "As of the end of fiscal year 2016, our analysis of SSA data indicates 65  percent of the total square footage in SSA\u2019s inventory is in buildings  where the majority use was field operations (see fig. 4). Field  Operations includes, for example, field offices and card centers. Square  footage in buildings whose majority use was ODAR (15 percent) and  headquarters (13 percent) represent the next largest space users.  However, we were not able to calculate the exact number and square  footage of different types of offices (such as field offices or hearing  offices) due to limitations with SSA\u2019s facility data, which we describe in  greater detail later in this report. These limitations also preclude the  presentation of comprehensive data on how the composition of SSA\u2019s  offices has changed over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Is Expanding Benefit Application and Management Services It Offers Remotely, but Overall Demand for Field Office Services Has Not Decreased", "paragraphs": ["SSA is expanding its remote delivery of services\u2014such as online and  other new technologies to connect with the agency\u2014to provide more  choices to its customers and because of overall trends in Americans\u2019 use  of online services. SSA has had online services available for a number of  years, introducing online retirement and disability applications in 2000  and 2002, respectively. It continues to move more services online. For  example, SSA launched an online Medicare Only application in 2010 and  a new online portal for managing benefits (mySocialSecurity) in 2012.  SSA officials said they have plans to introduce online options for other  high-volume workloads in the coming years. For example, there were  10.6 million requests for replacement Social Security cards in fiscal year  2016, and as of April 2017 SSA was piloting online requests for  replacement cards in 17 states and Washington, D.C., with plans to  expand to additional states. There were also over 2 million SSI  applications in 2016, and in April 2017 SSA introduced an online SSI  application for individuals who meet certain conditions.", "The number of online transactions completed by SSA customers for  benefit applications and certain benefit management services has  increased as SSA has expanded the types of services available. For  example, from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2016, the number of  retirement applications submitted online increased from approximately  220,000 (9 percent of total retirement applications) to approximately 1.4  million (52 percent of applications), according to our analysis of SSA data  (see fig. 5).", "There is wide variation in the use of these online services between field  offices, however, with customers in certain areas continuing to conduct  the majority of services directly with SSA staff either in person at field  offices or over the phone with field office staff. The use of online services  varied across the 13 field offices included in this review, including for  benefit verification letters (4 percent to 36 percent), disability claims (31  percent to 62 percent), and retirement claims (13 percent to 62 percent),  according to our analysis of SSA service delivery data for fiscal year 2016  (see fig. 6). SSA officials attribute this variation across service areas to  particular population demographics and needs (e.g., computer literacy).  For example, SSA field offices in San Francisco, California, have a  relatively low percentage of online claims due to large non-English  speaking and homeless populations, SSA officials said.", "In addition to its main service delivery methods (in person, phone, online),  SSA has rolled out a variety of technologies for customers to conduct  business with the agency, many of which are self-service. For example, in  2008 SSA introduced self-help personal computers in field offices, which  allow customers to complete transactions online at these locations,  according to SSA officials. Visitors completed over 390,000 online  transactions on these computers in fiscal year 2016. SSA has also  increased use of video service delivery, which allows SSA staff to take  claims or conduct hearings remotely, either in SSA facilities or in third- party locations such as senior centers. For example, the proportion of  hearings on disability claims that were conducted by video increased from  11 percent in fiscal year 2007 to 26 percent in fiscal year 2016, according  to SSA data. Another emerging service delivery approach is the desktop  icon, which provides a shortcut to access SSA online services on  computers in third-party locations, such as libraries or social service  agencies. Customers completed about 94,000 transactions by clicking on  these icons during fiscal year 2016, according to SSA data. SSA also  recently ended a trial of customer service station kiosks in seven SSA  field offices and third-party locations, which allowed customers to  complete online transactions, print and scan documents, and interact with  SSA staff through a video connection.", "Despite the increase in online transactions relative to field office  transactions for certain benefit application and management services,  overall demand for field office services has not decreased. As indicated  above, our analysis of SSA data for disability and retirement applications  and benefit verification letters shows an increasing proportion of these  services being completed online. However, our analysis of separate SSA  data on total visits to field offices and phone calls to SSA for all services  shows that the number of these contacts has not decreased. For  example, the number of in-person visits to field offices in fiscal year 2007  (42.9 million) was about the same as in fiscal year 2016 (42.7 million),  according to SSA data. The demand for services with SSA staff over the  phone has not decreased either (see fig. 7). SSA officials said this may  be due to increased demand for certain services and customer  preference. For example, overall demand for retirement and some related  benefits increased 20 percent from 2009 to 2016, as evidenced by SSA  claims data. SSA officials said that given the rise in the overall U.S.  population over the last decade\u2014the population increased by 7 percent  between 2007 and 2016, according to data from the Census Bureau\u2014the  expanded use of online services has likely prevented a substantial  increase in visits to field offices, even if in-person visits have not actually  declined. SSA expects overall demand for SSA services to continue  increasing as the U.S. population ages. In addition, there are still SSA  services with significant workloads, such as SSI claims, that are not yet  fully available online."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Steps to Reconfigure Its Physical Footprint Do Not Fully Incorporate Changes in Service Delivery and Also Face External Constraints", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "While SSA Has Developed Strategic Goals, It Does Not Always Consider Evolving Service Delivery or Collect Needed Information", "paragraphs": ["SSA has developed strategic goals for expanding remote service delivery  while reconfiguring its physical footprint and is beginning to implement  initiatives that may help reduce space; however, SSA has not integrated  its facility plan with its strategic plan, provided flexibility for individual  offices, or compiled accurate facility data as suggested by standards for  internal control and leading practices for facility planning."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Integrating Facility and Strategic Plans", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s 2014-2018 Strategic Plan and Vision 2025\u2014the latter, published in  2015, lays out SSA\u2019s priorities and vision for the agency over 10 years\u2014 emphasize the agency\u2019s goal to expand remote service delivery options  and adjust its physical footprint to reflect the emphasis on remote  services.

This plan  includes information on, among other things, annual space reduction  targets; progress made in reducing domestic office and warehouse  space; initiatives to help continue space reductions; and challenges to  further reduction.", "Leading practices for facility planning state that such plans should reflect  a decision-maker\u2019s priorities for the future and should meet the goals and  objectives in the agency\u2019s strategic plans, including identifying the proper  mix of existing and future facilities needed to fulfill its goals. SSA\u2019s 2014-2018 Strategic Plan and Vision 2025 set broad goals, but neither is  a facility plan nor includes specific steps to reduce facilities as the agency  expands remote service delivery beyond identifying a small number of co- location opportunities. Furthermore, SSA\u2019s Real Property Efficiency Plan  is driven by OMB requirements, which are distinct from SSA\u2019s strategic  goal to expand remote service delivery, and does not explicitly detail how  SSA will change its physical footprint in relation to its strategic goal to  expand remote service delivery options. SSA has developed targets for  online use by customers, for example increasing the number of online  transactions completed by 25 million each year, but it is unclear how  those inform its facility planning decisions. In addition, though we found  high online usage rates in some of the field offices we analyzed, SSA  headquarters officials said a high percentage of online service use by  SSA customers has not been a determining factor in local-level decisions  on facility space because not all services are available online.", "As SSA continues to expand remote service delivery and develop plans  to reflect the priorities of Vision 2025, there may be more opportunities for  it to reconfigure its physical footprint. SSA has recently started making  several additional services available online that represent significant  workloads, such as the SSI application, which may reduce the number of  in-person visits over time and the associated space needs. Further, SSA  officials said they are currently developing the Strategic Plan for 2018- 2022, which will implement the long-term Vision 2025 priorities to adjust  its physical footprint in anticipation of delivering a greater number of  services remotely. However, because SSA lacks a long-term facility plan  that identifies the needed composition of its facilities as it moves to  emphasize remote service delivery, SSA could be missing opportunities  to achieve its strategic goals, including identifying opportunities to  reconfigure or reduce some field offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Flexibility for Individual Offices", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s policies and procedures for making space planning decisions have  helped achieve space reductions, but may not always provide sufficient  flexibility to adapt to changing service demands. Currently, SSA uses  service area reviews\u2014conducted periodically\u2014and space standards to inform its decisions about needed space. At the local level, a service area  review for an individual field office considers several factors, such as  customers\u2019 use of online services, accessibility of the office, and office  workload trends, on which to base recommendations for changes, such  as, for example, field office consolidations. Unlike service area reviews,  space standards are automatically applied to all offices when a lease is  expiring to determine how much space each office requires. The space  standards, revised in 2012, take into account changing needs to some  extent. For example, the revised standards eliminated space for filing  cabinets due to the digitization of records and added space to the  reception areas because of the continued demand for in-person services  (see fig. 8).", "While the application of the revised space standards has helped reduce  SSA\u2019s overall field office space, some SSA officials said the standards do  not provide flexibility for individual offices. SSA headquarters officials said  the standards are used to determine the amount of space to lease for an  office, and after an office is acquired, planning and design efforts are  conducted to configure the space. However, three of five regional  commissioners we interviewed said the space standards did not provide  flexibility to accommodate equipment for emerging technologies, such as  an area for self-help personal computers for customers. The standards  allot 100 square feet for equipment for emerging technologies in general  because, according to SSA headquarters officials, some technologies  were not available when the standards were being revised so the actual  amount of space needed for them could not have been known. However,  offices may not be able to be configured to accommodate the equipment  at the time it is delivered without making trade-offs affecting other  services. For example, some field offices use interviewing windows,  which are needed for in-person service, as a place for self-help  computers. In the Wilmington, Delaware, field office, the self-help  computers take up two interviewing stations and are located at the end of  a long hallway requiring an escort for customers who want to use them  (see fig. 9).", "The space standards also may not provide sufficient flexibility to  accommodate unanticipated staff growth, according to 8 of 10 area  directors we interviewed. The pre-2012 space standards allowed field  offices to request 10 percent more space for potential staff growth; the  current standards allot space only for current on-board staff. SSA  headquarters officials as well as 4 of 10 area directors said long-term  leases make it difficult for SSA to adjust field office space as needs arise,  such as to accommodate changes in staff levels. For example, one area  director said two field offices in Utah were understaffed at the time of their  lease renewal, which resulted in insufficient space in the new location to  add staff to meet the office\u2019s service demands.", "According to SSA officials, the field office space standards currently meet  the agency\u2019s needs. Furthermore, they have no plans to reassess the  space standards at this time, though they may do so in the future if, for  example, changes to service delivery require it. According to federal  standards for internal control, management should identify, analyze, and  respond to significant internal and external changes to the agency, such  as changes in personnel and technology. Absent the flexibility to adjust  space to accommodate changes in staff levels or incorporate new service  delivery technologies, the quality of service at some field offices may  decline because of increased wait times and decreased availability of  potentially time-saving service delivery technologies.

As a result, in  cases where more than one office occupies a building, SSA\u2019s data  system only counts the office using the majority of the space. Since fiscal  year 2015, SSA has been annually developing a list of its buildings and  their associated office types, and using this list to meet OMB reporting  requirements. However, to develop that list, SSA must manually match  records from multiple data sources and OFLM and organizational  component staff must coordinate.

As SSA develops  the REALT application, it will be important to ensure that it is structured to  provide the information needed by SSA officials to make effective facility  planning decisions.

SSA has co-located approximately 10 percent of its  field offices with ODAR permanent remote sites, as of May 2017. SSA  recently initiated a co-location pilot program with the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS), and is taking steps to evaluate the results to determine the  utility of the pilot agency-wide. The goal of the co-location pilot, which  combines SSA field offices with IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers, is to  lower each agency\u2019s infrastructure costs. Since it began in January 2017,  four IRS staff have moved into SSA field offices. According to an IRS  official the pilot will continue through January 2018. The two agencies are  collecting customer service information based on visitor data, weekly  surveys of SSA field office managers, and customer surveys; they plan to  use the results to determine whether to expand the pilot and pursue  additional co-location opportunities. The weekly visitor data includes the  number of visitors to the pilot locations and the wait times. SSA\u2019s field  office managers participating in the pilot complete surveys weekly to  determine how much time SSA staff spend on co-location-related  activities, such as notifying an IRS employee when customers arrive.

For example, it took SSA longer than expected to find an  office location in Mountain View, California, that met the agency\u2019s space  needs because of the high rental costs. The Douglas, Arizona, area  director stated the office is challenged to find an alternate location  because Douglas is a small town with a limited number of buildings and  the cost of renovating an existing building to suit a field office\u2019s needs  would be too high. Similarly, the Hazard, Kentucky, field office currently  has excess space, but the limited building options in downtown are in a  higher crime area and, therefore, are not acceptable for an SSA field  office, according to the field office manager. SSA headquarters officials  mentioned other constraints, including a complicated federal leasing  process and that some property owners may not want SSA in their space  due to the high number of visitors and lack of available public parking.", "SSA also works within constraints that can come from addressing the  concerns of community stakeholders and unions. Elected officials or  community leaders may sometimes oppose SSA\u2019s plans to consolidate  field offices. For example, though the San Francisco Chinatown and  Downtown offices are approximately 1.5 miles apart and SSA\u2019s internal  analysis supported consolidation, SSA officials stated the agency decided  not to do so due to community concerns about access if the Chinatown  office was eliminated. In Kingston, New York, SSA initially retained a  contact station after the field office was consolidated with the  Poughkeepsie field office, which is approximately 20 miles away, in  response to political concerns about Kingston losing an office, according  to a local manager. Also, according to SSA officials, employee unions  negotiate office layout and design if conditions of employment of the  bargaining unit employees are impacted by proposed changes.  Additionally, they noted that unions provide input on the impact and  implementation of space changes, including ergonomics and security of  the field offices. SSA headquarters officials said while the interactions with its employee unions are positive, there are times these interactions  can cause delays to individual projects.

Customers\u2019 difficulties with online applications  could limit SSA\u2019s ability to shift more of its business online and further  reconfigure its physical footprint. More than half the regional  commissioners and field office managers we interviewed, as well as front- line staff in three of the four field offices where we interviewed these staff,  said this complexity is a challenge; many cited the complexity of disability  programs in particular. The online application for disability benefits  requires claimants to provide detailed information on their medical and  work histories and, according to SSA officials, to navigate through over 10  separate web pages. Several staff we interviewed\u2014three of five  regional commissioners and three of seven field office managers\u2014 believe the online applications could be improved. For example, one  regional commissioner said the online disability application asks the same  questions multiple times and this can be confusing. In our observations of  in-person disability claims at field offices, we saw examples of the  assistance that SSA staff may provide with benefit claims. In one  instance, an SSA staff member asked the applicant a number of  questions to try and determine the date the claimant stopped working,  and ultimately got permission to contact the claimant\u2019s employer. The  staff member told us that if the application had been done online, SSA  staff almost certainly would have had to follow up with the claimant to  complete the application. On the other hand, a number of SSA staff\u2014 including five of seven field office managers and front-line staff in four  field offices\u2014said some processes such as changes of address or  managing direct deposit are simpler and more suited to being completed  online.", "SSA is trying to improve its online services and make them more user- friendly, which may promote greater use of these services and less  reliance on in-person services at field offices. For example, SSA is adding  new features that make it possible for online customers to interact with  SSA staff to resolve problems. It has introduced a click-to-callback option  allowing online customers to request a call from an SSA staff member,  and a click-to-chat option for a live online conversation; and in fiscal year  2018 or later, SSA plans to introduce click-to-video for a live conversation  with video image. In 2015, SSA surveyed customers who had started but  failed to complete online benefit applications, with the goal of identifying  difficulties and ways to address them, according to SSA officials. The  survey found, for example, that the most common reason disability benefit  applicants failed to complete an online claim was that they did not  understand what the questions meant (30 percent of respondents listed  this as a reason). SSA officials told us that, aside from adding a reminder  to the final screen of the online application to click \u201csubmit,\u201d the survey  has not led to any other enhancements to the online application.", "Furthermore, despite anecdotal evidence that online claims submitted to  SSA contain errors, SSA does not track these issues on an on-going  basis. Six of seven field office managers and front-line staff in four field  offices told us at least some online benefit claims have issues that require  staff to follow up with claimants. Front-line staff in several field offices said  such follow-ups are common, and staff in one field office said it often  takes longer to process an online claim than one submitted in-person as a  result. Staff in two field offices cited problems with missing medical  release forms and with the start dates claimants gave for their  disabilities. SSA officials said they do not collect any data on which  online claims require staff follow-up, because staff must decide in each  case what is needed and it would be complex to track each time this  happens. Standards for internal control in the federal government state  agency management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks to  meeting agency objectives, including risks related to complex programs  and new technologies. Without data on the number and nature of errors  in online claims, SSA may miss opportunities for improvements that make  the claims process easier for customers and the agency, and that could  help SSA further reconfigure its footprint to the extent that more  customers migrate to online services.", "Another challenge with SSA\u2019s online services is data security, which the  agency is taking steps to address. Several SSA staff we interviewed\u2014two  of five regional commissioners and 3 of 10 area directors\u2014told us  customers\u2019 concerns about the security of their personal information are  an obstacle to wider use of online services. For example, one area  director said data security breaches affecting government agencies have  raised public concerns about the security of personal information on the  Internet. In a 2015 survey of SSI recipients about their Internet use, SSA  found that among responding adult recipients, 74 percent were not very  or not at all comfortable with providing their Social Security number  online\u2014which is required to use a mySocialSecurity account. SSA  officials told us a major component of their effort to protect customers\u2019  data involves complying with federal data security requirements.", "Officials said the agency completed a risk assessment of its  mySocialSecurity portal in 2016, and as a result is developing stronger  identity proofing and new multi-factor authentication options.

Lack of access to  the Internet or to a computer was mentioned as an obstacle to wider use  of SSA\u2019s online services by four of five regional commissioners and 7 of  10 area directors. One regional commissioner said the major obstacle to  expanding remote service delivery is lack of broadband Internet access in  rural areas. Additionally, an area director told us low levels of Internet  access and computer literacy are challenges in low-income urban areas.  According to SSA\u2019s 2015 survey of recipients of SSI\u2014a program for  people with limited income\u2014only 34 percent of adult respondents said  they use the Internet. Among adult respondents who do not use the  Internet, close to half (43 percent) said they either lack a computer or lack  Internet access. Some SSA customers simply prefer interacting directly  with an SSA staff member to conducting business on-line, according to 9  of 10 area directors and six of seven field office managers we  interviewed. Several of these officials said older people and non-English  speakers in particular may feel more comfortable with in-person services.", "A key part of SSA\u2019s strategy to address customers\u2019 challenges with  access to online delivery of services has been to make these services  available in more locations, from SSA field offices to community-based  sites such as public libraries, according to agency officials. As noted  previously, in recent years SSA has rolled out self-help personal  computers in field offices, giving visitors the option of completing business  online on an SSA computer; desktop icons on computers in third-party  locations such as public libraries, to link users to SSA services online;  and a small number of customer service stations in third-party locations,  which offer both online and video connections with SSA (see fig. 10 for  images of these technologies). Additionally, SSA uses video service  delivery to conduct business such as claims and hearings with customers  in remote locations.", "Some SSA staff and a staff member at a community organization shared  the benefits of these new approaches. For example one area director said  the self-help personal computers in field offices give customers the option  of taking care of their business quickly rather than waiting to speak with  an SSA staff member. A field office manager said these computers can  help educate the public about the online option for accessing SSA  services. With regard to video service delivery, one area director told us it  is used to conduct claims and other business with Native Americans on  remote reservations, who prefer the personal interaction with SSA  provided by the video. A staff member at a community organization that  hosts a desktop icon site said that for older, non-English speakers, it has  been a helpful alternative to visiting a crowded SSA field office. Staff said  they walk these clients through each step of using SSA\u2019s online services.", "SSA officials also reported some implementation challenges with these  new technologies and approaches. Most area directors (6 of 10) and field  office managers (five of seven) we spoke with said there have been  challenges with the use of self-help personal computers, such as  customers who may lack technological skills and need assistance to use  the computers. SSA has also experienced some difficulties in working  with other organizations to host these new technologies. For example,  several SSA staff and a staff member at a host site said some entities  have had concerns about including desktop icons on their computers due  to issues such as data security and increasing workloads for staff at host  sites.", "While these new service delivery approaches are integral to SSA\u2019s efforts  to expand remote service delivery, the agency lacks clear performance  goals or targets for them. SSA is collecting data on the use of some of  these approaches. For example, it collects data on the number of different  types of transactions\u2014such as benefit claims and registrations for  mySocialSecurity accounts\u2014completed through the self-help personal  computers, the number of transactions completed by clicking on desktop  icons, and some data on use of video services. However, SSA has not  established performance goals for all of these new approaches. In prior  work we have identified setting performance goals and collecting  performance information related to these goals as key elements of  effective customer service. Without setting meaningful performance  goals, for example, for speed, quality, or customer satisfaction, and  measuring progress towards these goals, SSA may miss opportunities to  improve its service delivery and potentially encourage more customers to  use remote services rather than visit field offices. This may be especially  relevant in light of the implementation issues raised by some SSA staff.  SSA officials told us they have not established set criteria for assessing  the desktop icon sites\u2014such as what level of usage indicates success\u2014 because each site is different and must be assessed individually. Officials  also said there is little cost to the agency for installing these sites apart  from staff time. Similarly, officials said they have no set criteria for the  success of video services in third-party locations because each site has  different needs and must be evaluated individually. They said they rely on  anecdotal information from local video service coordinators to determine if  each site makes sense. However, strategies do exist for developing  performance goals that account for local variation.

Until recently, a significant  impediment to reducing or downsizing field offices has been the  continuing demand for in-person services, but this trend could change as  SSA shifts more and more services online. Without a long-term facilities  plan for reconfiguring its field office structure as it expands options for  customers to access services remotely and in light of the wide variation in  remote service use across offices, SSA could miss opportunities to further  reduce its footprint. The agency\u2019s 2012 space standards have contributed  to space reductions, yet the standards may in some cases impede  effective customer service because they do not provide sufficient flexibility  in how SSA uses space to meet local staffing or technology needs.  Finally, SSA\u2019s capacity to conduct long-term facilities planning will likely  be hampered as long as it lacks a facilities data system that it can use to  accurately track the composition of offices in its buildings over time.", "Similarly, despite SSA\u2019s success in expanding remote services, it could  be missing opportunities to make additional progress or improve its  customer services. If the agency can encourage greater use of remote  services, it will potentially make further reconfiguration of its physical  footprint more feasible. For example, SSA does not have data on the  incidence and cause of staff follow-ups required with online applicants to  inform SSA about how to make these processes better.

Specifically, the records in the  data set represent individual leases. Each lease is categorized according  to a \u201cspace type\u201d denoting a type of SSA office, such as area office, field  office, and hearing office. Leases may be associated with a single SSA  office or with multiple offices.

One reason we chose the Billings, Montana, field office is because it  has one of the largest service areas (45,000 square miles), resulting  in potentially very long distances to reach the field office.", "In addition to the Wilmington, Delaware, field office, our pilot site visit  location, we chose three additional site visit locations from the 10  selected field offices based on (1) unique services provided at the  selected field office or in the surrounding area such as being co-located  with an ODAR permanent remote site or having a video unit linked to an  external location (e.g., another city or town) and (2) geographic diversity.  To be consistent with the selection process above, we chose one office  that had been part of a consolidation and two that had a service area  review.", "At each of the three site visit locations aside from Wilmington, Delaware,  we visited two field offices, a hearing office, and a third-party location that  provided remote service delivery (e.g., a Korean community organization  with a Social Security Express desktop icon). The first field office was  selected from the original list of 10 offices discussed above. The second  field office in each location was chosen based on its proximity to the first  field office or a hearing office that we visited. For example, we selected  the Lexington, Kentucky, field office because it is located in the same  building as the hearing office we visited. As a result, in total we visited or  interviewed the area director associated with 13 field offices (see table 2).  During each visit we interviewed the field office manager, hearing office  manager, and chief Administrative Law Judge, and conducted a group  interview with a random selection of field office staff. In total we spoke  with 30 field office staff. We also observed staff-customer interactions at  the field offices that were selected; observed hearings; and toured each  field and hearing office. The results of our site visits and interviews with  field staff are not generalizable to all of SSA\u2019s field and hearing office  staff.", "Finally, we interviewed five regional commissioners.
