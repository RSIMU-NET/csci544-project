One law enforcement agency annually publishes aggregate metrics on BSA reports that led to investigations and indictments. But FinCEN did not consistently communicate available metrics; it generally did so on an ad-hoc basis such as through published speeches. In 2019, FinCEN began a study to identify measures on the value and usefulness of BSA reporting\u2014to be completed by the end of 2019. By consistently communicating currently available metrics (summary data), and any later identified by the study, FinCEN may assist financial institutions in more fully understanding the importance of their efforts.", "Industry associations GAO interviewed noted financial institutions would like to receive more institution-specific feedback on the usefulness of their BSA reporting; they also identified suspicious activity reports as labor-intensive. In 2017, FinCEN began providing such feedback and some law enforcement agencies have ongoing efforts to provide institution-specific briefings. But these efforts have not been regularly made and involved relatively few institutions. Additional and more regular feedback, designed to cover different types of financial institutions and those with significant financial activity, may enhance the ability of the U.S. financial industry to effectively target efforts to identify suspicious activity and provide quality BSA reporting."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes four recommendations, including that FinCEN review options to consistently communicate summary data and regularly provide institution-specific feedback on its BSA reporting.

The Bank Secrecy Act and related anti-money laundering  authorities and requirements (collectively, BSA/AML) are important tools  for regulators and law enforcement to detect and deter the use of financial  institutions for illicit finance activity. BSA and its implementing  regulations generally require financial institutions\u2014such as banks,  securities broker-dealers, futures and commodities brokers, and money  transmitters\u2014to collect and retain various records of customer  transactions, verify customers\u2019 identities, maintain AML programs, and  report suspicious transactions.", "The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the  Department of the Treasury (Treasury), is responsible for the  administration of BSA/AML. As lead regulator for BSA, FinCEN issues  implementing regulations and ensures compliance with the BSA. FinCEN  has delegated its examination authority to certain federal agencies,  including the federal functional regulators who supervise institutions for  BSA compliance\u2014Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), National  Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2014and the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS). We refer to the federal functional regulators and IRS  collectively as supervisory agencies in this report because they are  responsible for examining financial institutions for compliance with the  BSA/AML requirements. Self-regulatory organizations (SRO) for the  securities and futures industries\u2014including the Financial Industry  Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the National Futures Association  (NFA)\u2014also have BSA/AML responsibilities and conduct BSA  examinations of their members. The Department of Justice (DOJ) can  conduct investigations of financial institutions and individuals for both civil  and criminal violations of BSA/AML laws and regulations. DOJ  prosecutes violations of federal criminal money laundering statutes and  violations of the BSA, and typically several law enforcement agencies  play a role in conducting BSA-related criminal investigations. In addition,  hundreds of agencies, including federal, state and local law enforcement,  supervisory agencies, and state regulators use BSA reporting\u2014for  example, suspicious activity reports (SAR) and currency transaction  reports (CTR)\u2014in their investigations or examinations.", "In the past few years, some congressional committees have held  hearings on BSA/AML supervision and enforcement activities and  reforming the BSA/AML framework to improve coordination and  communication among agencies responsible for oversight of BSA/AML  requirements. We recently issued reports highlighting perspectives on  BSA/AML requirements and on concerns related to derisking\u2014the  practice of banks limiting certain services or ending relationships with  customers to, among other things, avoid perceived regulatory concerns  about facilitating money laundering. In addition, financial institution  stakeholders have raised questions about the lack of a feedback loop or  clear communication from FinCEN, law enforcement, and supervisory  agencies on how to most effectively comply with BSA/AML requirements,  especially BSA reporting requirements.", "You asked us to provide information on BSA implementation, including  efforts to improve coordination between federal agencies and the financial  industry to combat money laundering. This report (1) describes how  FinCEN and supervisory agencies supervise, examine for, and enforce  BSA/AML compliance; (2) discusses how FinCEN, supervisory agencies,  and law enforcement collaborated on implementing and enforcing  BSA/AML requirements; and (3) examines the extent to which FinCEN,  supervisory agencies, and law enforcement have established metrics and  provided feedback to financial institutions on the usefulness of their BSA  reporting.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations,  and agency documentation, including examination policies and  procedures. We reviewed and analyzed data from FinCEN summary  reports on the examination and enforcement activities of supervisory  agencies\u2019 for fiscal years 2015 through 2018 (second quarter). We  assessed the reliability of the data by reviewing documentation related to  these datasets, interviewing officials knowledgeable about the data, and  conducting manual data testing for missing data, outliers, and obvious  errors. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes  of reporting summary data on agencies\u2019 BSA/AML examinations,  violations, and enforcement actions.

We selected the six agencies  based on their (1) focus on financial crimes, (2) involvement in BSA  criminal cases we selected, (3) participation in FinCEN\u2019s liaison program,  and (4) identification by FinCEN as key users of BSA data. The views of  selected law enforcement agencies are not generalizable. To identify key  collaborative mechanisms used to implement BSA/AML responsibilities,  we reviewed agency documentation (such as strategic plans, national  strategies, and risk assessments); prior GAO reports that contained  discussions of collaborative mechanisms; and interviewed agency  officials from FinCEN, supervisory agencies, and selected law  enforcement agencies. We compared agencies\u2019 collaboration efforts to  criteria within federal internal control standards on management  communication. We also reviewed three criminal cases involving  BSA/AML violations by financial institutions to illustrate how law  enforcement investigates and prosecutes BSA violations and coordinates  with FinCEN and other supervisory agencies. We selected the cases  because they occurred recently (calendar year 2017 or 2018), involved  criminal violations of BSA by financial institutions, required agency  coordination, and resulted in a large monetary penalty. While not  generalizable, the cases provided insight into collaboration processes. To  obtain perspectives on BSA/AML implementation and agency  collaboration, we conducted interviews with the supervisory and law  enforcement agencies previously mentioned. To obtain additional  perspectives, we interviewed seven selected industry associations,  chosen based on their published works and relevant experience and for  coverage of key financial industries (banking, securities, futures, and money services businesses). While not generalizable, these interviews  helped provide context for how industry views the effectiveness of  BSA/AML collaboration efforts.", "For the third objective, we reviewed relevant agency documentation and  data on any performance metrics related to the usefulness of BSA  reporting and any feedback mechanisms that FinCEN, supervisory  agencies, or the six selected law enforcement agencies had established.  We also interviewed FinCEN and the supervisory agencies, law  enforcement agencies, and industry associations previously mentioned.  We compared the BSA metrics against key criteria for enhancing or  facilitating the use of performance metrics that GAO previously identified  and federal internal control standards on management communication.

Covered financial institutions are expected to  complete a BSA/AML risk assessment to identify specific products,  services, and customers, which supervisory agencies can use to evaluate  the compliance programs of financial institutions and scope their  examinations. Most officials from supervisory agencies and SROs said  they also consider asset size, among other factors, to determine  examination frequency and scope. For example, the federal banking  regulators implemented less frequent examination cycles for smaller,  well-capitalized financial institutions.", "FinCEN is the administrator of BSA and delegated BSA/AML examination  authority to the supervisory agencies. FinCEN officials told us they have  been considering how regulators of financial institutions of different size  and risk assess BSA/AML compliance and continue to work with federal  regulators to identify better ways to supervise examinations.

FinCEN officials told us it mostly considers risk (not size) when  conducting its own examinations because even small institutions could  pose money laundering risk. FinCEN states that it uses an intelligence- driven approach to target examinations in high-risk areas. For example,  FinCEN officials told us they have conducted BSA/AML compliance  examinations of financial institutions on issues such as virtual currencies  and data breaches in domestic branches of foreign banks. In an August  2018 speech, the Director of FinCEN noted that FinCEN, working closely  with BSA examiners at IRS, had examined more than 30 percent of  identified registered virtual currency exchangers and administrators since  2014\u2014totaling about 30 examinations, according to FinCEN officials.  FinCEN officials said they conducted a total of five BSA/AML  examinations with IRS in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

In considering asset size to determine the  frequency of examinations, all of the banking regulators adopted rules to  reduce the frequency of examinations for small, well-capitalized financial  institutions\u2014as seen in table 2.", "In addition, in their annual reports to FinCEN the banking regulators  provide a description of the criteria used for determining the timing and  scope of BSA/AML examinations, such as risk and asset size. For  instance, FDIC and the Federal Reserve noted in their annual reports to  FinCEN that the timing and scope of their BSA/AML examinations are  primarily determined by an institution\u2019s BSA/AML risk profile and factors  such as its condition, overall rating, and asset size. OCC, in its annual  report, said that examination scope included consideration of the bank\u2019s  BSA/AML risk assessment, quality of validated independent testing  (internal and external audit), previous examination reports, BSA reports,  and other relevant factors, including data from the OCC\u2019s Money  Laundering Risk System. OCC officials said the system identifies  potential indicators of BSA/AML risk by measuring the extent to which  various types of products, services, customers, and geographies are  offered or served by supervised banks. For banks that report into that  system, OCC officials said they factor information from the system into  developing an examination strategy that helps determine resource  allocation and expertise needs. According to NCUA, each credit union  must receive a BSA examination each examination cycle\u2014although the  frequency and scope of these examinations may vary based on the credit  union\u2019s size and other risk factors. For example, small credit unions with  assets under $50 million may be subject to a defined-scope examination  (which includes a BSA examination) where the risk areas have already  been identified and the scope is pre-determined. NCUA also provides a  BSA questionnaire that is publicly accessible to assist its examiners in  implementing BSA examinations (for example, to help examiners assess  the BSA risk of the credit union and scope the examination). Factors  considered in the questionnaire include prior violations, correspondence  from law enforcement related to BSA compliance, whether or not the  credit union conducted a risk-assessment, and high-risk accounts.", "While the FFIEC BSA/AML examination manual and other federal  banking documentation discuss considering BSA/AML risk when  determining the scope and frequency of examinations, officials from all  four banking associations with whom we spoke said, in practice,  examiners do not always use a risk-based approach when assessing  BSA compliance. Nearly all said examiners may take a zero-tolerance  approach when conducting examinations. For example, representatives  from two industry associations said that although failure to file a single  SAR or unintentional errors should be treated differently than egregious,  intentional noncompliance, or a pattern of negligence (in terms of level of  noncompliance), that sometimes has not been the case. Federal Reserve  officials noted that each examination is specific to the facts and  circumstances of that examination and that systemic deficiencies in a  bank\u2019s BSA/AML compliance program are generally treated differently  than nonsystemic deficiencies.", "As discussed earlier, FFIEC has been working on updating its entire  FFIEC BSA/AML examination manual, including updates to more clearly  state the agencies\u2019 approach to risk-based supervision, according to OCC  officials. Representatives from two of the four banking associations with  which we spoke with stated they were involved in providing input on  recent updates to FFIEC\u2019s examination manual and all four had provided  input to the effort to implement the customer due diligence and beneficial  ownership rule. For example, OCC officials said that the risk-based  approach is most clearly discussed in the opening pages of the current  FFIEC manual and could be more directly incorporated throughout the  manual to provide enhanced guidance to examiners.

One of the project\u2019s efforts seeks  feedback from selected supervised institutions and examiners on ways to  improve the examination process. For example, the FFIEC examination  modernization project reviewed, compared, and identified common  principles and processes for risk-focusing examinations of community  financial institutions. FFIEC members also committed to issue reinforcing  and clarifying examiner guidance on these risk-focused examination  principles.", "In addition, Treasury, FinCEN, and the banking regulators established a  working group to identify ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness  of BSA/AML regulations and supervision. In October 2018, the working  group issued a joint statement to address instances in which banks with  less complex operations and lower-risk BSA/AML profiles may decide to  enter into collaborative arrangements with other banks to share resources  to manage their BSA/AML obligations in order to increase efficiency and  reduce burden.

According to FINRA officials they have different expectations  for firms\u2019 AML programs, based on size (larger firms typically are  expected to have more complex AML programs than smaller firms).

They noted that  BSA/AML guidance tends to focus on banks and treat other types of  financial institutions (money service business, casinos, and others) as  one group, despite their diversity. In relation to the futures industry, the  representatives stated that this makes it difficult for futures commission  merchants to implement requirements because the rules or guidance do  not necessarily take into consideration their unique business structure.  CFTC staff told us that BSA requirements could be applied differently to  different types of firms and were supportive of tailoring or reducing  requirements where the obligations were duplicative, overly burdensome,  and BSA-related risks were low. For example, CFTC staff recommended  that FinCEN relieve (1) certain introducing brokers known as voice  brokers and (2) futures commission merchants that are initial clearing  firms from customer identification program requirements because they  have limited interaction with the customer and do not have access to  customer information that would allow them to perform customer due  diligence.

In response, FinCEN  management said the primary reason for not processing referrals was the  \u201cage\u201d of the violations when the referral was made to FinCEN, which  according to FinCEN officials impedes a thorough investigation of the  violations due to an imminent expiration of the applicable statute of  limitations. The report recommended that IRS consider having its FinCEN  referral process reviewed by process experts to make it more efficient  because delays in submitting cases to FinCEN could lead to FinCEN  taking longer to process referrals or not considering cases for further civil  penalty.

The  Office of Inspector General recommended that FinCEN implement a  process to periodically notify federal and state regulators of the status of  and actions taken on referred cases. In its response, FinCEN agreed  with the recommendation, and stated that it follows its standard operating  procedures for case processing. FinCEN\u2019s response stated that its case  processing procedures provide that in all FinCEN enforcement actions  taken in coordination with other government partners (including other  regulators), FinCEN\u2019s Enforcement Division will provide regulators with a  copy of FinCEN\u2019s consent order that details the violations, factual  findings, and proposed settlement terms.

For  example, on average, from fiscal years 2016 to 2018, SEC\u2019s BSA review  team reviewed about 27,000 SARs each year that related to current or  potential investigative matters, or entities regulated by SEC. CFTC staff  told us they review an estimated 7,500\u20138,000 SARs annually. On  average, in about 100 instances a year, CFTC\u2019s BSA review team refers  SARs to investigative teams in support of new or existing investigations.

FinCEN contracts an  annual survey that includes questions to BSA data users (such as federal  and state law enforcement and regulators) about the usefulness of BSA  data to, among other things, provide new information or supplement  known information or identify new leads or investigations. BSA data users  are asked to score the value and impact of BSA data and scored it at  about 80 out of 100 for both 2016 and 2017.

Based on information FinCEN collected from  law enforcement, approximately 95 percent of 314(a) requests  contributed to arrests or indictments. In addition, FinCEN reported the  number of cases submitted and related subjects of interest identified in  314(a) requests for each 2-week period from January 5, 2016, to January  29, 2019. For example, for the 2-week period starting on January 29,  2019, 16 requests resulted in 162 subjects of interest.", "FinCEN contracted a study on the value of BSA reporting\u2014which began  in January 2019 and is to be completed by the end of 2019\u2014with the goal  of identifying common attributes of BSA value among stakeholders;  assessing how to use available data to establish metrics for evaluating  and calculating the value of BSA; identifying gaps in data and other  information needed to measure the value of BSA reporting; and proposing  actions to improve FinCEN\u2019s ability to identify, track , and measure the  value of BSA reporting.

On December 4, 2017, FinCEN publicly launched  the FinCEN Exchange, a public-private program that brings together  law enforcement, FinCEN, and different types of financial institutions  to share information to help identify vulnerabilities and disrupt money  laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. As of  December 2018, FinCEN convened more than a dozen briefings with  law enforcement agencies across the country, involving more than 40  financial institutions. According to Treasury\u2019s 2018 national strategy,  the information provided by financial institutions through SARs after  the briefings helped FinCEN map and target weapons proliferators,  sophisticated global money laundering operations, human trafficking  and smuggling rings, and corruption and trade-based money  laundering networks, among others. FinCEN officials told us that  these exchanges provide a forum in which law enforcement can  request specific information and provide information on typologies to  financial institutions that allows financial institutions to improve their  BSA monitoring and reporting.", "FinCEN advisories. FinCEN issues public and nonpublic advisories  to financial institutions to help financial institutions better detect and  report suspicious activity related to a particular risk and related  typology. For example, in October 2018 FinCEN posted an advisory  on its website to alert U.S. financial institutions of the increasing risk  that proceeds of political corruption from Nicaragua might enter the  U.S. financial system. It also posted an advisory on the Iranian  regime\u2019s illicit activities and attempts to exploit the financial system.  These advisories included specific instructions on how to file SARs  related to this type of suspicious activity. Some of the industry  associations with which we spoke had positive feedback on FinCEN  advisories and said they would like to see more red flags and specific  guidance to help improve their BSA monitoring programs.", "BSAAG. Among its functions, the advisory group serves as a forum  for industry, supervisory agencies, and law enforcement to  communicate about how law enforcement uses SARs and other BSA  data. For example, sometimes law enforcement agencies present  specific cases using BSA data or information on money laundering  and terrorist financing threats. Many of the industry associations and  supervisory agencies with which we spoke cited BSAAG as a useful  feedback mechanism. As discussed previously, the advisory group is  only open to those invited and not a public forum, so not all financial  institutions receive or can provide feedback at these meetings.", "Law enforcement awards. FinCEN officials said that annual law  enforcement awards ceremonies are one of the mechanisms they use  to provide financial institutions with feedback on the usefulness or  effectiveness of BSA/AML information. The award ceremonies  highlight successful cases utilizing BSA data. FinCEN officials told us  that FinCEN also sends thank you letters to the selected financial  institutions that provided the underlying financial data used in the  awarded cases, publishes overviews of the cases for which law  enforcement agencies received awards, and documents nominated  cases. FinCEN issues press releases about the winning cases as  another way to share information with financial institutions.", "Outreach events. FinCEN representatives regularly have participated  in outreach events about BSA/AML issues, such as by sharing  information at BSA/AML conferences. According to FinCEN officials,  the conferences allow FinCEN representatives to both formally  (speeches, presentations) and informally (personal interactions) solicit  and offer feedback on how financial institutions can improve BSA  reporting. Additionally, Treasury reported that its Office of Terrorism  and Financial Intelligence regularly engages public and private-sector  practitioners and leaders, both domestic and international, on money  laundering and terrorist financing issues. For example, the office  convenes multilateral and bilateral public-private sector dialogues with  key jurisdictions and regions to discuss mutual anti-money laundering  and counter-terrorist financing issues of concern.", "Representatives from nearly all of the federal law enforcement agencies  we interviewed said that they conducted outreach events and developed  relationships with financial institutions to solicit and provide feedback on  their BSA reports including providing feedback on ways to improve BSA  reporting and to enhance BSA compliance by financial institutions.", "Conferences. Law enforcement agencies have presented at  conferences on BSA/AML topics and host conferences for financial  institutions. For example, for more than a decade ICE-HSI, FBI,  Secret Service, IRS-CI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration  jointly have hosted an annual conference that includes speakers from  law enforcement, supervisory agencies, FinCEN, and financial  institutions. According to an ICE-HSI official, the intent of the  conference is to educate the private financial sector. FBI officials also  said they conduct outreach, such as hosting and participating in  conferences, and said that this type of outreach reached more than  6,000 people in the last year (as of August 2018).", "Briefings and financial institution-specific training. Some law  enforcement agencies have their own outreach programs on BSA  topics for financial institutions. For example, ICE-HSI has the  Cornerstone Outreach Program that began to work with the private  sector in 2003 to identify money laundering vulnerabilities in the  financial system. The program is to encourage partnerships with the  private sector by sharing distinguishing traits or forms of criminal  behavior (either crime-centered or person-centered) and methods,  and providing training to financial institutions. ICE-HSI officials said  they conducted about 300 Cornerstone Outreach presentations in  fiscal year 2018. FBI officials also told us they host a couple of  meetings annually for financial institutions and sometimes conduct  institution-specific training upon request, such as on SAR usefulness.  FBI officials told us that for the institution-specific SAR trainings, they  change the information on the SARs for training purposes and  highlight how institutions can improve SAR filings. They also provide  some summary-level statistics and work with the financial institution\u2019s  SAR teams to train them on trends. They estimated they conduct from  about eight to 10 such sessions annually (as of April 2019).", "Informal relationships with financial institutions.

However, CFTC staff noted  that their BSA review team communicates the general usefulness of  SARs filed by their institutions at conferences and through telephone  contacts with the filer after the relevant case is filed. SEC staff told us  they do not reach out directly to provide financial institutions specific  feedback on the usefulness of SARs, but provide training on what makes  a good or bad SAR through routine interaction with the primary securities  industry association and presentations at BSAAG. As discussed earlier,  some supervisory agencies regard FinCEN and law enforcement as the  primary end users of BSA reports, and thus, in a better position to provide  feedback to financial institutions on BSA reporting. Additionally, many  supervisory agencies told us that it would be helpful if FinCEN and law  enforcement could provide more frequent or systematic feedback on  financial institutions\u2019 SAR reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Feedback Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Some supervisory agencies, industry associations, and law enforcement  agencies with which we spoke identified limitations with some of  FinCEN\u2019s feedback mechanisms, including FinCEN Exchange and law  enforcement awards. Representatives from all the industry associations  we spoke with indicated that financial institutions would like to see more  institution-specific feedback on their SARs to improve their monitoring  systems and reporting.", "FinCEN Exchange. Some industry associations appreciated FinCEN\u2019s  outreach, but noted that the new FinCEN Exchange program was on a  small-scale and industry associations had not been invited to participate  or provide feedback. An official from one industry association said that the  association could help identify banks, such as community banks, that  could be a good fit for the program. Supervisory agencies also generally  said they were not involved in the FinCEN Exchange program. Officials  from OCC said that they would like to be involved because they are the  primary regulator for many of the financial institutions in the program and  thought their participation would add value. Some law enforcement  agencies had some concerns about the FinCEN Exchange program, such  as private-sector representatives not being properly vetted or the risk of  talking about ongoing investigations. For example, officials from ICE-HSI  and FBI told us their institution-specific training included only vetted or  trusted financial institutions.", "FinCEN officials said that they collaborated with regulators on the FinCEN  Exchange and solicited feedback on the program from certain industry  associations. In addition, FinCEN posts frequently asked questions about  the FinCEN Exchange program on its website and encourages feedback  from financial institutions on how they can support FinCEN priorities such  as information sharing. FinCEN officials said that the FinCEN Exchange  is an invitation-based program and that FinCEN vets information received  from financial institutions and consults with law enforcement, as  appropriate, to convene a briefing. Furthermore, FinCEN\u2019s frequently  asked questions about the program note that financial institutions that  voluntarily participate in a FinCEN Exchange briefing must adhere to the  terms noted in FinCEN\u2019s invitation, including any requirement of  confidentiality given the sensitivity of information provided.", "Awards. Representatives from CFTC, FBI, and three industry  associations with whom we spoke made suggestions for expanding  FinCEN\u2019s law enforcement awards and related thank you letter initiatives.  For example, CFTC suggested that FinCEN expand the awards program  to include civil cases as well as criminal cases. FinCEN officials also told  us in April 2019 that they were considering awards for civil cases.  Industry associations generally said their member financial institutions  appreciated receiving thank you letters, but some noted that there were  limitations with these letters. For example, a representative from one  industry association said that only a small percentage of financial  institutions receive the awards, and representatives from another industry  association said that the letters should provide more specific feedback.  Two other industry associations said that the confidential nature of SARs  makes it difficult to share the success of the financial institution that  submitted the reporting. Many law enforcement agencies with which we  spoke said that the law enforcement awards were a good idea, and FBI  officials recommended creating awards for the financial institutions as  well. FinCEN officials stated that due to SAR confidentiality rules, it  cannot publicize awards to financial institutions.", "Institution-specific feedback. Representatives from all the industry  associations with whom we spoke told us, or have publically stated that  financial institutions would like to see more institution-specific feedback  on their SARs to improve their monitoring systems and reporting. SAR  reporting is labor-intensive for financial institutions because it requires  researching and drafting narratives for a SAR filing and justifying cases  where a SAR is not filed, according to many industry association  representatives. However, many representatives said that financial  institutions get little institution-specific feedback on their SAR reporting.  We found that while law enforcement conducts some small group  briefings that industry associations said were useful, these briefings cover  a small number of financial institutions in relation to the size of the U.S.  financial industry. ICE-HSI stated that it conducted 302 institution-specific  trainings and briefings in fiscal year 2018, and FBI, as discussed  previously, estimated it has conducted from about eight to 10 institution- specific SAR reporting trainings annually in relation to the more than  10,000 depository institutions, more than 26,000 money services  businesses registered with FinCEN, and almost 4,000 active broker- dealers registered (as of January 2019). The American Bankers  Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and The  Clearing House all have issued papers\u2014recommending more institution- specific feedback on financial institution SAR reporting.", "Some industry associations and other stakeholders pointed to  international efforts that provided feedback through public-private  partnerships. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s Joint Money Laundering  Intelligence Taskforce (joint task force), formally established in May 2016,  includes regulators, law enforcement, and more than 40 major United  Kingdom and international banks conducting a large proportion of  financial activity in the United Kingdom (89 percent of the volume of  personal accounts in the United Kingdom). The joint task force has a  system in place to routinely convene these partners, included vetted  banking representatives, to set AML priorities and share intelligence.  According to the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force\u2019s (FATF)  mutual evaluation report of the United Kingdom, financial institutions  involved in the joint task force are required to file SARs for suspicious  activity identified through the program, and these SARs are considered to  be of high value. FATF\u2019s report also noted that the joint task force is  considered to be best practice in public-private information sharing.  According to Treasury\u2019s 2018 national strategy, FinCEN collaborated with  the United Kingdom\u2019s joint task force in implementing the FinCEN  Exchange program.", "In prior work, we reported that FinCEN recognized that financial  institutions do not generally see the beneficial impacts of their BSA/AML  efforts. FinCEN, law enforcement, and some industry associations with  which we spoke identified challenges in providing institution-specific  feedback to financial institutions on the usefulness of their BSA reporting.  In addition to the large number of financial institutions in the United  States, officials from FinCEN and law enforcement agencies told us that  law enforcement cases may be sensitive and time-consuming, and the  unauthorized disclosure of SARs or sharing of certain information with  financial institutions might compromise ongoing investigations. Two  industry associations also identified the confidential nature of SARs as a  challenge for FinCEN and law enforcement to provide institution-specific  feedback to financial institutions. As we have discussed, FinCEN has  been undertaking a study to better understand the value and  effectiveness of BSA. In addition, FinCEN and some law enforcement  agencies have made efforts to provide some institution-specific feedback  through various methods on BSA reporting, but the feedback has been  periodic, sometimes only at the request of financial institutions, and  provided on a small scale.", "FATF standards on information sharing state that anti-money laundering  authorities should provide feedback to financial institutions to assist them  in complying with anti-money laundering requirements\u2014these  mechanisms can include feedback loops, whereby more consistent and  more fully explained feedback is provided to the private sector on  suspicious transaction reports. FinCEN\u2019s statutory duties also include  information sharing with financial institutions in the interest of detection,  prevention, and prosecution of terrorism, organized crime, money  laundering, and other financial crimes. As discussed, other countries  have put in place mechanisms (such as the United Kingdom\u2019s joint task  force) to provide regular feedback on AML reporting (including SAR-like  instruments) to financial institutions representing a large portion of the  country\u2019s financial activity. Additional and more regular institution-specific  feedback, designed to cover different types of financial institutions and  those with significant financial activity, may enhance the U.S. financial  industry\u2019s ability to effectively target its efforts to identify suspicious  activity and provide quality BSA reporting."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN, numerous supervisory agencies (covering various financial  sectors), and law enforcement agencies are responsible for enforcing the  BSA/AML regulatory framework with the end goal of detecting and  preventing money laundering and other financial crimes. While these  agencies have processes and mechanisms in place to collaborate on key  BSA/AML issues, such collaboration and information sharing could be  enhanced by additional and more regular involvement of representatives  of the futures industry\u2014a complex and unique financial markets sector.  Unlike the other key federal supervisory agencies and securities SRO  involved in BSA compliance, the primary futures SRO was not  consistently included in BSAAG. Thus, FinCEN may be missing  opportunities to better understand compliance in the futures industry and  the SRO may not be updated on related BSAAG initiatives. The key  futures industry association also has had less consistent participation in  BSAAG, and although it has been a member of BSAAG in the past, it was  not a member concurrently with the futures SRO\u2014thereby, potentially  missing opportunities to engage FinCEN and other agencies on BSA  issues in futures markets. In addition, by providing NFA with direct access  to BSA data (similar to the access the key securities SRO already has)  FinCEN could facilitate NFA oversight and enable it to scope  examinations proactively to address BSA risks.", "Some federal agencies have taken steps to provide metrics and  institution-specific feedback on the usefulness of BSA reporting to  industry; however, metrics were not provided regularly and feedback  efforts were provided on a small scale. Additionally, challenges to  expanding and enhancing metrics and feedback remain (such as those  related to measuring the usefulness of BSA reporting, providing feedback  to thousands of individual institutions, and the sensitive nature of ongoing  law enforcement investigations). FinCEN has an ongoing effort to identify  additional measures of the value and usefulness of BSA reporting, which  is expected to be completed at the end of 2019. But opportunities exist to  enhance feedback and reporting before that date and in general. For  example, in the interim FinCEN routinely could communicate currently  available metrics on usefulness to help financial institutions more fully  understand the importance and value of their efforts to report BSA-related  information. Furthermore, with today\u2019s rapidly changing financial markets  and potential changes to money laundering risks, it is important that  FinCEN and federal agencies take steps to provide institution-specific  feedback\u2014while keeping in mind any confidentiality concerns\u2014to cover  different types of financial institutions and those with significant financial  activity.

Specifically, FinCEN concurred with the  recommendation that FinCEN more consistently and publicly provide  summary data on the usefulness of BSA reporting (Recommendation 3).  FinCEN disagreed with the draft report\u2019s recommendation that FinCEN,  after consulting with CFTC, should ensure that the primary SRO  conducting BSA examinations in the futures industry is a regular member  of BSAAG and also should consider making the primary futures industry  association a concurrent member (Recommendation 1). FinCEN\u2019s written  response stated that while the primary futures SRO presently is a BSAAG  member, only federal agencies are considered permanent members, and  FinCEN will not make future membership commitments to any specific  SRO or any other nonfederal organization. As such, we modified the  recommendation to give FinCEN more flexibility to address the issues  that prompted our recommendation. We continue to believe that  prioritizing futures representation in BSAAG to be consistent with  securities industry representation would help FinCEN better understand  BSA compliance in the futures industry and keep the futures industry  updated on related BSAAG initiatives.  As noted in the report, the primary  securities SRO has been a member of BSAAG since 2008 and a key  securities industry association has been a concurrent member.", "FinCEN disagreed with the recommendation that FinCEN, after consulting  with CFTC, explore providing direct BSA data access to NFA  (Recommendation 2) because FinCEN said it has not received a request  from CFTC or NFA to engage on this matter. FinCEN also said it would  review any future request for direct access in accordance with established  procedures, stating it must ensure that proper controls are in place and  that direct access to the BSA database is limited to those who truly need  it. As discussed in our report, CFTC stated that NFA\u2019s direct access to  BSA data would enhance NFA\u2019s ability to scope and perform BSA/AML  examinations, and to use BSA data more extensively and more frequently  to perform its functions, including conducting the majority of BSA  examinations for the futures industry. NFA representatives also told us  they welcomed a discussion with CFTC and FinCEN on the benefits and  drawbacks of having direct access to BSA data. We continue to believe  the recommendation is valid as it provides FinCEN flexibility to explore  providing NFA data access and would not preclude FinCEN from  ensuring that NFA had proper controls in place.", "In its written responses, FinCEN neither agreed nor disagreed with the  recommendation that FinCEN review options for establishing a  mechanism through which law enforcement agencies may provide regular  and institution-specific feedback on BSA reporting (Recommendation 4).  FinCEN said it agreed with the spirit of this recommendation\u2014that law  enforcement feedback on the value and usefulness of BSA information is  important\u2014and stated that FinCEN regularly takes necessary steps to  review options for establishing additional mechanisms through which law  enforcement agencies can provide regular feedback. FinCEN also stated  that it provides a consolidated view of law enforcement feedback as well  as feedback on the value and usefulness of institution-specific BSA  information. However, as discussed in the report, we found that the  current institution-specific feedback mechanisms were not occurring on a  regular basis or were on a relatively small scale. In its response, FinCEN  also noted that unless mandated by Congress, law enforcement feedback  will be voluntary and that FinCEN cannot compel law enforcement  compliance with feedback initiatives.

To better  understand how supervisory agencies conduct their examinations, we  reviewed the following BSA/AML examination manuals: the 2014  BSA/AML Examination Manual, developed by the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC); the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti- Money Laundering Examination Manual for Money Services Business  (developed by FinCEN and IRS); and SEC\u2019s nonpublic manual and  futures SROs nonpublic examination procedures. We reviewed and  analyzed data from FinCEN summary reports on the examination and  enforcement activities of supervisory agencies for fiscal years 2015  through 2018 (second quarter), which were the most recent data available  at the time of our analysis.", "We also reviewed FinCEN\u2019s enforcement actions for this time period as  provided on its website, to identify the number and types of financial  institutions, and the number of concurrent actions FinCEN brought jointly  with a regulator. We also reviewed and analyzed FinCEN referral data  from January 1, 2015, to September 25, 2018. Referrals are potential  BSA violations or deficiencies referred by supervisory agencies, the  Department of Justice, or state regulators. We assessed the reliability of  the FinCEN summary report data and referral data by reviewing  documentation related to these datasets, interviewing knowledgeable  officials, and conducting manual data testing for missing data, outliers,  and obvious errors. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for  reporting on supervisory agency, SRO, and FinCEN BSA/AML  compliance and enforcement activities. For this and our other objectives,  we interviewed officials at Treasury\u2019s Office of Terrorism and Financial  Intelligence and FinCEN, the other supervisory agencies, and two  SROs\u2014FINRA and NFA.", "To address the second objective, we judgmentally selected six law  enforcement agencies based on their (1) focus on financial crimes, (2)  role in investigating or prosecuting recent large criminal cases we  selected involving financial institutions with BSA violations, (3)  participation in FinCEN\u2019s liaison program, and (4) identification by  FinCEN as a key user of BSA data. We selected the following law  enforcement agencies: the Criminal Division (Money Laundering and  Asset Recovery Section), the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices (through the  Executive Office for United States Attorneys), and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation in the Department of Justice; IRS Criminal Investigation in  the Department of Treasury; and U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Secret  Service in the Department of Homeland Security. The views of selected  law enforcement agencies are not generalizable.", "To identify key collaborative mechanisms used to implement BSA/AML  responsibilities, we reviewed agency documentation (such as strategic  plans, national strategies, and risk assessments) and prior GAO reports  that contained discussions of collaborative mechanisms, and we  interviewed agency officials from FinCEN, supervisory agencies, SROs,  and selected law enforcement agencies. We obtained agency  documentation and data related to the identified collaboration  mechanisms and interviewed officials from FinCEN, supervisory  agencies, and selected law enforcement agencies for their perspectives  on these efforts. We compared agencies\u2019 collaboration efforts to criteria in  federal internal control standards on management communication.", "To gain further insight into the collaboration process, we also reviewed  documentation on three criminal cases involving BSA/AML violations by  financial institutions to illustrate how law enforcement investigates and  prosecutes BSA violations and coordinates with FinCEN and other  supervisory agencies. We selected the cases on the basis of recent  occurrence (calendar year 2017 or 2018) and on their having involved  criminal violations of BSA by financial institutions, required coordination  on penalties among multiple supervisory agencies and law enforcement,  and resulted in a large monetary penalty. While not generalizable, the  cases helped provide additional context for our review. To obtain  additional perspectives on the effectiveness of BSA/AML collaboration  processes, we interviewed representatives of seven selected industry  associations based on their published work and relevant experience and  for coverage of key financial industries (banking, securities, futures, and  the money services business). While not generalizable, these interviews  helped provide context for how industry views the effectiveness of  BSA/AML collaboration efforts.", "For the third objective, we reviewed agency documentation and data on  metrics related to BSA reporting and feedback mechanisms that FinCEN,  the supervisory agencies, or the six selected law enforcement agencies  had established. Key documents we reviewed included Treasury\u2019s most  recent strategic plan, national strategy for combating illicit financing, and  related risk assessments. For all agencies we interviewed, we requested  any available metrics. We reviewed agency websites, annual reports, and  recently published speeches and testimonies on BSA/AML-related topics  to identify any metrics. We also requested and reviewed contract  documentation from FinCEN, such as the performance work statement for  a study that FinCEN commissioned on how to establish metrics for and  identify the value of BSA data. We compared metrics on the usefulness  of BSA and how they were communicated against key criteria for  enhancing or facilitating the use of performance metrics that GAO  previously identified and federal internal control standards on  management communication.", "For feedback mechanisms, we obtained documentation on any steps  FinCEN, supervisory agencies, or the selected law enforcement agencies  took to provide feedback on BSA reporting to financial institutions and we  interviewed agency representatives on these efforts. The documents we  reviewed included those identified above related to metrics, as well as  agency advisories, guidance, and rulemaking. We compared the  feedback efforts against Treasury\u2019s information-sharing statutory duties  and strategic plan, and international anti-money laundering standards and  guidance. To gain industry perspectives on the usefulness of BSA  reporting and on feedback received from FinCEN, supervisory agencies,  and law enforcement, we conducted seven interviews with the selected  industry associations. While not generalizable, the interviews helped  provide context for financial industry perspectives on BSA/AML reporting  and feedback.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to August 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
