In addition, Executive Order 13548 entitled,  \u201cIncreasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities,\u201d issued in  July 2010 emphasized that as the nation\u2019s largest employer, the federal  government must become a model for the employment of individuals with  disabilities. The Executive Order called for an additional 100,000  individuals with disabilities to be employed in the federal government by  2015.", "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (EEOC) 2017  regulations also require agencies to take specific steps to increase the  employment of individuals with disabilities. For example, agencies are expected to commit to the goal of having no less than 12 percent of their  workforce comprised of employees with disabilities. This is also to include  at least 2 percent of an agency\u2019s workforce to be comprised of employees  with targeted disabilities, which include traumatic brain injuries, deafness,  blindness, and partial or complete paralysis, among others.

Our objectives were to (1) examine the extent to which  agencies met the goal outlined in Executive Order 13548 directing the  federal government to hire an additional 100,000 individuals with  disabilities by 2015, and examine retention rates for employees with  disabilities between 2011 and 2017; (2) examine practices selected  agencies have adopted to increase hiring and retention of individuals with  disabilities, including reasonable accommodation provisions; and (3)  describe the efforts the key leadership agencies took to provide guidance  and assistance to agencies to increase the hiring and retention of  individuals with disabilities.", "To address the first objective, we analyzed personnel data captured in the  Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Enterprise Human Resources  Integration (EHRI) database. We assessed the reliability of EHRI data  through electronic testing to identify missing data, out of range values,  and logical inconsistencies. We also reviewed our prior work assessing  the reliability of these data. We interviewed OPM officials to understand  how they collect, maintain, track, and use data on individuals with  disabilities. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We analyzed data across the 24 agencies cited under the Chief Financial  Officers (CFO) Act to determine (1) the number of individuals with  disabilities and targeted disabilities hired each year during 2011 through  2017, the last year for which data were available, (2) which agencies  hired these individuals, (3) the types of hiring authorities used, and (4)  General Schedule (GS) levels in which individuals with disabilities were  placed and their position classifications. There are slight discrepancies in  the data used to examine retention rates, which were due to  inconsistencies we found with hiring and/or separation dates recorded in  OPM\u2019s EHRI data. We determined these discrepancies did not affect the  reliability of the data for our purposes.", "These data also allowed us to identify any patterns or changes in the  hiring, placement, and retention of individuals with disabilities across  years. Using the government-wide data, we identified whether people  were hired as full-time permanent employees versus part-time or  temporary employees. Of the individuals hired during 2011 through 2017,  we identified the number of employees who left the federal government  during that same time period.", "To address the second objective, we selected three agencies as case  illustrations: the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Small Business  Administration (SBA), and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Our  selection was based on analysis of disability employment data for fiscal  years 2011 through 2017 across the 24 CFO Act agencies. We sorted the  agencies by their average percentage of total employees with reported  disabilities and targeted disabilities from highest to lowest. We narrowed  the scope to eight agencies that were categorized as having either the  highest or lowest average percentages for the time period. Within that  scope, we selected three agencies\u2014one small, one medium, and one  large\u2014in terms of their total full-time employees to provide a range of  agency experiences.

The additional actions stated in Executive Order 13548  specified that federal agencies were to implement strategies for retaining  federal workers with disabilities in federal employment, to make increased  use of Schedule A excepted hiring authority for persons with disabilities,  and to designate a senior-level official to be accountable for meeting the  goals of the order and developing and implementing the agency\u2019s plan.", "In January 2017, EEOC issued a final rule amending the regulations  requiring federal agencies to engage in affirmative action for individuals  with disabilities. The rule codified many of the requirements placed on  agencies by management directives and past executive orders, among  other things. Agencies were to begin following the rule in January 2018.  The revised regulation requires that agencies take specific steps until  they meet specific employment goals set by EEOC for individuals with  disabilities and targeted disabilities, provide personal assistance services  to certain employees who need them because of a targeted disability, and  meet a number of other requirements designed to improve employment  opportunities for individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce.", "OPM, EEOC, and Labor each have roles in advancing the hiring and  retention of persons with disabilities in the federal government.", "OPM is responsible for executing, administering, and enforcing the civil  service laws, rules, and regulations.

EEOC is responsible for the annual review and approval of  agencies\u2019 affirmative action program plans for the hiring, placement, and  advancement of individuals with disabilities. It is also responsible for  establishing procedures for handling federal employees\u2019 allegations of  discrimination and for providing for the adjudication of complaints and  hearing of appeals.", "Labor\u2019s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) is to provide  national leadership in developing policy to eliminate barriers to the  employment of individuals with disabilities in the public and private  sectors. ODEP works in collaboration with federal, state, and local  agencies, private sector employers, and employer associations to  develop and disseminate evidence-based policy strategies and effective  practices. The office also assists agencies and employers with adopting  such policies and practices. Additionally, Labor administers the Federal  Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, which provides workers\u2019 compensation  coverage to federal employees for employment-related injuries and  occupational diseases.", "Under Executive Order 13548, each of these agencies were assigned  roles and responsibilities often in consultation with each other. For  example, OPM, in consultation with Labor and EEOC, was tasked to  identify and assist agencies in implementing strategies for retaining  federal employees with disabilities. Additionally, OPM was also to consult  with Labor, EEOC, and OMB in designing model recruitment and hiring  strategies for agencies and developing mandatory training on  employment of the disabled. Labor was to consult with OPM in pursuing  innovative re-employment strategies and develop policies that foster  improved return-to-work of employees who were injured on the job.", "OMB\u2019s initial role was to convene federal agencies and assist their start- up efforts to implement the Executive Order, according to staff in OMB\u2019s  Office of Performance and Personnel Management. OMB staff told us the  agency helped to establish a framework for coordination and collaboration  among the key leadership agencies focused on making the federal  government a model employer for persons with disabilities and to provide  support for regulatory and policy initiatives related to disability  employment. In 2015, in furtherance of an executive order focused on  improving diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce, OMB joined  OPM and EEOC and issued a memorandum to all heads of executive  departments and agencies announcing the establishment of the Diversity  and Inclusion in Government Council. The council initially operated  under the direction of OPM, OMB, and EEOC and was formed to provide  a forum for improving senior leadership engagement and collaboration on  strategic and operational diversity and inclusion priorities. OMB\u2019s role has  since diminished as it delegated much of the leadership responsibilities to  the other key leadership agencies.", "For reporting purposes, the federal government distinguishes between  two major categories of disabilities: targeted and other disabilities.  Targeted disabilities, generally considered to be more severe, include  traumatic brain injuries, deafness, blindness, partial or complete  paralysis, significant mobility impairments, and psychiatric disabilities,  among others. Other disabilities include such conditions as  gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular or heart disease, autoimmune  disorders, pulmonary or respiratory conditions, and learning disabilities.", "Federal statutes and regulations provide special hiring authorities for  people with disabilities. These include Schedule A excepted service hiring  authority\u2014which permits the noncompetitive appointment of qualified  individuals with intellectual, severe physical, or psychiatric disabilities  and appointments and noncompetitive conversion for veterans who are  30 percent or more disabled. To qualify for a Schedule A appointment,  an applicant must generally provide proof of disability.

Federal employees voluntarily  complete this form to disclose their disability status, as defined by the  Rehabilitation Act. Our past work highlighted concerns about the  accuracy of data captured in the SF-256. For example, we reported that  agency officials and advocates for people with disabilities believe there is  an undercount of employees with disabilities because some individuals  may not disclose their disability status out of concern they will be  discriminated against or precluded from advancement. In addition,  employees may develop a disability during federal employment and may  not know how to or why they should update their status. Disability status  information is confidential and cannot be used to affect an employee in  any way.", "Given our previously reported concerns, we recommended that OPM  assess the extent to which the SF-256 accurately measures progress  toward the goal of Executive Order 13548 and to explore options for  improving the accuracy of SF-256 reporting. To address our  recommendation, OPM updated its 2012 Employee Feedback Survey to  allow federal employees to confidentially self-disclose a disability and  serve as a source of comparison through which OPM could assess the  accuracy of the SF-256."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Exceeded the Hiring Goal Set Forth in the Executive Order, but OPM Does Not Track or Report Retention Data", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "An Additional 143,000 Persons with Disabilities Were Hired Government- wide between 2011 and 2015", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies exceeded the government-wide goal to hire an  additional 100,000 persons with disabilities in the federal government by  2015, according to our analysis of OPM\u2019s EHRI data across the 24 CFO  Act agencies.

We found the trends to be generally  consistent between the employee groups during this time period, with the  largest percentage of hires staying less than 1 year. These departures  may be explained, in part, by the proportion of employees hired into  temporary positions who therefore were not necessarily expected to stay  on the job for a longer duration, or by employees who did not meet  performance standards.", "To pinpoint the root causes behind these departure rates and to  determine where appropriate improvements and potential solutions may  be warranted, targeted data collection, tracking, and analysis is needed.  Moreover, the loss of such a substantial percentage of new hires within  their first 2 years of employment provides an opportunity for the federal  government to examine why this occurs, identify any lessons learned, and  better target its retention efforts as appropriate to potentially reduce such  early departures. Further, these retention trends have implications related  to agencies\u2019 ability to meet and sustain progress toward the federal goals  of ensuring that at least 12 percent of their workforce is comprised of  employees with disabilities including 2 percent comprised of employees  with targeted disabilities.", "In addition, we analyzed the number of persons with disabilities hired into  each occupational category as identified in OPM\u2019s EHRI database for  fiscal years 2011 through 2015.

Tracking performance over a 3-year period is critical to an agency\u2019s ability  to assess whether it has adequately processed and provided reasonable  accommodations, according to EEOC guidance. Agencies are  encouraged to use this tracking information to evaluate whether and  where they need to improve their handling of reasonable accommodation  requests. In addition, this type of monitoring is consistent with federal  internal control standards. Specifically, the standard calls for ongoing  monitoring to be built into the entity\u2019s operations, performed continually,  and responsive to change.", "Without periodically soliciting, obtaining, and documenting employee  feedback on agencies\u2019 reasonable accommodations efforts, management  is missing opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs,  identify potential risks, and identify any improvements that may be  warranted. For example, such information could provide valuable insights  about the timeliness of processing and fulfilling employees\u2019 requests and  the ongoing effectiveness of an accommodation. In some cases, an  accommodation may no longer be effective for an employee for various  reasons such as if the employee\u2019s limitations change, workplace  equipment changes, job responsibilities change, or the accommodation  involves equipment or software that requires maintenance or updates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EEOC, OPM, and Labor Have Coordinated Roles to Assist Agencies", "paragraphs": ["EEOC, OPM, and Labor took various actions during the course of the 5- year period specified under the executive order for meeting the  government-wide hiring goal and have continued their efforts.
