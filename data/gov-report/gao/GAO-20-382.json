Among the 10 programs were the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Head Start; the Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; and three Department of Labor Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act core programs. Some of these entities also reported using state, local, and/or philanthropic resources to enhance their flexibility to provide services.", "State and local officials told GAO that difficulties with data sharing and limited information on successful two-generation approaches made it challenging to implement them, and some federal agencies have taken steps to address these challenges. State and local officials said that data sharing is difficult due to various concerns, including protecting participant privacy. Multiple federal agencies have resources on data sharing that may be useful to entities implementing two-generation approaches. State and local officials also said they wanted more examples of successful two-generation approaches and information on federal funding to implement them. To help address this challenge, various federal offices provided information and technical assistance, but the information is distributed via separate email lists and websites, thereby limiting cross-programmatic access and availability. HHS officials said the interagency Council on Economic Mobility\u2014led by HHS\u2014may help address information sharing. Given its recent establishment, related efforts are yet to be seen. Without readily available information, state and local entities may lack useful resources when designing programs to serve families."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS, in consultation with the Council on Economic Mobility, make information on two-generation approaches readily available.

Research has shown that poverty is  associated with negative outcomes for the entire family. For example,  low-income parents often have minimal access to education and job  training opportunities, reliable housing, transportation, and quality child  care, which limits their ability to achieve economic security. While many  parents provide nurturing environments for their children amidst these  challenges, these stressors can compromise family well-being. For  example, the stress of living in poverty can lessen parental emotional  support for children. When child development is not fully supported by  parents, children may be less prepared for school, more likely to drop out,  and more likely to remain in poverty as adults.", "Two-generation poverty reduction approaches\u2014also referred to as whole  family approaches\u2014are used by federal, state, and local government  agencies, and non-governmental organizations, to reduce poverty and  move low-income families towards economic self-sufficiency. Two- generation approaches combine multiple programs and/or services to  holistically address the needs of low-income families. By combining  services, these approaches address intergenerational poverty in a way  that is beyond what any single federal program was designed to  accomplish, according to the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS). Specifically, two-generation approaches bring together child- serving programs, such as early childhood and K-12 education, and adult- serving programs, such as workforce development and post-secondary  education. Despite the potential benefits of two-generation approaches,  states may face challenges in implementing them, including managing  inconsistent or competing requirements across programs serving low- income families, according to HHS.", "Senate Appropriations Committee Report 115-150 included a provision  for GAO to identify federal programs that could be used in two-generation  poverty reduction approaches and any challenges faced by organizations  that are implementing these approaches. This report examines (1) the  primary federal programs that support selected two-generation  approaches and how these programs were leveraged by selected state  and local entities, and (2) the challenges selected state and local entities  faced implementing two-generation approaches and steps federal  agencies have taken to address those challenges.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed representatives of 23 state  and local entities from five states: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia,  Maryland, and Minnesota. To select these states, we compiled a list of  state and local two-generation approaches based on interviews with  federal agency officials, representatives of stakeholder groups active in  supporting two-generation approaches, and reviews of publications on  two-generation approaches. For those states with two-generation  approaches, we also collected information from the U.S. Census Bureau  website, such as their population size and percentage of families with  children in poverty. We selected these five states to achieve variation in  two-generation approaches, population size, percentage of families with  children in poverty, and geographic region, among other factors. In each  state, we interviewed officials in state and/or local government and non- governmental organizations. We selected interviewees in each state  based on recommendations made by the state\u2019s Two-Generation  Program Manager or other state agency officials, recommendations made  by stakeholder groups, and/or information we compiled on organizations  implementing two-generation approaches. These interviews are not  generalizable to two-generation approaches nationwide.", "In addition, we interviewed officials from five federal agencies:  Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Education (Education), HHS,  Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Labor (DOL). We selected  these agencies because they all administer programs that serve low- income individuals and families. We also interviewed representatives of  six stakeholder groups\u2014including the National Governors Association  and Ascend at the Aspen Institute\u2014that supported or promoted two- generation poverty reduction approaches and/or were recommended by  federal agency officials. In addition, we reviewed relevant documentation,  such as federal, state, and local agency documentation on two-generation  approaches and prior GAO reports on low-income programs. services through a comprehensive, holistic approach with state level leadership support.

We  also found that many of these programs provide assistance such as cash  aid, food, shelter, and health care for those who have limited means or  are disadvantaged in other ways, while other programs are designed to  help low-income people move toward self-sufficiency through education,  training, and employment services.", "In their current strategic plans, some agencies include goals related to  supporting individuals or families to help them move towards self- sufficiency. For example, HHS has a strategic objective to \u201cencourage  self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, and eliminate barriers to  economic opportunity.\u201d Officials from HHS\u2019s Administration for Children  and Families (ACF) said they are currently updating ACF\u2019s strategic plan  and it will likely include a vision of ending multigenerational poverty  through primary prevention by using a whole family\u2014or two-generation\u2014 approach that proactively connects families to services before they are in  crisis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two-Generation Approaches to Poverty Reduction", "paragraphs": ["Two-generation approaches are different from individual low-income  programs because these approaches simultaneously address multiple  areas, such as child and family economic supports, education,  employment, health, well-being, and social capital, according to HHS.  These approaches are based on findings that connect the well-being of  parents to their children\u2019s social, emotional, physical, and economic well- being. For example, research indicates that parents\u2019 improved economic  security is linked to improvements in children\u2019s home environment,  greater parental engagement in their children\u2019s schooling, and stronger  parenting skills, which may lead to improved child outcomes. Similarly,  children\u2019s well-being directly affects their parents\u2019 ability to succeed in  both school and the workplace. For example, if parents participate in a  workforce training program, but cannot access safe and affordable child  care, they may not be able to accept or keep the job for which they  trained. Research developed by an ACF-sponsored project states that  two-generation approaches are hypothesized to result in parents  experiencing stronger labor force attachment or increased earnings,  children improving their school readiness and academic achievement,  and families increasing family functioning, community connectedness,  goal-directed behavior, and executive functioning, among other potential  outcomes.", "This approach is not a new idea. For example, Head Start programs,  which started in 1965, provide early education services to low-income  children while offering support to families, such as services that promote  housing stability, continued education, and financial security. In addition,  federal programs have supported past efforts to improve service  coordination for low-income families, such as the use of one-stop centers  that deliver workforce, education, and other support services at a single  location. These previous efforts, however, often prioritized one generation  over the other, according to researchers. Researchers also found that  these previous efforts tended to not provide the intensity or duration of  services needed to create change for low-income families.", "More recent two-generation approaches are intentionally meant to  provide services for parents, children, and families in innovative ways by  equally addressing the needs of children and parents using quality  programs and interventions. For example, ACF is using a human- centered design approach to work across its programs to help families  achieve economic independence. Human-centered design aims to create  solutions from the point-of-view of families that are in need and the states  that serve them and to design systems and service delivery to fit families  instead of the other way around, according to ACF. These newer two- generation approaches, which aim to be higher quality and more intensive  than previous efforts, are still being tested. ACF and others are currently  evaluating the effectiveness of these two-generation approaches."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected State and Local Entities Most Commonly Reported Using 10 Federal Programs to Meet the Unique Needs of Local Communities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The 10 Most Cited Federal Programs Have Characteristics That Allow State and Local Entities to Address Multiple Aspects of Child and Parent Well- Being", "paragraphs": ["Ten federal programs were most commonly cited by selected state and  local entities as being used to serve whole families and reduce poverty  (see table 1).

(See appendix I for the target population,  purpose, and services provided by the 10 federal programs.) Specifically:", "Target Populations. Consistent with two-generation approaches,  many of the federal programs target low-income, needy, or at-risk  families. However, we previously reported that eligibility requirements  for some low-income programs vary significantly with regard to who  may obtain benefits and services, how income is counted, and the  maximum income applicants may have. As a result, state and local  officials told us that some families who they would like to engage in  two-generation approaches are not eligible for some of the federally- funded programs they use for these approaches.", "Purpose. The purposes of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  (TANF) and the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) are broad  and can be used to support families in multiple ways. For example,  CSBG\u2019s purposes are, among other things, to reduce poverty,  revitalize low-income communities, and empower low-income  individuals and families to become fully self-sufficient. In addition,  according to HHS, these two broad programs allow state and local  agencies to cover costs that other programs do not allow, such as  salaries for staff to design the two-generation approach. Among the  23 state and local entities, officials from the three entities that reported  using CSBG and seven of the 11 that reported using TANF said that  they used the programs in combination with other federal programs  that have more limited purposes. The other programs can be used to  provide more specific supports, such as developing child care  programs, increasing employment and earnings, alleviating hunger, or  improving maternal and child health.", "Benefits or Services Provided. A range of benefits and services for  both children and parents are available across the 10 federal  programs, such as child care, food assistance, and job skills training.  To create their two-generation approach, state and local entities can,  to the extent permitted by law, combine services from multiple  programs to provide a coordinated approach to addressing the needs  of the entire family. In fact, according to HHS, combining services  from multiple programs is common in two-generation approaches  because single programs tend to cover only one type of service or  may be for parents or children instead of both.", "In addition to the 10 most commonly cited federal programs, state and  local entities reported using over 40 other federal programs to support  their two-generation approaches (see appendix II). For example, one  entity has a housing complex for single parents and their children. The  families receive HUD Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, and the entity also provides support services such as child care, parenting  classes, and financial counseling. Two entities reported using Medicaid\u2014 one of the nation\u2019s largest sources of funding for medical and other  health-related services for low-income individuals.", "There may be additional federal programs beyond those cited that could  be used for two-generation approaches that selected state and local  entities did not report using. For example, HHS officials told us that the  Social Services Block Grant could be used for two-generation approaches  because it is one of the most flexible sources of social services funding.  HUD officials said the Family Self-Sufficiency Program provides case  management services and could be used for two-generation approaches.  However, none of the 23 selected state and local entities reported using  either program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected State and Local Entities Combine Federal Programs with Other Resources in Multiple Ways to Support Their Unique Two-Generation Approaches", "paragraphs": ["We found that selected entities leveraged the 10 most commonly cited  federal programs in different ways to meet the unique needs of their  individual communities. Officials from some entities reported using only  one of the 10 programs, while one entity reported using as many as  seven of the programs. In addition, all of the 23 selected entities reported  using other resources, including state, local, and/or philanthropic funds, to  create their two-generation approaches (see fig. 1). Some state and local  officials said these additional resources were needed to provide flexibility  in meeting the needs of families. For example, officials from one agency  told us they used additional resources to provide services to families with  incomes that exceeded the eligibility limits for federal programs, noting  that some with higher incomes were still in need of assistance.", "To create their unique two-generation poverty reduction approaches and  address the needs of their communities, selected entities reported the  significance of involving leadership, changing policies, expanding  services, modifying service delivery practices, and/or serving specific  populations. Specifically:  Involving Leadership. In some states, the governor or state  legislature encouraged state agencies to adopt two-generation  approaches and/or staff were hired to lead the state\u2019s efforts in  implementing two-generation approaches, according to officials. For  example, officials told us that Maryland\u2019s governor and Connecticut\u2019s  state legislature created commissions with membership from state  agencies, local organizations, and the public. The commissions made  recommendations related to mitigating multigenerational poverty and  developing local programs to pilot two-generation approaches. In  addition, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, and Minnesota officials  reported hiring a two-generation approach program manager within  state government to coordinate the state\u2019s efforts across agencies  and programs to implement such approaches.", "Changing Policies. Officials from some states said they changed  policies to better support families as part of their two-generation  approaches, such as modifying eligibility requirements for certain  services. For example, officials from a Colorado state agency said  they changed policies across a range of programs to be more family  friendly, such as providing transitional food assistance to families no  longer eligible for TANF. Officials from a Georgia state agency said  they made a number of policy changes, such as increasing the  income eligibility threshold for child care subsidies to help families  retain this care as their income increases.", "Expanding Services. Some officials also reported providing  additional services to families that they had not provided in the past.  For example, a Colorado state agency is piloting an expansion of its  maternal and child home visiting program that adds employment,  education, and child care to the supports the program already  provides in order to improve family economic self-sufficiency. A  Colorado local department now provides short-term housing with  support services, in addition to its existing emergency shelters, for  some families experiencing homelessness.", "Modifying Service Delivery Practices. Selected state and local  entities sometimes changed the methods they used to deliver services  to families, according to officials. For example, families served by a  local agency in Maryland complete an intake form and a strengths and  needs assessment. A trained coach then helps the family complete a  pathway plan with family goals and action steps. A Minnesota local  department is implementing new tools to assess the health, nutrition,  education, and employment needs of families and connect them to  supports across the department. A Connecticut state agency is  employing a family centered coaching model in its Jobs First  Employment Services Program. The coaching goes beyond traditional  job search assistance by identifying the needs of children and parents  and providing financial literacy training.", "Serving Specific Populations. Two-generation approaches by  selected non-governmental organizations generally provided services  to more specific populations, such as single parents or the families of  children in certain schools. For example, a non-governmental  organization in Minnesota serves single mothers and their young  children by providing housing, on-site early childhood education, and  weekly life skills training while mothers earn post-secondary  credentials. Another non-governmental organization in Minnesota  serves families of children in Minneapolis schools and assists families  in accessing a variety of services, such as housing stabilization,  health, career, and financial counseling.

For example, officials in one county  said that if more robust data sharing occurred across agencies and  systems, they would have access to information that would help them  make decisions based on the needs of the families they serve.  Additionally, officials from one non-governmental organization said they  wanted to share data with other relevant organizations in order to be able  to measure the impact of their two-generation approach. We previously  found that states and localities used data sharing to improve case  management by helping caseworkers obtain client information more  quickly and make more informed decisions.", "Yet, state and local officials said that data sharing is difficult due to issues  with linking data across low-income programs and concerns about how to  protect participant privacy. Specifically, officials from five state and local  entities reported issues related to linking data, including that a lack of  common data fields across low-income programs made it difficult for the  entities to share data. For example, officials at one state agency said they  wanted to link mental health and substance abuse data systems.  However, the officials have spent 6 years creating matching fields across  these systems to allow the data to be shared, and the process is not yet  complete. In addition, officials from seven entities said concerns about  protecting participant privacy contributed to their data sharing challenges.  For example, an official at a state agency noted it can be difficult to  balance protecting an individual\u2019s privacy while sharing enough data to be  helpful to entities using two-generation approaches.", "Federal agencies have taken steps to assist state and local entities  interested in data sharing by providing related resources and guidance  (see fig. 2).

HHS also has hosted webinars and  communities of learning to assist state and local entities that were  interested in adopting two-generation approaches. For some of these  efforts, HHS partnered with other federal agencies. Specifically, within  HHS/ACF, at least seven offices have developed information related to  two-generation approaches (see fig. 3 for examples). This information  discusses a range of topics, from funding flexibility to options for building  service models, that could assist state and local agencies in creating two- generation approaches.", "According to federal internal control standards, managers should  externally communicate the information needed to achieve their  organizational goals. To help to ensure effective external  communication, managers may want to consider whether the information  is readily available to the intended audience when needed.

HHS officials said that they disseminate guidance and other  resources through existing program or office-specific mechanisms, such  as separate email lists and websites for each office. Other federal  agencies in our review also created information relevant to two- generation approaches that they distributed through existing program  mechanisms. For example, DOL officials said information related to two- generation approaches is woven into technical assistance as relevant to  various grant programs. Similarly, Education officials said they published  guidance on its website and sent it to state educational agencies and  other stakeholders through program specific email lists.", "Given these current approaches to distribution, state and local entities  using two-generation approaches may not have access to or be aware of  all relevant resources if these resources are only available to recipients of  certain federal programs or entities in contact with certain federal offices.
