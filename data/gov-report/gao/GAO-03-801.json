Because airlift alone may not be sufficient, the Army is planning to use a combination of airlift and sealift to deploy the brigades. However, if sealift were used to deploy the Stryker brigades, deployment times to many global regions would be significantly longer than the 4-day goal the Army has set for itself. The Army's plan for supporting and sustaining Stryker brigades in combat operations is still evolving. The Army will not be able to finish its support plan until November 2003, when the results from an operational evaluation of the first Stryker brigade will be issued. Before it can fully implement the support plan, the Army will also need to make funding and other decisions relating to implementing some of the plan's logistical support concepts.

On the other hand, the Army\u2019s  current light infantry forces can be deployed rapidly and are easier to  support once deployed, but they lack the combat power, survivability, and  tactical mobility of the heavy forces. To address this gap in capabilities  between heavy and light forces, the Army is organizing and equipping a  rapidly deployable force, called Stryker brigades, intended to provide the  combatant commanders with increased land power options, including the  ability to execute and sustain early-entry operations, potentially into  remote areas of the world. Stryker brigades will also validate new  doctrine and organizational structures and develop insights for subsequent  transformation to the Army\u2019s future force\u2014the Objective Force. To this  end, the Army has established a goal to deploy a combat capable Stryker  brigade (including its 1,000 plus vehicles and pieces of equipment as well  as 3,900 personnel) anywhere in the world within 4 days. Having realistic  deployment goals is important to the Army for measuring its progress in  creating forces to meet them, as well as to theater combatant commanders  so that these forces can be integrated into contingency planning.", "This is the sixth in a series of reports identifying key challenges the Army  faces in implementing its transformation plans.

Our  objectives were to assess the Army\u2019s progress in (1) meeting its  deployment goal for Stryker brigades and (2) supporting and sustaining a  deployed Stryker brigade in combat operations. We also address potential  changes in deployment and support plans the Army may need to make in  response to direction from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to  enhance the brigades\u2019 capabilities.

Army  transformation plans call for the ability to deploy a brigade anywhere in  the world in 4 days, a division in 5 days, and five divisions within 30 days.  The first step in this transformation is to form and equip six Interim  Brigade Combat Teams, now called Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, as an  early-entry force that can be rapidly deployed, supported anywhere in the  world, and capable of conducting combat operations immediately upon  arrival into a theater of operations, if required. Initially, the Army  established a requirement for Stryker brigades of being capable of  deploying anywhere in the world within 4 days after first aircraft liftoff.  The Army has since made it a goal or target for the Stryker brigades, rather  than a requirement, to help set a vision and design metric for developing  the brigades.", "According to the Army\u2019s organizational and operational concept for  Stryker brigades, the brigades are designed to have higher levels of  strategic and tactical mobility than existing Army forces. Strategically, the  brigades are being organized, equipped, and configured to meet a 96-hour  deployment standard. To help achieve the envisioned rapid deployability,  the Army is developing logistical support plans and concepts that will  permit Stryker brigades to deploy with fewer quantities of supplies and  smaller numbers of support personnel and equipment than currently exists  in heavier brigade-size units. At the tactical level, the brigades are to be  capable of intratheater deployment by C-130 air transport. Key to their  increased mobility is their primary combat platform, the Stryker armored  vehicle. According to the Army, the Stryker armored vehicle will fulfill an  immediate requirement for a vehicle that is air transportable any place in  the world, arriving ready for combat. The Stryker is an eight-wheeled  armored vehicle that will provide transport for troops, weapons, and  command and control. The Stryker vehicle weighs about 19 tons,  substantially less than the M1A1 Abrams tank (68 tons) and the Bradley  fighting vehicle (33 tons), the primary combat platforms of the Army\u2019s  heavier armored units.", "The Army selected one light infantry brigade and one mechanized infantry  brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington, to become the first two of six planned  Stryker brigades. The Army completed a congressionally mandated  operational evaluation of the first of these brigades at the end of May 2003,  and it plans to report the results of the evaluation by November 2003. At  that time, the Secretary of Defense is to certify to Congress whether or not  the results of the operational evaluation indicate that the Stryker brigade\u2019s  design is operationally effective and operationally suitable, at which time  this brigade can be deployed overseas for the first time. The Army plans to  complete the formation of the second of the two Fort Lewis brigades in  2004 and to form four more Stryker brigades from 2005 through 2010. The  planned locations of the next four brigades (see fig. 1) are Fort  Wainwright/Fort Richardson, Alaska; Fort Polk, Louisiana; Schofield  Barracks, Hawaii; and a brigade of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.

Deploying a heavy armored brigade would require airlifting  almost 29,000 tons of armored vehicles, equipment, and supplies and about  4,500 personnel. Deploying a Stryker brigade would require airlifting about  15,000 tons of vehicles, equipment, and supplies and about 3,900  personnel. Consequently, the amount of airlift that would be needed to  deploy a Stryker brigade would be about one-half of the airlift aircraft  needed to deploy a heavy armored brigade.

The study found that it is possible to achieve global air  deployment timelines on the order of 1 to 2 weeks by using a combination  of continental United States based brigades, a Stryker brigade forward- based in Germany, and regional preposition sites. According to the study,  prepositioning of equipment or overseas basing of forces is the single most  effective way to increase the responsiveness of Army forces for operations  in key regions.", "Under the 2002 Defense Planning Guidance, the Army is planning for the  relocation of one Stryker brigade to Europe in fiscal year 2007. By air, a  brigade based in Germany, for example, could reach some global regions  in less time than it could from the four currently planned brigade  locations. From Ramstein Air Base in Germany, minimum air deployment  times to sub-Saharan Africa would be 7 to 9 days, compared to a minimum  of 13 days to 14 days from the other brigade locations. From Germany to  the Balkans, it would take 5 days to airlift a Stryker brigade, compared to  about 6 days to 7 days from the other locations. Although the Army  recognizes that some prepositioning of Stryker brigade equipment  overseas would add to a brigade\u2019s strategic responsiveness and is  considering it as a future option, Army officials told us that it would be too  costly to do so at this time.", "Based on our analysis of the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s air  deployment planning factors and airlift allocation assumptions, achieving  the 5 to 14 day air deployment timelines would be difficult because it  would require the Air Force to dedicate about one-third of its projected  2005 primary strategic airlift aircraft fleet of C-17s and C-5s for  transporting only one Stryker brigade. Obtaining this amount of airlift for  deploying one Stryker brigade would require allocating 31 percent of the  Air Force\u2019s total 2005 inventory of C-17 aircraft and 38 percent of its C-5  aircraft inventory. Obtaining an airlift allocation larger than this would be  possible\u2014if airlifting a Stryker brigade is a National Command Authority  top priority and absent competing demand elsewhere for airlift aircraft.  Table 1 shows the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s estimated airlift  allocation and the percentages of the projected 2005 total airlift inventory  of C-17 and C-5 aircraft needed to strategically airlift one Stryker brigade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Plans to Use a Combination of Airlift and Sealift to Deploy Stryker Brigades", "paragraphs": ["Because it may not always be possible to obtain sufficient airlift to deploy  an entire Stryker brigade, Army officials anticipate using a combination of  airlift and sealift to deploy the brigades, although sea deployment time  would be slower than the Army\u2019s 4-day worldwide deployment goal to  most locations. Army officials told us that current plans are to deploy  about one-third of a Stryker brigade by air and the remainder of the  brigade would be deployed by sea. While some areas in South America  could be reached by a Stryker brigade located at Fort Polk, Louisiana, via  gulf coast ports in about 4 days, sea deployment times to South America  and other global regions from the three other planned Stryker brigade  locations would take longer. For example, sailing time for a Fort   Lewis-based Stryker brigade from Seattle/Tacoma, Washington, would be  about 10 days to ports in northern regions of South America and more  than 2 weeks to ports in West Africa. From Alaska, sailing time to any of  the eight overseas destinations we included in this analysis would take  from 12 days to 24 days. Similarly, sailing times to the Balkans from any  one of the four planned Stryker brigade locations would take a minimum  of 2 weeks to over 3 weeks. With a Stryker brigade forward based in  Europe, sea deployment times to the Balkans from seaports in Germany,  for example, could be reduced to about 7 days. Figure 3 shows estimated  ranges of Stryker brigade sailing times from the four current and planned  Stryker brigade locations to selected global regions. (See app. IV for a  summary of sea deployment times by origins and destinations.)", "In addition to the sailing times needed to reach overseas destinations, it  would take days to transport a Stryker brigade and all of its vehicles and  equipment from its home installation to a seaport. For example, the  Stryker brigade to be located in Alaska would need to travel about 350  miles by rail or highway from Fort Wainwright, near Fairbanks, to seaports  in or near Anchorage. In addition, loading and unloading cargo transport  ships take much longer than loading and off-loading aircraft. According to  Army deployment planning data, it would take about 2 days for loading  ships and another 2 days to unload them after arrival, compared to hours  for loading and unloading aircraft. Furthermore, many areas of the world  in which Stryker brigades are anticipated to operate have no access to a  seaport, and not all seaports would have the capacity to handle large   deep-draft vessels. Additional time would also be needed for Army forces  deployed by sea to move from a seaport to an in-land area of operations,  although a Stryker brigade would be able to move to in-land locations  faster than a heavy armored brigade because Stryker armored vehicles can  be driven while heavier armored vehicles and tanks might require rail or  truck transport. Also, a deployed Stryker brigade would need less time  than a heavy armored brigade would need to unload at a seaport,  assemble, and begin operations: Stryker brigades are organized and  equipped to begin operations soon after arrival in an operational theater,  carrying up to 3 days\u2019 supplies of the fuel and ammunition and  sustainment items, allowing the brigades to immediately conduct a combat  mission. This contrasts with an Army armored or mechanized brigade,  which would need days to draw the fuel, ammunition, and other supplies it  would need before it can begin operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s Plan for Supporting and Sustaining Stryker Brigades in Combat Operations Is Still Evolving", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s plan for supporting and sustaining Stryker brigades in combat  operations is still evolving and cannot be considered finalized until a  number of issues are resolved.

The Army conducted the operational evaluation in April and  May 2003 to assess the first Stryker brigade\u2019s overall operational  effectiveness and suitability. The operational evaluation included the  logistical support plan and processes that augment the brigade\u2019s limited  capabilities to perform basic maintenance, supply, and transportation  services. To make Stryker brigades easier to deploy and support, the Army  designed the brigades with a support structure that is only about one-third  the size of that found in a heavy armored brigade. Thus, Stryker brigades  do not have the capability to sustain operations without the assistance of  external support organizations and resources. Contractors will provide a  key part of this external support to service and maintain newly fielded  Stryker armored vehicles and complex digital command, control,  communications, and computer equipment. Contractor logistics support  will be needed to support the Stryker vehicles and digital systems at least  until these systems are fully fielded. Also, instead of transporting large  inventories of ammunition spare parts, and other supplies into an area of  operation\u2014as a heavy armored brigade would do\u2014Stryker brigades are to  sustain themselves in extended operations by having these items delivered  from numerous locations outside the area of operation, such as Army  depots and theater support bases, where they will be stored and  configured for rapid shipment and distribution to the brigades as they are  needed.", "Because these support and sustainment processes are new concepts and  key elements of the Army\u2019s support plan for Stryker brigades, the Army  will complete the plan after it has reviewed the results and lessons learned  from the operational evaluation. Based on the results, the Army plans to  make any adjustments or modifications it determines are necessary before  the plan becomes final. Before it can fully implement the support plan, the  Army will need to determine the cost and decide whether it will fund the  acquisition of vehicles and equipment replacement reserves. The brigades  are designed to do only limited maintenance for vehicles and equipment  on the battlefield; therefore, the Army\u2019s support plan calls for rapidly  evacuating and replacing items needing major maintenance or repair with  what the Army calls ready-to-fight replacements. The plan depends on  having in reserve and readily available sufficient numbers of vehicles and  essential equipment, such as digital components, for rapid shipment into  an area of operation. Before the Army can make a final funding decision, it  will first need to determine the types, amounts, and total cost of the ready- to-fight replacements that would be needed. As of May 2003, the Army had  not made a final decision as to the number, types, and configuration of the  ready-to-fight vehicles, nor the method of their delivery to an area of  operations. Additionally, to reduce the amount of materiel that is deployed  and stockpiled within an operational theater, the Army\u2019s Stryker brigade  support plan includes measures for rapidly distributing directly to the  brigades pre-configured loads of essential sustainment supplies such as  food, repair parts, and ammunition, as they are needed. Before the Army  can implement the plan, it will need to finish the instructions and  guidelines that will identify the types and amounts of supplies to be  distributed in configured loads and the locations and facilities (including  defense supply depots, Stryker brigade installations, and theater support  bases) where configured loads are to be built and stored. The Army also  still will need to identify the personnel and obtain the equipment, supplies,  and funding that will be needed to manage and carry out its planned  configured load distribution system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s Plans for Deploying and Sustaining Stryker Brigades Could Change", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s current plans for deploying and sustaining Stryker brigades  could change after the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) reviews  options it directed the Army to provide for enhancing the brigades\u2019  capabilities.

OSD has directed the  Army to present a plan by July 8, 2003, that provides options for adding to  the brigade\u2019s enhanced combined arms capabilities. Currently, the  brigades do not have capabilities such as aviation and air defense. Such  changes would enhance the overall organizational effectiveness of the  brigades, but they also could increase deployment and support  requirements, potentially making the brigades more difficult to deploy by  air and to support.", "OSD directed the Army to provide options for enhancing the Stryker  brigades to ensure that they would provide a higher level of combat  capability and sustainability across a broader spectrum of combat  operations than those for which they were originally conceived, along with  the capability of being employed independently of higher-level command  formations and support. According to OSD, this additional capability will  result in Stryker brigades that are more prototypical of the combined arms  Objective Force units the Army is developing and would enhance the  transformation of the Army by fielding added capabilities sooner. OSD has  directed the Army not to expend funds in fiscal year 2004 for the fifth and  sixth Stryker brigades until the Army presents a plan to provide options  for enhancing all but one of the brigades. OSD wants the Army to  remodel the brigades to be distinctively different than their original design,  with enhanced combined arms capabilities that might include aviation, air  defense, sensors, and armor.", "Many factors\u2014including the numbers, size, and types of equipment\u2014 affect the Stryker brigades\u2019 deployment and logistical support  requirements. Based on the U.S. Transportation Command\u2019s deployment- planning factors, every additional 1,000 tons of weight to be airlifted  reduces aircraft range by 250 nautical miles and adds another 15 aircraft  loads. If Stryker brigades were redesigned to include an aviation unit, for  example, transporting the unit\u2019s helicopters from the continental United  States to overseas destinations would most likely need to be done by sea,  and it would take days to unload them after arrival into a theater of  operations. In addition, adding aviation maintenance personnel and the  equipment that is needed to support an aviation unit would also  substantially increase deployment requirements. Once deployed, the  requirements for logistical support, such as fuel and spare parts, would  increase well beyond that for which the Army\u2019s current Stryker brigade  support plan anticipates.

We also did not consider possible future  developments in lift assets such as High Speed Vessels or Ultra Heavy Lift  Aircraft in our assessment of Stryker brigade deployability.", "To obtain information on the Army\u2019s plan for supporting Stryker brigades  in combat operations, we analyzed Army information on the organizational  design and operational concepts for Stryker brigades to gain an  understanding of the logistical challenges of supporting and sustaining the  brigades. We interviewed officials at Fort Lewis and U.S. Army Alaska for  information relating to support and sustainment plans for the first three  Stryker brigades. In addition, we reviewed documents and interviewed  officials from Army headquarters staff elements responsible for operations  and plans, logistics, and force development. We also interviewed and  obtained documents from the Army\u2019s Forces Command, the Combined  Arms Support Command, and the Tank-automotive and Armaments  Command to learn about support and sustainment options for the Stryker  brigades.", "Our review was conducted from April 2002 through March 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Secretary of the Army, and the Director of Management and Budget.
