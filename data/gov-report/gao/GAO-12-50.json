The committee report accompanying a proposed bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (H.R. 5136) directed GAO to review language and culture training for Army and Marine Corps general purpose forces. For this report, GAO evaluated the extent to which these services (1) captured information in training and personnel systems on the completion of language and culture predeployment training and proficiency gained from training and (2) developed plans to sustain language skills acquired through predeployment training. GAO analyzed service documents and interviewed cognizant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Marine Corps have documented some information at the unit level for service members who completed language and culture predeployment training, but the services have not fully captured information within service-level training and personnel systems on service members who completed training or their corresponding proficiency. DOD and service guidance require the services to document language and culture training completion and proficiency gained from training in service-level systems. However, GAO identified several factors that limited the services' ability to implement this guidance. For example, the Army's primary training system did not have data fields for all mandatory language and culture tasks and, as a result, units were unable to document the completion of this training. In addition, while the Army collects some language proficiency data within its primary personnel system, the Army considers these data unreliable because of weaknesses in its approach to collecting them. To improve the accuracy of information within this system, the Army established a task force in January 2011, which has identified a number of key tasks and is at varying stages of completing its work. The Marine Corps did not document language and culture predeployment training completion in any servicewide training or personnel system and a system has not been designated for this purpose. Further, the Marine Corps had not required marines who completed significant language training to take formal proficiency tests and, therefore, the service did not have language proficiency data for these marines. By not capturing information within service-level training and personnel systems on the training that general purpose forces have completed and the language proficiency gained from training, the Army and Marine Corps do not have the information they need to effectively leverage the language and culture knowledge and skills of these forces when making individual assignments and assessing future operational needs. The Army and Marine Corps have not developed plans to sustain language skills already acquired through predeployment training. The services have made considerable investments to provide some service members with extensive predeployment language training. For example, as of July 2011, over 800 soldiers have completed about 16 weeks of Afghan language training since 2010 at a cost of about $12 million. DOD and service guidance address the need to sustain language skills and the DOD strategic plan for language, regional, and culture skills calls for the services to build on existing language skills for future needs. However, we found that the services had not yet determined which service members require follow-on language training to sustain skills, the amount of training required, or appropriate mechanisms to deliver the training. Although informal follow-on training programs were available to sustain language skills, such as computer-based training, these programs were voluntary. In the absence of formal sustainment training programs to maintain and build upon service members' language skills, the Army and Marine Corps may miss opportunities to capitalize on the investments they have already made to provide predeployment language training for ongoing operations. GAO made recommendations intended to improve the availability of information on training completion and proficiency and help DOD plan for sustainment training. DOD generally agreed with the recommendations, but stated that the definition of significant language training was not intended to describe training for initial skills. However, DOD noted that current guidance does not preclude language proficiency testing at this stage."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Due to changes in the global security environment and operational  experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Department of Defense (DOD)  has emphasized the importance of developing language skills and  knowledge of foreign cultures to meet the needs of current and future  military operations. It is DOD\u2019s policy that language and culture training  be embedded in initial military training, professional military education,  and predeployment training and integrated across the total force. DOD  has emphasized that it should better account for the language and culture  knowledge and skills of service members within the department\u2019s  personnel management systems. These systems, which include training  and personnel systems, are used at the service level to manage  individual assignments and also provide senior leaders at the service and  department level with visibility over the capabilities of military personnel.  DOD has also stated that language and culture training must be valued  as a long-term investment and is investing millions of dollars to provide  such training to general purpose forces for ongoing military operations  and to prepare these forces for future missions. For example, in  December 2009, the Office of the Secretary of Defense directed the Army  to include a total of about $160 million in its budget submissions for fiscal  years 2011 through 2015 to establish and maintain language training  detachments on selected military installations across the services to  teach foreign languages to military and civilian personnel including those  who are preparing for deployments to Afghanistan.", "In prior reports, we have identified various management challenges that  DOD faces in developing language and culture capabilities, and made  several related recommendations. In June 2009, we recommended that  DOD develop a strategic plan that includes measurable performance  goals and objectives and investment priorities and a validated  methodology for identifying language and regional proficiency  requirements, including cultural awareness, and in May 2011, we  recommended that DOD establish a defined planning process to align the  services\u2019 language and culture training efforts. DOD has taken some  steps to address our recommendations. For example, in February 2011,  DOD published the Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Language  Skills, Regional Expertise, and Cultural Capabilities (2011-2016), but  stated that a more detailed implementation plan would be issued  separately. In particular, DOD noted that its implementation plan will  include a clearly defined planning process for working with the military  departments to coordinate and synchronize plans with the department\u2019s  strategic goals and resources. As of September 2011, DOD is continuing  to develop the implementation plan.", "The committee report accompanying a proposed bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (H.R. 5136) directed us to  review a number of issues related to language and culture training for  Army and Marine Corps general purpose forces.

For this  report, we evaluated the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps have  (1) captured information in service-level training and personnel systems  on the completion of language and culture predeployment training and  proficiency gained from this training and (2) developed plans to sustain  language skills acquired through predeployment training.", "For the first objective, we focused on Army and Marine Corps language  and culture training programs administered since 2009 to prepare general  purpose forces for ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Therefore,  for this review, we excluded training programs for language and regional  experts (e.g., foreign area officers and intelligence specialists) and  special operations forces. We reviewed information available in service- level training and personnel systems and department-level information  systems on service members\u2019 completion of language and culture training  and the corresponding acquisition of skills\u2014specifically, the time frame  when this training occurred and the proficiency service members gained  from training. We defined \u201cproficiency\u201d using DOD\u2019s agreed-upon method  for measuring it. We conducted interviews with Army and Marine Corps  officials who are responsible for developing predeployment training  programs and documenting information on training completion in service- level training and personnel systems. We also discussed the extent to  which the services used these systems to record service members\u2019  proficiency gained from this training, in particular the training that meets  DOD\u2019s definition of significant language training. We also interviewed  officials with Army and Marine Corps units that were participating in  predeployment training and units that were deployed in Afghanistan at the  time of our review to discuss the extent to which they used service-level  training and personnel systems and other processes to document the  completion of language and culture training and any proficiency gained  from training. We assessed the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 efforts in light  of DOD guidance that requires that the services document all language  and regional proficiency training, education, and experience in training  and personnel systems and Army and Marine Corps documents that note  that language and culture training completion and corresponding  proficiency should be documented in service-level systems.", "For the second objective, we interviewed Army and Marine Corps training  officials to discuss the extent to which the services had developed plans  and specific training programs for general purpose forces to sustain  language skills acquired through predeployment training. We interviewed  officials with Army and Marine Corps units that were participating in  predeployment training and units that were deployed in Afghanistan at the  time of our review to discuss any formal programs used by service  members to sustain skills acquired through language training. We also  discussed other informal training programs that were available to service  members to sustain language skills. To gain an understanding of the  investments already made in predeployment language training, we  collected information from service training officials on the number of  soldiers and marines completing predeployment language training from  January 2009 through July 2011, the amount of time spent in training, and  the cost of these training programs. To ensure the reliability of our data,  we interviewed knowledgeable officials about the data and internal  controls on the systems that contain them. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this audit.

The  Army and Marine Corps have also developed concepts to align  headquarters and forces with geographic commands around the world  and plan to provide them with specialized language and culture training  prior to deployment to conduct security force assistance and irregular  warfare missions, among others. In addition, the services are  implementing strategies to build and reinforce language and culture  knowledge and skills through training at various points of a service  member\u2019s career through formal service institutions, such as professional  military education schools, and during predeployment training. For  example:  \uf0b7  Beginning in 2009, the Army Command and General Staff College  began offering language courses to soldiers in targeted languages,  such as Arabic, Chinese, and French, which consist of resident  instruction, self-study, and distance learning in a modified year-long  program. In addition, the Army updated its Captains Career Course in  2010 to include 13 hours of training in the areas of cross-cultural skill  building and negotiations.  \uf0b7  The Marine Corps has begun implementing the Regional, Culture, and  Language Familiarization career development program for all marines  that begins when marines enter military service and continues  throughout their career. As part of the program, marines are assigned  to 1 of 17 regions around the world and will be assigned an  associated language.

In addition,  commanders are required to designate at least one leader per platoon  who will have regular contact with a local population to complete 16  weeks (at least 480 hours) of on-site training at one of five language  training detachments on Army installations. If the designated leader does  not have access to a language training detachment, that soldier is  required to complete approximately 100 hours of computer-based  training. Since February 2010, the Marine Corps has required that all  deploying marines complete culture training which, for Afghanistan  deployments, service officials reported typically consists of 1 day of  training, and selected marines have been required to complete language  training with the amount determined by a mission analysis. Selected  marines can complete this training at one of two language training  detachments on Marine Corps installations or through programs at a local  community college and university. Language training detachments on  Army and Marine Corps installations provide predeployment training that  includes role playing, classroom instruction, and self-directed learning  (see fig. 2).", "DOD relies on the Defense Language Proficiency Test system of tests to  measure an individual\u2019s proficiency in a foreign language.

Although the  system provides a single data field for units to record information for basic  language and culture training, the Army has multiple, mandatory  language and culture predeployment training requirements. Because only  one field exists, units we spoke with stated that inconsistent information  was recorded in that field. In some cases, units recorded basic culture  training in the field but did not record predeployment language training.  For example, officials with battalions preparing to deploy to Afghanistan in  March 2011 reported they did not record information in this field for  soldiers who completed mandatory language training at an on-site  language training detachment. At the time of our review, the Army had not  yet established data fields within the Digital Training Management System  that would allow training officials to document soldiers\u2019 completion of all  mandatory language and culture training tasks. In bringing this fact to the  attention of the Army, service headquarters officials stated that the Army  has considered adding new data fields within the Digital Training  Management System for all required language and culture predeployment  training tasks, but as of July 2011, had not done so. Without data fields  available that are clearly aligned with all mandatory training tasks, units  have been unable to document which soldiers completed language and  culture training.", "We also found that the Army had not recorded language proficiency in its  primary training systems, despite the fact that these systems have data  fields to record this information. In December 2010, the Army reinforced  its prior guidance that directed that units record training in the Digital  Training Management System and also stated that units should record  training within the Army Training Requirements and Resources System to  enable tracking of cultural knowledge and foreign language proficiency.  Service officials reported that, as of July 2011, nearly 100 percent of the  more than 800 soldiers who completed training at a language training  detachment met the Army standard for language proficiency in the  speaking and listening modalities.

While the  Army collects some language proficiency data within this system, the  Army considers these data unreliable because of weaknesses in its  approach to collecting them. For all soldiers, including those who  complete training at a language training detachment, the Army utilizes a  paper form to document soldiers\u2019 language proficiency. Upon completing  training at a language training detachment, the Army has provided  soldiers with a test to determine proficiency in the listening and speaking  modalities and a testing official records the corresponding proficiency on  this form. The form should then be passed on to a soldier\u2019s local training  manager and to the Army Human Resources Command. The Army  Human Resources Command is required to ensure that language  proficiency data are current and accessible to the Department of the Army  staff and personnel managers. According to Army officials, the command  updates these data in soldiers\u2019 personnel records within the Total Army  Personnel Database. However, Army officials described several  weaknesses in this process that result in unreliable data. For example,  the Army relies on hand-delivered hard copy forms, which introduce  multiple opportunities for these forms to be lost or human error in data  entry. Depending on the type of language test, language proficiency  data are also reported to the Defense Manpower Data Center, which  maintains personnel and manpower data for all service members,  including language test scores. For Web-based tests, test scores are  automatically transferred to the Defense Manpower Data Center. For in- person or telephone tests, a testing official records the test score and  sends the results to the Defense Manpower Data Center. Army officials  explained that a data link does not currently exist to transfer data between  the Defense Manpower Data Center and the Total Army Personnel  Database and therefore language proficiency data have not been  routinely documented in soldiers\u2019 personnel records. Because the Total  Army Personnel Database is also intended to provide data on soldiers\u2019  language proficiency for the department\u2019s Language Readiness Index,  officials responsible for managing the Language Readiness Index  reported that departmentwide visibility over service members\u2019 language  proficiency is limited by the lack of accurate and timely service data.", "To better understand examples of limitations in the Army\u2019s ability to  capture information within the Army\u2019s training and personnel systems on  the completion of language and culture predeployment training and  corresponding language proficiency, see figure 3.", "In January 2011, the Army established a task force to improve the  accuracy of information on service members\u2019 language proficiency  available within the Total Army Personnel Database.

The Marine Corps is not planning to sustain the Afghan  language skills of marines that were acquired through predeployment  training with a formal training program. Marine Corps officials cited  several reasons as the basis for this approach, for example because of  the turnover of personnel within the Marine Corps from one deployment to  the next. Additionally, according to current plans, the service will provide  language training for a variety of languages as part of its career  development program. However, we found that this program is not  intended to maintain or build upon language skills already acquired by  some marines through extensive predeployment Afghan language  training. In the absence of formal sustainment training to maintain and  build upon service members\u2019 language skills acquired for ongoing  operations at considerable expense in time and resources, the Army and  Marine Corps may miss opportunities to capitalize on the investments  they have already made to provide predeployment language training."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has recognized that its ability to identify general purpose forces that  have language and culture knowledge and skills will be critical to  managing these forces in the future.

Further, the Army and Marine  Corps face competing demands for limited training time and resources  and, in this context, not all service members who acquired skills through  predeployment language training may require follow-on training. Despite  the fact that the Army and Marine Corps have made considerable  investments to provide some service members with extensive  predeployment language training, the services have not determined which  service members require follow-on training to sustain language skills, the  amount of training required, or appropriate mechanisms for delivering the  training.

DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix II. DOD also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as  appropriate.", "In addition to providing detailed responses to our recommendations, DOD  provided two general comments about our report. First, DOD pointed out  that our report noted the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps used  service-level training and personnel systems to record service members\u2019  proficiency gained from predeployment training that meets DOD\u2019s  definition of \u201csignificant language training.\u201d DOD stated that, since it  believed the current definition in the report may have taken the definition  out of context, it would like to clarify what constitutes a \u201csignificant  language training event,\u201d noting that DOD Instruction 5160.71 defines  such an event as \u201cat least 150 hours of immersion training or 6  consecutive weeks of 5-hours-a day classroom training, or other  significant event as defined by the Secretaries of the Military Departments  and the Heads of Defense Agencies and DOD Field Activities.\u201d DOD  stated that this definition was not intended to be associated with the initial  acquisition of a language, but rather is associated with modifying the  retesting interval for someone who has already achieved a measured  proficiency. In a follow-up discussion, DOD officials clarified that language  training offered during predeployment training falls into the category of  initial acquisition of a language, and therefore, under the instruction,  testing for proficiency is not required. These officials noted, however, that  the military services are not precluded from testing for language  proficiency at this stage, and therefore have the option of administering  tests. As we noted in our report, the Army has decided to exercise this  option and is in fact testing the proficiency of its service members upon  completing extensive predeployment training. Given the considerable  investments that the Marine Corps is making to provide some marines  with extensive language training prior to deploying to Afghanistan, we  continue to believe it is prudent for the Marine Corps to take a similar  approach to testing. In the absence of such action, we continue to believe  that DOD may be missing an opportunity to gain greater visibility of the  language skills of its forces and therefore effectively leverage this  capability when making individual assignments and assessing future  operational needs.", "Second, DOD acknowledged our recommendation to develop  sustainment training programs to maintain and build upon service  members\u2019 language skills. The department noted that DOD Instruction  5160.70 emphasizes the importance of sustainment language and  regional proficiency training and education programs for language  professionals and language-skilled personnel. DOD stated that with an  increasing number of general purpose forces attending predeployment  language training at language training detachments, the department will  examine ways to capitalize on the investments already made to ensure  that it builds, enhances, and sustains a total force with a mix of language  skills, regional expertise, and cultural capabilities to meet existing and  emerging needs.", "DOD also provided detailed comments on each of our recommendations.  DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretary of the Army to establish clearly defined data fields for  all mandatory language and culture training tasks within the Digital  Training Management System and update Digital Training Management  System records for soldiers that completed training prior to these fields  being established. DOD stated that deficiencies within the Digital Training  Management System have been identified and that the Army, in a  December 2010 order, had directed the development of solutions to  address these deficiencies. As stated in our report, we recognize that the  Army directed that units record training in the Digital Training  Management System. However, its direction did not include requiring that  adjustments be made in the system. Specifically, it did not call for action  to be taken to add new data fields for all required language and culture  predeployment training tasks that would allow training officials to  document soldiers\u2019 completion of these tasks. Therefore, because the  Army has not directed this action, we continue to believe that our  recommendation has merit.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretary of the Army to document the language proficiency for  soldiers completing predeployment language training within the Digital  Training Management System and the Army Training Requirements and  Resources System. DOD stated that most predeployment language  training is of such short duration that language proficiency will not be  measurable and that the department\u2019s emphasis will be to document  language proficiency for general purpose forces completing  predeployment foundational language training (usually 16 weeks or  longer) conducted at language training detachments. DOD also noted that  the Total Army Personnel Database will remain the primary system for  recording language proficiency of Army personnel. DOD further noted that  the Army Training Requirements and Resources System already  facilitates the requirement for tracking and reporting certain language and  culture training courses. For example, DOD noted that the Army has,  within the system, assigned specific codes for all language and culture  training courses; modified functions to require a proficiency score for  these courses; and assigned codes to each of the courses for a specific  language. However, in its comments, DOD did not state whether the  Army plans to take any actions to document language proficiency within  the Digital Training Management System, as we also recommended. We  continue to believe this action is needed to provide decision makers with  better information on the language and culture knowledge and skills of  soldiers to make individual assignments and assess future operational  needs.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy, in consultation with the  Commandant of the Marine Corps, to designate which training and/or  personnel systems the Marine Corps should use to document the  completion of marines\u2019 language and culture training. DOD stated that, as  outlined in our report, current Marine Corps systems, such as the Marine  Corps Training Information Management System, are designed to track  the completion of institutional training and professional military education,  not the completion of individual and unit-level training. DOD stated that  although efforts are being pursued that may eventually allow for this  capability, the Marine Corps believes that a comprehensive cost-benefit  analysis needs to be conducted beforehand in order to accurately capture  the costs in time, fiscal resources, and infrastructure enhancements  associated with implementation and determine whether those costs  necessary to track the completion of language and culture training at the  individual and unit levels are warranted, particularly when prioritized  against other validated operational requirements in a fiscally- and time- constrained environment. We agree that the Marine Corps should  consider the costs associated with documenting the completion of  language and culture training beyond those already incurred at the unit  level to record this information and determine whether the benefits are  warranted. As part of its analysis, we would expect that the service would  also consider the potential opportunity cost of not recording this  information, such as how it might affect the ability of decision makers to  make timely and informed decisions on assigning forces or assessing  future operational needs if they do not have complete information on the  knowledge and skills of their forces.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy, in consultation with the  Commandant of the Marine Corps, to administer formal tests to marines  completing a significant language training event using DOD\u2019s agreed- upon method to measure proficiency, and ensure the results of these  tests are documented in marines\u2019 personnel records with the Marine  Corps Total Force System. DOD stated that the Marine Corps\u2019  predeployment language training programs are not specifically designed  to produce a measurable language proficiency score using DOD\u2019s  agreed-upon method for measuring it. Rather, the programs are focused  on the military/tactical domain, and are designed to provide marines with  the communication skills necessary to accomplish a specific mission- related task/skill. DOD stated, however, that the Marine Corps is  assessing the feasibility of incorporating metrics into its predeployment  language training programs that would produce a proficiency score, such  as using the Very Low Range series of Defense Language Proficiency  Tests and oral proficiency interviews. DOD also restated the need for  clarification in our report over what constitutes \u201csignificant language  training,\u201d noting that the current definition was not intended to represent  initial acquisition of a language but rather is associated with modifying  retesting intervals.

DOD stated that the Army is formulating a plan for  sustainment of language skills acquired at Army language training  detachments and that such a plan would rely heavily on existing  distributed learning resources. We would expect that as the Army  develops this plan, it would specifically address which soldiers require  additional training, the amount of training required, appropriate  mechanisms for delivering the training, and whether any adjustments to  existing training programs would be made. DOD also stated that the  Marine Corps has made a decision to formally build and sustain  language, regional, and culture skills via the Regional, Culture, and  Language Familiarization program for general purpose forces that  specifically targets its officer corps and enlisted ranks starting at sergeant  and above. DOD noted that given high attrition rates for first-term enlisted  marines, applying this program or other deliberate institutional programs  designed to target the first-term enlisted population group have been  deemed cost prohibitive. For these marines, language, regional, and  culture skills are provided through predeployment training programs and  common skills training, and sustained via informal mechanisms by  providing access to language learning software and other computer- based technologies.

To evaluate the  extent to which the Army and Marine Corps captured information within  service-level training and personnel systems on the completion of  language and culture training and proficiency gained by personnel  through training, we focused on Army and Marine Corps language and  culture predeployment training programs administered since 2009 to  prepare general purpose forces for ongoing operations in Afghanistan  and Iraq. Therefore, for this review, we excluded service training  programs for language and regional experts (e.g., foreign area officers  and intelligence specialists) and special operations forces.

In identifying Army and Marine  Corps unit personnel to speak with, we selected an illustrative  nongeneralizable sample of units that were deployed for contingency  operations or preparing to deploy during the time frame of October 2010  through June 2011. We assessed the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 efforts in  light of DOD guidance that requires that the services document all  language and regional proficiency training, education, and experience in  training and personnel systems and Army and Marine Corps documents  that state that language and culture training completion and  corresponding proficiency should be documented in service-level  systems. For our review, we focused on language and culture-related  training, which DOD includes in its description of regional proficiency  skills. We also discussed with Office of the Secretary of Defense and  Army officials the content and status of ongoing departmental and Army  efforts, such as the Army\u2019s Language Tracking Task Force, which are  intended to improve the accuracy of information on the language  proficiency of service members available in personnel systems.", "To evaluate the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps have  developed plans to sustain language skills acquired through  predeployment training, we interviewed Army and Marine Corps training  officials to discuss the extent to which the services had developed  specific training programs for general purpose forces to sustain language  skills.
