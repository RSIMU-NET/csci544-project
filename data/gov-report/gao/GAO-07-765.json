Institutional investors (e.g., mutual funds and pension funds) cast the majority of proxy votes due to their large stock holdings. In recent years, concerns have been raised about a group of about five firms that provide research and recommendations on proxy votes to their institutional investor clients. GAO was asked to report on (1) potential conflicts of interest that may exist with proxy advisory firms and the steps that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken to oversee these firms; (2) the factors that may impede or promote competition within the proxy advisory industry; and (3) institutional investors' use of the firms' services and the firms' potential influence on proxy vote outcomes. GAO reviewed SEC examinations of proxy advisory firms, spoke with industry professionals, and conducted structured interviews with 31 randomly selected institutional investors. GAO is not making any recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Various potential conflicts of interest can arise at proxy advisory firms that could affect vote recommendations, but SEC has not identified any major violations in its examinations of such firms. In particular, the business model of the dominant proxy advisory firm--Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)--has been the most commonly cited potential conflict. Specifically, ISS advises institutional investors how to vote proxies and provides consulting services to corporations seeking to improve their corporate governance. Critics contend that corporations could feel obligated to retain ISS's consulting services in order to obtain favorable vote recommendations. However, ISS officials said they have disclosed and taken steps to mitigate this potential conflict. For example, ISS discloses the potential conflict on its Web site and the firm's policy is to advise clients of relevant business practices in all proxy vote analyses. ISS also maintains separate staff who are located in separate buildings for the two businesses. While all institutional investors GAO spoke with that use ISS's services said they are satisfied with its mitigation procedures, some industry analysts continue to question their effectiveness. SEC conducts examinations of advisory firms that are registered as investment advisers and has not identified any major violations. Although new firms have entered the market, ISS's long-standing position has been cited by industry analysts as a barrier to competition. ISS has gained a reputation for providing comprehensive services, and as a result, other firms may have difficulty attracting clients. Proxy advisory firms must offer comprehensive coverage to compete and need sophisticated systems to provide the services clients demand. But firms interested in entering the market do have access to much of the information needed to make recommendations, such as publicly available documents filed with SEC. Competitors have attempted to differentiate themselves from ISS by, for example, providing only proxy advisory services and not corporate consulting services. While these firms have attracted clients, it is too soon to tell what their ultimate effect on enhancing competition will be. Among the 31 institutional investors GAO spoke with, large institutions reportedly rely less than small institutions on the research and recommendations offered by proxy advisory firms. Large institutional investors said that their reliance on proxy advisory firms is limited because, for example, they have in-house staff to assess proxy vote issues and only use the research and recommendations offered by proxy advisory firms to supplement such research. In contrast, small institutional investors have limited resources to conduct their own research and tend to rely more heavily on the research and recommendations offered by proxy advisory firms. The fact that large institutional investors cast the great majority of proxy votes made by institutional investors and reportedly place relatively less emphasis on advisory firm research and recommendations could serve to limit the firms' overall influence on proxy voting results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, publicly traded corporations hold shareholder meetings for  director elections and to consider management and shareholder proposals  that may have an effect on a corporation\u2019s operations and value, such as  executive compensation, corporate governance matters, and proposed  mergers and acquisitions.

These proxy advisory firms may perform several  functions on behalf of their clients, such as offering research and  recommendations on particular proxy issues (e.g., whether to approve an  executive compensation plan) or casting the actual votes. Critics of proxy  advisory firms, including certain industry associations and academics,  contend that the proxy advisory industry suffers from significant conflicts  of interest and a lack of competition and that these firms have a  disproportionate influence on proxy voting. Others counter that the firms  provide a valuable service for institutional investors and note that such  clients are sophisticated market participants that are free to choose  whether and how to employ the services of proxy advisory firms.", "Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) regulates the proxy solicitation process with respect to  publicly traded equity securities, and SEC regulates the activities of proxy  advisory firms that are registered with SEC as investment advisers under  the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under SEC rules, when soliciting  proxies, certain information must be disclosed in writing to shareholders,  and such disclosure, referred to as a proxy statement, must be filed with  the agency. These proxy statements must include important facts about  the issues on which shareholders are asked to vote. Under the Investment  Advisers Act and related SEC rules, registered investment advisers are  required to take a variety of steps designed to help protect their clients.  For example, an investment adviser must disclose information about its  business practices and potential conflicts of interest to clients and  potential clients. SEC monitors compliance with the laws and rules  through, among other means, periodic examinations of registered  investment advisers. Based on examination findings, SEC may send letters  to investment advisers requiring them to correct identified deficiencies.  SEC may also take enforcement actions for more serious violations, as  deemed appropriate, such as seeking civil fines in federal district court.", "Because of your interest in helping to ensure the integrity of proxy voting,  you asked us to provide an overview of proxy advisory firms and SEC\u2019s  oversight of this industry. This report (1) identifies potential conflicts of  interest that may exist with proxy advisory firms and the steps that SEC  has taken to oversee these firms; (2) discusses the factors that might  impede or promote competition in this industry; and (3) analyzes  institutional investors\u2019 use of proxy advisory services to help vote proxies  and the influence proxy advisory firms may have on proxy voting.", "To address these objectives, we conducted a literature review and  examined studies relating to the proxy advisory industry. In addition, we  identified and interviewed various professionals (experts, academics,  industry association representatives, and others) with knowledge of the  industry. To gain an understanding of SEC\u2019s oversight of proxy advisory  firms, we reviewed relevant investment adviser regulations and  examination reports and interviewed agency officials. Further, we  conducted structured interviews with 31 institutional investors selected  randomly by type, including mutual funds, corporate pension funds,  government pension funds, and union pension funds, as well as some asset  management institutions, to gain an understanding of the ways in which  they use proxy advisory firms and the influence that such firms have on  proxy voting. Our sample was derived from Standard & Poor\u2019s Money  Market Directories (January 2006), and consisted of a population of  institutional investors with over $1 billion in assets, including large and  small institutional investors from each type above this asset level. We  defined \u201clarge\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d institutional investors as the top and bottom 15  percent of each investor type. Large and small institutional investors  account for over 72 percent of the managed assets held by all of the  institutional investors with over $1 billion in assets. Although we randomly  selected these institutional investors, the size of the sample was small and  might not have been representative of the universe of institutional  investors. As a result, we could not generalize the results of this effort.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., between September 2006  and June 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Votes are solicited on a variety of key issues that could potentially affect  the corporations\u2019 value, such as the election of directors, executive  compensation packages, and proposed mergers and acquisitions, as well  as other, more routine, issues that may not affect value, such as approving  an auditor and changing a corporate name. The proxy statement typically  includes a proxy ballot (also called a proxy card) that allows shareholders  to appoint a third party (proxy) to vote on the shareholder\u2019s behalf if the  shareholder decides not to attend the meeting. The shareholder may  instruct the proxy how to vote the shares or may opt to grant the proxy  discretion to make the voting decision. The proxy card may be submitted  to the company via the mail or online.", "The proxy advisory industry has grown over the past 20 years as a result of  various regulatory and market developments. The management of a  mutual fund\u2019s or pension plan\u2019s assets, including the voting of proxies, is  often delegated to a person who is an investment adviser subject to the  Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In a 1988 letter, known as the \u201cAvon  Letter,\u201d the Department of Labor took the position that the fiduciary act of  managing employee benefit plan assets includes the voting of proxies  associated with shares of stock owned by the plan. According to industry  experts, managers of employee retirement plan assets began to seek help  in executing their fiduciary responsibility to vote proxies in their clients\u2019  best interests. Consequently, the proxy advisory industry\u2014particularly  ISS, which had been established in 1985\u2014started to grow. According to  industry experts, ISS\u2019s reputation and dominance in the proxy advisory  industry continued to grow in the 1990s and early 2000s, fueled by the  growing fiduciary requirements of institutional investors and increased  shareholder activism. This increased shareholder activism has been  attributed in part to reaction by investors to the massive financial frauds  perpetrated by management of public companies, including the actions  that led to the bankruptcies of Enron and WorldCom. Many institutional  investors sought the services of proxy advisory firms to assist in their  assessments of the corporate governance practices of publicly traded  companies and to carry out the mechanics of proxy voting. Finally, in  2003, SEC adopted a rule and amendments under the Investment Advisers  Act of 1940 that requires registered investment advisers to adopt policies  and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that proxies are voted in  the best interests of clients, which industry experts also cited as a reason  for the continued growth of the proxy advisory industry.", "Today, the proxy advisory industry is comprised of five major firms, with  ISS serving as the dominant player with over 1,700 clients. The other four  firms\u2014Marco Consulting Group (MCG), Glass Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis),  Proxy Governance, Inc. (PGI), and Egan-Jones Proxy Services (Egan- Jones)\u2014have much smaller client bases and are relatively new to the  industry: Glass Lewis, PGI, and Egan-Jones were all created within the  past 6 years.", "Founded in 1985, ISS serves clients with its core business, which  includes analyzing proxy issues and offering research and vote  recommendations. ISS also provides Web-based tools and advisory  services to corporate issuers through ISS Corporate Services, Inc. a  separate division established in 1997 which was spun-out into a wholly- owned subsidiary in 2006.

In addition, ISS helps corporate clients develop  proposals to be voted on and offers corporate governance consulting  services to help clients understand and improve their corporate  governance ratings.", "Because ISS provides services to both institutional investors and  corporate clients, there are various situations that can potentially lead to  conflicts. For example, some industry professionals stated that ISS could  help a corporate client design an executive compensation proposal to be  voted on by shareholders and subsequently make a recommendation to  investor clients to vote for this proposal. Some industry professionals also  contend that corporations could feel obligated to subscribe to ISS\u2019s  consulting services in order to obtain favorable proxy vote  recommendations on their proposals and favorable corporate governance  ratings. One industry professional further believes that, even if  corporations do not feel obligated to subscribe to ISS\u2019s consulting  services, they still could feel pressured to adopt a particular governance  practice simply to meet ISS\u2019s standards even though the corporations may  not see the value of doing so.", "ISS has disclosed and taken steps to help mitigate situations that can  potentially lead to conflicts. For example, on its Web site, ISS explains that  it is \u201caware of the potential conflicts of interest that may exist between   proxy advisory service \u2026 and the business of ISS Corporate Services,  Inc. .\u201d The Web site also notes that \u201cISS policy requires every ISS  proxy analysis to carry a disclosure statement advising the client of the  work of ICS and advising ISS\u2019s institutional clients that they can get  information about an issuer\u2019s use of ICS\u2019s products and services.\u201d In  addition, some institutional investors we spoke with noted that ISS has on  occasion disclosed to them, on a case-by-case basis, the existence of a  specific conflict related to a particular corporation.", "In addition to disclosure, ISS has implemented policies and procedures to  help mitigate potential conflicts. For example, according to ISS, it has  established a firewall that includes maintaining separate staff for its proxy  advisory and corporate businesses, which operate in separate buildings  and use segregated office equipment and information databases in order to  help avoid discovery of corporate clients by the proxy advisory staff. ISS  also notes on its Web site that it is a registered investment adviser and is  subject to the regulatory oversight of SEC.

Most institutional  investors also reported conducting due diligence to obtain reasonable  assurance that ISS or any other proxy advisory firm is independent and  free from conflicts of interest. As part of this process, many of these  institutional investors said they review ISS\u2019s conflict policies and  periodically meet with ISS representatives to discuss these policies and  any changes to ISS\u2019s business that could create additional conflicts.

For example, one academic said that while ISS is  probably doing a fair job managing its conflicts, it is difficult to confirm  the effectiveness of the firm\u2019s mitigation procedures because ISS is a  privately-held company, thereby restricting information access.

Because of ISS\u2019s clients\u2019 level of satisfaction, other providers of proxy  advisory services may have difficulty attracting their own clients. In  addition, because of its dominance and perceived market influence,  corporations may feel obligated to be more responsive to requests from  ISS for information about proposals than they might be to other, less- established proxy advisory firms, resulting in a greater level of access by  ISS to corporate information that might not be available to other firms.", "Industry analysts explained that, in addition to overcoming ISS\u2019s  reputation and dominance in the proxy advisory industry, proxy advisory  firms must offer comprehensive coverage of corporate proxies and  implement sophisticated technology to attract clients and compete. For  instance, institutional investors often hold shares in thousands of different  corporations and may not be interested in subscribing to proxy advisory  firms that provide research and voting recommendations on a limited  portion of these holdings. As a result, proxy advisory firms need to provide  thorough coverage of institutional holdings, and unless they offer  comprehensive services from the beginning of their operations, they may  have difficulty attracting clients. In addition, academics and industry  experts we spoke with said that new firms need to implement a  sophisticated level of technology to provide the research and proxy vote  execution services that clients demand. The initial investment required to  develop and implement such technology can be a significant expense for  firms.", "Although newer proxy advisory firms may face challenges attracting  clients and establishing themselves in the industry, several of the  professionals we spoke with believed that these challenges could be  overcome. For example, while firms may need to offer comprehensive  coverage of corporate proxies in order to attract clients and although ISS  might have access to corporate information that other firms do not, much  of the information needed to conduct research and offer voting  recommendations is easily accessible. Specifically, anyone can access  corporations\u2019 annual statements and proxy statements, which are filed  with SEC, are publicly available, and contain most of the information that  is needed to conduct research on corporations and make proxy voting  recommendations. Also, although developing and implementing the  technology required to provide research and voting services can be  challenging, various industry professionals told us that once a firm has  done so, the marginal cost of providing services to additional clients and  of updating and maintaining such technology is relatively low.", "Some of the competitors seeking to enter the proxy advisory industry in  recent years that we spoke with have offered their services as alternatives  to ISS. Specifically, they have attempted to differentiate themselves from  ISS by providing only proxy advisory services to institutional investor  clients.

We did not attempt to assess the adequacy of SEC\u2019s oversight.", "To identify the factors that might impede or promote competition in this  industry, we reviewed the relevant literature and examined studies  relating to the level of competition in the industry, and we spoke with  various industry professionals. We did not attempt to evaluate the level of  competition in this industry and, therefore, did not come to any  conclusions about the extent to which competition exists.", "Finally, to explore institutional investors\u2019 use of proxy advisory services to  help vote proxies and the influence proxy advisory firms may have on  proxy voting, we conducted structured interviews with 31 institutional  investors selected randomly by type, including mutual funds, corporate  pension funds, government pension funds, and union pension funds, as  well as asset management institutions. Our sample included several of the  largest institutional investors and was derived from Standard & Poor\u2019s  Money Market Directories (January 2006). The sample consisted of a  population of mutual funds and pension funds with over $1 billion in  assets, and included large and small institutional investors from each  investor type. We defined \u201clarge\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d institutional investors as the  top and bottom 15 percent of each institutional investor type. In total,  these large and small institutional investors accounted for over 72 percent  of assets under management held by mutual funds and pension funds with  over $1 billion under management. Although we randomly selected these  institutional investors, the size of the sample was small and may not  necessarily be representative of the universe of institutional investors. As  a result, we could not generalize the results of our analysis to the entire  population of institutional investors.", "We conducted structured interviews with 20 large and 11 small  institutional investors. Initially, we had contacted a total of 126 mutual  funds and pension funds that were randomly selected from our sample of  institutional investors and 20 (13 large and 7 small institutions) reported  using proxy advisory firm services and agreed to participate in our  structured interviews. The other 106 institutional investors we had initially  contacted declined to participate in the structured interviews for several  reasons. In particular, many of these institutions said that they do not vote  proxies themselves, but rather hire asset management institutions to both  manage their investment portfolios and vote proxies on their behalf. We  conducted interviews with 11 (7 large and 4 small institutions) of these  asset management institutions, which were referred to us by several of the  pension funds we had initially contacted. The results of these asset  manager interviews are included among the total of 20 large and 11 small  institutional investors that we interviewed. In addition, some of the 106  institutional investors declined to participate because they vote proxies  themselves or do not vote proxies at all, while others refused to  participate or could not be reached.", "In our structured interviews with the 31 institutional investors, we spoke  with officials from the organizations who are responsible for proxy voting  activities. We asked these officials a variety of questions relating to their  institutions\u2019 policies on proxy voting and use of proxy advisory firms.  Further, we asked the officials to comment on potential conflicts of  interest associated with proxy advisory firms, steps taken to mitigate such  potential conflicts, and the level of competition in the proxy advisory  industry.", "Finally, we spoke with various industry professionals discussed earlier to  gain their perspectives on the influence of proxy advisory firms. We could  not identify any studies that comprehensively measured the influence that  these firms have on proxy voting.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., between September 2006  and June 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contact, Wes Phillips, Assistant Director; Emily  Chalmers; Rudy Chatlos; Eric Diamant; Fred Jimenez; Yola Lewis; and  Omyra Ramsingh made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
