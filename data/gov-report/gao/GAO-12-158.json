This was caused in part by weaknesses in FMCSA\u0092s internal controls and may have affected FMCSA\u0092s ability to carry out its mission to reduce motor carrier (large truck and bus) accidents and fatalities. To the extent that these weaknesses existed in FMCSA\u0092s other grant programs, it is possible that FMCSA also incorrectly awarded other grant funds.", "As requested, this report examines (1) internal control weaknesses in FMCSA\u0092s other grant programs prior to fiscal year 2010 that could have increased the risk of irregularities in grant awards and (2) FMCSA\u0092s actions to improve grants management, and remaining challenges. GAO analyzed FMCSA grants management documents related to internal controls over grants both before and after fiscal year 2010 and recent actions, and interviewed FMCSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Prior to fiscal year 2010, FMCSA\u0092s internal controls over management of all of its grant awards were weak, which increased the risk that FMCSA awarded grants that violated laws or FMCSA policies. Internal controls like those related to workforce training and policies and procedures can help provide assurance that operations, including grants management, are efficient and transactions comply with laws. However, FMCSA had only limited formal grants management training, limited documentation of grants management policies and procedures, and, according to FMCSA grants management staff, did not require legal review to help ensure that all awards complied with governing laws and regulations. As a result, FMCSA could not be certain that staff were trained in managing grant awards or followed relevant policies and laws in awarding grants, increasing the risk for mismanagement.", "Since fiscal year 2010, FMCSA has taken a number of actions to transform its grants management practices, including planning to centralize oversight through a Grants Management Office, standardizing policies and procedures, developing grants management training, and implementing grants management systems to manage award processes and documentation. While these actions help address some existing internal control weaknesses\u0097for example, clearly documented and standardized policies and procedures should help ensure that grants management staff follow policies when awarding grants\u0097some challenges remain. Specifically, FMCSA has not conducted a strategic workforce analysis that could help it identify and fill gaps in expertise, as well as support its budget request to staff a Grants Management Office. Also, FMCSA\u0092s grants management policies and procedures lack details on some grant program staff\u0092s roles and responsibilities, and the agency does not have a system to easily track and ensure that staff complete required training. The agency also has not set metrics related to its grants management program or developed a method to measure progress in meeting those metrics. Further, since FMCSA has only recently implemented these actions, it is unclear how effective these new initiatives will be in improving its grants management. Regardless, it will be important that the agency have leadership in place that can continue to drive its transformation, as well as metrics to measure its progress in achieving its grants management goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), in  2009, there were over 124,400 crashes in the United States involving  large trucks and buses, leading to over 3,600 fatalities. As an agency in  the Department of Transportation (DOT), FMCSA\u2019s mission is to reduce  crashes, injuries, and fatalities related to motor carriers\u2014large trucks and  buses\u2014and it relies heavily on 10 grant programs to achieve that  mission. Of the $550 million Congress appropriated to FMCSA in fiscal  year 2011, about $300 million went to states and other entities in the form  of grants to help fund motor carrier safety efforts. For example, FMCSA\u2019s  Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) provides funds to  reduce commercial motor vehicle-involved accidents, fatalities, and  injuries, through safety activities such as inspections.", "Effective internal controls over grants management can reduce the risk of  mismanagement of grant awards by helping ensure that grants are  awarded in accordance with law and FMCSA policy and in a way that  advances agency objectives. In 2010 FMCSA discovered that it may have  violated federal appropriations statutes in some Commercial Vehicle  Information Systems and Networks (CVISN) grants from fiscal years 2006  to 2010, including violations of the Antideficiency Act\u2014which prohibits  federal agencies from incurring obligations that exceed budget authority  made available through appropriations or contract authority\u2014and its  authorizing statute, The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient  Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). In 2011,  DOT determined that it had in fact violated federal appropriations  statutes. These violations were caused in part by weak internal controls  over FMCSA\u2019s management of CVISN grants, such as a lack of oversight  and inadequate grants management training for FMCSA staff. In part in  response to these problems, FMCSA has begun to transform its grants  management practices with activities that it largely began implementing in  or after fiscal year 2010, including proposing the creation of a centralized  grants management office and creating standardized grants management  policies and procedures. To the extent that the weak internal controls that  contributed to irregularities in CVISN awards existed in FMCSA\u2019s other  grant programs prior to fiscal year 2010, it is possible that FMCSA  violated statutes in making other grant awards.", "It is important for FMCSA to award grant funds in accordance with laws  and FMCSA policies in order to help ensure that limited dollars effectively  support its national motor carrier safety goals. The economic downtown  has created unprecedented fiscal constraints for states. State revenues  have decreased in recent years\u2014total state and local tax receipts fell  nearly 5 percent from 2008 to 2009\u2014putting increased fiscal pressure on  state governments. This challenge increases the importance of federal funds\u2014such as grants from FMCSA\u2014for state governments. For  example, in the case of CVISN awards, because some states received  more funds than they were legally authorized, other states may not have  received as much as they could have, adding unfairly to the fiscal  pressures on those states and potentially impacting those states\u2019  commercial motor vehicle safety efforts.", "Given these concerns, you asked us to review: (1) the extent to which,  prior to fiscal year 2010, FMCSA\u2019s other grant programs had internal  control weaknesses that could have increased the risk for financial  irregularities in grant awards and (2) actions FMCSA is taking to improve  its grants management to reduce the risk for financial irregularities in  awarding grants and the challenges that remain.", "In order to address the extent to which, prior to fiscal year 2010,  FMCSA\u2019s other grant programs had internal control weaknesses that  could have increased the risk of grant award irregularities, we reviewed  Internal Control Evaluation reviews of FMCSA\u2019s grants management  procedures and practices and related external auditor reports and  interviewed grants management staff in FMCSA headquarters, as well as  a selected number of field office staff and state grant recipients. We did  not review internal controls over CVISN prior to fiscal year 2010 given  that we recently reported on internal control weaknesses in that program.  We reviewed GAO\u2019s internal control standards for the federal  government to determine those standards most relevant to grants  management and reviewed relevant FMCSA grants management  documentation to determine the extent to which relevant internal controls  were in place for each grant program prior to fiscal year 2010. In order to  determine the extent to which actions FMCSA is taking to improve its  grants management reduce the risk for financial irregularities in awarding  grants, and the challenges that remain, we reviewed documentation  related to these efforts such as FMCSA\u2019s Grants Management Program  Roadmap and Grants Management Manual. We analyzed these  documents and information obtained during interviews and compared  them with GAO\u2019s internal control standards to determine the extent to  which they address the internal controls deficiencies we identified at  FMCSA. We also interviewed FMCSA management about these efforts.  Finally, we interviewed grants management officials at the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA) and analyzed relevant grants management  documents to determine how those agencies manage their grant  programs and how their grants management practices may be relevant to  FMCSA. We selected these agencies because they, like FMCSA, devote  at least 50 percent of their budgets to grants and have a safety focus.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2011 to December 2011  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In order to meet this mission FMCSA,  among other things, establishes commercial motor carrier regulations,  educates motor carriers, drivers, and the public, and partners with  stakeholders such as state governments on efforts to reduce motor  carrier crashes. FMCSA uses 52 division offices\u2014one in each state as  well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico\u2014and four regional service  centers to help carry out its efforts. In order to undertake these activities,  FMCSA received appropriations of approximately $550 million for fiscal  year 2011 and obligated about $300 million of that for grant awards.", "FMCSA manages 10 grant programs that span a range of areas and  provides funding to states, localities, and others to improve commercial  motor vehicle safety (see table 1). Nine of the 10 grant programs are  discretionary\u2014that is, FMCSA decides, through a competitive process  based on a review of the merits of applications, which applicants to award  funds. FMCSA considers its MCSAP Basic and Incentive program, which  accounts for over one-half of FMCSA\u2019s grant funding, to be a formula  grant program as FMCSA awards funds through a predetermined formula  set by FMCSA based on, among other factors, a state\u2019s population and  highway miles.", "FMCSA currently manages its grants using the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s (OMB) five phases of grants management (see fig. 1). The  first three phases are most relevant to awarding grant funds, the focus of  this report. These five phases broadly outline all steps that an agency  needs to undertake in awarding and managing grants, including planning  the grant program, soliciting and reviewing applications, awarding funds,  overseeing grant recipients, and closing out grants. For example,  management of grant application reviews and the award process includes  creating a grant announcement, accepting and reviewing applications,  making funding decisions, and obligating those funds to selected grant  recipients.", "Generally speaking, grants management staff in FMCSA headquarters  are responsible for managing the first three phases of grants. Once  FMCSA awards grants to states, staff in FMCSA\u2019s 52 division offices,  headed by Division Administrators, generally assume responsibility of  managing the grants, including oversight of the grantee and grant  closeout. The four regional service centers also provide grants  management support and oversight to each of the division offices.  FMCSA has a small number of grant awards that are provided to national  organizations, and these grants are managed entirely by FMCSA staff in  headquarters.", "Internal controls are mechanisms that help an organization, such as a  federal agency, provide reasonable assurance that it is meeting its  objectives, that operations are effective and efficient, and that the agency  is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We have issued  standards for internal control in the federal government, and these  standards provide an overall framework for establishing and maintaining  internal controls and identifying and addressing major performance and  management challenges, as well as areas at greatest risk of fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement. Effective internal controls, which include  the plans, methods and procedures to meet agency goals and objectives,  can assist in managing change to cope with shifting environments and  evolving demands and priorities. As a result, internal controls play a  significant role in helping managers achieve agency goals.", "We have previously reported that there are five standards for internal  control (see table 2) that define the minimum level of quality acceptable  for internal control in government and can be applied to all aspects of an  agency\u2019s operations. The standards are: (1) establishing a control  environment, in which an agency creates an environment that sets a  positive and supportive attitude toward internal controls such as  management\u2019s commitment to competence and setting an ethical tone  within the agency; (2) conducting risk assessment, in which an agency  assesses both internal and external risks associated with achievement of  agency objectives; (3) engaging in control activities, which helps  management ensure that its directives, such as policies and procedures,  are carried out; (4) disseminating information and communications to  management and others; and (5) monitoring performance over time and  ensuring that audit findings are addressed and promptly resolved. In the  context of grants management, internal controls are the mechanisms that  help an agency ensure that its grant programs are effectively and  efficiently managed and that its grant awards comply with laws and  regulations.", "FMCSA\u2019s Internal Control Senior Assessment Team oversees FMCSA\u2019s  internal controls program, which includes, among other actions, annual  internal control evaluations conducted by an external auditor to test the  effectiveness of internal controls. The evaluations test a number of  internal control areas at FMCSA, including grants management. In  conducting the internal control evaluations, the external auditor uses an  Internal Control Evaluation Tool to assess the effectiveness of internal  control activities\u2014which it does by interviewing key staff and testing  controls to determine their effectiveness\u2014and assigns an effectiveness  rating to each control activity reviewed, and determines the relative  significance of internal control deficiencies identified during the  evaluations. Although past reviews found internal control deficiencies  related to grants management\u2014including inadequate grants management  oversight\u2014the external auditor did not make an overall determination of  FMCSA\u2019s internal controls over grants management. In response to  findings made in each review, the Internal Control Senior Assessment  Team, in conjunction with subject matter staff at FMCSA, develops  corrective action plans that include information on planned actions and  time frames for addressing the finding. Once all actions have been  implemented by FMCSA and then tested by the auditor, the auditor can  close the corrective action plans.", "SAFETEA-LU authorized funding for all of FMCSA\u2019s grant programs and  established funding restrictions for the CVISN program. In May 2010,  DOT and FMCSA determined that FMCSA might have violated statutory  requirements in obligating CVISN awards. After FMCSA\u2019s Chief Financial  Officer and Office of the Chief Counsel staff noticed irregularities with  CVISN awards, including potential statutory violations, in spring 2010,  DOT established an analysis team supported by Deloitte Consulting LLP  (Deloitte), to review the CVISN program and determine the extent of the  problem. Using the results of Deloitte\u2019s review and its own follow-up  assessment, FMCSA found widespread problems with CVISN grant  awards, and DOT concluded that it violated the Antideficiency Act\u2014which  prohibits federal agencies from incurring an obligation that exceeds their  available appropriation or contract authority amounts\u2014and SAFETEA- LU. FMCSA found that many awards exceeded statutory caps and that, in  some cases, FMCSA awarded total CVISN funds in excess of the annual  contract authority available. Specifically, FMCSA found that it committed  47 statutory violations between fiscal years 2006 and 2010 totaling about  $23 million. In response, FMCSA temporarily shut down the CVISN  program in May 2010 to determine the problems and to prevent  exacerbating any problems. According to FMCSA officials, the agency  reopened the CVISN program in June 2011 and plans to award fiscal  year 2012 CVISN grants. FMCSA awarded $17 million in grants in fiscal  year 2011 to states that the agency determined had not previously  received an improper CVISN grant award.", "In May 2011, we reported on a number of internal control weaknesses  that contributed to CVISN award violations including: problems with  grants management policies and procedures, such as an erroneous  internal policy FMCSA issued that provided incorrect guidance regarding  the extent to which states were available to receive certain CVISN funds,  as well as a lack of written policies and procedures; a failure to track  CVISN grants awarded by the Federal Highway Administration, which  managed CVISN before FMCSA, statutory cap violations for CVISN awards; insufficient FMCSA oversight  over the CVISN program, including the lack of legal review by FMCSA\u2019s  Office of the Chief Counsel to ensure that all awards complied with  relevant laws; and a lack of training provided to FMCSA staff on how to  manage the CVISN program. We did not make any recommendations at  that time, pending completion of this broader review of FMCSA\u2019s grant  awards.", "The Federal Highway Administration also administered the MCSAP Basic and Incentive  and High Priority, PRISM, and the Commercial Drivers License Program Improvement  grant programs prior to FMCSA.", "Grants management is a key function at NHTSA and EPA\u2014two agencies  that, similarly to FMCSA, devote approximately one-half of their budgets  to grants. EPA manages its grants through a single centralized office,  while NHTSA manages its grants through two different offices\u2014one for  formula grants and one for discretionary grants. EPA\u2019s mission is to  protect human health and the environment, and it devotes about half of its  budget to provide formula and discretionary grants to support this  mission. These grant programs support a variety of efforts, including  those that further the health of people and the environment. EPA\u2019s Office  of Grants and Debarment (OGD) provides centralized grants  management support, which includes general oversight of award  competitions for discretionary grants and the development of uniform  grants management policies and procedures for all of EPA\u2019s grant  programs. Each of EPA\u2019s 10 regional offices also has a grants  management office that provides its region with grants management  support. NHTSA\u2019s primary mission, similar to FMCSA\u2019s, is to save lives,  prevent injuries, and reduce the costs of motor vehicle traffic and crashes.  NHTSA uses its grant programs, totaling about $744 million in fiscal year  2010, to help support that mission.

Specifically, each grant program was managed independently by  a grant program manager, which decentralized oversight of policies and  procedures for those grant programs. FMCSA reported that its grants  were also managed through its 52 division offices and 4 service centers  throughout the country, which created inconsistencies as employees  performed multiple tasks and roles. As a result, FMCSA management  could not be sure that grant programs were being managed consistently  and in line with a single agency policy. In addition, grants management  staff told us that FMCSA did not provide adequate grants management  training to staff as it did not require any of its grant program management  staff to complete formal grants management training. Our internal control  standards state that training should be aimed at developing and retaining  needed employee skills. Staff received grants management training  informally through on-the-job training, some external training, and FMCSA  conferences, which did not specifically focus on grants management  training. While some grant managers said they received grants  management training from an external training provider, this training was  not focused on managing FMCSA grants, and attendance was not  required by FMCSA. Similarly, FMCSA\u2019s 2007 internal control evaluation  reported that FMCSA grants management staff were not equipped with  formal grants management training and recommended that FMCSA  establish a team tasked with creating a formal grants management  training program.

Our standards for internal control  call for federal agencies to document their policies and procedures, which  help managers exercise control over agency activities, including activities  undertaken to manage and administer programs such as grant programs  and help ensure that management directives are conveyed to staff and  carried out. FMCSA released a Financial Management and Processing  Manual for Grant Programs in 2006 that focused on administrative  functions related to processing grant transactions; however, it did not  focus on broader grants management policies and procedures such as  how to review applications and make award determinations, which would  be critical for employees to properly carry out these activities. FMSCA did  create some documented policies and procedures related to managing  grant awards, though they were limited in scope and did not apply to all  grant programs. For example, while FMCSA staff created policy memos  that detailed some required policies and procedures, such as retaining  grant award documents, these memos were created only for the MCSAP  program. According to FMCSA officials, these memos were created and  provided to staff generally on an as-needed basis\u2014for example, when  staff had questions about specific issues. In general, grants managers for  a majority of FMCSA\u2019s grant programs told us that they received minimal  direction on grants management policies and procedures from FMCSA. In  terms of employees\u2019 roles and responsibilities, FMCSA documented  these in program managers\u2019 performance plans and evaluated relevant  staff through the agency\u2019s performance management system on their  performance in meeting stated performance grants management  expectations. However, FMCSA did not document roles and  responsibilities details in one centralized document, for instance into  existing grant related policies and procedures. As a result, grants  management staff did not have access to a single set of comprehensive  documented policies and procedures to guide them in awarding and  managing FMCSA grants, and FMCSA management could not have  reasonable assurance that applicable laws and FMCSA policies were  followed.", "In addition, as was the case with CVISN grants,grants management staff, prior to fiscal year 2010, FMCSA did not  require and conduct a formal legal review of every grant award to ensure  that awards adhered to laws and regulations. According to our internal  control standards, transactions, such as grant awards, should be properly  authorized and made in compliance with laws and regulations. FMCSA  grants management officials told us that legal staff involvement in grant  award review was limited to answering questions and providing support  on issues such as whether grant recipients would be providing required  matching funds. The absence of a required legal review to ensure  compliance increases the risk that other FMCSA awards may have  violated laws or regulations, as was the case with certain CVISN awards.", "Finally, FMCSA had not conducted a strategic workforce assessment to  determine the skills and staffing levels needed to manage its grants  programs.

However, while FMCSA directed  grants management staff to use EDMS for grant files beginning in 2006,  some staff told us that FMCSA did not specify which grant award  documents should be saved in EDMS or in hard copy files. An internal  control evaluation also found that FMCSA\u2019s grant documentation was not  stored consistently in EDMS. The inconsistent use of FMCSA\u2019s EDMS  system to maintain grant documentation increases the risk that FMCSA  management may not have had needed electronic access to grant  documentation, such as grant applications and supporting documentation,  when making grant award decisions, which could have contributed to  poor decision making and award irregularities.", "In addition to issues related to the maintenance of grant documentation,  according to FMCSA staff, the communication of information from  management to grants management staff and among grants  management staff was ad hoc and informal prior to fiscal year 2010,  providing limited assurance that grants management information was  adequately disseminated to staff in a timely manner. FMCSA did not have  a communications plan to guide the methods through which certain types  of information should have been communicated amongst grants  management staff. According to GAO\u2019s internal control standards,  information should be communicated to management and other relevant  agency officials in a timely manner and should be useful, reliable, and  continuous.

The fiscal year 2005 internal  control evaluation led to a corrective action plan calling for FMCSA to  develop a grant program policies and procedures manual and to  implement a centralized grant management oversight function. According  to FMCSA management, FMCSA was able to close out this corrective  action plan by releasing the Financial Management and Processing  Manual for Grant Programs in 2006. However, some FMCSA grants  management staff said that the 2006 manual was narrowly focused and  that FMCSA management did not fully address this finding until the  release of a more complete Grants Management Manual in the beginning  of fiscal year 2010 (October 2009). Furthermore, the fiscal year 2005  review led to a corrective action plan for FMCSA to implement a  centralized grant management oversight function. However, FMCSA did  not first formally propose a centralized function in the form of its proposed  Grants Management Office (GMO) until fiscal year 2010. According to  FMCSA officials, the agency did not address these findings in a more  timely manner because it faced limited resources and wanted to take a  sequential approach to transform its grants management. As a result, the  agency did not want to design and propose the GMO until the foundation  of the Grants Management Manual was in place.

For example, since April 2011, the CFO has been in  charge of establishing policies and procedures, and FMCSA\u2019s Chief  Counsel has been responsible for conducting legal reviews. The GMO  should help reduce the risk of grant award mismanagement by providing  centralized and consistent oversight and reviews of all grant programs  and holding all grant programs and grant managers to the same standard  policies. In addition, according to some FMCSA officials we interviewed,  by assuming administrative grant responsibilities now held by program  staff, the GMO could ease the burden on those programmatic staff so  they could focus on responsibilities related to their subject matter  expertise. As a result, management should be in a better position to help  ensure that grants are managed consistently and in line with policies and  procedures, reducing the risk for award irregularities.", "However, despite the GMO being central to the agency\u2019s grant  management improvements, FMCSA has not conducted a workforce  analysis that could help the agency identify and fill gaps in expertise,  including those that might be needed for the proposed GMO. We have  reported in the past that while the specific approach to strategic workforce  planning varies by individual agencies based on needs and missions,  such strategies should determine the workforce skills and competencies  needed to achieve future results and develop strategies to address gaps  to ensure the agency has the necessary skills and competencies. Such  planning is especially important in times of budget constraints and  organizational change, as FMCSA is undergoing its grants management  transformation. FMCSA officials told us that the agency had considered  conducting a workforce analysis that could systematically assess its  grants management skill and staff needs, and then determine if it has  these skills and staff, and if it does not, how to obtain them. Further,  FMCSA stated in its fiscal year 2011 budget request that it currently does  not employ individuals that are trained in grants management. Yet the  only action FMCSA has taken to assess its workforce was to create a  model to assess the number of staff needed in the field\u2014but not in  headquarters\u2014to meet requirements in grants management, program  delivery, and oversight. According to FMCSA officials, in preparing its  fiscal year 2011 budget request for $399,000 and three full-time  equivalent employees for the GMO, they did more of an anecdotal  assessment to determine GMO staffing needs, for instance noting that the  agency\u2019s current attorneys had too heavy a workload to devote enough  time to reviewing grants and concluding that the agency needed a   FMCSA officials told us that while they are  dedicated grants attorney.considering a strategic workforce analysis for their headquarters grants  management staff, they have not yet done so in part because FMCSA  may not have the resources to fund the staff levels that such an analysis  might recommend. Further, they noted that it would be difficult to  determine workload and staffing needs until they developed,  implemented, and trained staff in new grants management processes.  Until FMCSA conducts a thorough workforce analysis, it will not know if it  has the staff and skills necessary to effectively manage its grant  programs and support the proposed GMO, or if it requires additional  resources as it continues its grants management transformation.", "Officials told us that if FMCSA does not receive funding to support the  GMO, the agency will continue to use existing staff such as the CFO and  an outside contractor to assume many of the intended GMO functions.", "FMCSA reported that these interim changes in staffing responsibilities  create additional risks to the agency\u2019s grants management as they  increase reliance on contractors and delay the agency\u2019s ability to  implement changes that would enhance its employees\u2019 grants  management skills. In other words, in the agency\u2019s opinion this alternate  plan would do less to strengthen FMCSA\u2019s internal controls than would a  GMO, potentially leaving FMCSA\u2019s grant awards at risk of  mismanagement.", "One of the key internal control improvements that FMCSA has made is to  standardize and document its grants management policies and  procedures, in its Grants Management Manual, which were inconsistently  documented prior to 2010. According to FMCSA, the Manual is designed  to \u201cestablish strong internal controls in the form of grant process  standardization and promote greater adherence to policies, processes,  and procedures.\u201d FMCSA first issued the Manual in early fiscal year 2010  and issued an update in January 2011. The Manual provides information  on the roles and responsibilities of grants management staff and  describes the steps in each stage of the grant process\u2014from the grant  announcement, to application review and award, and finally to closeout\u2014 as well as the steps that staff are expected to follow in each stage. In  addition, the Manual publishes grants management staff\u2019s roles and  responsibilities in one place, instead of across individuals\u2019 performance  plans as was customary prior to 2010. Including these descriptions in a  document that all grants management staff have access to helps ensure  that all staff know their and others\u2019 roles and responsibilities, which  should help increase accountability and the likelihood that all staff fulfill  their documented responsibilities. Further, by documenting and setting  consistent policies across all grant programs, the Manual should provide  staff with the information needed to help ensure that grants are managed  and awarded in line with FMCSA policies and with all relevant laws.", "While the Manual strengthens FMCSA\u2019s internal controls, grant program  staff\u2019s roles and responsibilities are still not sufficiently documented. For  example, grants management positions detailed in the Manual include  program manager, for the person in headquarters who manages all  aspects of a specific grant program. However, there is a single list of roles  and responsibilities for staff who manage grants in the field, including field  administrators, service center directors, and state program managers.  FMCSA officials told us that these individuals have different roles in the  field, yet they have a single list of roles and responsibilities. In addition, a  2011 external review of the agency\u2019s grants management found that the  Manual did not clearly describe who has responsibility for managing grant  award documentation or have clear explanations of two steps in the grant  cycle\u2014grant concurrence and approval. FMCSA officials told us that they  believe that the grant concurrence and approval workflow diagrams  displayed in the Manual depict the approval flow and clearly denote each  reviewer in the process. In addition, FMCSA officials said that they  provided more detailed information on these topics through training and  job aids and that the agency intends to provide additional, possibly grant  program specific information in standard operating procedure documents.  However, in that case, details on all programs would not be located in one  central place, and grants management staff might face challenges in  keeping track of and following these various guidance documents. The  review also noted that the Manual does not include a description for the  financial program specialist, an individual who assists with financial  oversight, and that work flow diagrams in the Manual are not clear, which  may confuse staff on certain grants management roles and  responsibilities.", "The Manual also describes a new requirement for all grants to be formally  reviewed by the Office of Chief Counsel prior to award. FMCSA created  checklists\u2014one for each grant program\u2014to guide these legal reviews to  ensure that awards follow all applicable laws and regulations. Required  and standardized legal reviews should reduce the risk that CVISN-type  statutory violations occur in the future by providing a structured legal  framework for attorneys to follow during legal reviews. EPA uses similar  reviews and ensures that review checklists are updated annually to  incorporate any new requirements and laws. Updating these checklists  on a regular basis helps ensure that all relevant laws, regulations, and  requirements are followed when awarding grants.", "FMCSA implemented a new electronic grants management system,  GrantSolutions, to manage the process for all phases of grant awards.  While there have been some challenges in implementing the system,  FMCSA officials noted that requiring all grants management staff to use  the new system for the entire grants process helps ensure that all staff  are following the same standardized policies and procedures and  documenting the same information, which was not necessarily the case  prior to 2010. In addition, the system helps ensure that certain tasks are  completed by building them into the system\u2019s automated workflow. For  example, the Financial Management Office will conduct its financial  review as part of the funding and approval processes in GrantSolutions.", "FMCSA staff began using GrantSolutions to manage grant awards and as  the official repository of grant-related documentation in fiscal year 2011.  Some grant managers we interviewed said that GrantSolutions was  challenging to use, particularly at first. FMCSA officials told us that  because GrantSolutions was developed for the Department of Health and  Human Services, it is not customized for FMCSA\u2019s needs, making it  challenging at times to use. FMCSA officials noted that they are working  with GrantSolutions developers at the Department of Health and Human  Services to customize the system to the extent possible and have had to  supplement training on the system provided by the Department of Health  and Human Services with FMCSA-provided training courses and  materials. However, regardless of the challenges noted by some staff,  FMCSA reported that GrantSolutions will help to ensure that all required  grant documents are saved and stored in the system. Having a single  system in which staff are required to store all relevant grant  documentation will help ensure that documents are located together in  one place when grant managers and other relevant individuals, such as  those who serve on technical review panels, need to review them and  make award decisions based on them.", "FMCSA implemented additional required training for grant managers,  which should help to strengthen its controls over grants management.  FMCSA began training staff on the contents of the Manual in spring 2011  and plans to add more comprehensive 2-day grants management training  in 2012. FMCSA officials told us the agency has contracted with outside  training providers for training it cannot provide itself, including  appropriations law training. FMCSA reported that training will help  grants management staff better understand the FMCSA policies, as well  as the laws and regulations that they should follow when managing grant  awards. This is particularly important in light of the agency\u2019s  Antideficiency Act violations in its CVISN program, which, as mentioned  previously, occurred in part because staff did not fully adhere to the  funding restrictions governing the program. According to FMCSA\u2019s Grants  Management Program Roadmap, staff that attend this new 2-day training  will be required to pass an exam before graduating from the course;  however, FMCSA has not specified what will occur if staff do not pass the  exam.", "Despite the improvements in the curriculum, FMCSA does not have a  system for management to easily track employee training to ensure that  staff complete required training and are continuing to keep their skills and  knowledge up to date. FMCSA currently documents required training in  employees\u2019 individual development plans. Separately, FMCSA\u2019s  electronic training system lists courses and the names of staff who have  completed them. According to FMCSA officials, the training system does   so it cannot  not contain information from individual development plans, identify employees who have not taken certain training courses. As such,  FMCSA relies on, but does not require, supervisors to monitor staff  training. Supervisors keep track of which employees have not completed  required training by cross-referencing the requirements in the individual\u2019s  development plan and the names of those who completed the  requirements in the training system. Since the information is not all in one  location, management may not know if staff fail to complete required  training. The absence of a formal, centralized mechanism for tracking  staff training increases the risk that a staff\u2019s failure to take a required  course could go undetected, increasing the risk that staff do not have the  knowledge needed to appropriately manage grant awards.", "In contrast, though EPA also requires regular training for grants  management staff, it uses a system that identifies staff who have not  taken required training, which allows management to contact those  individuals to ensure that they complete it. EPA also ensures its grants  management staff complete required training by limiting access to the  agency\u2019s grants management system\u2014a system staff need to perform  their job functions\u2014to only those staff that have completed the training  required to become certified grant project officers. Grant project officers  who do not take required training are unable to process grant awards.  Moreover, staff must take a refresher course to maintain their certification  every 3 years. Finally, EPA reviews its training periodically to identify new  regulations or other information that grant management staff need to  know and incorporates it into the training. NHTSA also has required  training for grants management staff, including required refresher training  every 2 years for managers of discretionary grants. NHTSA discretionary  grants managers are required by OMB to take \u201cContracting Officer\u2019s  Technical Representative\u201d training.", "FMCSA has improved its methods for communicating grants  management information to staff and has created a communications plan  to guide grants management communications. FMCSA hired contractors  to implement SharePoint, a Web-based system developed by Microsoft,  and began using it in October 2010. FMCSA uses SharePoint to share  and disseminate grants management and other documents to internal  staff. Currently, most of SharePoint is dedicated to the contents of the  Manual, though FMCSA also uses it for grants management \u201cfrequently  asked questions\u201d and forums. Second, FMCSA set up e-mail groups for  job categories, including grant Program Managers and Division  Administrators, to help ensure that it can target communications to  specific groups. Whereas, prior to 2010, FMCSA management in  headquarters relied on Division Administrators to pass communications  on to other field staff, management can now communicate directly with  their intended recipients, thus increasing the likelihood that grant  management staff receive the information management intended them to  receive. Finally, in contrast to the ad hoc communications FMCSA relied  on prior to fiscal year 2010, FMCSA created a communications plan in  2011 that outlines a strategy for communicating with stakeholders during  its grants management transformation. A communication strategy is  essential to an organization undergoing significant change, like FMCSA,  which is transforming its grants management program. A communication  strategy helps ensure consistency of message, encourages two-way  communication, provides information to meet specific needs of  employees, and facilitates more frequent communication. While  FMCSA\u2019s strategy lacks some details\u2014for example, specific information  on the types of messages that will be communicated to staff\u2014 the agency  noted that its communication plan is sufficient at this time and will  continue to evolve as it identifies additional communication needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Actions Could Help Ensure Continued Grants Management Improvements", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA has begun to initiate a number of improvements to internal  controls over its grants management that should help reduce the risk for  grant award irregularities and mismanagement, but there are additional  challenges that could impact the agency\u2019s ability to continue to  successfully transform its grants management. When undergoing such  transformations, we have reported that it is important for agencies to  undertake certain practices like (1) establishing a coherent mission  guiding the transformation, (2) involving employees in the transformation,  (3) establishing a communication strategy to report progress, (4) ensuring  that agency leadership drives transformational change, and (5)  establishing results-oriented goals and a strategy and timeline for tracking  performance towards achieving them.", "FMCSA\u2019s ongoing initiatives reflect the agency\u2019s progress in  implementing the first three of these practices, but it is unclear if the  agency will be able to make progress in the other two\u2014ensuring it has  appropriate leadership and establishing goals to measure its progress.  For example, the Grants Management Program Roadmap, previously  described, provides a coherent framework and mission guiding FMCSA\u2019s  grants management transformation. In addition, FMCSA employees were  involved in developing both the Roadmap and the Manual and, as we  previously noted, although its scope is limited, FMCSA created a  communication plan. However, it is unclear if the agency will have  sufficient leadership to drive this transformation in the future, as it may not  receive funding for its centralized GMO in fiscal year 2012, and its CFO,  who oversaw many of the new grants management initiatives and was  designated as the individual to whom the GMO would report if it is  created, left the agency in August of this year. We have previously  reported that top leadership must set the direction, pace, and tone for  agency transformation. It is important for FMCSA\u2019s next CFO to continue to provide such leadership given that officer\u2019s role in grants  management.", "Further, FMCSA has not set metrics to measure its performance in  meeting grants management goals. While the Grants Management  Program Roadmap includes milestones, they are for implementation  steps only, such as dates by which FMCSA will roll out grants  management training. Performance metrics could help FMCSA identify  the extent to which the changes it is making contribute to reducing the  risk for financial or management mistakes. This information, in turn, could  help inform FMCSA\u2019s decisions about which actions to continue and  which need to be modified or discontinued. This information could also  help FMCSA demonstrate to Congress that, despite its past violations, it  is committed to improving its grants management. EPA\u2019s grants  management plan, for example, includes a system for monitoring the  implementation of its grants management changes and evaluating the   For instance,  extent to which they meet certain performance targets.one of the grants management goals under the plan is to \u201cenhance the  management process for grants policies and procedures,\u201d and one of the  performance targets it will use to track its progress toward meeting this  goal is to \u201coffer training on 100% of new and revised policies at least 4  weeks before required implementation.\u201d In this way, EPA can measure its  performance and progress in meeting grants management goals and  determine additional improvements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government and state governments are experiencing severe  budgetary constraints, consequently it is essential that the federal  government increase its attention to how federal grant funds are awarded  and spent. FMCSA relies on states to deliver a number of motor carrier  safety grant programs, and many states rely on FMCSA grant funds to  help deliver these critical programs. In 2011, DOT determined that it had  violated federal appropriations statutes, including the Antideficiency Actin awarding some CVISN grants from fiscal years 2006 to 2010. While  these violations were specific to the CVISN program, some of the internal  control weaknesses that contributed to those violations existed across  FMCSA\u2019s additional nine grant programs.", "FMCSA\u2019s recent grants management initiatives, such as the Grants  Management Manual and grants management training, appear to be  positive steps in addressing internal control weaknesses that were  prevalent in FMCSA\u2019s grant programs prior to fiscal year 2010, including  those found to have contributed to statutory violations pertaining to  CVISN awards. However, many of the initiatives are relatively new, and it  is too soon to tell whether they will ultimately be successful in addressing  internal control weaknesses. In particular, while FMCSA plans to staff a  centralized Grants Management Office\u2014an important component of its  grants management transformation\u2014the agency has yet to conduct a  strategic analysis of its grants management workforce needs including  resources needed for this office. For the initiatives that FMCSA has  implemented, additional improvements could help ensure their success.  For example, adding information to the Grants Management Manual on  staff roles and responsibilities and adequately tracking required training  will ensure grants management staff are equipped to effectively manage  grant awards. Finally, setting goals and measures and tracking progress  toward meeting those goals can help ensure that the agency continues to  head in the right direction in its grants management transformation.  Without implementing some of these additional efforts, FMCSA\u2019s grants  management initiatives could fall short of their objective to achieve  effective internal controls, and the agency\u2019s grant awards will continue to  be at risk of financial irregularities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the importance of FMCSA\u2019s grants programs in helping meet the  agency\u2019s goals, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation  direct the FMCSA Administrator to take the following four actions:  In order to better determine its staffing and skill needs for grants  management, conduct a strategic grants management workforce  planning evaluation, including an analysis of the needed staff  resources for the proposed GMO.", "To further improve grants management policies and procedures, add  details regarding staff roles and responsibilities in the Grants  Management Manual so that grants management staff are  appropriately informed to manage each program.", "To improve its tracking of grants management training, work with the  appropriate DOT individuals to modify its training system to allow  management to easily determine which staff have taken required  training.", "In order to track the progress of its grants management  transformation, create a series of measurable grants management  goals and objectives and timelines for completing them, as well as a  series of metrics to measure progress in meeting these goals.

As such, we modified the  language in our report to recommend that FMCSA work with appropriate  individuals at DOT to modify the training system. Second, our draft  recommendation that FMCSA create grants management goals and  objectives and report to Congress on their progress in meeting them  stated that FMCSA should report to Congress annually. In response,  FMCSA officials noted that the agency already updates Congress on its  programs regularly and that an annual report on its grants management  goals would be administratively burdensome.

In addition, we reviewed GAO\u2019s prior  work on FMCSA\u2019s Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and  Networks (CVISN) grant program to determine internal control  weaknesses that contributed to financial irregularities with CVISN grant  awards. We interviewed the grant program manager for each program  other than CVISN prior to fiscal year 2010 to discuss how each grant  program was managed at that time and the internal controls that were in  place over the grant programs. We did not include CVISN in this review  given the work we had already conducted on that grant program. We  collected and analyzed relevant documentation, such as grant policy  memos, related to internal controls over grants. We also interviewed  FMCSA headquarters officials, including the Chief Financial Officer  (CFO), regarding internal controls.", "We also interviewed FMCSA officials and FMCSA grant recipients from  four states\u2014Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, and Wisconsin. We selected  these four states because they were among those identified by FMCSA  as having received irregular CVISN awards and also received a number  of non-CVISN grant awards, which allowed us to interview fiscal year  2011 recipients of all of FMCSA\u2019s grant programs, aside from the  Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training Grant. We  determined that not including interviewing any recipients of this grant was  acceptable given its small size (a total of $1 million in awards) and that  recipients are generally private training providers and educational  institutions as opposed to state government agencies, which are the  primary recipients of FMCSA\u2019s other grants. In each state we interviewed  key grants management FMCSA staff at the Division Office\u2014primarily  Division Administrators and State Program Specialists\u2014regarding their  role in managing FMCSA grants as well as internal controls that were in  place for managing those grants prior to fiscal year 2010. We also  interviewed recipients of each grant in each state regarding their  experiences with receiving FMCSA grants and of FMCSA\u2019s management  of making grant awards.", "Finally, we reviewed audits related to internal controls and grants  management, including grants management internal control evaluations  and corrective action plans for FMCSA for fiscal years 2007 through 2010  and two audits conducted by an outside auditor (Deloitte) following the  discovery by FMCSA of irregular CVISN awards to review findings made  by other audits regarding grants management internal control  weaknesses at FMCSA prior to fiscal year 2010.
