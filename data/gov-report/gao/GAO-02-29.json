Auditors for 19 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported that their agencies' financial management systems did not comply substantially with FFMIA requirements, compared to 21 agencies reported as not being substantially compliant for 1999. The auditors for five CFO Act agencies reported no instances in which the agencies' systems did not substantially comply with FFMIA. These auditors, however, did not definitively state whether the agencies' financial management systems substantially complied with FFMIA.

One  of the key legislative underpinnings for addressing this issue is the Chief  Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990.

FFMIA  also requires auditors to report in their CFO Act financial statement audit  reports whether the agencies\u2019 financial management systems comply with  FFMIA\u2019s requirements.  We are required to report annually on the  implementation of the act.

Issued  pursuant to FIA, the Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government provide the standards that are directed at  helping agency managers implement effective internal control, an integral  part of improving financial management systems.", "Effective internal control also helps in managing change to cope with  shifting environments and evolving demands and priorities.  As programs  change and as agencies strive to improve operational processes and  implement new technological developments, management must  continually assess and evaluate its internal control to ensure that the  control activities being used are effective and updated when necessary.   While agencies had achieved some success in identifying and correcting  material internal control and accounting system weaknesses, their efforts  to implement the FIA had not produced the results intended by the  Congress.", "Therefore, in the 1990s, the Congress passed additional management  reform legislation to improve the general and financial management of the  federal government.

Administrative systems  include those generally common to all federal agency operations such as  budget, acquisition, travel, property, and payroll.  Agencies implement  programmatic systems as needed to fulfill the agency\u2019s mission, such as  inventory, grants, insurance and benefit payments, and loans.  For example,  SSA would need a benefit payment system to fulfill its mission of providing  social security and disability payments to the elderly and disabled.   However, SSA would not need to implement a loan system since it does not  process loans.

Importantly, financial  management systems reform is a part of one of the five governmentwide  initiatives in the President\u2019s Management Agenda.", "Agencies continue to make progress in addressing their financial  management system weaknesses.  At the same time, they have a long way  to go.  The vast majority of these agencies are still not substantially  complying with FFMIA\u2019s requirements.  Auditors for 19 of the 24 CFO Act  agencies reported that for fiscal year 2000, the agencies\u2019 systems did not  comply substantially with one or more FFMIA requirements\u2014federal  systems requirements, federal accounting standards, or the SGL.", "For fiscal year 2000, 7 agencies were reported not to be in substantial  compliance with all 3 FFMIA requirements; 18 were reported not in  substantial compliance with systems requirements; 12 were reported not in  substantial compliance with accounting standards; and 8 were reported not  in substantial compliance with the SGL.  Auditors for five agencies\u2014the  Department of Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Small Business  Administration (SBA), and the General Services Administration (GSA)\u2014 reported that the results of tests disclosed no instances in which the  agencies\u2019 systems did not substantially comply with the three requirements  of FFMIA.  By reporting negative assurance, which is the form of reporting  called for in OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, these auditors are not saying that the  systems are in substantial compliance, but that the results of their tests  disclosed no instances in which the agencies\u2019 systems did not substantially  comply with FFMIA.  We discuss this issue further in this report.  Figure 3  summarizes the auditors\u2019 FFMIA determinations for fiscal year 2000.", "Eighteen of the 24 CFO Act agencies received unqualified audit opinions on  their financial statements for fiscal year 2000, up from 15 in fiscal year  1999, 12 in fiscal year 1998, and 6 in fiscal year 1997.  This represents steady  progress and a lot of hard work by the agency CFOs and their staffs, OMB,  Treasury, and the audit community.", "At the same time, auditors for 13 of the 18 agencies that received  unqualified opinions reported that the agencies\u2019 financial systems did not  comply substantially with FFMIA\u2019s requirements in fiscal year 2000.  In  many instances, agencies have been able to obtain unqualified audit  opinions only through extensive labor-intensive efforts, which include  expending significant resources to use extensive ad hoc procedures, and  making billions of dollars in adjustments to derive financial statements.   This is usually the case when agencies have inadequate systems that are  not integrated and routinely reconciled.  The President\u2019s Management  Agenda calls these efforts \u201cextraordinary, labor-intensive assaults on  financial records.\u201d  These time-consuming procedures must be combined  with sustained efforts to improve agencies\u2019 underlying financial  management systems and controls. If agencies continue year after year to  rely on significant costly and time-intensive manual efforts to achieve or  maintain unqualified opinions, it can serve to mislead the public as to the  true status of agencies\u2019 financial management capabilities.  In such a case,  an unqualified opinion would become an accomplishment without much  substance.", "Although the CFO Act agencies face challenges, some formidable, in  preparing financial statements, all issued their financial statements on  time.  In a prior report, we recommended that OMB work with the  agencies to ensure that the agencies\u2019 financial statements are audited and  issued by the March 1 statutory deadline.  For fiscal year 2000, all 24 of the  CFO Act agencies met the March 1 statutory due date, 5 months after the  end of the fiscal year.  In comparison, in fiscal year 1999, 5 of the 24 CFO  Act agencies issued their audited statements after the statutory due date.   Going forward, we anticipate the timeframes becoming tighter and  reporting requirements earlier, which will intensify the need to overhaul  the financial management systems.  The Director of OMB and the Secretary  of the Treasury have indicated that more timely and more frequent financial  statement reporting will be an objective to help improve financial  management.  As a first step, OMB recently proposed that agencies prepare  and issue unaudited interim financial statements starting with the 6-month  period ending March 31, 2002, and submit these statements to OMB by May  31, 2002.  Beginning with fiscal year 2003, OMB will require agencies to  prepare and submit unaudited interim financial statements on a quarterly  basis.  Also, for fiscal year 2002, OMB has moved the reporting date from  March 1 to February 1.   We support these actions by OMB.", "Financial statement audit results are key indicators of the quality of agency  financial data at year-end and provide an annual public scorecard on  accountability.  While the increase in the number of agencies that are  receiving unqualified audit opinions is noteworthy, it is only one of three  indicators of the quality of financial management information.  Having  effective internal controls to help managers better achieve agencies\u2019  missions and program results and minimize operational problems along  with financial management systems that routinely generate reliable, useful,  and timely information are also key indicators of the quality of an agency\u2019s  financial management information.  As shown in figure 4, fully integrated  financial systems, reliable and timely financial statements, and effective  internal control serve as indicators for an entity\u2019s financial management  health.", "A clean audit opinion alone only provides credibility to an agency\u2019s  financial statements as of the date of the financial statements\u2014the last day  of the fiscal year.  It provides no assurance about the effectiveness or  efficiency of financial systems used to prepare the statements, the quality  of internal control, or whether the systems can produce reliable data for  decision-making purposes on demand throughout the year.", "For example, the Department of the Treasury received its first unqualified  opinion on its fiscal year 2000 departmentwide financial statements.   However, like several other agencies, despite the unqualified opinion,  Treasury\u2019s IG reported that Treasury\u2019s systems did not comply substantially  with FFMIA.  For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) continues  to face most of the pervasive systems and internal control weaknesses that  we have reported each year since we began auditing IRS\u2019 financial  statements in fiscal year 1992.", "As discussed in our report on the IRS fiscal year 2000 financial  statements, IRS\u2019 unqualified opinion was the culmination of 2 years of  extraordinary efforts on the part of IRS senior management and staff to  develop compensating processes to work around its serious systems and  control weaknesses to derive year-end balances for its financial statements.   Top management at IRS and its staff are to be applauded for their  dedication that resulted in an unqualified opinion.  While IRS\u2019 efforts did  address several management issues we raised in previous audits, its  approach to obtaining an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2000  financial statements relied heavily on costly, time-consuming, and labor- intensive efforts, including the need for statistical projections, external  contractor support, substantial adjustments, and monumental human  efforts that extended well after the fiscal year-end.  This was particularly  the case for reporting amounts for both tax receivables and property and  equipment.", "Because IRS\u2019 systems cannot accurately track amounts representing taxes  receivable, IRS has for the past 4 years employed a complex statistical  sampling process to derive the balance reported on its financial statements;  this process takes months to complete, requires extensive human and  financial resources, and results in tens of billions of dollars in adjustments  annually to present a balance that is good for one day only.  Additionally,  because IRS does not have an adequate property management system, it  had to use contractors to (1) perform statistical sampling procedures to  derive a reliable balance for property and equipment in fiscal year 1999;  and (2) analyze fiscal year 2000 transactions to derive the September 30,  2000, balance for property and equipment, a process that extended into  February 2001.", "Situations such as those at IRS demonstrate the tremendous efforts many  agencies make to produce auditable annual financial statements.  These  agencies undertake far more work to prepare financial statements than  would be necessary if they had basic financial systems in place to routinely  provide both the data for financial statements and management  information.   The financial statement preparation and audit process puts a  tremendous strain on the staff of the CFO and the auditors and diverts  resources from correcting the underlying problems.  To quote the Secretary  of the Treasury, \u201cit takes the federal government 5 months to close our  books\u2026This is not the stuff of excellence.\u201d", "As we discuss below, one of the main problems agencies face is the lack of  an integrated financial management system.  Having an effective,  integrated financial management system that can produce financial  information in a timely manner minimizes the need for time-consuming and  costly procedures to prepare financial statements and, most importantly,  provides the information needed to manage on an ongoing basis.  To  remedy their problems, agencies are in the process of either implementing  new core financial systems or upgrading their current systems to lay the  foundation for compliance with FFMIA.", "In this regard, by far DOD faces the most complex and difficult challenges  of any agency.  Today, DOD relies on an overly complex and error prone  network of systems that are not integrated.  Millions of transactions must  be manually keyed and rekeyed into the vast number of systems involved in  any given DOD business process.  Weak systems and controls leave DOD  vulnerable to fraud and improper payments.  In addition, as we recently  testified, lacking an effective network of systems and the related inability  to obtain reliable cost and budget information severely constrains DOD\u2019s  ability to maintain adequate funds control, measure performance, reduce  costs, and maintain effective accountability over its estimated $1 trillion  investment in weapon systems and inventories.  Because of the  unparalleled size and complexity of DOD\u2019s operations along with the  serious, deeply entrenched nature of its financial management system  deficiencies, it will not be possible to fully implement an integrated system  structure overnight.  Such a dramatic transformation will require a  sustained effort over a number of years.  As discussed later in this report,  the Secretary of Defense and the DOD Comptroller have stated that priority  will be given to financial management reform.", "Other agencies such as the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, and  Education, SBA, GSA, and AID are planning or are in the process of  implementing new systems.  And yet others, such as NASA, have failed in  recent attempts to successfully implement new systems, and are starting  over.  One thing that stands out though is that across the board, agencies  have recognized their shortcomings and assisted by OMB and with input  from the audit community are working to modernize their financial  management systems and processes.", "In addition, several agencies have made progress in other areas aimed at  improving their financial management systems.  For example, in fiscal year  2000, the Department of Agriculture IG reported the establishment of a  Senior Executives group to develop a corporate strategy, including a  budget and timeframes, for administrative and financial system changes to  the agency\u2019s various systems.  According to Agriculture officials, this was a  clear sign that senior level executives for the department were  acknowledging that there was a need to develop overall agency financial  systems rather than continue to rely on multiple stand-alone subsystems.   In another instance, auditors for the Department of Education reported  that the agency made progress in strengthening controls over IT processes.   The auditors also reported that the implementation of new controls and the  reinforcement of existing controls increased the effectiveness of internal  controls in areas such as IT planning and security management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of fiscal year 2000 audit reports for the 19 agencies\u2019  systems that were reported to be substantially noncompliant with FFMIA,  we identified 6 primary reasons either cited by the auditors or identified in  our structured interviews with agency officials as to why their systems  were noncompliant:  lack of integrated financial management systems,  inadequate reconciliation procedures,  lack of accurate and timely recording of financial information,  noncompliance with the SGL,  lack of adherence to federal accounting standards and/or OMB   weak security controls over information systems.", "Figure 5 shows the relative frequency of these problems at the 19 agencies  with noncompliant systems and the problems relevant to FFMIA that were  reported by their auditors or obtained through interviews with agency  officials.  Auditors reported these problems among the weaknesses  identified during the audits; however, the auditors may not have reported  the problems as specific reasons for why they concluded that the agencies\u2019  systems did not substantially comply with FFMIA.  We included all  weaknesses relevant to FFMIA identified by the auditors because such  problems must be resolved in order for the agencies\u2019 systems to generate  the reliable, useful, and timely information needed for decision-making.

In this regard, OMB  Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, requires agencies to  establish and maintain an integrated financial management system that  conforms with JFMIP\u2019s functional requirements.", "An integrated financial system coordinates a number of functions to  improve overall efficiency and control.  When agencies do not have an  integrated financial management system\u2014which includes administrative  and program systems that maintain financial information, such as  budgeting, logistics, personnel, acquisition, and property systems\u2014they  are often forced to rely on ad hoc programming, analysis, or actions such as  duplicative transaction entries.  In these situations, agencies must expend  major efforts and resources to generate financial information that their  systems should be able to provide on a daily or recurring basis.", "The lack of integrated financial systems is a continuing serious problem for  most agencies. Based on discussions with agency officials at the 19  agencies that were reported to be noncompliant with FFMIA, lack of an  integrated system and adequate funding to replace old systems were key  obstacles in achieving compliance with FFMIA.  Some agencies rely heavily  on external consultants to develop financial information. The results of our  work showed that 13 of the 24 CFO Act agencies used the assistance of  contractors in preparing their financial statements because their systems  were not able to produce this information. Many of these officials agree  that a key to improving financial management and complying with FFMIA  is to have an integrated financial system that provides reliable, useful, and  timely information that managers can use for day-to-day operations.   However, according to these officials, to upgrade or replace existing  systems requires funding and a strong commitment from management,  which many of them said they did not have in the past.  In this regard, the  President\u2019s Management Agenda makes clear the commitment of the  President to ensure that federal financial systems produce accurate and  timely information.", "As shown in figure 5, auditors for 13 of the 19 agencies with noncompliant  systems reported lack of integrated systems as a problem.  To illustrate, VA  achieved an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2000 consolidated  financial statements, but to do so required a significant amount of  resources and manual processes.  Auditors for VA noted continued  difficulties related to the preparation, processing, and analysis of financial  information to support the preparation of VA\u2019s consolidated financial  statements.

The  reported estimates of improper payments across the government totaled  approximately $20 billion for both fiscal years 2000 and 1999.

Among other things, there were discrepancies  between the data in NIH\u2019s management, payment, and accounting systems.   These discrepancies affected the accuracy of grant award amounts.  These  system deficiencies could result in NIH\u2019s erroneously awarding grants to  ineligible grant receipts and in funds being used for improper purposes.  If  these systems were integrated, NIH would have fewer discrepancies in its  data and would need to devote substantially less effort to assuring that the  data across those three functions were consistent.  According to HHS  officials, NIH has implemented compensating controls to address these  systems deficiencies.  Moreover, system deficiencies are also a factor for  DOD.

Our  sense is that today few agencies may have good cost accounting  information. The seven agencies\u2019 systems that were reported by their  auditors as noncompliant with the cost accounting standard are not able to  provide timely full cost accounting information and at best can only  provide this information at the end of the fiscal year through periodic cost  surveys or other cost finding techniques.  The lack of timely cost  information seriously impinges the capacity to make informed managerial  decisions on a daily basis, precludes meaningful and timely reporting on  performance measures, and could result in project cost overruns and  program inefficiencies.  Performance information is necessary to  determine the value of government programs and their success in achieving  their goals.  Further, the move to implementation of performance-based  budgeting highlights the need for cost accounting information at the  program level.

This guidance requires auditors to plan and perform their audit  work in sufficient detail to enable them to determine the degree of  compliance and report on instances of noncompliance for all of the  applicable FFMIA requirements.  We agree with this objective.  The  guidance describes specific minimum requirements that agency systems  must meet to achieve compliance and provides indicators of compliance.  The FFMIA implementation guidance also indicates that auditors should  report on FFMIA compliance as part of the financial statement audit  process based upon OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, Audit Requirements for  Federal Financial Statements.  OMB Bulletin No. 01-02 states that auditors  shall perform tests of the entity\u2019s compliance with FFMIA.", "In providing guidance on reporting on substantial compliance with FFMIA,  OMB Bulletin No. 01-02 states that auditors should report that \u201cthe results  of our tests disclosed no instances in which the agency\u2019s financial  management systems did not substantially comply\u201d .  In  contrast, FFMIA requires the auditors to \u201c\u2026report whether the agency  financial management systems comply with the requirements of .\u201d   This is an important distinction because under auditing standards the  terminology \u201cdisclosed no instances\u201d means that the auditor is providing  negative assurance.   Under generally accepted government auditing  standards, only limited incidental testing is necessary for an auditor to give  negative assurance.  However, to \u201creport whether,\u201d or to provide positive  assurance, auditors need to perform sufficient testing to draw a conclusion.   Auditors for the five agencies that were not reported to be noncompliant  with FFMIA provided negative assurance in accordance with OMB  guidance.  If the readers of the report do not understand this distinction,  they may have a false impression that the systems have been reported to be  substantially compliant by the auditors.", "Today for most agencies, because their systems deficiencies are well  known and well documented and based on other audit work the auditor  may have performed outside of the financial statement audit, the auditor  may have sufficient knowledge to conclude that an agency is not in  substantial compliance with FFMIA without performing additional testing  beyond that needed for the financial statement audit opinion.  The auditors  for the 19 agencies that reported agencies\u2019 systems to be noncompliant  with FFMIA for fiscal year 2000 told us they relied on knowledge obtained  from prior years\u2019 audits or the internal control and compliance with laws  and regulation testing performed during the current year financial  statement audits.", "However, to provide positive assurance when assessing substantial  compliance with FFMIA requirements, sufficient testing is needed. Some of  the promising audit procedures noted during our review included the use of  detailed audit programs and an assessment of financial systems\u2019  functionality.  For example, auditors for 7 of the 24 agencies\u2014the  Department of Energy, AID, NSF, EPA, HUD, NRC, and OPM\u2014designed  and used separate FFMIA audit programs to test for compliance. Other  procedures that auditors could perform to provide positive assurance when  assessing compliance with FFMIA include using the GAO and JFMIP  checklists that were developed as assessment tools.  For example, the  auditors for NRC used the GAO checklist to determine systems\u2019  compliance with JFMIP systems requirements, while the auditors for the  Department of Labor used the JFMIP checklist to determine the agency\u2019s  core financial system\u2019s compliance with FFMIA.  For both agencies, the  auditor reported that the agency systems were not compliant with FFMIA.", "GAO and the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE)  recently issued a joint Financial Audit Manual (GAO/PCIE FAM).  This  manual provides the methodology for performing financial statement  audits of federal entities.  Section 350 of this manual describes the  procedures auditors should follow in determining the nature, timing, and  extent of control tests and of tests for systems\u2019 compliance with FFMIA  requirements.   Specifically, the manual states that the auditor should use  any management-provided documentation of the work that management  did for its assertion about the systems\u2019 conformance with the agency\u2019s  annual Financial Integrity Act report and any work management may have  done for FFMIA as a basis for determining the nature and extent of audit  work needed.  Management\u2019s role is important and the comprehensive  nature of its determination as to whether it is in substantial compliance is  important in the audit process.", "For example, if management provides the auditor with a checklist detailing  the functions the systems are able to perform, the auditor generally should  select some significant functions from the checklist and determine whether  the systems perform them.  Overlap exists between testing for FFMIA  compliance and testing internal controls.  The GAO/PCIE FAM cites a  number of techniques, such as observation, inspection, and walkthroughs  that the auditor can employ when performing this work.  Further, to  achieve maximum efficiency, these tests for FFMIA compliance generally  should be done concurrently with other nonsampling control tests.", "The nature of FFMIA will always require a certain degree of judgement on  the part of auditors and management.  OMB's revised implementation  guidance provides examples for auditors and management to consider  when assessing compliance with FFMIA.  For example, the guidance states  that an agency\u2019s systems are substantially compliant with FFMIA, if they  can, (1) prepare financial statements and other required financial and  budget reports using information generated by the financial management  systems; (2) provide reliable and timely financial information for managing  current operations; (3) account for their assets reliably, so that they are  properly protected from loss, misappropriation, or destruction; and (4) do  all of the above in a way that is consistent with the federal accounting  standards and the SGL.  Nonetheless, auditors for 10 agencies and financial  management officials at 4 agencies told us that they encountered problems  in interpreting the guidance including OMB\u2019s definition of \u201csubstantial  compliance.\u201d  FFMIA states that agencies\u2019 financial management systems  should \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the systems\u2019 requirements, accounting  standards, and SGL requirements but does not elaborate on the meaning of  \u201ccomply substantially.\u201d Some in the CFO and audit communities believe  that without further guidance, the interpretation and application of the  guidance will likely remain inconsistent throughout the federal  government.", "Auditors for seven agencies told us that, in their view, OMB\u2019s January 2001  revised guidance appeared to lower the threshold for determining  compliance with FFMIA, providing more agencies an opportunity to  become compliant with FFMIA.  For example, the auditor for one agency  believes that the revised guidance is too subjective, while the auditor for  another agency told us that the guidance eliminated specific systems  requirements.  Further, officials at one agency told us that they believed the  change in the guidance related to the systems security indicators lowered  the threshold.  In fact, according to the auditors and agency officials for  this same agency, the change in OMB\u2019s revised guidance, which was  retroactive for fiscal year 2000, was the reason for the agency\u2019s reported  systems\u2019 compliance in fiscal year 2000.  In fiscal years 1999 and 1998, the  auditor reported that the agency was not in substantial compliance with  FFMIA because of reportable conditions related to IT security control  weaknesses.  OMB\u2019s previous guidance characterized IT security controls that were considered reportable conditions as an indicator of an instance  of noncompliance with FFMIA.  In contrast, the revised guidance states  that only material IT security control weaknesses should be considered as  indicators of noncompliance with FFMIA.  According to the auditors and  agency officials, because the revised guidance no longer characterized IT  security controls that were reportable conditions as indicators of instances  of noncompliance, the auditors determined that the agency was compliant  with FFMIA for fiscal year 2000.", "Moreover, although the compliance indicators in OMB\u2019s revised  implementation guidance were meant only as examples of compliance,  auditors for three of the agencies which ultimately reported the agencies\u2019  systems to be noncompliant with FFMIA and two auditors that provided  negative assurance used the indicators in OMB\u2019s revised guidance as a  prescriptive checklist for determining an agency\u2019s systems compliance.   These auditors compared the material weaknesses and reportable  conditions identified through the financial statement audit process to the  OMB compliance indicators, and if no deficiencies in a specifically listed  indicator had been identified as part of the financial statement audit work,  no noncompliance with FFMIA was reported.  If a deficiency in a specific  indicator was noted, noncompliance was reported.  This was not the way  the OMB indicators should have been used because just applying the  indicators is too limiting and was not OMB\u2019s intention.  Without a  comprehensive approach, key systems\u2019 functionalities may not be assessed  and the extent of noncompliance will remain uncertain. Without testing the  functionality of a financial management system, auditors cannot be assured  that the agencies\u2019 systems are operating as designed and that the systems  substantially comply with FFMIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Successful FFMIA Implementation Requires Top Management Commitment, Adequate Resources, and Redesigned Processes", "paragraphs": ["Bringing agency financial management systems into compliance with  FFMIA requirements is a formidable challenge that requires sustained top  management commitment, adequate funding resources, skilled financial  management staff, and meaningful management information.

Many of the officials we interviewed told us that having enough staff with  the right skill mix was a problem for the agencies in achieving their FFMIA  goals.  Officials at 14 of the 19 agencies with noncompliant systems cited  the lack of adequate human capital resources as an obstacle to achieving  FFMIA compliance.  It is crucial that the federal government has a qualified  workforce with the right mix of skills to successfully implement financial  systems.  A key factor is having a well-qualified project manager to lead this  effort.  The Core Competencies for Project Managers Implementing  Financial Systems in the Federal Government identifies competencies in  three areas: financial management, human resources, and technical.   Pursuit of these competencies will enable project managers to meet the  challenge of today\u2019s changing environment and prepare for the future.", "Strategic human capital management is a pervasive challenge in the federal  government. To highlight the urgency of this governmentwide challenge, in  January 2001 we added strategic human capital management to our list of  federal programs and operations identified as high risk. As stated in the  high-risk series report, human capital shortfalls are eroding and  threatening the ability of many agencies to effectively, efficiently, and  economically perform their missions.  As a result, this area needs greater  attention to ensure maximum government performance and accountability.", "Another key success factor for world-class financial management is  meaningful management information.  Financial information is meaningful  when it is reliable, useful, and timely.  However, as discussed earlier, most  federal agencies lack the systems and processes required to produce  meaningful financial information needed for management decision-making.   To remedy their financial management systems problems, many agencies  are implementing COTS software packages.  In this regard, JFMIP tests  vendor COTS packages and certifies that they meet current financial  management system requirements for core financial management  systems.  Agencies who have or are currently implementing COTS  packages include the Departments of Agriculture, Education,  Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, DOD components such as the  Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Military Sealift  Command, HUD\u2019s FHA, and AID.", "A key to successful implementation of COTS systems, according to leading  finance organizations, is reengineering business processes to fit the new  software applications that are based on best practices. The Clinger-Cohen  Act requires agency heads to modernize inefficient mission-related and  administrative processes (as appropriate) before making a significant  investment in IT systems to support them.  Thus, an assessment of current  processes should be completed before any decision is made about  acquiring technology.  As a result, federal agencies are beginning to  consider the merits of information technology approaches that involve  reengineering business processes in conjunction with implementing COTS  software without significant modification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remediation Plans Improved but Continue To Lack Important Details", "paragraphs": ["The CFO Act requires OMB to prepare and submit to the Congress a  governmentwide 5-year financial management plan, including annual status  updates.  Among other requirements, the governmentwide plan is to  describe strategies for improving financial management.  To help compile  the governmentwide 5-year plan, OMB uses agency-specific financial  management plans that agencies prepare as part of their budget  submissions and are also required by the CFO Act.   FFMIA requires agency  management to prepare remediation plans, in consultation with OMB, that  describe the corrective actions they plan to take to resolve their instances  of noncompliance, target dates, and resources necessary to bring financial  systems into substantial compliance with FFMIA requirements.  Further,  the recently issued President\u2019s Management Agenda for improving  financial management states that OMB will work with agencies to ensure  that federal financial systems produce accurate and timely information to  support operating, budget, and policy decisions.", "For our report on FFMIA compliance last year, we reviewed remediation  plans agencies prepared to address problems identified in the fiscal year  1998 financial statement audits.  We concluded that the majority of the  plans lacked sufficient detail to be adequate tools for agency management  and staff to use in resolving financial management problems.  For this  year\u2019s report, we reviewed agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 remediation plans.   Overall the plans improved slightly over those for fiscal year 1998.  While  OMB has worked with many agencies to prepare or revise these plans,  which helped improve the plans, many still lacked sufficient detail and  descriptions of the resources needed for executing the corrective actions.   Further, some of the corrective actions included in the remediation plans  we reviewed did not fully address the problems they are intended to  correct.  As we reported last year, remediation plans need to be sufficiently  detailed to provide a \u201croad map\u201d for agency management and staff to  resolve financial management problems.  The severity of problems facing  agencies as they attempt to replace or overhaul old and outdated financial  systems and resolve serious information security weaknesses, among other  things, highlights the need for detailed remediation plans.", "Of the 21 agencies whose systems were reported to be noncompliant with  FFMIA in fiscal year 1999, 16 prepared remediation plans. Two agencies\u2014 SSA and FEMA\u2014did not submit remediation plans for fiscal year 1999 to  OMB because agency management determined that their systems were in  substantial compliance with FFMIA. While SSA and FEMA management  acknowledged that the weaknesses identified by the auditors exist, they  did not agree with the auditors that the weaknesses resulted in lack of  \u201csubstantial\u201d compliance.  However, SSA and FEMA have provided  comments, including corrective actions, in response to the auditors\u2019  recommendations.", "In addition, 3 of 21 agencies\u2014the Departments of Justice and State and  GSA\u2014did not prepare separate remediation plans to address reported  fiscal year 1999 instances of noncompliance.  The Department of Justice  addressed instances of FFMIA noncompliance for both fiscal years 1999  and 2000 in its Financial Management Status Report and Five-Year Plan  dated May 2001.  Department of State officials decided not to issue a  separate remediation plan for fiscal year 1999 but rather to focus on  implementing actions in its March 2000 plan and on updating its  remediation plan to address the fiscal year 2000 instances of  noncompliance.  Lastly, GSA officials told us that management did not  prepare a remediation plan for fiscal year 1999 because the agency\u2019s  systems were determined to be in compliance for fiscal year 2000, and the  severity of the problems for fiscal year 1999 no longer warranted  development of a plan.", "FFMIA provides that if the compliance determination made by the agency  head differs from the auditors\u2019 findings, the Director of OMB is to review  the determinations and provide a report on the findings to the appropriate  committees of the Congress.  Further, although FFMIA does not require a  remediation plan if an agency head determines the agency\u2019s systems  comply substantially, OMB Circular A-11 requires agencies to address  systems weaknesses in their financial management improvement plans.", "We reviewed the 16 available remediation plans to determine whether (1)  they included all the instances of noncompliance identified in the fiscal  year 1998 financial statement audit reports; (2) the planned corrective  actions were accompanied by detailed steps; (3) the corrective actions, if  successfully implemented, could potentially resolve the problems; (4) they  included information about resources needed; and (5) they provided target  dates for completing the corrective actions.  Figure 6 presents the results of  our analysis.", "As shown in figure 6, 14 of the agencies\u2019 remediation plans included  corrective actions that covered all of the reported instances of  noncompliance identified as a result of the fiscal year 1999 financial  statement audit.  The remediation plans for two agencies, HUD and DOD,  did not include corrective actions to cover all of the instances of FFMIA  noncompliance reported.  While HUD\u2019s remediation plan covered virtually  all of its instances of noncompliance, it did not fully address computer  security weaknesses over its information systems.  The corrective actions  in DOD\u2019s plan, referred to as its Financial Management Improvement Plan  (FMIP),could not be specifically related to the reported instances of  FFMIA noncompliance.", "Another limitation with a number of the remediation plans is that the  corrective actions were broadly stated and did not include sufficient details  describing how actions are to be accomplished.  As shown in figure 6,  corrective actions in 11 of the 16 remediation plans fell into this category.  An example of a plan with sufficient details describing corrective actions is  HUD\u2019s remediation plan.  In its plan, HUD included specific actions for  addressing FHA\u2019s compliance with the SGL at the transaction level, which  includes completing the feeder system SGL financial transaction processes  for 19 systems, validating extracts from existing feeder systems, and  determining the appropriate SGL accounting treatment and data format.", "In contrast, one of the corrective actions in AID\u2019s remediation plan is to  develop cost allocation models with cost drivers to attribute costs to the  agency\u2019s goals.  Based on our review of AID\u2019s remediation plan, we found  no information that describes, even in general terms, the cost drivers and  how the cost allocation models will be developed.  As we discuss later,  when an agency\u2019s corrective actions involve implementing or replacing  financial management systems, it is important to have a detailed plan that  includes adopting sound IT investment and control processes.", "While there is a substantial amount of professional judgment associated  with assessing the adequacy of these plans, we determined that the  corrective actions in the remediation plans of 15 agencies, if successfully  implemented, could potentially resolve the problems, as shown in figure 6.   For DOD, we determined that the corrective actions described in the  agency\u2019s remediation plan probably would not resolve the problems.  For  example, we recently reported that while DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2000 FMIP is a  significant effort and an improvement over prior plans, it largely represents  a compilation of the military services\u2019 and DOD components\u2019 stovepiped  approaches, and therefore is not an effective management tool that  establishes a departmentwide strategic approach for developing an  integrated DOD-wide financial management system.   Such stovepiped  approaches have been at the heart of previous DOD-wide reform initiatives  that have produced some incremental improvements, but have not resulted  in the fundamental reform necessary to resolve these long-standing  management challenges.  As we recently testified, DOD\u2019s financial  management challenges must be addressed as part of a comprehensive,  integrated, DOD-wide business process reform, including an  enterprisewide systems architecture to guide and direct its financial  management modernization investment.  If the hundreds of initiatives  outlined in the plan are not implemented as part of an overall financial  management architecture, DOD runs the risk that its system efforts will  result in perpetuating a system environment that is duplicative, not  interoperable, unnecessarily costly to maintain, and is unable to optimize  financial management performance and accountability.  We are encouraged  that the Secretary of Defense has stated that he intends to include financial  management reform among his top priorities.  Most recently, DOD has  initiated a number of actions that hold promise for addressing its long- standing serious problems in this area.  For example, DOD recently  announced plans to (1) dedicate significant funding to this area; (2)  establish a top level steering committee that is to include leaders of its  major components and Secretariat-level organizations; and (3) analyze  ongoing and planned financial management systems initiatives across the  Department to curtail high-risk efforts that will not lead to an integrated  financial management structure.", "OMB\u2019s guidance and FFMIA state that remediation plans are to include  resources and target dates necessary to achieve substantial compliance. As  shown in figure 6, 10 of the 16 remediation plans we reviewed did not  include a discussion of resources needed.  Resource information is  important for agencies and OMB to determine whether corrective actions  can realistically be undertaken.", "Finally, as shown in figure 6, all 16 of the remediation plans included  timeframes.  This is an improvement over fiscal year 1998, where 14 of the  19 remediation plans included timeframes.  The plans would be further  enhanced by including intermediate target dates.   Setting specific  intermediate target dates help keep agencies on track as they implement  corrective actions.  FFMIA, which was enacted 5 years ago, specifies that  agencies have 3 years to bring their systems into compliance after a  determination of noncompliance has been made.", "FFMIA also provides for extending the time needed to complete the  planned actions past 3 years with the concurrence of OMB.  As mentioned  earlier, in our discussion of the extent of long-term challenges facing DOD,  3 years will not be enough time for some agencies to address their  remaining problems.

As discussed further in the next  section, OMB\u2019s continuing leadership is critical to the efforts across  government to improve financial management systems.  Many agencies are  planning or are in the process of implementing new core financial  management systems. Implementing or overhauling financial management  systems can understandably take time, and the systems may not be  operational for several years.   For example, as previously discussed, VA is  planning to replace its \u201cpatchwork\u201d of computer systems and correct its  FMFIA material systems weaknesses by implementing a single commercial  financial management and logistics system.  This system implementation  effort, called the Core Financial and Logistics System, is targeted to be  completed by the end of 2003.

In describing its need for an integrated financial  management system, NASA has stated that its financial management  environment was comprised of decentralized, nonintegrated systems, with  policies, procedures, and practices unique to its field centers.  The  Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) is expected to correct  these problems.  NASA is undertaking its third attempt to implement an  integrated financial management system.  In a prior attempt, a former  contractor working on the IFMS had difficulties upgrading its software to  support new technologies and to meet all federal requirements.  This  contract was eventually terminated, and the program to implement the  system has been changed so that implementation of the new system is  broken into individual software modules.  NASA CFO officials told us that  NASA is now moving to a COTS package for its core financial system.   NASA expects to implement the core financial system at its centers in fiscal  year 2003.", "Agriculture encountered problems in implementing a COTS package to  provide a departmentwide accounting system, due to inadequate project  planning and inexperienced management coupled with insufficient  business process reengineering.  According to PriceWaterhouseCoopers,  Agriculture\u2019s implementation of the COTS package was impacted by  insufficient strategic planning.  For example, Agriculture did not have a  single, strong strategic plan to guide the implementation of its Foundation  Financial Information System (FFIS).  The strategic implementation plan  should have been developed in concert with its component agencies and  communicated throughout the Department.  Moreover, Agriculture did not  do sufficient analysis of its business processes before attempting to  implement the FFIS at the Forest Service.  As a result, significant effort was  expended automating existing and complex business processes, some of  which needed to be reengineered.  Agriculture hired experienced financial  systems program management staff in the fourth quarter of 1998.  This staff  reoriented the FFIS project and has implemented the FFIS in six major  Agriculture agencies since the beginning of fiscal year 2000.

According to OMB officials, OMB is integrating its  review of FFMIA remediation plans with its capital planning and  investment control plans process.

OMB  welcomed our participation on this effort and we look forward to working  with them. As we discuss in our report, management reform legislation  including the CFO Act, GPRA, and FFMIA, if fully and effectively  implemented, will collectively help achieve strong financial management  that provides reliable, timely, and useful information for decisionmakers.", "In its comments, OMB expressed concern as to how our report  characterized the level of testing currently contemplated by OMB Bulletin  No. 01-02. This was not our intent, and we have clarified our report. OMB  stated that required tests of FFMIA in OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, coupled with  the requirement to test internal controls over significant systems, results in  more than incidental testing. Our point is that under generally accepted  government auditing standards, auditors need to perform only limited  incidental testing to provide negative assurance. Our concern is that with  negative assurance, the auditor is not saying that they determined the  systems to be substantially compliant, but that the work performed did not  identify instances of noncompliance.  We view the law as requiring a  definitive statement as to whether the systems susbstantially complied. It is  important that readers of the audit report understand this distinction, or  they may have a false impression that the auditor is stating that they found  the systems to be substantially compliant.  We will continue to work with  OMB on this matter and recognize that we have differing views.", "We agree with OMB that reorienting remediation plans towards measurable  performance would force a more integrated enterprisewide approach that  considers both financial and nonfinancial systems that support agency  missions.  This provides a needed perspective and helps agencies to adopt  an information technology architecture that includes a well-defined  blueprint for operational and technological change. The Clinger-Cohen Act  provides a foundation that can be followed by agencies as they implement  these important systems initiatives.

Regarding the first concern, as we state in the  report, we included all weaknesses relevant to FFMIA identified by the  auditors because such problems must be resolved in order for the agencies'  systems to have the data to generate the reliable, useful, and timely  information needed for decision-making. Regarding the second concern,  EPA officials stated that the example in our report illustrates the lack of  timely processing of the deobligation actions and is not an example of the  lack of timely recording of a financial transaction.  According to EPA  officials, the deobligation can only take place after an authorizing official  closes the obligating document. EPA officials stated that the closeout  usually occurs after audits and other administrative requirements are  satisfied.  As a result, a large backlog of grants has been awaiting closeout.   In our view, this example illustrates that the lack of timely deobligations,  which trigger the final transactions, can result in misleading financial  information, both at year-end and throughout the year.", "NASA officials disagreed with our questioning of its compliance with  FFMIA because of issues related to cost accounting and the lack of an  integrated financial management system.  NASA stated that contract cost  reports provided to the agency by its contractors, combined with cost  finding techniques that are permitted under Managerial Cost Accounting  Concepts and Standards, allow NASA to capture all costs related to the  multibillion dollar international space station program.  However, as we  highlight and discuss in more detail in our August 31, 2001 report, NASA's  systems do not track the cost of individual space station subsystems or  elements.  According to agency officials, NASA manages and tracks space  station costs by contract and does not need to know the cost of individual  subsystems or elements to effectively manage the program. However, our  work in this area found that NASA assigns potential and probable future  costs in order to estimate the impact of canceling, deferring, or adding  space station content.", "These cost estimates often assign the cost of specific space station  subsystems.  However, because NASA does not attempt to track costs by  element or subsystem, the agency does not know the actual cost of  completed space station components and is not able to re-examine its cost  estimates for validity once costs have been realized.  Further, in the event  of a cost overrun, it would be very difficult to identify which component  prompted the overrun, thus hampering management's ability to make  informed decisions.  While cost finding techniques when clearly assigned to  outputs are permitted under the Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts  and Standards, NASA appears to not have clearly defined the outputs\u2014in  this case the space station components\u2014to permit recognition and  measurement of costs appropriate for intended purposes, such as holding  managers accountable for differences between budgeted and actual costs.   Therefore, it remains unclear how NASA can conclude it is in compliance  with cost accounting standards.", "NASA officials also stated that the fact that NASA does not have an  integrated financial management system does not preclude substantial  compliance with FFMIA.  Specifically, they state that NASA's systems taken  as a whole, meet the objectives of FFMIA and the supplemental,  compensating procedures and practices employed by NASA substantially  and materially achieve federal requirements.  Nonetheless, NASA reports  its financial management systems as a nonconforming significant area of  management concern because the systems are not fully automated and not  fully integrated.  NASA\u2019s labor-intensive, reconciliation/compilation  processes are due to the fact that it has nonstandard systems that are not  integrated and were not designed to include the SGL accounts.  In our view,  systems that are prone to errors and do not adhere to OMB's requirements  for an integrated financial management system as outlined in OMB Circular  A-127, preclude compliance with the goals and requirements of FFMIA. To  illustrate the challenges faced by NASA in trying to provide relatively  straightforward information, as we recently reported, for over 5 months  NASA has been unable to provide us with detailed transaction-based  support for amounts obligated against the space station and shuttle  because it maintains a separate accounting system at each of its nine field  centers and headquarters and cannot readily pull the information together.", "NASA also took exception with the way the draft characterizes the centers'  financial/accounting policies, procedures, and practices as unique.  NASA  stated that its Financial Management Manual prescribes standard financial  policies, procedures and practices and ensures the centers comply with  those through various quality assessment processes.  NASA also added that  the field centers have lower level policies, practices, and procedures  unique to each center based on a center's mission and organization  structure.  We agree that NASA's Financial Management Manual prescribes  standard financial policies, procedures, and practices, but our intent in the  report is to convey that each center has a unique operating environment.  This has permitted nonstandardized data formats, and nonintegrated  systems, thus prohibiting the access to readily available reliable, useful,  and timely financial information.", "Several agencies also provided technical comments that we incorporated  where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman, and Ranking Minority  Member, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management,  Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, Senate Committee on  Governmental Affairs; and to the Chairman, and Ranking Minority Member,  Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management, and  Intergovernmental Relations, House Committee on Government Reform.
