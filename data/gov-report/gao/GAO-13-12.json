The center is still relatively early in the process of implementing these models. Eleven of the models were selected by the Innovation Center under the provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that established the center, while the remaining 6 were specifically required by other PPACA provisions. The Innovation Center projects that a total of $3.7 billion will be required to fund testing and evaluation of the 17 models, with the expected funding for individual models ranging from $30 million to $931 million. As of March 2012, the center's 184 staff were organized into four groups responsible for coordinating the implementation of different models and another five groups responsible for key functions that support model implementation. Officials said that, among other things, the center's initial hiring of staff reflected the need for leadership and for specific types of expertise, such as individuals with a background in evaluation.", "The Innovation Center's plans for evaluating individual models include identifying measures related to the cost and quality of care. Officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) told GAO that the Innovation Center had developed preliminary evaluation plans for the 17 models being implemented that, among other things, identified proposed measures. According to CMS officials, these measures will be finalized by contractors responsible for evaluating, on behalf of CMS, each model's impact on cost and quality. As of August 1, 2012, the Innovation Center had contracted for the evaluation of 10 of the 17 models. The center's plans for evaluating its own performance include aggregating data across models by using a set of core measures it has developed. In addition, the Innovation Center has taken steps to monitor its progress in implementing the 17 models through biweekly reviews of standard milestones and related data, such as the number of applications to participate in a model the center has received.", "GAO identified three key examples of overlap between the 17 Innovation Center models and the efforts of other CMS offices, meaning that the efforts share similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve these goals, or target similar populations. However, these overlapping efforts also have differences, and CMS officials said the efforts are intended to be complementary to each other. GAO also identified a number of mechanisms the Innovation Center uses to coordinate its work in order to avoid unnecessary duplication between its models and other efforts, such as multi-office meetings at the staff, director, and agency level. Further, through using these mechanisms, the Innovation Center has engaged in key practices for collaboration, including leveraging resources across offices. At the same time, the center is still working on ways to make its coordination more systematic. For example, largely because of questions raised during GAO's review, the Innovation Center initiated a process to ensure that CMS does not pay for the same service under the contracts in one of its models and those in another CMS office. However, officials told GAO that the center is still working on implementing this process and may need to take additional steps to eliminate any unnecessary duplication. GAO is recommending that the Administrator of CMS direct the Innovation Center to expeditiously complete its process to review and eliminate any areas of unnecessary duplication in contracts that have been awarded in one of its models. HHS agreed with this recommendation and described steps it is taking to address unnecessary duplication."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Administrator of CMS direct the Innovation Center to expeditiously complete its process to review and eliminate any areas of unnecessary duplication in contracts that have been awarded in one of its models.

Complicating these trends, recent evidence  suggests that higher levels of health care spending do not always lead to  enhanced quality of care. As a result, policymakers have sought to both  reduce costs and improve quality by researching ways of changing how  health care services are delivered and health care providers are paid. To  identify approaches that work, policymakers need credible information on  the effects of the approaches on cost and quality. In 2010, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) created the Center for  Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) within the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers  Medicare and Medicaid. The purpose of the Innovation Center is to test  new approaches to health care delivery and payment\u2014known as  models\u2014in order to reduce Medicare and Medicaid expenditures while  preserving or enhancing quality of care for beneficiaries of the programs.  Although CMS conducted similar testing through demonstrations prior to  PPACA, the recent law provides the Innovation Center with additional  authority. For example, unlike for demonstrations CMS has frequently  conducted in the past, models tested under the provision establishing the  Innovation Center can, under certain conditions, be expanded\u2014including  on a nationwide basis\u2014through rulemaking instead of requiring  legislation. In addition, PPACA significantly increased the funding  available to CMS to test new approaches. According to an analysis by the  Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, CMS\u2019s funding for research,  demonstrations, and evaluations has historically been appropriated  annually, and was less than $1 billion for the period of fiscal years 2000  through 2010. In contrast, PPACA provided the Innovation Center with a  dedicated source of funding, appropriating $10 billion for its activities for  the period of fiscal years 2011 through 2019 and $10 billion per decade  beginning in fiscal year 2020.", "PPACA required CMS to make the Innovation Center operational by  January 1, 2011, and the center became operational in November 2010.  Since that time, some members of Congress have raised questions about  the extent to which models the Innovation Center has selected for testing  will lead to reduced costs and improved quality in health care, particularly  given the amount appropriated for its work. They have also raised  questions about the potential for overlap between efforts of the Innovation   which, if not  Center and those of existing centers and offices within CMS, effectively coordinated, could result in the inefficient use of federal  resources through unnecessary duplication.the implementation of the Innovation Center. In this report, we:   (1) describe the Innovation Center\u2019s activities, funding, organization, and  staffing; (2) describe the Innovation Center\u2019s plans for evaluating its  models and its own performance; and (3) examine whether efforts of the  Innovation Center overlap with those of other CMS offices and assess  how the center coordinates with other offices.", "We were asked to review  To describe the Innovation Center\u2019s activities, funding, organization, and  staffing, we focused our review on information as of March 31, 2012\u2014 about 2 years after the enactment of PPACA. We reviewed documents,  including information on models the center was implementing as of this  date, and planning documents, such as organizational charts. We also  reviewed budget and staffing data for the Innovation Center. We  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about their efforts to ensure  the quality of the data, checked for anomalies, and determined these data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In order to obtain more in- depth information on center activities, we reviewed examples of the types  of documents used in implementing models, such as a model\u2019s Innovation  Center Investment Proposal (ICIP), which is the document developed to  obtain approval for models or initiatives. Finally, we interviewed  Innovation Center officials and officials in CMS\u2019s Office of Financial  Management.", "To describe the Innovation Center\u2019s plans for evaluating its models and  its own performance, we reviewed documents, such as descriptions of the  center\u2019s model evaluation process and internal tracking documents. We  also reviewed examples of more-detailed information, such as documents  discussing evaluation plans for individual models the center was  implementing as of March 31, 2012, and reviewed information on the  center\u2019s progress in evaluating models. In addition, we reviewed the  statement of work for a contractor to evaluate the Innovation Center\u2019s  operations. To supplement this information, we interviewed Innovation  Center officials and officials from CMS\u2019s Office of the Actuary.", "To examine whether efforts of the Innovation Center overlap with those of  other CMS offices and assess how the center coordinates with other  offices, we reviewed the key functions of all offices within CMS, using  information that was available on CMS\u2019s website to identify areas of  potential overlap. We then interviewed Innovation Center officials, as well  as officials from other CMS centers and offices, including the Center for  Medicare, the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality (CCSQ), and the  Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS), to obtain more-specific  information about the efforts they conduct. On the basis of these  interviews and review of related documentation, such as statements of  work for program contractors, we assessed whether Innovation Center  models being implemented as of March 31, 2012, had similar goals,  engaged in similar activities or strategies to achieve these goals, or  targeted similar beneficiaries as the efforts of other CMS offices. While  efforts identified in this report may not represent the full universe of  overlapping efforts between the Innovation Center and other CMS offices,  we conducted a systematic examination to identify key examples of  where overlap may have occurred. Finally, we interviewed the same  officials to obtain information on how the Innovation Center coordinates  its efforts with other CMS offices, and reviewed corroborating  documentation, such as center policies and procedures, when available.  We assessed how the center coordinates within the context of federal  internal control standards and key practices for collaboration identified in  prior GAO work. According to federal internal control standards, an  entity should, among other things, have the policies and procedures  necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness and  efficiency of its operations, including the use of resources, and ensure  that these policies and procedures are appropriately documented.", "We conducted our performance audit from February 2012 through  November 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["While PPACA gives CMS discretion in how to implement the Innovation  Center, such as the composition of its staff, the law also established  certain requirements for the center. For example, PPACA requires that, in  carrying out its duties described in the law, the Innovation Center consult  with representatives of relevant federal agencies and clinical and  analytical experts with expertise in medicine or health care management.  It also requires that, of amounts appropriated to the center, the center  make no less than $25 million available for model implementation each  fiscal year starting in 2011. In addition, PPACA requires that the  Innovation Center evaluate each model to measure its effects on  spending and quality of care, and that these evaluations be made public.  Further, PPACA requires the Innovation Center to modify or terminate a  model any time after testing and evaluation has begun unless it  determines that the model either improves quality of care without  increasing spending levels, reduces spending without reducing quality, or  both.", "In addition to these requirements, when selecting models, PPACA  requires the Innovation Center to determine that a model addresses a  situation in which deficits in care were leading to poor clinical outcomes or  unnecessary spending. The law also describes types of models that the  Innovation Center could consider in selecting models to test; however the  center is not limited to this list. Examples of model types include changing  the way primary care providers are reimbursed for services and improving  care for patients recently discharged from the hospital. PPACA also  directs that in selecting models, the Innovation Center give preference to  those that improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of health care  services and lists additional factors for consideration, such as whether the  model uses certain technology to help achieve its goals.", "Finally, PPACA also makes certain requirements not applicable to models  tested under the provision establishing the Innovation Center that were  applicable to demonstrations CMS has frequently conducted in the past.  For example, while prior demonstrations generally required legislation in  order to be expanded, PPACA allows CMS to expand Innovation Center  models more broadly into Medicare or Medicaid\u2014including on a  nationwide basis\u2014through the rulemaking process if the following  conditions are met: (1) the agency determines that the expansion is  expected to reduce spending without reducing the quality of care or  improve quality without increasing spending, (2) CMS\u2019s Office of the  Actuary certifies that the expansion will reduce or not increase net  spending, and (3) the agency determines that the expansion would not  deny or limit coverage or benefits for beneficiaries. In addition, PPACA  makes inapplicable certain requirements that have previously been cited  as administrative barriers to the timely completion of demonstrations.  Specifically, PPACA provides the following:", "HHS cannot require that an Innovation Center model be budget  neutral, that is, designed so that estimated federal expenditures under  the model are expected to be no more than they would have been  without the model, prior to approving a model for testing.", "Certain CMS actions in testing and expanding Innovation Center  models cannot be subject to administrative or judicial review. For  example, the selection of models for testing or expansion is not  subject to review by the agency or the courts.", "The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to Innovation Center  models. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, agencies generally are  required to submit all proposed information collections to the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) for approval and provide a 60-day  period for public comment on collections, among other things, when  they want to collect data on 10 or more individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Innovation Center\u2019s Activities, Funding, Organization, and Staffing Focused on Implementing 17 New Models", "paragraphs": ["From the time it became operational in November 2010, through   March 31, 2012, the Innovation Center\u2019s activities and use of funding  focused on implementing 17 new models to test different approaches to  health care delivery and payment in Medicare and Medicaid.

These models  generally fall into three different types on the basis of the delivery and  payment approaches tested. The center\u2019s \u201cPatient care\u201d models test  approaches that are designed around improving care for clinical groups of  patients such as patients needing heart bypass surgery. \u201cSeamless care\u201d  models test approaches designed to improve coordination of care for a  patient population across care settings, such as the coordination of  inpatient and outpatient care for all of a provider\u2019s Medicare beneficiaries.  \u201cPreventive care\u201d models test approaches designed to improve health,  such as incentive programs to prevent smoking. The 17 models vary by  the program and beneficiaries targeted. For example, some target  Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries specifically, whereas others are open  to beneficiaries of either program. In addition, three models have been  designed to target individuals who are covered by both Medicare and  Medicaid. The models also vary in terms of the types of participants  involved, ranging, for example, from physician group practices to  Federally Qualified Health Centers, to health plans, to state Medicaid  programs.", "Of these 17 models, 11 were selected by the Innovation Center under the  PPACA provision that established the center and, as a result, certain  requirements that have applied to demonstrations CMS has frequently  conducted in the past are not applicable to these models. The Innovation  Center selected the 11 models for implementation by reviewing model  types identified in PPACA and ideas submitted by CMS staff as well as  through a variety of mechanisms designed to obtain ideas from  beneficiaries, providers, payers, state policymakers and others. Selection criteria\u2014which are available to the public on the Innovation  Center\u2019s website\u2014include focusing on health conditions that offer the  greatest opportunity to improve care and reduce costs, and meeting the  needs of the high-admission-rate hospitals most vulnerable populations.", "The remaining six new models the Innovation Center is implementing  were specifically required by other PPACA provisions. For example, the  center is implementing a model required by PPACA that tests whether  partnerships between and community-based organizations can improve  transition care services for Medicare beneficiaries. The degree of  flexibility that the Innovation Center has in implementing these six models  varies by each model\u2019s specific statutory authority.", "These mechanisms included the Innovation Center\u2019s online web program and \u201clistening  session\u201d meetings held across the country in 2010.", "The Innovation Center projects that the total funding required to test and  evaluate these 17 models will be $3.7 billion over their lifetime, including  $2.7 billion for the 11 models selected by the Innovation Center and   $1.0 billion for the 6 models specifically required by other provisions of  PPACA. The expected funding for individual models ranges from   $30 million to $931 million, depending on model scope and design.  Officials said that the period required to test and evaluate an individual  model typically ranges from 3 to 5 years. With regard to the Innovation  Center\u2019s annual expenditures, as of March 31, 2012, the Innovation  Center forecast that most of its fiscal year 2012 budget\u2014or   76.8 percent\u2014would be spent implementing the 11 models that were  selected for implementation by the Innovation Center.

CMS officials explained that this  process includes a series of steps to develop and prepare the model for  testing followed by a testing and evaluation period that is typically 3 to   5 years in which, among other things, participants and CMS put specified  changes to health care delivery or payment into effect. (See sidebar.)  While the Innovation Center had started testing 12 of the 17 models as of  August 1, 2012, nearly all of these tests had started within the prior   12 months, and 5 had started within the prior 6 months. Thus, the  models still have a significant portion of their testing and evaluation period  remaining. In addition, for the 5 models that had not yet started testing,  the Innovation Center was still completing the steps necessary to start  testing. Appendix II provides additional information about the general  process used to implement models.", "In addition to the 17 models, the Innovation Center also assumed  responsibility for 20 demonstrations that were initiated prior to the  Innovation Center\u2019s formation. Responsibility for the demonstrations was  moved to the Innovation Center in March 2011, when the demonstration  and research and evaluation groups of CMS\u2019s former Office for Research,  Development and Information (ORDI) were brought into the Innovation  Center through reorganization. As of August 1, 2012, testing of 9 of  these 20 demonstrations had ended, although evaluation activities were  still ongoing for 4 of them. The demonstrations were initiated under the  Medicare Health Care Quality Demonstration Program which enables  CMS to select which demonstrations to conduct, or because they were  specifically required by various pre-PPACA statutes. Like the Innovation  Center\u2019s models, the demonstrations test a range of delivery and  payment approaches; for example, one demonstration tests the use of  care management\u2014a particular approach to coordinating and managing  health services\u2014for high-cost Medicare beneficiaries while another tests  approaches for preventing and treating cancer among minorities in  Medicare."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Innovation Center\u2019s Organization and Staffing Reflect Its Focus on the 17 Models and Other Key Functions That Support Model Implementation", "paragraphs": ["As of March 31, 2012, the Innovation Center\u2019s 184 staff were organized  into nine groups and the Office of the Director.

To conduct this aggregation, the Innovation Center will use  statistical techniques, such as meta-analysis. Aggregation will not occur  until individual models have been evaluated, but officials said that the  Innovation Center has started asking evaluation contractors to consider  using the 70 measures when possible.", "The Innovation Center\u2019s plans for evaluating its performance also include  monitoring its progress in implementing models. The Innovation Center  has established a project management approach for its models that  includes standard milestones\u2014such as \u201ccompletion of OMB clearance\u201d  and \u201cissuance of participant solicitation and application\u201d\u2014that it uses to  track the progress of models against target deadlines. In addition, certain  data are monitored for each model against specified targets, such as the  number of applications submitted and the number of participants  selected. Individual milestones and data are summarized across all of the  Innovation Center models every 2 weeks. The intended purpose is to  allow the center\u2019s management to monitor progress across models and to  identify and promptly address potential delays. According to CMS  officials, the Innovation Center was monitoring the progress of each of the  17 models it was implementing as of March 31, 2012.", "Finally, in order to help evaluate its performance, in June 2012, the  Innovation Center contracted with a firm to review the Innovation Center\u2019s  internal operations and how the center operates within the context of  CMS\u2019s programs overall. The statement of work for this contract identified  a number of objectives, including recommending ways to improve the  center\u2019s organizational structure, revising the center\u2019s management  policies and procedures, and identifying additional ways to evaluate the  Innovation Center\u2019s performance on an ongoing basis. To support these  objectives, the contract requires the firm to, for example, identify best  practices for expanding innovative models of care into ongoing programs  such as Medicare and Medicaid. The contract also requires the firm to  identify policies and procedures that are missing within the Innovation  Center that would improve its performance.

The three key examples we identified are the following:", "The Innovation Center\u2019s Two Accountable Care Organization (ACO)", "Models and the Center for Medicare\u2019s Shared Savings Program.  The Innovation Center is implementing two models\u2014the Pioneer ACO  model and the Advance Payment ACO model\u2014that share similar  goals with those of the Shared Savings Program, which is required by  PPACA and administered nationally by CMS through its Center for  Medicare. All three efforts aim to encourage Medicare providers that  participate in ACOs to improve the quality of care among the patients  they serve, while at the same time reducing Medicare expenditures. In  order to achieve these goals, the efforts provide financial incentives  for ACOs that meet specified quality of care and cost savings  thresholds by allowing them to share in a certain amount of the  savings they achieve for the Medicare program. However, the  Innovation Center\u2019s models and the Shared Savings Program each  adopt a different approach to sharing any realized savings. Further,  while the Shared Savings Program is open to all eligible ACOs, the  models target specific subgroups of ACOs. According to CMS  officials, the Innovation Center\u2019s ACO models are intended to be  complementary to the Shared Savings Program, because they allow  CMS to test alternative approaches to the national effort. If these  alternative approaches are proven effective, officials explained, they  could be incorporated into the Shared Savings Program.", "The Innovation Center\u2019s Medicaid Models and CMCS\u2019s State  Medicaid Demonstrations. As of March 31, 2012, the Innovation  Center was implementing nine models that share the same broad goal  as the state Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations overseen by  CMCS\u2014testing new ways of delivering and paying for health care in  Medicaid. Despite this similarity, the Innovation Center\u2019s models can  test delivery and payment approaches across geographic areas and  with different types of participants, including directly with providers,  while Medicaid demonstrations under CMCS are agreements between  CMS and state Medicaid agencies to test approaches within a  particular state. According to CMS officials, the Medicaid models and  demonstrations are intended to be complementary: the models allow  CMS to test the effectiveness of approaches it selects, while the  demonstrations are initiated by states on the basis of their own  priorities and needs. Further, officials said that while evaluations of  Innovation Center models may be able to more-rigorously test  effectiveness, state Medicaid demonstrations allow for a larger  number of tests to be conducted\u2014according to CMS, there were  approximately 70 active section 1115 demonstrations as of August  2012\u2014and can point to promising approaches that should be  considered for further testing.", "The Innovation Center\u2019s Partnership for Patients Model and CCSQ\u2019s  Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program. The goals of the  Innovation Center\u2019s Partnership for Patients model\u2014namely reducing  the rate of preventable hospital-acquired conditions and 30-day  hospital readmissions\u2014are also currently among the many goals of  CCSQ\u2019s QIO program. In order to achieve these goals, both the  Partnership for Patients model and the QIO program contract with  organizations\u2014Hospital Engagement Networks (HEN) and QIOs,  respectively\u2014to disseminate successful patient safety interventions in  hospitals through training and technical assistance. While the two  efforts are very similar in this respect, compared to QIOs, the activities  of HENs target more hospital-acquired conditions and focus on a  broader population that includes non-Medicare patients.officials also told us that the work of HENs and QIOs is intended to be  complementary and that HENs reinforce and expand on work already  being done by QIOs in order to reduce hospital-acquired conditions  and 30-day hospital readmissions at a faster rate. While QIOs may  have established relationships with certain hospitals in their states, as  of September 2012, CMS officials said that HENs had engaged a  much wider network of hospitals in patient safety interventions when  compared with QIOs\u2014about 4,000 versus just over 800 respectively.  Officials said that one reason for this is that HENs focus exclusively  on hospitals whereas QIOs are responsible for implementing  improvement projects across all settings of care. Additionally, officials  said that because hospital system organizations serve as HENs, they  can leverage their member hospitals to encourage these hospitals to  adopt patient safety interventions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Innovation Center Uses a Number of Mechanisms to Coordinate with Other Offices, but Is Still Working on Ways to Make Coordination More Systematic", "paragraphs": ["Over the period of our review, we identified a number of mechanisms the  Innovation Center uses to coordinate its work in order to avoid  unnecessary duplication in models that overlap with efforts of other CMS  offices. In using these mechanisms, the center has engaged in key  practices that we identified in prior work as helping enhance and sustain  collaboration, such as leveraging resources, establishing compatible  policies and procedures, and developing ways to report on results across  offices. The mechanisms the Innovation Center uses are the following:", "Committees and boards. The Innovation Center uses a number of  committees and boards to coordinate with other offices. For example,  CMS officials told us that in deciding whether to select a model for  testing, the Innovation Center\u2019s Portfolio Management Committee  considers other efforts within CMS\u2014as well as more broadly across  HHS\u2014that may overlap with the model in order to avoid unnecessary  duplication. Officials said that when overlap is identified, the decision  to continue with the model is made on a case-by-case basis and  involves a determination of whether the model is significantly different  from existing efforts. Additionally, members of the Portfolio  Management Committee are able to help identify staff in other offices  that the Innovation Center might want to invite to work on a model in  order to leverage existing agency expertise. In another example,  CMS\u2019s Enterprise Management Board brings together relevant offices  across the agency, such as the Chief Operating Officer, the Office of  Acquisition and Grants Management, and the Center for Medicare,  early in a model\u2019s implementation to determine what needs to be done  operationally. To avoid unnecessary duplication, the board considers  whether there are existing CMS resources that could be leveraged for  the model\u2019s infrastructure needs or whether a resource being  developed for an Innovation Center model could be shared with other  CMS efforts.", "Model approval process. According to CMS officials, the process CMS  uses to approve Innovation Center models for implementation also  allows the center to coordinate with other CMS offices. Officials  explained that as part of this process, all CMS offices must have the  opportunity to review and comment on the ICIP\u2014a document that  contains key information on a proposed model, such as design  parameters and cost estimates\u2014before the model is approved by the  CMS administrator. Officials said that under CMS policy, the  Innovation Center must address these comments. The ICIP contains  sections that specifically address issues related to overlap, such as a  section on \u201cSynergy with Existing or Planned Initiatives\u201d and a section  on \u201cUniqueness/Innovation.\u201d CMS officials said that, as a result, when  the ICIP is circulated, if the Innovation Center did not sufficiently  coordinate with other CMS centers or offices during the initial  selection of a model, these offices would have the opportunity to raise  any concerns related to unnecessary duplication. After a model is  approved by CMS, HHS and OMB also review and approve the ICIP.", "Multi-office meetings at the staff, director, and agency level. First,  CMS officials said that staff from the Innovation Center meet with staff  from other offices to work on efforts that overlap. For example, during  planning for its ACO models, the Innovation Center met with the  Center for Medicare to establish compatible policies and procedures  with the Shared Savings Program, such as developing common  scripts for 1-800-MEDICARE call centers and rules for elevating  beneficiary or provider questions to these centers for additional  review. Additionally, in March 2012, the Innovation Center started  meeting with CCSQ every week to discuss coordination between  HENs and QIOs in order to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort.  Second, CMS officials told us that there is regular coordination  between the director of the Innovation Center and certain other CMS  centers and offices, through meetings that happen on a weekly,  biweekly, or monthly basis. Officials said that, among other things,  these meetings are intended to share the results of ongoing efforts  and address such issues as making sure policies are compatible  across similar efforts. Officials also told us that all CMS offices have  weekly issues meetings with the CMS Administrator that other offices  involved in an issue being discussed are encouraged to attend.  Officials told us that if staff from other CMS offices thought an issue  related to overlapping efforts had not been adequately addressed  through other coordination mechanisms, these meetings serve as an  opportunity for them to raise it.", "Liaisons. Officials told us that staff members in other CMS offices  serve as liaisons to the Innovation Center, though they are not  formally designated as such. Officials said that these staff members  primarily serve as a central point of contact so that there is a  systematic way to keep track of coordination across offices. For  example, CMCS has a staff member serving as a liaison to the  Innovation Center who, among other things, ensures that the  Innovation Center\u2019s models employ policies and procedures that are  compatible with Medicaid program rules.", "Targeted reviews. CMS officials said that as part of selecting  participants for the Innovation Center\u2019s Medicaid models, the  Innovation Center works with CMCS, CMS regional offices, and OMB  to ensure that the models do not duplicate funding for states that are  already being funded to engage in the same activity through a CMCS  demonstration. For example, the application for the Strong Start for  Mothers and Newborns model\u2014which tests, among other things, the  effectiveness of three different approaches to providing enhanced  prenatal care to Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014specified that states that  were already paying for enhanced prenatal services were not allowed  to participate in the model.", "While the Innovation Center uses these mechanisms, it is also still  working on ways to make its coordination with other offices more  systematic. Specifically, CMS officials said that while some of the  Innovation Center\u2019s coordination mechanisms are formalized through  documented policies and procedures, the center is considering the extent  to which additional policies and procedures are needed. For example,  officials said that while the Enterprise Management Board, which is  responsible for addressing how models are coordinated with other CMS  efforts operationally, is formally established through a written charter, they  have considered whether a similar group that deals with coordination at  the policy level needs a more formal structure in place. In another  example, the Innovation Center has directed the outside firm that began  an evaluation of Innovation Center operations in June 2012 to consider,  as part of its statement of work, whether there are any gaps in current  center policies and procedures\u2014including those related to coordination  with other offices\u2014and to propose solutions to those gaps.", "The Innovation Center is also currently developing a process to ensure  that CMS does not pay for the same service under both HEN and QIO  contracts. Officials said that CMS recognizes there are areas of overlap  between HENs and QIOs and that they made an explicit decision to  include overlapping activities in HEN and QIO statements of work,  because, among other things, the nature of trying to reduce hospital- acquired conditions and readmissions requires multiple entities working  from different perspectives in a reinforcing manner. Although the HEN  and QIO contractors were originally told to work out areas of overlap  locally, largely because of questions asked during our review, officials  recognized the need for a more-formal process to ensure coordination  was working in practice. CMS officials said that a review of the 26 HEN  contracts is under way to identify if any unnecessary duplication of effort  has occurred\u2014that is, whether HENs and QIOs are conducting the same  activities in the same hospital. Officials noted that the review process  has evolved and may continue to evolve over time, in part because of the  size of the review\u2014which includes reviewing HENs\u2019 activities in  approximately 4,000 hospitals\u2014and in part because the Innovation  Center has not conducted this type of review previously. CMS officials  said that they will take steps, including potentially modifying HEN or QIO  contract language, to eliminate any unnecessary duplication of effort that  the review identifies and to document how this duplication was  addressed.", "Finally, officials noted that CMS is in the process of developing a  centralized database, which may also help the Innovation Center make its  coordination more systematic. Among other things, officials said that the  database is intended to help prevent duplicative payments to providers  that participate in CMS efforts involving incentive payments for meeting  specified quality of care and cost savings thresholds, such as the  Innovation Center\u2019s ACO models and the Center for Medicare\u2019s Shared  Savings Program. Specifically, officials said that the database is intended  to track which beneficiaries are participating in different efforts across  CMS to help ensure that beneficiaries are not counted twice for the  purposes of calculating incentive payments. While officials reported that  the database initially became operational in June 2012, they also said  that they are currently working on significant system upgrades that are  expected in September 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Innovation Center became operational in November 2010 and is still  in the early stages of implementing its first models, with much work\u2014 particularly evaluation activities\u2014to be done in coming years. As of   March 31, 2012, the Innovation Center had announced 17 models,  covering a variety of topics, to test new approaches in health care  delivery and payment. In addition, the Innovation Center has developed  preliminary evaluation plans for each of the 17 models, although at the  time of our review, most still needed to be finalized, and it may take as  long as 3-5 years until the evaluations begin to produce results. With  spending on health care in the United States continuing to increase, and  an appropriation of $10 billion every 10 years, it is important that the  Innovation Center continue the testing of its models and conduct  evaluations as planned in order for CMS to determine the extent to which  the new approaches are able to reduce costs and improve quality of care.", "At the time of our review, we identified three key examples of Innovation  Center models that overlap with efforts being conducted by other offices  within CMS. As the Innovation Center and other CMS offices work in  similar areas\u2014namely paying for and delivering health care to Medicare  and Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014there likely will be additional efforts that  overlap as the center continues to build its portfolio of models and  initiatives. We encourage these efforts to the extent that they are  complementary, well coordinated, and do not result in unnecessary  duplication. However, our review also suggests that while the Innovation  Center has taken steps to coordinate with other offices, it still has work to  do in making this coordination more systematic. For example, the  Innovation Center is considering whether additional policies and  procedures are needed to coordinate its efforts with other offices, and it  will be important for the center to continue to determine the extent to  which this is necessary, particularly as it considers the results of the  evaluation by an outside firm. In addition, the Innovation Center is still  implementing a process to ensure that CMS does not make payments for  duplicative services under HEN contracts in its Partnership for Patients  model\u2014one of its first and most expensive models to date\u2014and QIO  contracts. Given the significance of the Innovation Center\u2019s work, and the  amount of money involved in its operation, having appropriate and well- documented coordination mechanisms in place will be an important step  going forward to help ensure that resources are used most efficiently and  any overlapping efforts do not become unnecessarily duplicative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure the efficient use of federal resources, we recommend  that the Administrator of CMS direct the Innovation Center to  expeditiously complete implementation of its process to review and  eliminate any areas of unnecessary duplication in the services being  provided by HENs and QIOs in hospitals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.

The Innovation Center seeks approval for the model. This includes separate  approval processes for the ICIP, for model funding, and for any solicitations that  would be issued to potential participants.  The approval process includes a sequence of reviews within CMS, within HHS,  and finally with OMB. During these reviews, modifications may be made on the  basis of input from individuals in other CMS centers and offices, in other related  HHS programs, and from OMB.", "Once the ICIP is approved, the Innovation Center issues an announcement and  other information about the model to the public.", "The Innovation Center issues information about how to apply for participation in  the model, including information about which types of providers or organizations  are eligible to participate, the process for submitting applications, and the  selection process. The Innovation Center may also organize webinars or learning  sessions open to the public and interested participants to share information and  answer questions.", "Innovation Center models vary by the type of participant that is involved\u2014for  example, physician group practices, health plans, and state Medicaid  programs.", "Models also vary in terms of the type of agreement that is established with  participants, for example, whether it is a grant, a cooperative agreement, a  contract, or a provider agreement.  The selection process for participants is generally competitive. The criteria  used in the selection process may vary by model. For example, selection  criteria may include such factors as organizational capabilities and plans for  ensuring quality of care. In other cases, eligible participants may be selected  in order to achieve a mix and balance of certain characteristics for evaluation  purposes, for example geographic location (urban, rural) and whether the  participant uses electronic health records.", "The Innovation Center solicits and hires contractors to evaluate the model.  Applicants are asked to propose specific evaluation approaches to the preliminary  evaluation plans that the Innovation Center has identified. Contractors are  selected through a competitive process.
