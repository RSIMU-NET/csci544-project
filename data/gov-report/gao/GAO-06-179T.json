Since 2003, the United States has made available about $30 billion for activities that include the construction and repair of infrastructure, procurement of equipment, and training and equipping of Iraqi security forces. International donors have pledged $13.6 billion in reconstruction funds (from 2004 through 2007), of which about $2.7 billion was provided in multilateral and bilateral grants through August 2005. However, most of the pledged amount''about $10 billion--is in the form of loans on which the Iraqi government largely has not yet drawn. Iraqi funds have primarily supported the country's operating budget, with some focus on capital improvement projects. For 2005, Iraq planned for about $28 billion in expenditures--largely supported by oil proceeds--to fund salaries, pensions, ministry operations, and subsidies. It is likely that Iraq may need more funds than currently available due to the severely degraded infrastructure, post conflict looting and sabotage, and additional security costs. The United States faces three key challenges in stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq. First, the security environment and the continuing strength of the insurgency have made it difficult for the United States to transfer security responsibilities to Iraqi forces and to engage in rebuilding efforts. The security situation in Iraq has deteriorated since June 2003, with significant increases in attacks against the coalition and the coalition's partners. Second, inadequate performance data and measures make it difficult to determine the overall progress and impact of U.S. reconstruction efforts. The United States has set broad goals for providing essential services in Iraq, but limited performance measures present challenges in determining the overall progress and impact of U.S. projects. Third, the U.S. reconstruction program has encountered difficulties with Iraq's ability to maintain new and rehabilitated infrastructure projects and to address maintenance needs in the water, sanitation, and electricity sectors. For example, as of June 2005, U.S.-funded water and sanitation projects representing about $52 million of approximately $200 million spent on completed projects were inoperable or were operating at lower than normal capacity. The United States has made a significant investment in the rebuilding and stabilization of Iraq.

In May 2003, the CPA dissolved the military  organizations of the former regime and began the process of creating or  reestablishing new Iraqi security forces, including the police and a new  Iraqi army. Over time, multinational force commanders assumed  responsibility for recruiting and training some Iraqi defense and police forces in their areas of responsibility. In May 2004, the President issued a  National Security Presidential Directive, which stated that, after the  transition of power to the Iraqi government, the Department of State  (State), through its ambassador to Iraq, would be responsible for all U.S.  activities in Iraq except for security and military operations. U.S. activities  relating to security and military operations would be the responsibility of  the Department of Defense (DOD). The Presidential Directive also  established two temporary offices: (1) the Iraq Reconstruction and  Management Office to facilitate transition of reconstruction efforts to Iraq  and (2) the Project and Contracting Office (PCO) to provide acquisition and  project management support for some U.S.-funded reconstruction projects.  Other U.S. government agencies also play significant roles in the  reconstruction effort.

In February 2004, the multinational force attempted to  quickly shift responsibilities to Iraqi security forces but did not succeed in  this effort. Police and military units performed poorly during an escalation  of insurgent attacks in April 2004, with many Iraqi security forces around  the country collapsing or assisting the insurgency during the uprising.  About that time, the Deputy Secretary of Defense said that the  multinational force was engaged in combat in Iraq, rather than in  peacekeeping as had been expected. The United States decided to maintain  a force level of about 138,000 troops until at least the end of 2005, rather  than drawing down to 105,000 troops by May 2004 as DOD had announced  in November 2003. The United States has maintained roughly the same  force level of 138,000 troops in Iraq since April 2004, as it has sought to  neutralize the insurgency and develop Iraqi security forces.", "In late September and early October 2005, the Secretary of Defense and  senior U.S. military officers reported on their strategy to draw down and  eventually withdraw U.S. forces as Iraq meets certain conditions. These  conditions would consider the level of insurgent activity, readiness and  capability of Iraqi security forces and government institutions, and the  ability of the coalition forces to reinforce the Iraq security forces if  necessary. The ability to meet these conditions will be affected by progress  in political, economic, and other areas. According to the commanding  general of the multinational force, as conditions are met, multinational  forces will progressively draw down in phases around the country. By the  time the multinational force\u2019s end state is achieved, U.S. forces will be  withdrawn or drawn down to levels associated with a normal bilateral  security relationship. The defined end state is an Iraq at peace with its  neighbors, with a representative government that respects the human  rights of all Iraqis, and with a security force that can maintain domestic  order and deny Iraq as a safe haven for terrorists.", "DOD and the multinational force face a number of challenges in  transferring security responsibilities to the Iraqi government and security  forces. As we reported in March 2005, the multinational force faced four  key challenges in increasing the capability of Iraqi forces: (1) training,  equipping, and sustaining a changing force structure; (2) developing a  system for measuring the readiness and capability of Iraq forces; (3)  building loyalty and leadership throughout the Iraqi chain of command; and  (4) developing a police force that upholds the rule of law in a hostile  environment. Further, in a July 2005 report to Congress, DOD noted  continuing problems with absenteeism in the Iraqi Army, Police Service,  and Border Police; among those units conducting operations; and units  relocating elsewhere in Iraq. The report also noted that there was  insufficient information on the extent to which insurgents have infiltrated  Iraqi security forces. However, in an October 2005 report to Congress,  DOD noted insurgent infiltration is a more significant problem in Ministry  of Interior forces than in Ministry of Defence forces. Moreover, in early  October 2005, senior U.S. military officers noted challenges in developing  effective security ministries, as well as logistics capabilities of Iraqi forces.", "Since March 2005, the multinational force has taken some steps to begin  addressing these challenges. For example, the multinational force has  embedded transition teams at the battalion, brigade, and division levels of  Ministry of Defense forces, as well as in the Ministry of Interior\u2019s Special  Police Commando battalions, the Civil Intervention Force, and the  Emergency Response Unit. Multinational force transition teams conduct  new transition readiness assessments that identify the progress and  shortcomings of Iraqi forces. According to DOD\u2019s report, these assessments  take into account a variety of criteria that are similar but not identical to  those the U.S. Army uses to evaluate its units\u2019 operational readiness,  including personnel, command and control, training, sustainment/logistics,  equipment, and leadership. The assessments place Iraqi units into one of  the following four categories:   Level 1 units are fully capable of planning, executing, and sustaining  independent counterinsurgency operations.", "Level 2 units are capable of planning, executing, and sustaining  counterinsurgency operations with coalition support.", "Level 3 units are partially capable of conducting counterinsurgency  operations in conjunction with coalition units.", "Level 4 units are forming or otherwise incapable of conducting  counterinsurgency operations.", "The multinational force is also preparing similar readiness assessments on  the Iraqi police through partnerships at the provincial levels. These  assessments look at factors that are tailored to the tasks of a police force,  including patrol/traffic operations, detainee operations, and case  management.", "According to DOD\u2019s October 2005 report and DOD officials, Iraqi combat  forces have made progress in developing the skills necessary to assume  control of counterinsurgency operations. However, they also recognize that  Iraqi forces will not be able to operate independently for some time  because they need logistical capabilities, ministry capacity, and command  and control and intelligence structures. According to DOD\u2019s October 2005  report, Iraq has 116 police and army combat battalions actively conducting  counter insurgency operations. This number corresponds to the number of  battalions in levels 1, 2, and 3 described above. Of these battalions, 1  battalion was assessed as level 1, that is, fully capable of planning,  executing, and sustaining independent counterinsurgency operations.  Thirty-seven were level 2, or capable of planning, executing, and sustaining  counterinsurgency operations with coalition support; and 78 were level  3\u2014partially capable of conducting counterinsurgency operations in  conjunction with coalition units. The assessment of Iraqi units\u2019 capabilities  also considers the threat level they face. According to a senior U.S. military  officer, Iraqi forces have more quickly progressed from level 3 to level 2 in  areas that have experienced fewer insurgent attacks, such as southern Iraq.", "GAO\u2019s forthcoming classified report on Iraq\u2019s security situation will provide  further information and analysis on the challenges to developing Iraqi  security forces and the conditions for the phased draw down of U.S. and  other coalition forces."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Security Situation Has Affected Rebuilding Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The security situation in Iraq has affected the cost and schedule of  reconstruction efforts. Security conditions have, in part, led to project  delays and increased costs for security services. Although it is difficult to  quantify the costs in time and money resulting from poor security  conditions, both agency and contractor officials acknowledged that  security costs have diverted a considerable amount of reconstruction  resources and have led to canceling or reducing the scope of some  reconstruction projects. For example, in March 2005, the USAID cancelled  two electrical power generation-related task orders totaling nearly $15  million to help pay for increased security costs incurred at another power  generation project in southern Baghdad. In another example, work was  suspended at a sewer repair project in central Iraq for 4 months in 2004 due  to security concerns. In a September 2005 testimony, the Special Inspector  General for Iraq Reconstruction and a USAID official also observed that the  cost of security had taken money away from reconstruction and slowed  down reconstruction efforts.", "However, the actual cost that security has added to reconstruction projects  is uncertain. We reported in July 2005, that, for 8 of 15 reconstruction  contracts we reviewed, the cost to obtain private security providers and  security-related equipment accounted for more than 15 percent of contract  costs, as of December 31, 2004. Our analysis and discussions with agency  and contractor officials identified several factors that influenced security  costs, including (1) the nature and location of the work, (2) the type of  security required and the security approach taken, and (3) the degree to  which the military provided the contractor security services. For example,  projects that took place in fixed locations were generally less expensive to  secure than a project, such as electrical transmission lines, which extended  over a large geographic location. In addition, some contractors made more  extensive use of local Iraqi labor and employed less costly Iraqi security  guards, while others were able to make use of security provided by the U.S.  military or coalition forces.", "Our analysis did not include increased transportation or administrative  expenses caused by security-related work stoppages or delays, or the cost  associated with repairing the damage caused by the insurgency on work  previously completed. We also excluded the cost associated with the  training and equipping of Iraqi security forces and the costs borne by DOD  in maintaining, equipping, and supporting U.S. troops in Iraq.", "In July 2005, to improve agencies\u2019 ability to assess the impact of and  manage security costs in future reconstruction efforts, we recommended  that the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator,  USAID, establish a means to track and account for security costs to  develop more accurate budget estimates. State did not indicate whether it  agreed with our recommendation, Defense agreed, and USAID did not  comment on the recommendation.", "In addition, the security environment in Iraq also has led to severe  restrictions on the movement of civilian staff around the country and  reductions of a U.S. presence at reconstruction sites, according to U.S.  agency officials and contractors. For example, work at a wastewater plant  in central Iraq was halted for approximately 2 months in early 2005 because  insurgent threats drove subcontractors away and made the work too  hazardous to perform. In the assistance provided to support the electoral  process, U.S. funded grantees and contractors also faced security  restrictions that hampered their movements and limited the scope of their  work. For example, IFES was not able to send its advisors to most of the  governorate-level elections administration offices, which hampered  training and operations at those facilities leading up to Iraq\u2019s Election Day  on January 30, 2005.", "While poor security conditions have slowed reconstruction and increased  costs, a variety of management challenges have also adversely affected the  implementation of the U.S. reconstruction program. In September 2005, we  reported that management challenges such as low initial cost estimates and  delays in funding and awarding task orders have also led to the reduced  scope of the water and sanitation program and delays in starting projects.  In addition, U.S. agency and contractor officials have cited difficulties in  initially defining project scope, schedule, and cost, as well as concerns with  project execution, as further impeding progress and increasing program  costs. These difficulties include lack of agreement among U.S. agencies,  contractors, and Iraqi authorities; high staff turnover; an inflationary  environment that makes it difficult to submit accurate pricing;  unanticipated project site conditions; and uncertain ownership of projects  sites."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Performance Data and Measures and Inadequate Reporting Present Difficulties in Determining Progress and Impact of Rebuilding Effort", "paragraphs": ["State has set broad goals for providing essential services, and the U.S.  program has undertaken many rebuilding activities in Iraq.

However, limited  performance data and measures make it difficult to determine and report  on the progress and impact of U.S. reconstruction. For example, in the  water and sanitation, health, and electricity sectors, limited performance  data and reporting measures are output focused and make it difficult to  accurately measure program results and assess the effectiveness of U.S.  reconstruction efforts. Although information is difficult to obtain in an  unstable security environment, opinion surveys and additional outcome  measures have the potential to help determine progress and gauge the  impact of the U.S. reconstruction efforts on the lives of the Iraqi people.", "In the water and sanitation sector, the Department of State has primarily  reported on the numbers of projects completed and the expected  capacity of reconstructed treatment plants. However, we found that the  data are incomplete and do not provide information on the scope and  cost of individual projects nor do they indicate how much clean water is  reaching intended users as a result of these projects. For example,  although State reported that 143 projects were complete as of early July  2005, it could not document the location, scope, and cost of these  projects. Moreover, reporting only the number of projects completed or  under way provides little information on how U.S. efforts are improving  the amount and quality of water reaching Iraqi households or their  access to sanitation services. Information on access to water and its  quality is difficult to obtain without adequate security or water metering  facilities. However, opinion surveys assessing Iraqis\u2019 access and  satisfaction with water sanitation services have found dissatisfaction  with these services. The most recent USAID quality of life survey, in  February 2005, found that just over half of respondents rated their water  supply as poor to fair and over 80 percent rated their sewerage and  wastewater disposal as poor to fair. These surveys demonstrate the  potential for gathering data to help gauge the impact of U.S.  reconstruction efforts.", "Limitations in health sector measurements also make it difficult to  relate the progress of U.S. activities to its overall effort to improve the  quality and access of health care in Iraq. Department of State  measurements of progress in the health sector primarily track the  number of completed facilities, an indicator of increased access to  health care. For example, State reported that the construction of 145 out  of 300 health clinics had been completed, as of August 31, 2005.  However, the data available do not indicate the adequacy of equipment  levels, staffing levels, or quality of care provided to the Iraqi population.  Monitoring the staffing, training, and equipment levels at health facilities  may help gauge the effectiveness of the U.S. reconstruction program  and its impact on the Iraqi people. In addition, opinion surveys assessing  Iraqis\u2019 access and satisfaction with health services also have the  potential for gathering data to help gauge the impact of U.S.  reconstruction efforts. For example, the most recent USAID quality of  life survey, in February 2005, found that the majority of Iraqis approved  of the primary healthcare services they received; although fewer than  half of the respondents approved of the level of health care at Ta\u2019mim,  Al Basrah, and Maysan governorates.", "In the electricity sector, U.S. agencies have primarily reported on  generation measures such as levels of added or restored generation  capacity and daily power generation of electricity; numbers of projects  completed; and average daily hours of power. For example, as of May  2005, U.S.-funded projects reportedly had added or restored about 1,900  megawatts of generation capacity to Iraq\u2019s power grid. However, these  data do not show whether (1) the power generated is uninterrupted for  the period specified (eg., average number of hours per day), (2) there  are regional or geographic differences in the quantity of power  generated, and (3) how much power is reaching intended users.  Information on the distribution and access of electricity is difficult to  obtain without adequate security or accurate metering capabilities.  However, opinion surveys assessing Iraqis\u2019 access and satisfaction with  electricity services have found dissatisfaction with these services. The  February 2005 USAID survey found that 74 percent of the respondents  rated the overall quality of electricity supply as poor or very poor. The  surveys also found that the delivery of electricity directly influenced the  perceived legitimacy of local government for many respondents. These  surveys demonstrate the potential for gathering data to help gauge the  impact of U.S. reconstruction efforts.", "In September 2005, we recommended that the Secretary of State address  this issue of measuring progress and impact in the water and sanitation  sector. State agreed with our recommendation and stated that it is taking  steps to address the problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iraq\u2019s Capacity to Operate and Maintain U.S.-Funded Projects Presents Sustainability Problems", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. reconstruction program has encountered difficulties with the  Iraqis\u2019 ability to sustain the new and rehabilitated infrastructure and  address maintenance needs. In the water, sanitation, and electricity  sectors, in particular, some projects have been completed but have  sustained damage or become inoperable due to the Iraqis\u2019 problems  maintaining or properly operating them.", "In the water and sanitation sector, U.S. agencies have identified limitations  in the Iraqis\u2019 capacity to maintain and operate reconstructed facilities,  including problems with staffing, unreliable power to run treatment plants,  insufficient spare parts, and poor operations and maintenance procedures.  As of June 2005, approximately $52 million of the $200 million in completed  large-scale water and sanitation projects either were not operating or were  operating at lower capacity due to looting of key equipment and shortages  of reliable power, trained Iraqi staff, and required chemicals and supplies.  For example, one repaired wastewater plant was partially shut down due to  the looting of key electrical equipment and repaired water plants in one  southern governorate lacked adequate electricity and necessary water  treatment chemicals. In addition, two projects lacked a reliable power  supply, one lacked sufficient staff to operate properly, and one lacked both  adequate staff and power supplies. In response, U.S. agencies have taken  initial steps to improve Iraqi capacity to operate and maintain water and  sanitation facilities. For example, in August 2005, USAID awarded a  contract to provide additional maintenance and training support for 6  completed water and sanitation facilities.", "The U.S. embassy in Iraq stated that it was moving from the previous model  of building and turning over projects to Iraqi management toward a  \u201cbuild-train-turnover\u201d system to protect the U.S. investment. However,  these efforts are just beginning, and the U.S. assistance does not address  the long-term ability of the Iraqi government to support, staff, and equip  these facilities. It is unclear whether the Iraqis will be able to maintain and  operate completed projects and the more than $1 billion in additional  large-scale water and sanitation projects expected to be completed through  2008. Without assurance that the Iraqis have adequate resources to  maintain and operate completed projects, the U.S. water and sanitation  reconstruction program risks expending funds on projects with limited  long-term impact. In September 2005, we recommended that the Secretary  of State address the issue of sustainability in the water and sanitation  sector. State agreed with our recommendation and stated that it is taking  steps to address the problem.", "In the electricity sector, the Iraqis\u2019 capacity to operate and maintain the  power plant infrastructure and equipment provided by the United States  remains a challenge at both the plant and ministry levels. As a result, the  infrastructure and equipment remain at risk of damage following their  transfer to the Iraqis. In our interviews with Iraqi power plant officials from  13 locations throughout Iraq, the officials stated that their training did not  adequately prepare them to operate and maintain the new U.S.-provided  gas turbine engines. Due to limited access to natural gas, some Iraqi power  plants are using low-grade oil to fuel their natural gas combustion engines.  The use of oil-based fuels, without adequate equipment modification and  fuel treatment, decreases the power output of the turbines by up to 50  percent, requires three times more maintenance, and could result in  equipment failure and damage that significantly reduces the life of the  equipment, according to U.S. and Iraqi power plant officials.", "U.S. officials have acknowledged that more needs to be done to train plant  operators and ensure that advisory services are provided after the turnover  date. To address this issue, USAID implemented a project, in February  2005, to train selected electricity plant officials (plant managers,  supervisors, and equipment operators) in plant operations and  maintenance. According to DOD, PCO also has awarded one contract and  is developing another to address operations and maintenance concerns.", "Although agencies had incorporated some training programs and the  development of operations and maintenance capacity into individual  projects, recent problems with the turnover of completed projects, such as  those in the water and sanitation and electricity sectors, have led to a  greater interagency focus on improving project sustainability. In May 2005,  an interagency working group including State, USAID, PCO, and the Corps  of Engineers, was formed to identify ways of addressing Iraq\u2019s capacity  development needs.", "The working group reported that a number of critical infrastructure  facilities constructed or rehabilitated under U.S. funding have failed, will  fail, or will operate in sub-optimized conditions following handover to the  Iraqis. They found that a number of USAID and PCO projects encountered  significant problems in facility management and operations and  maintenance when turned over to the Iraqis or shortly thereafter. To  mitigate the potential for project failures, the working group recommended  increasing the period of operational support for constructed facilities from  a 90-day period to a period of up to one year. According to a State  department official, as of September 22, 2005, the recommendations are  currently under active consideration and discussion by the Embassy  Baghdad and Washington."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["For the past two and half years, the United States has served as the chief  protector and builder in Iraq.

It is unclear when Iraqi security forces will be capable of  operating independently, thereby enabling the United States to reduce its  military presence.", "Similarly, it is unclear how U.S. efforts are helping the Iraqi people obtain  clean water, reliable electricity, or competent health care. Measuring the  outcomes of U.S. efforts is needed to determine how they are having a  positive impact on the daily lives of the Iraqi people.", "Finally, the United States must ensure that the billions of dollars it has  already invested in Iraq\u2019s infrastructure are not wasted. The Iraqis need  additional training and preparation to operate and maintain the power  plants, water and sewage treatment facilities, and health care centers the  United States has rebuilt or restored. This would help ensure that the  rebuilding efforts improve Iraq\u2019s economy and social conditions and  establish a secure, peaceful, and democratic Iraq.", "We will continue to examine the challenges the United States faces in  rebuilding and stabilizing Iraq. Specifically, we will examine the efforts to  stabilize Iraq and develop its security forces, including the challenge of  ensuring that Iraq can independently fund, sustain, and support its new  security forces; examine the management of the U.S. rebuilding effort,  including program execution; and assess the progress made in developing  Iraq\u2019s energy sectors, including the sectors\u2019 needs, existing resources and  contributions, achievements, and future challenges.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
