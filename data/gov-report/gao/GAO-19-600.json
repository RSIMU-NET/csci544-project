This process involves coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), about 200 bureaus and overseas posts, and the Office of Management and Budget. Even though State's process is complex and does not meet the mandated time frame, State has not systematically reviewed its process since it revised the process in fiscal year 2016.

According to federal internal control standards, agency data systems should provide quality data that is free from errors. However, State's mechanism for collecting information is a spreadsheet-based system susceptible to human errors, and State does not have appropriate controls in place to ensure data consistency.", "Third, in fiscal year 2018, staffing gaps also affected the development of the Section 653(a) report. State's two offices primarily responsible for managing the Section 653(a) process had 15 of 54 full-time equivalent positions vacant, which contributed to delays in submitting the Section 653(a) report, according to State officials.

For example, State officials said  that when the Section 653(a) reporting mandate began the annual  appropriations act contained fewer requirements and directives. The  Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1971,  appropriated $2.2 billion in foreign assistance and was 18 pages in  length.

As previously shown in  figure 3, most of the delays in the fiscal year 2018 process occurred  during the allocation negotiation, review, and agreement phase\u2014which  relies heavily on officials from the offices experiencing staffing gaps.", "According to State officials, the staff shortfall affecting the development of  the fiscal year 2018 Section 653(a) report was due to the State hiring  freeze that affected the entire agency, as well as vacancies among  USAID personnel assigned to State\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance  Resources. State\u2019s hiring freeze took effect in January 2017 and was  lifted in May 2018. In addition, State officials said that USAID has not  filled USAID-funded vacancies within State\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign  Assistance Resources. In fiscal year 2018, nine of the 13 full-time  equivalent positions in State\u2019s Resources and Appropriations office were  funded by USAID, of which four were vacant, and 21 of the 41 full-time  positions in Regional and Global Affairs office were funded by USAID, of  which six were vacant.", "Our 2019 High-Risk Series report calls for agencies to design and  implement action plans for closing skills gaps, which can include when an  agency has an insufficient number of people to complete its work. The  report states that the action plan should define the root cause of all skills  gaps within an agency and provide suggested corrective measures,  including steps necessary to implement solutions. State officials said that  they have received permission to fill the vacant State positions, and  USAID has provided permission to advertise two vacant USAID positions  within State\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources. Thus, that  office is requesting additional State full-time equivalent positions. Despite  these efforts, State and USAID officials said that they do not have an  action plan to address the vacancies. Without a plan to fill these  vacancies, a lack of staff resources will likely continue to impact the  timeliness of the Section 653(a) reports."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Congress appropriates tens of billions of dollars for foreign assistance  annually and mandates the President to report to Congress on how the  U.S. government will allocate funds for foreign countries, by category of  assistance, within 30 days of the enactment of the annual appropriations  act. State and USAID have developed a complex process to balance how  their allocations will meet the detailed requirements and directives within  the annual appropriations acts, the administration\u2019s priorities, and  country-specific foreign assistance needs. However, State has been  unable to meet the mandated time frame for submitting the Section  653(a) report for various reasons. Most importantly, State\u2019s process for  completing the various phases of the Section 653(a) process is not  designed to meet the mandated 30-day deadline. Moreover, State  officials have not systematically reviewed their process since it changed  in fiscal year 2016, to identify areas that can be streamlined or eliminated  to expedite the completion and submission of the report. Additionally,  State\u2019s system for collecting input on foreign assistance allocations from  its various offices, bureaus, and overseas posts is prone to data entry  errors that take extra time to correct, contributing to delays in submitting  the Section 653(a) report. Further, State\u2019s two offices primarily  responsible for managing the Section 653(a) process had a substantial  number of positions vacant in 2018 but did not have a formal plan to  address the resulting skills gaps.

To determine the timeliness associated with the development and  submission of State\u2019s Section 653(a) reports for fiscal years 2015 through  2018, we also reviewed documentation to identify when the Department  of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Acts  were enacted, the mandated submission dates, and compared those  dates with the dates that State submitted the reports to Congress.

For those factors that we identified, we  requested and analyzed additional information as described below.", "In reviewing State\u2019s Section 653(a) process, we analyzed State and  USAID guidance documents and reports developed to address Section  653(a) mandates. We reviewed State\u2019s analyses that identified the  requirements and directives in the annual appropriations acts and joint  explanatory statements for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. These  requirements and directives outline how the agencies should allocate the  funding for programs and for countries and international organizations. In  addition, we reviewed State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s guidance documents that  outlined the Section 653(a) process.

We assessed State\u2019s process against federal standards for  internal control, which state that management sets objectives to meet the  requirements of applicable laws and regulations. We also assessed the  process against GAO\u2019s guidance on business process reengineering,  which outlines best practices on how agencies should model their  processes.", "To examine the quality of the data State collects during development of  the Section 653(a) reports, we reviewed whether State\u2019s analyses  followed State\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual requirement that State must  maintain effective systems of management control programs designed to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention of or prompt  detection of errors and irregularities. We analyzed State\u2019s reports on the  requirements and directives in the annual appropriations acts from fiscal  year 2015 through 2018. In addition, we validated a judgmental sample of  the requirements and directives that State identified to ensure that they  were in the applicable appropriations act, joint explanatory statement, and  reports from the appropriations committees in the Senate and House of  Representatives. Although we identified an error in the appropriated  amount recorded for the fiscal year 2016 International Narcotics Control  and Law Enforcement account, we did not find errors specific to the  requirements and directives State identified. Therefore, we concluded that  the analyses were sufficiently reliable for our purpose, and we used  State\u2019s analyses to determine the total number of requirements and  directives. Moreover, we reviewed the fiscal year 2015 through 2018  appropriations acts to identify the amounts appropriated for the accounts  included in the corresponding Section 653(a) reports.
