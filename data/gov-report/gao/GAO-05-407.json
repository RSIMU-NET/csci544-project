In our report, which is included in  the fiscal year 2004 Financial Report of the United States Government, we  reported material deficiencies relating to Treasury\u2019s preparation of  the CFS.

Statement of Federal Financial Accounting  Concepts No. 4, Intended Audience and Qualitative Characteristics for  the Consolidated Financial Report of the United States Government,  states that the consolidated financial report should be a general purpose  report that is aggregated from agency reports and that it should tell users  where to find information in other formats, both aggregated and  disaggregated, such as in individual agency reports, on agency Web sites,  and in the President\u2019s Budget. In our prior report, we recommended that as  Treasury continues to design and further implement its new process for  compiling the CFS, the Secretary of the Treasury direct the Fiscal Assistant  Secretary, in coordination with the Controller of the OMB, to modify  Treasury\u2019s closing package to (1) require federal agencies to directly link  their audited financial statement notes to the CFS notes and (2) provide the  necessary information to demonstrate that all of the five principal  consolidated financial statements are consistent with the underlying  information in federal agencies\u2019 audited financial statements and other  financial data.", "As discussed in our fiscal year 2004 audit report, Treasury made progress in  laying the foundation to address certain long-standing material deficiencies  in preparing the CFS. Foremost is the ongoing development of a new  system, the Governmentwide Financial Reporting System (GFRS), to  collect agency financial statement information taken directly from federal  agencies\u2019 audited financial statements rather than using federal agencies\u2019  Standard General Ledger data, as Treasury had done in previous years to  compile the CFS. The goal of the new system is to be able to directly link  information from federal agencies\u2019 audited financial statements to amounts  reported in the CFS, a concept that we strongly support. Once Treasury is  able to achieve this, a major impediment to our ability to audit the CFS  would be eliminated.", "Based on our review of Treasury\u2019s new process for compiling the CFS, we  found that Treasury was unable to demonstrate that the information in the  fiscal year 2004 CFS directly linked to agencies\u2019 audited financial  statements. Even though Treasury required each significant agency to  submit its audited financial statement data in the GFRS closing package  and certify their accuracy, the closing package does not require federal  agencies to directly link their audited financial statement notes to the  closing package notes and does not require the necessary information to  compile all five of the required consolidated financial statements. In some  cases, we found that Treasury was unable to demonstrate that the financial  information in the CFS directly linked to federal agencies\u2019 audited financial  statements because federal agencies provided Treasury with incomplete  and inaccurate financial information. Also, because of other internal  control weaknesses over the compilation process noted in this report,  Treasury could not fully ensure that the information in the CFS was  consistent with underlying information in agencies\u2019 audited financial  statements and other financial data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controls over the Compilation Process", "paragraphs": ["We continued to find that there are specific areas of internal control in  Treasury\u2019s process for compiling the CFS that need to be strengthened.  Treasury had to resort to last-minute, alternative methods to gather the  needed fiscal year 2004 information. These problems were compounded by  Treasury\u2019s reliance on internal controls that were dependent on procedures  that would attempt to identify any errors after they were made by an  agency (detective controls) rather than on internal controls that may have  prevented or minimized the errors from occurring (preventive controls).  Treasury had planned to perform certain tests of its new fiscal year 2004  process and design the necessary internal controls by collecting agencies\u2019  fiscal year 2003 financial information during the summer of fiscal year  2004. Although Treasury did collect the fiscal year 2003 financial  information, it did not perform the necessary detailed tests to identify and  correct potential issues with its new reporting process and develop  adequate internal control for the fiscal year 2004 reporting process.", "Internal control should provide, among other things, reasonable assurance  that financial reporting is reliable. GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government defines the minimum level of quality  acceptable for internal control in the federal government and provides the  standards against which internal control is to be evaluated. These  standards state that internal controls should include (1) segregation of  duties, (2) appropriate documentation of transactions and internal control,  (3) reviews by management at the functional or activity level, and  (4) access controls over information systems. We found many internal  controls in place, but we also continued to identify areas that need to be  improved, as well as the need for a strong financial reporting  infrastructure. As Treasury continues to develop its new compilation  process, implementing adequate internal control remains important and  needs to be considered during the development process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Segregation of Duties", "paragraphs": ["Segregation of duties is the practice of dividing the steps in a critical  function among different individuals in order to reduce the risk of error,  thus preventing a single individual from having full control of a transaction  or event. Lack of proper segregation of duties for critical processes leaves  the CFS vulnerable to errors and could result in incomplete and inaccurate  summarization of data within these financial statements. During our fiscal  year 2004 audit, we identified a lack of segregation of duties over  (1) Treasury\u2019s new process for preparing governmentwide adjustments to  the financial statements,(2) the process for making changes to Excel  spreadsheets that contain audited agency financial information, and  (3) access to federal agencies\u2019 closing package data in Treasury\u2019s new  system. The lack of segregation of duties over these areas allowed a single  Treasury employee to perform functions that should have been divided  among several employees. In each of the following examples, a single  Treasury employee was allowed to  determine and approve the amount of a journal voucher to adjust the   solely determine needed changes to the Excel spreadsheets and make  the changes without obtaining any approval, and  have access to agency closing package data entered in Treasury\u2019s new  system by individual agencies and edit the same information without  obtaining approval from the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appropriate Documentation of Transactions and Internal Control", "paragraphs": ["Agency management is responsible for developing appropriate detailed  policies, procedures, and practices to perform agency operations and  ensuring that internal control is an integral part of operations. Although  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for  clear documentation of policies and procedures and transactions, we  continued to find that many key policies and procedures were not  documented in Treasury\u2019s standard operating procedures and that Treasury  did not have appropriate supporting documentation for all transactions  recorded in the CFS.", "In our prior report, we recommended that the Secretary of the Treasury  direct the Fiscal Assistant Secretary to develop and fully document policies  and procedures for the consolidated financial statement preparation  process so that they are proper, complete, and consistently applied among  staff members. Without documented policies and procedures, staff could  apply practices inconsistently or not perform necessary practices at all.  However, during our fiscal year 2004 audit, we found that Treasury had not  fully documented its policies and procedures for preparing the CFS before  the fiscal year 2004 process began and continued to develop its policies and  procedures throughout our audit and up to the end-of-fieldwork date.  Treasury\u2019s standard operating procedures did not include the following key  procedures:  procedures for correcting any errors identified in agencies\u2019 closing   detailed and comprehensive procedures for the allocation of certain  costs on the statement of net cost; and  procedures for compiling information that was not collected in GFRS or  Excel spreadsheets, such as how to properly analyze and compile  contingency information.", "Also, Treasury did not have appropriate supporting documentation for all  transactions recorded in the CFS. Recording transactions in the financial  statements without adequate underlying support increases the risk that  inappropriate adjustments to balances in the financial statements could be  made. Specifically, we found that 20 of the 51 journal vouchers recorded in  Treasury\u2019s journal voucher log did not have adequate supporting  documentation. Eighteen of these journal vouchers were necessary  because agencies submitted data in their closing packages that did not  agree to their audited financial statements. Treasury did not document  communications with these agencies before recording such adjustments.  For example, we found that the supporting documentation for 13 fiscal  year 2004 journal vouchers to correct agency data was simply a printout  from GFRS or a copy of a page from an agency\u2019s financial statements  without any agency confirmation of the correction.

Transactions and other significant events should be authorized and  executed only by persons acting within the scope of their authority.  Appropriate reviews by management of key decisions and data are vital  controls to ensure that only authorized actions occur. Inadequate  management reviews and lack of documentation of changes, reviews, and  approvals could allow the CFS to be manipulated or changed without any  supervisory control or review, resulting in the possibility that agency data  could be changed or incorrectly compiled in the CFS. For example, we  found that some changes to the Excel spreadsheets used to compile agency  financial information were not documented, and therefore, there was no  documentation of review and approval from management. We also found  that not all journal vouchers were approved by management before being  recorded in the CFS.

Limiting access ensures that access to very sensitive  resources is limited to very few individuals and that employees are  restricted from performing incompatible functions or functions beyond  their responsibility. Treasury\u2019s lack of adequate controls to prevent  inappropriate access increases the risk of unauthorized information or  computer resource modification, disclosure, loss, or impairment.  Specifically, we found that inappropriate access to GFRS was granted to  certain Treasury personnel, and the GFRS database was not configured to  prevent the unauthorized alteration of data submitted by federal agencies.

As a result, we found that Treasury\u2019s Financial Management  Service personnel had excessive workloads and that an extraordinary  amount of effort and dedication was required to compile the CFS.

While the FASAB standard does not require the CFS to  include the Statement of Budgetary Resources and Statement of Financing,  which are required financial statements at the agency level, the standard  should not be interpreted to mean that none of the information reported in  federal agency financial statements is relevant to the Reconciliation of Net  Operating Cost and Unified Budget Deficit and the Statement of Changes in  Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities. For example,  federal agencies report net outlays in their Statements of Budgetary  Resources, and net outlays for all federal agencies are reflected in the  budget deficit amount reported in the Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost  and Unified Budget Deficit and Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from  Unified Budget and Other Activities in the CFS. During our fiscal year 2004  audit, we identified material differences between net outlays reported by  the agencies and the records used by Treasury to report net outlays at the  consolidated level, totaling about $69 billion.", "When differences arise between the amounts Treasury uses to compile the  CFS and related amounts federal agencies are reporting, it is important for  management of the federal government to understand and be able to  explain those differences and take corrective action where needed. For  fiscal year 2004, the Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost and Unified  Budget Deficit and Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified  Budget and Other Activities included some amounts that Treasury could  not explain or fully support or for which Treasury could not demonstrate  the link to agencies\u2019 audited financial statements. We continue to believe  that the process of directly linking relevant audited federal agencies\u2019  financial statement information to these two financial statements would be  the most efficient and effective manner for Treasury, as the preparer of the  CFS, to obtain and demonstrate the necessary assurance on certain  information reported in such financial statements. As such, we have not  modified our recommendations in this area.", "Treasury stated that it would welcome specific recommendations to  address problems with its Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost and Unified  Budget Deficit and Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified  Budget and Other Activities. In this regard, we have previously provided  several specific recommendations to Treasury regarding the preparation  and reporting of these financial statements, and these recommendations  are included in appendix II of this report. Our recommendations are  intended to allow some flexibility in developing viable solutions to address  the issues. At the same time, we believe it is crucial that Treasury develop  corrective actions to address our recommendations now as it is still  designing and further implementing its new system and process for  compiling the CFS. Prolonging corrective actions could result in additional  costs to Treasury if it decides later to modify its new system to collect and  compile additional information.", "This report contains recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury  and the Director of OMB.
