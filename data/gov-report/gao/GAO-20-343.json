First, it is unclear which U.S. agencies were present at or aware of various interactions where nuclear cooperation was or may have been discussed, except for the formal negotiations in 2012 and 2018 and a commercial mission coordinated with State. GAO was able to identify eight interactions where nuclear cooperation was discussed and five more interactions where nuclear cooperation may have been discussed (see figure).", "Note: Interactions depicted in this figure include meetings, phone calls, and a letter, among other things.", "Second, GAO was unable to determine whether the agencies kept the committees fully and currently informed.

According to congressional staff, Congress on occasion learned of developments through non-agency sources and had to apply forceful measures, including holds on nominations, to get information from the executive branch. By committing to regular briefings to Congress on nuclear cooperation negotiations and initiatives, State could better support congressional oversight on nuclear nonproliferation matters. In addition, congressional staff have said the AEA allows for broad interpretation of the \u201cfully and currently informed\u201d requirement.

Since 2008, when the  United States and Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding  on nuclear energy cooperation, the current and prior U.S. administrations  have engaged in discussions and negotiations about nuclear cooperation  with the Saudi government. In October 2017, the Saudi government  issued a solicitation to procure its first nuclear power reactor, and invited  the United States, the Republic of Korea, China, Russia, and France to  bid on the contract. Some members of Congress and nonproliferation  experts have expressed concerns that a civilian nuclear program could  enable Saudi Arabia to develop a capability to produce nuclear-weapons  material. Senior Saudi officials have stated publicly that there could be  conditions under which the country would seek to acquire nuclear  weapons or develop a nuclear weapons program.", "Under Section 123, the Department of State (State) is responsible for  negotiating the agreements, with the \u201ctechnical assistance and  concurrence\u201d of the Department of Energy (DOE).

Specifically, beginning in May 2019, we requested from State,  DOE, and the NSC basic factual information on license applications for  the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia; the dates of any  discussions or negotiations between U.S. and Saudi officials; the U.S.  and Saudi agencies, offices, and representatives present at such  meetings; and the types of records produced from such meetings. DOE  provided us with information on the license applications, and State and  DOE provided us with limited information on their general processes  relating to the negotiations of agreements. After reviewing a preliminary  draft of this report, State officials in January 2020 provided a list of  congressional briefings on U.S. nuclear cooperation initiatives since 2013.  However, these officials declined to discuss the details of the briefings  with us, including the participating agencies, substantive issues, and  other details that would have allowed us to establish the extent of  information provided to Congress on U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation  negotiations. Furthermore, neither agency nor the NSC provided  substantive information in any of the other categories we requested. In  order to complete this review within a time frame responsive to the needs  of our congressional requesters, we adjusted our audit objectives to focus  on describing the status of the negotiations and management of the  negotiations process. Because State, DOE, and NSC did not provide  information to fully address these adjusted objectives, we obtained  documentation and information from other agency officials and over 30  other stakeholders, including former U.S. government officials, current  and former congressional staff, and nuclear industry representatives and  knowledgeable nongovernmental experts who have followed the  negotiations.

For example, the Additional Protocol requires states to  declare the location and status, among other things, of uranium mines  and uranium and thorium mills. Under a CSA alone, material in mining  or ore processing activities (e.g., uranium at mines and mills) is not  subject to the agency\u2019s safeguards as it is not yet suitable for enrichment.

This broad restriction on any enrichment and  reprocessing, which became known as the \u201cgold standard,\u201d goes beyond  the enrichment and reprocessing restriction required by Section 123 of  the AEA, because it applies to all nuclear material rather than just U.S.- obligated material.

Specifically, stakeholders identified the  following benefits:  A nuclear cooperation agreement would limit production of  weapons-usable material. Several stakeholders told us that a nuclear  cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia would give the United States  the opportunity to directly restrict Saudi Arabia\u2019s proliferation potential.  For example, a U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation agreement would include  a term required by the AEA that would limit Saudi Arabia\u2019s production of  weapons-usable material by prohibiting Saudi Arabia from separating  plutonium accumulated in any reactor supplied under the agreement  without U.S. consent. According to some stakeholders, other potential  supplier countries likely would not impose such restrictions as conditions  of supplying Saudi Arabia with nuclear materials or equipment.", "Cooperation would help the United States retain influence. Several  stakeholders noted that nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia could help  revitalize the United States as a global nuclear supplier, which would help  the United States retain its current influence over global nonproliferation  norms and rules. For example, as a global nuclear supplier, the United  States would have greater influence in international nuclear forums such  as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which establishes nonproliferation  guidelines. According to one stakeholder, the United States\u2019 political  leverage to promote strong global nonproliferation norms depends upon  the United States\u2019 retaining a leadership role in nuclear energy. Another  stakeholder said that nuclear cooperation agreements provide the United  States with influence over countries\u2019 proliferation decisions. For instance,  this stakeholder said that nuclear cooperation agreements include legal  conditions that reinforce the legal obligations of the Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and create an additional  disincentive to violate those conditions or withdraw from the treaty.", "Stakeholders we interviewed also identified several proliferation concerns  that U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation may not mitigate, and could potentially aggravate. According to these stakeholders, concerns include  the following:  Concerns about stated Saudi nuclear weapon ambitions and  commitment to obligations. Some stakeholders expressed concern  over Saudi officials\u2019 stated interest in acquiring nuclear weapons. As  previously noted, senior Saudi officials have said publicly that there could  be conditions under which the country would seek to acquire nuclear  weapons or develop a nuclear weapons program. For example, Saudi  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said publicly in 2018 that if Iran  develops or obtains a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would also work to  do so. In 2009 and 2012, respectively, King Abdullah and Prince Turki al- Faisal were reported to have made similar statements. Some  stakeholders said that the intent behind such statements was to send a  message about Saudi Arabia\u2019s posture toward Iran, but some other  stakeholders said that lower-lever Saudi officials have also indicated that  the country is open to pursuing nuclear weapons. Several stakeholders  said that such statements should be taken seriously as indicators of  Saudi nuclear weapons ambitions. One stakeholder said that such  statements raise concerns as to Saudi Arabia\u2019s commitment to its  obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  This stakeholder also said that Saudi Arabia has demonstrated  willingness to disregard the terms of transfers of U.S. conventional arms  to the country, calling into question whether the country could be trusted  to abide by the terms of the nuclear cooperation agreement.", "Concerns about the extent to which a nuclear cooperation  agreement would mitigate the risks of a Saudi weapons program.  Several stakeholders questioned whether the terms of an agreement  would meaningfully restrict proliferation behavior. For example,  notwithstanding the provision of Section 123 of the AEA that prohibits a  partner country from using U.S.-obligated material or equipment for  weapons purposes, some stakeholders said that another risk of nuclear  cooperation is that it would provide Saudi Arabia with the infrastructure  and knowledge to produce nuclear material for a future weapons  program. In addition, some stakeholders said that there were questions  as to whether the United States could enforce the terms of an agreement  if it was breached\u2014for example, whether in practice the United States  would be able to retrieve U.S.-obligated nuclear material from another  country. One stakeholder also noted that the terms of a nuclear  cooperation agreement would only be relevant in mitigating proliferation  risks if Saudi Arabia contracted with a U.S. company to build the  reactors. If Saudi Arabia purchases reactors from other suppliers, its  nuclear program will not be bound by the section 123-mandated  restrictions of a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States,  since those restrictions only apply to U.S.-obligated material.", "Concerns about the thoroughness of a U.S. assessment of Saudi  proliferation risks. Some stakeholders raised concerns about whether  the NPAS process would adequately assess Saudi proliferation risks. We  have previously identified weaknesses in the NPAS process related to  interagency consultation and a robust, transparent review process. As  described above, an NPAS for a U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation  agreement would be expected to include an overview of Saudi Arabia\u2019s  nuclear energy program and related infrastructure, nonproliferation  policies, and relations with countries of proliferation concern. An NPAS  would also include an analysis of the adequacy of safeguards and other  control mechanisms to ensure that assistance provided under the U.S.- Saudi agreement is not used to further any nuclear weapons effort. Some  stakeholders said that it would be important for the NPAS for Saudi  Arabia to address the questions regarding the country\u2019s stated intentions  to develop a nuclear weapons program. One stakeholder questioned  whether an NPAS would provide a sufficient assessment of Saudi nuclear  proliferation behavior or potential because the statutory requirement for  intelligence community input into the NPAS is narrowly worded.  Specifically, the addendum that the intelligence community is to provide  to each NPAS is required to contain a comprehensive analysis of the  country\u2019s export control system with respect to nuclear-related matters,  including interactions with other countries of proliferation concern and the  actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile-related transfers to such  countries, but the requirement does not call for the intelligence community  to assess the country\u2019s intent to develop nuclear weapons. State  officials declined to tell us whether they had begun drafting an NPAS in  anticipation of an agreement with Saudi Arabia. However, State officials  noted that their engagement with the intelligence community in the  development of an NPAS goes beyond the requirements of that statute,  but they also said that the legal requirement was limited.", "Concerns about regional proliferation risks and undermining of  global nonproliferation norms. Several stakeholders expressed  concerns about the regional and international nonproliferation implications  of a U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation agreement. For example, several  stakeholders said that an agreement without restrictions on enrichment  and reprocessing could lead to the renegotiation of the agreement with  the UAE. The agreement with the UAE, which includes a commitment to  forswear enrichment and reprocessing, also contains a provision that  would allow the UAE to request renegotiation of its agreement if another  country in the region concludes a less restrictive agreement with the  United States. Several stakeholders also raised the concern that a  nuclear cooperation agreement without additional nonproliferation  conditions would undermine U.S. and global nonproliferation norms by  sending the message that such norms were negotiable. For example, in  addition to the Additional Protocol being a mechanism to prevent  diversion of nuclear material, many stakeholders said that insisting on the  Additional Protocol was critical and emphasized the importance of the  Additional Protocol as a global nonproliferation norm. Several  stakeholders also questioned the premise that supplying Saudi Arabia\u2019s  nuclear program would allow the United States to retain influence over  international nonproliferation norms. One stakeholder said that the United  States has not been a significant nuclear exporter for decades and has  nonetheless retained its influence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nuclear Cooperation Negotiations with Saudi Arabia Have Stalled over Differences over Nonproliferation Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The United States and Saudi Arabia have not made significant progress  toward a nuclear cooperation agreement because of persistent  differences between the parties over nonproliferation conditions, including  U.S. insistence that Saudi Arabia conclude an Additional Protocol with  IAEA and that Saudi Arabia agree to restrictions on enrichment and  reprocessing, based on our analysis of available information.", "The United States and Saudi Arabia first held formal nuclear cooperation  negotiations in 2012, during which the United States provided a draft  agreement text to Saudi officials that included the nine nonproliferation  conditions required under Section 123 of the AEA, according to NNSA  officials.

In the next formal  negotiations in 2018, there was no progress in resolving the remaining  issues, and no changes to the text of the agreement were made at the  time, according to agency officials. The areas of disagreement that were  not resolved in 2012\u2014including those regarding provisions required by  the AEA\u2014remained unresolved as of January 2020, according to agency  officials.

The United States has urged Saudi Arabia to  conclude an Additional Protocol with IAEA, according to a September  2019 letter from the Secretary of Energy to the Saudi Minister of  Energy, Industry, and Mineral Resources and based on public  statements by the Secretary of Energy and another government  official. Several former agency officials and other stakeholders said  that Saudi Arabia has expressed an unwillingness to conclude an  Additional Protocol with IAEA.", "Restriction on enrichment and reprocessing. According to public  statements by agency officials, the United States supports a  permanent restriction on enrichment and reprocessing. According to  the Secretary\u2019s September 2019 letter and to former officials we  interviewed, however, the United States may be willing to accept a  temporary restriction on enrichment and reprocessing in its  negotiations with Saudi Arabia. According to these former officials,  such a temporary restriction would allow the United States and other  countries more time to work with Saudi Arabia to reach agreement on  mutually acceptable terms. However, one stakeholder said that this  option would not be attractive to Saudi Arabia and would not be useful  to the United States as a nonproliferation measure because an  existing nuclear cooperation agreement and any nuclear infrastructure  that it would have enabled would reduce U.S. leverage to influence  Saudi enrichment and reprocessing decisions in the future.", "Despite the lingering disagreement on certain provisions between both  countries, NNSA officials told us in November 2019 they believed the  negotiations had made progress since 2012 because the continued  interactions with Saudi officials over this time were useful in advancing  Saudi understanding of the United States\u2019 position on the nonproliferation  conditions of a potential agreement.", "We are unable to characterize Saudi views on the status of the  negotiations or on other aspects of our review, because State did not  respond to our repeated requests for assistance in facilitating travel to  Saudi Arabia and interviews with relevant Saudi officials.

State did not respond to our  initial request in May 2019 for information on dates and related details of  any congressional briefings it held on U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation  negotiations. However, in January 2020, after reviewing a preliminary  draft of this report, State officials provided a list of congressional briefings  on U.S. nuclear cooperation initiatives since 2013.", "We reviewed this list and identified two briefings specifically focused on  nuclear cooperation negotiations with Saudi Arabia: one held in January  2018 for House Committee on Foreign Affairs staff and another held in  May 2019 for House Committee on Oversight and Reform staff. State  officials also noted that U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation may have been  discussed in other State briefings that focused on nuclear cooperation in  general or with other countries, such as briefings to the House Committee  on Foreign Affairs and Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in July  2019 and November 2019. State officials declined to discuss the details  of any congressional briefings with us, including the participating  agencies, substantive issues, and other details. Consequently, we could  not establish the extent and substance of information the agencies  provided to Congress on U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation negotiations.", "After State did not provide us with the information we requested, we  reached out to a number of current and former staff of the House  Committee on Foreign Affairs and Senate Committee on Foreign  Relations, representing both parties. Through our interviews with eight of  these staff, we were able to identify one congressional briefing by the  agencies in December 2017 on the status of U.S.-Saudi nuclear  cooperation negotiations. However, based on our interviews with  congressional staff, we were unable to identify the dates of any other  briefings by the agencies on the U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation  negotiations. Notably, based on our review of the documentation and  interviews with congressional staff, it does not appear that the agencies  provided a briefing to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs or Senate Committee on Foreign Relations until more than a year after the last  formal U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation negotiations in March 2018.", "Current and former congressional staff we interviewed also described  their frustration in trying to obtain information, beyond briefings, from the  agencies on the status of the negotiations. Several current and former  congressional committee staff we interviewed told us that they learned of  developments in the U.S.-Saudi negotiations through the press or from  representatives of the nuclear industry, rather than directly from the  agencies, despite having asked the executive branch to keep them  informed of any developments. For example, one former staff member of  a relevant committee told us that they learned of the March 2018 formal  negotiations just days before the meeting through a press article. Another  former congressional committee staff member said that since late 2017,  the agencies have only provided information to Congress about the  negotiations in response to forceful measures, such as holds on  nominations or legislation. According to many of the current and former  congressional staff we interviewed, this stands in contrast to past practice  in which agencies regularly briefed the committees on nuclear  cooperation negotiations without coercion, and sometimes even initiated  the meetings.", "State and DOE provided Congress with contradictory justifications for not  providing such information to Congress, according to our review of  documents and interviews with congressional staff. For example, one  congressional committee staff member told us that agency officials said  they were not obligated to keep the committee currently and fully  informed of negotiations because the United States was not in  negotiations with Saudi Arabia. On another occasion, when pressed by  members of Congress in congressional hearings, an agency official said  he could not discuss nuclear cooperation negotiations with Saudi Arabia  because negotiations were ongoing. Specifically, in September 2019, the  Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and  Nonproliferation stated in a hearing that he could not get into details of  nuclear cooperation negotiations with Saudi Arabia because the  negotiations were ongoing. These contradictory justifications may have  led to inconsistency in the agencies providing information to Congress on  nuclear cooperation negotiations. By committing to regularly scheduled,  substantive briefings to Congress on nuclear cooperation initiatives and  negotiations, State and DOE could enhance transparency and build  confidence with Congress on nuclear cooperation, preemptively address  congressional concerns about cooperation with certain countries, and  support congressional oversight on nonproliferation matters.", "Former congressional staff, including those involved in drafting Section  123(e) in 2008\u2014the \u201cfully and currently informed\u201d provision\u2014said the  intent of the provision was to promote transparency on the status of any  nuclear cooperation negotiations to the congressional committees of  jurisdiction to lay the groundwork for congressional consideration of any  agreement. However, some former congressional staff said that the  provision allows for broad interpretation and that it may be up to  Congress to more clearly define the \u201cfully and currently informed\u201d  requirement. By specifying, through an amendment to the AEA, its  expectations for timeliness and information provided by the agencies on  nuclear cooperation negotiations and initiatives, Congress could have  better assurance that it will get the information it needs for its oversight of  nuclear nonproliferation matters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["State officials told us that they consistently provided information to  Congress on the nuclear cooperation negotiations and other interactions  with Saudi Arabia.

To examine U.S. agency  management of the negotiations, including how the agencies have  informed Congress about the negotiations, we reviewed official  documentation such as agency correspondence to Saudi officials, certain  export authorization application packages, dates of congressional  briefings on nuclear cooperation, and agency documentation related to  U.S. government advocacy for U.S. businesses related to nuclear  cooperation with Saudi Arabia.

Specifically, beginning in May 2019, we requested from the  Departments of State and Energy and the National Security Council  (NSC) basic factual information on license applications for the transfer of  nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia; the dates of any discussions or  negotiations between U.S. and Saudi officials; the U.S. and Saudi  agencies, offices, and representatives present at such meetings; and the  types of records produced from such meetings. DOE provided us with  information on the license applications, and State and DOE provided us  with limited information on their general processes relating to the  negotiation of agreements.

Furthermore,  neither agency nor NSC provided substantive information in any of the  other categories we requested; in order to complete this review within a  time frame responsive to the needs of our congressional requesters, we  adjusted our audit objectives to focus on examining the status of the  negotiations and management of the negotiations process. Because  State, NSC, and DOE did not provide information to fully address these  adjusted objectives, we obtained documentation and information from  other agency officials and over 30 other stakeholders, including, as  previously noted, former senior U.S. government officials, current and  former congressional staff, and nuclear industry representatives and  knowledgeable nongovernmental experts who have followed the  negotiations.", "We conducted our work from April 2019 through April 2020 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.
