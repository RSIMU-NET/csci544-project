For this report, GAO examined (1) the number and cost of compounded drugs paid for by TRICARE in fiscal year 2013, and (2) TRICARE's payment practices for compounded drugs and how they compare to other federal health care programs. GAO reviewed and analyzed TRICARE data on compounded drugs and reviewed, analyzed, and compared federal laws, regulations, and other documents pertaining to pharmacy and medical benefits under TRICARE, Medicare, and the VA health care system.

Most of these compounded drug prescriptions were dispensed in retail pharmacies and to retirees and their family members. Compounded drug prescriptions paid for by TRICARE's pharmacy benefit cost $259 million in fiscal year 2013\u2014accounting for about 3 percent of the total cost of all prescription drugs paid for through TRICARE\u2018s pharmacy benefit\u2014up from $5 million in fiscal year 2004, and were largely driven by compounded drug prescriptions containing bulk drug substances. Bulk drug substances are typically raw powders that are generally not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2014the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for assuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs and approving them for marketing in the United States. TRICARE could not identify compounded drug prescriptions paid for through its medical benefit, which pays for drugs administered to patients in outpatient or inpatient settings, because claim forms for outpatient and inpatient drugs lack specific billing codes.", "TRICARE's payment practices for certain compounded drugs under its pharmacy and medical benefit are inconsistent with TRICARE regulations and are typically more generous than those of Medicare and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Through its pharmacy benefit, TRICARE pays for compounded drugs that contain bulk drug substances in a manner that is inconsistent with its regulations, which stipulate that TRICARE is to pay for FDA-approved drugs only. In contrast, Medicare and VA have more restrictive payment practices for compounded drugs provided through their pharmacy benefits. By paying for compounded drugs containing bulk drug substances, TRICARE incurred additional costs. DOD officials told us that they are considering denying payment for compounded drugs that include bulk drug substances. TRICARE also pays for compounded drugs administered to patients through its medical benefit but does not determine whether these drugs contain bulk drug substances, in which case payment practices may be inconsistent with TRICARE's regulations. TRICARE's payment practices for these drugs are similar to Medicare's, but more generous than VA's.", "Though compounded drugs represent a small share of TRICARE's overall drug costs, its costs for these drugs have risen significantly in recent years.

Traditionally, a drug is compounded through the  process of mixing, combining, or altering ingredients to create a  customized drug tailored to the medical needs of an individual patient  upon receipt of a prescription. Drug compounding is typically used to  prepare prescription drugs that are not commercially available; for  example, a pharmacist may prepare a liquid formulation for a patient who  has trouble swallowing pills or tailor a drug for a patient who is allergic to  an ingredient in a commercially available prescription drug. Drug  compounding is practiced in a variety of pharmacy settings, including  retail pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies, and home infusion pharmacies,  as well as hospital pharmacies. Compounded drugs may be dispensed  directly to patients in pharmacy settings, or administered to patients in  inpatient or outpatient settings, such as hospitals or physician offices.", "Compounded drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA)\u2014the agency within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) responsible for assuring the safety and  effectiveness of drugs and approving them for marketing in the United  States.

Traditionally, the practice of drug compounding has been regulated by  state pharmacy regulatory bodies (e.g., boards of pharmacies). FDA and  others have raised concerns that some pharmacies are going beyond the  traditional practice of preparing compounded drugs for individual patients  by producing large quantities of compounded drugs without prescriptions  for individual patients, and selling these drugs to facilities in multiple  states with no assurance of their having met the safety and legal  requirements with which drug manufacturers must comply. In addition, in  2012, an outbreak of fungal meningitis linked to contaminated  compounded drugs raised concerns about the safety and quality of  compounded drugs.

Officials from one of  these two organizations told us that the organization requires providers to  submit NDCs for each ingredient to determine which ingredients are FDA- approved products and does not pay for bulk drug substances, unless the  organization determines that they are medically necessary. Officials from  the second organization told us that the organization requires providers to  submit supporting documentation, including invoices that list the name  and amount of each ingredient in the compounded drug. A third  organization reviews claims and requests additional documentation only  when the amount for a drug billed under the nonspecific HCPCS code on  a claim exceeds a certain dollar amount, but does not require NDCs to  determine which ingredients are FDA-approved products. For these  claims, the organization uses NDCs primarily to calculate payments, likely  for all ingredients in the compounded drug. The fourth organization does  not review claims with the nonspecific HCPCS code or collect additional  information and pays for all ingredients in the compounded drug. Officials  from the fifth organization told us that, because the organization owns  and operates its health care facilities and purchases drugs and drug  ingredients\u2014including some non-FDA-approved bulk drug substances  used to make compounded drugs\u2014the organization is able to determine  whether a compounded drug was administered to a beneficiary in  outpatient settings. As is the case for TRICARE, under Medicare Part A,  both CMS and four of the five Medicare Advantage organizations we  interviewed told us that compounded drugs administered in inpatient  settings are bundled together as part of the overall charge for the hospital  stay or inpatient admission.", "VA provides and pays for compounded drugs administered in outpatient  and inpatient settings on a limited basis and, therefore, VA\u2019s payment  practices for these drugs are more restrictive than TRICARE\u2019s. VA  instructs VAMCs to determine the suitability of FDA-approved drugs for  inpatient and outpatient use prior to compounding drugs onsite or  purchasing them from a pharmacy for VAMC use. For VA beneficiaries  seeking care from non-VA providers, VA requires beneficiaries to obtain  prior authorization from VA, except in emergencies. Because of VA\u2019s  process for approving care outside of VA medical centers, VA officials  told us that the agency makes decisions on whether to pay for a given  procedure or service, including a compounded drug, on a case-by-case  basis.", "Once the decision by TRICARE, Medicare, or VA to pay for compounded  drugs is made, payment calculations for determining reimbursement  amounts vary for compounded drugs administered in outpatient settings  and inpatient settings across the three programs.", "TRICARE reimburses providers for compounded drugs at either the  lesser of the billed charges or 95 percent of AWP for each ingredient  as determined by ingredients\u2019 NDCs for compounded drugs  administered in civilian outpatient settings. MTFs purchase drugs and  drug ingredients directly from manufacturers and, therefore, do not  reimburse providers for the use of these drugs. Officials from  TRICARE contractors and their subcontractors told us that, for  compounded drugs administered in civilian inpatient settings,  TRICARE pays a preset rate for the cost to deliver inpatient services,  including any drugs administered as part of the service. The use of a  compounded drug\u2014including one that contains bulk drug  substances\u2014would not generally change the inpatient payment rate  for a given service.", "CMS generally reimburses Medicare providers for compounded drugs  administered in outpatient settings based on the invoice price from the  pharmacy, which the contractors responsible for processing Part B  payments obtain during manual reviews of claims with the nonspecific  HCPCS codes.we interviewed calculate payments based on either the provider- submitted price for the drug, which may include payment for non-FDA- approved bulk drug substances, or common drug pricing benchmarks,  such as wholesale acquisition cost. The fifth Medicare Advantage  organization owns and operates its healthcare facilities and pays the  price set by the manufacturer for drugs and drug ingredients. For  drugs administered in inpatient settings, CMS and these organizations  pay a preset rate for the cost to deliver inpatient services, including  any drugs administered as part of the service, and the payment rate  would not change if the claim included a compounded drug."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although compounded drugs account for only a small percentage of the  drugs dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries in pharmacy settings, their  costs have increased significantly over the past ten years, from $5 million  in fiscal year 2004 to $259 million in fiscal year 2013, which is notably  higher than TRICARE\u2019s overall increase in drug costs. The majority of  these costs were for compounded drugs containing bulk drug substances,  the payment for which is inconsistent with TRICARE regulations that  authorize payment for FDA-approved drugs only. As a result, TRICARE  incurred additional costs reimbursing pharmacies for these drugs.  Moreover, because TRICARE does not track compounded drugs  administered in outpatient settings and its contractors do not determine  whether each drug ingredient listed on a claim is FDA-approved,  TRICARE may have also paid for compounded drugs containing bulk  drug substances in outpatient settings in a manner that is inconsistent  with its regulations, which may have also resulted in TRICARE incurring  additional costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure TRICARE\u2019s payment practices for compounded drugs are  consistent with its regulations, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense align TRICARE\u2019s payment practices for compounded drugs with  applicable regulations governing the TRICARE program.

The Joint Commission establishes  pharmacy standards that address all drugs\u2014including those that are  compounded\u2014and assesses compliance with these standards during the  accreditation process. The Joint Commission has standards related to an  organization\u2019s critical medication management processes\u2014those  undertaken by the hospital or organization and those provided through  contracted pharmacy services\u2014that include planning, selection, storage,  ordering, preparing and dispensing, administration, monitoring and  evaluation. Furthermore, The Joint Commission\u2019s standards evaluate  specific aspects of compounding such as verifying the credentials and  assessing the competency of the staff, adherence to proper labeling of  medication, manufacturer recommendations related to storage and end- use dates, following infection control processes and ensuring, when  appropriate, a sterile environment. For example, to help ensure that  compounded drugs are prepared safely, The Joint Commission standards  specify that, in most circumstances, a pharmacist, or pharmacy staff  under the supervision of a pharmacist, must prepare the compound or  admixture for all sterile compounded drugs and that staff use clean or  sterile techniques to avoid contamination. According to The Joint  Commission officials, the MTFs that The Joint Commission accredits  include small and large hospitals and ambulatory care clinics.  Accreditation surveys are conducted for each facility on a regular basis.  In addition, the Army, Navy, and Air Force maintain written guidance on  drug compounding in MTFs. This guidance includes general instructions  on the preparation of sterile and nonsterile compounded drugs, such as  specifying that these drugs should be prepared in accordance with  applicable U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention standards.", "DOD requires TRICARE\u2019s PBM, Express Scripts, to ensure that  pharmacies, which are part of its retail network, are fully licensed in  accordance with applicable federal and state laws, credentialed according  to Express Scripts\u2019 criteria, and have a current National Council for  Prescription Drug Programs number. Accordingly, a pharmacy that  provides compounded drugs to patients must adhere to individual state  board of pharmacy laws and regulations governing the dispensing of  compounded drugs. Express Scripts requires pharmacies interested in  joining its retail pharmacy network to complete a credentialing  questionnaire, which asks, among other things, for the name and license  number of all pharmacists and technicians employed by the pharmacy  and whether the pharmacy or pharmacists, technicians, or other  employees have previously been disciplined by a state board of  pharmacy or other regulatory authority. Express Scripts has recently  developed an additional questionnaire for compounding pharmacies,  which includes a question on the source of the ingredients used to make  compounded drugs.
