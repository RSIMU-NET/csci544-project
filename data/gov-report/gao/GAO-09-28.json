The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (Bankruptcy Reform Act) required the federal judiciary's Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) to collect and report certain additional bankruptcy statistics and required the U.S. Trustee Program, which oversees bankruptcy case administration, to develop uniform final reports that provide certain specified data about each case. GAO was asked to examine the (1) availability and accessibility of data from the personal bankruptcy system and (2) potential benefits and limitations of the new data requirements of the Bankruptcy Reform Act in addressing these issues. GAO examined bankruptcy data systems and obtained documentation and interviewed staff from AOUSC, bankruptcy courts, and the Trustee Program; groups representing consumers and creditors; data providers; and academic researchers and other stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There are limitations to the availability, accuracy, and accessibility of data on consumer bankruptcies. AOUSC publishes certain aggregate statistics related to the numbers of filings, but few data are available on the causes of bankruptcy and the characteristics of bankruptcy filers. Studies show that the information in the bankruptcy case files is not always accurate because much of it is self-reported by debtors who frequently make errors, although these data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of initiating a bankruptcy case. Bankruptcy case files are publicly accessible through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records system, but not in a format that allows the data they hold to be easily extracted and used for research or analysis. Another system, the U.S. Party/Case Index, was designed for nationwide searches for individual cases; while it serves that purpose, its search parameters are limited and the output does not include much of the data held in the system. Several factors create challenges to expanding data on consumer bankruptcies--most notably, privacy and security concerns related to facilitating public access to the highly personal data contained in bankruptcy files. The federal judiciary also has noted that collection of demographic and other additional data is not its mission and would require further resources. Nonetheless, a range of bankruptcy stakeholders, including some judges, researchers, and U.S. Trustee Program staff, have suggested that the judiciary identify and implement practicable ways to improve public access to data that already exist in its data systems, which could facilitate scholarly research and the formulation of bankruptcy policy and legislation. While the data requirements of the Bankruptcy Reform Act are a step toward making more information on consumer bankruptcies available, their value is likely to be limited. The new annual statistics will provide some additional information that may be helpful in identifying differences in bankruptcy cases across judicial districts. In addition, the uniform final reports required by the act will standardize the data in the reports and assist the U.S. Trustee Program in overseeing case administration. However, for several reasons the statistics required under the act are likely to be of limited value. For example, many of the statistics are relatively narrow in scope and were not intended to provide certain key information, such as the causes of bankruptcy and the demographic characteristics of filers. Further, the AOUSC data are provided as aggregated statistics--rather than data on individual cases--which limits the extent to which they can be analyzed. As such, a variety of stakeholders in the bankruptcy process told us that the underlying case-level data used to generate the statistics could be useful if made publicly available as a data set. AOUSC currently has no plans to provide public access to these case-level data, in part, officials say, because they first need to identify and address privacy and security issues. GAO acknowledges the importance of those issues, but believes that better access to bankruptcy data already held in the judiciary's data systems--such as these case-level data--would allow external parties to assess the data's reliability and limitations and could facilitate empirical research and the formulation of bankruptcy policy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, Americans have filed more than 13 million consumer  bankruptcy cases, yet relatively little is known about the characteristics of  these individuals, the factors that led to their seeking bankruptcy  protection, or the outcomes and consequences of their cases.

Individuals usually file for bankruptcy under one of two chapters\u2014 Chapter 7 or 13\u2014of the Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 7, the filer\u2019s  eligible nonexempt assets are reduced to cash and distributed to creditors  in accordance with distribution priorities and procedures set out in the  Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 13, filers submit a repayment plan to the  court agreeing to pay part or all of their debts over time, usually 3 to 5  years. Upon the successful completion of both Chapter 7 and 13 cases, the  filer\u2019s personal liability for eligible debts is discharged at the end of the  bankruptcy process, and creditors may take no further action against the  individual to collect any unpaid portion of the debt.", "The U.S. bankruptcy system is complex and involves entities in both the  judicial and executive branches of government (see fig. 1).", "Within the judicial branch, 90 federal bankruptcy districts have  jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases.

Other schedules and forms require the debtor to provide information on,  among other things: real property (real estate), personal property (such as  cash, stocks, bonds, and household items), secured debts (such as  mortgages and liens), unsecured debts (such as credit card debt and tax  obligations), monthly income, and itemized monthly expenses.", "Bankruptcy case files also include other information filed with the courts.  For example, the file may contain a Chapter 13 repayment plan, which  identifies specific creditors and the amount of their claims, the monthly  repayment amount, the interest rate that the debtor and creditors have  agreed on, and the duration of the repayment plan. Similarly, case files  may include reaffirmation agreements, including the amount and  characteristics of debt being reaffirmed.

While this information may be important for  public policy purposes, it is not collected as part of the bankruptcy  process primarily because it is not information needed by the judiciary or  Trustee Program to operate the bankruptcy system.", "To a limited extent, some nongovernmental entities collect information on  consumer bankruptcies. For example, since 1981, the Consumer  Bankruptcy Project, an ongoing research effort involving several  universities, has gathered information from bankruptcy filers through case  file reviews, surveys, and interviews on such things as educational levels,  housing, physical health, employment, and reasons for filing for  bankruptcy. The project has produced empirical studies of the  demographic and financial characteristics of consumer bankruptcy  debtors based on samples of Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 petitions filed in  1981, 1991, 2001, and 2007.

While some studies, such as those  produced by the Consumer Bankruptcy Project, have examined these  issues, it was widely acknowledged that not enough data were available  from the bankruptcy system and other sources to help fully inform these  discussions. Similarly, in recent work that GAO has conducted examining  the bankruptcy system, we have found that limitations in available data  have hindered our ability to answer questions of interest to congressional  requesters. For example, in October 2007, we reported that information  available from the bankruptcy system was not sufficient to allow us to  evaluate the impact of the Bankruptcy Reform Act on child support  obligations. Further, in our December 2007 report on debtors\u2019 use of  reaffirmation agreements, we examined a representative sample of  bankruptcy files in five bankruptcy courts, but were unable to do a  nationally representative sample because the necessary data needed to be  manually extracted from individual databases at the district level."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Bankruptcy Data Are Not Always Accurate", "paragraphs": ["There has been long-standing recognition that much of the data in the  bankruptcy system may not be accurate, largely because much of the data  is self-reported by debtors in the official bankruptcy forms.

A 2002 study of 103 consumer asset cases in the same  district found that 41 percent of cases had assets that had not been  disclosed by debtors in their initial bankruptcy papers.", "A key reason why information in bankruptcy cases may be inaccurate is  that it is largely self-reported by the debtor. Filers and bankruptcy petition  preparers must attest, under penalty of perjury, that the information they  provide is correct and true. Nonetheless, as seen above, ample evidence  indicates that debtors filing a bankruptcy petition do not always  accurately estimate, for example, their debts, the value of their assets, and  other key information. The unreliability of self-reported data in  bankruptcy files is a result of several factors, according to AOUSC staff,  private trustees, and academic experts we spoke with. First, individuals  entering bankruptcy often have not kept good financial records, a fact that  may hinder their ability to provide accurate information. Second, some  portion of debtors file for bankruptcy without the assistance of an  attorney and their unfamiliarity with the process increases the likelihood  they will make errors on the forms. Third, there is little incentive for any  party to ensure that certain information is precisely accurate if that  information will not affect the outcome of the case. For example, in  Chapter 7 cases that involve no eligible assets to be distributed to  creditors, calculating the precise amount of a debtor\u2019s liabilities makes  little difference since all eligible debt will be discharged anyway. As such,  the impact of data in bankruptcy forms that is less than fully accurate  varies depending on how the information is being used. The data may be  problematic for the purposes of research or the collection of statistics, but  are still sufficiently reliable for the purposes of initiating a bankruptcy  case.", "In every consumer bankruptcy case, the private trustee submits to the  Trustee Program a \u201cfinal report\u201d that details the administration of the  estate. The Trustee Program reviews these reports and they are then filed  with the court. The information in these final reports is generally more  accurate than information in the petition and supporting forms, for two  primary reasons. First, the trustee has certain responsibilities to review  and verify some of the financial information submitted by the debtor.  Second, the final report is generated near the end of the bankruptcy  process, when more accurate information may be available, whereas the  petition is submitted by the debtor at the beginning of the process. At the  same time, the scope of the information contained in the trustee final  reports is limited\u2014largely to data related to disbursements and  repayments to creditors.", "Some parties have expressed concerns about the measurement of  consumer versus business bankruptcies. The Bankruptcy Code defines  consumer (nonbusiness) debt as that incurred by an individual primarily  for a personal, family, or household purpose. If the debtor is a  corporation or partnership, or if debt related to the operation of a business  predominates, AOUSC defines the nature of the debt as business. Debtors  self-report in the bankruptcy petition whether their debts are primarily  consumer or business debts, but such a determination can be ambiguous.  For example, certain debtors\u2014such as entrepreneurs, small businesses,  self-employed individuals, and independent contractors\u2014may have  difficulty determining the predominant nature of their debts if their  personal and business liabilities are closely intertwined. In the 2005 study,  \u201cThe Myth of the Disappearing Business Bankruptcy,\u201d the authors  concluded that AOUSC statistics significantly undercount the number of  business bankruptcies, which they said may lead policymakers and others  to draw inappropriate conclusions about trends in business successes and  failures and other important policy issues. AOUSC officials told us that  the appropriate definition of whether a debtor is a consumer or a business  is open to question, but that the classification used in their statistics\u2014the  predominant nature of the debt as reported by the debtor\u2014has a statutory  basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors Affect the Ability to Expand the Data Available from the Bankruptcy System", "paragraphs": ["The concerns that exist today about the data available from the  bankruptcy system have existed for decades. For example, interest in  more detailed, accurate, and reliable information was raised by both the  1973 and 1997 federal bankruptcy commissions. While opportunities may  exist to further expand and improve the data available from the  bankruptcy system, several factors create challenges to making such  improvements.", "Public accessibility must balance privacy and security concerns.  Bankruptcy files can contain personal information such as tax and  financial data or documents from creditors that may reveal such things as  a filer\u2019s medical circumstances or gambling history. In the past, accessing  bankruptcy records required physically retrieving files from a courthouse.  However, with the development of the Internet, personal information can  be readily and quickly accessed from anywhere in the world, raising  privacy concerns. Further, some consumer groups, bankruptcy attorneys,  and representatives of the judiciary have raised concerns that increasing  electronic access to bankruptcy data, such as through data-enabled forms,  could facilitate identity theft or the use of personal data to target  bankruptcy filers for potentially exploitative financial products or  services. In 2003 and 2007, bankruptcy rules were amended to restrict the  publicly accessible personal information in bankruptcy files. For  example, only the last four digits of a Social Security number are required  in the bankruptcy petition and bankruptcy filers may redact personal  identifiers, such as dates of birth and names of minors, from electronic or  paper filings made with the court. AOUSC officials told us that if  substantial additional bankruptcy information were to be made publicly  available, the privacy and security rules themselves might have to be  reconsidered to provide additional protections.", "Collection of demographic and other additional data is not the  judiciary\u2019s mission. The basic mission of the federal courts is to interpret  and apply the law to resolve disputes. AOUSC officials told us that while  the bankruptcy courts have certain statutory requirements to maintain an  accurate public record of case proceedings, they have no such  requirements, or any need, to collect demographic or financial data that  are unrelated to the operations of the courts. As such, the judiciary  historically has been reluctant to devote resources to collecting data solely  for research and policy purposes.", "Resources are limited. Improving the judiciary\u2019s data collection and  statistical infrastructure can require additional resources for such things  as equipment, staff, and training. AOUSC officials noted that their current  resources for information technology, data collection, and statistical  reporting were limited and would not be able to readily accommodate  additional responsibilities.", "Local courts\u2019 autonomy can hinder centralized data collection. All  bankruptcy courts are governed by certain national rules and requirements  and must report certain standard data to AOUSC. However, individual  courts also have a significant degree of autonomy to develop their own  local rules and requirements, and local practices and procedures vary.  Further, each individual district manages its own data systems and can  choose to track additional data according to its preferences. The  traditional autonomy of the 90 individual bankruptcy districts can create  challenges for AOUSC in ensuring that processes are followed uniformly  and data are collected in a consistent fashion.", "The bankruptcy process is not wellsuited to collecting certain types of  information. The factors that result in a bankruptcy\u2014a key public policy  issue\u2014are inherently hard to capture in a bankruptcy form. Bankruptcy  petitions include a list of creditors but do not necessarily provide insight  as to the source of the debt\u2014for example, credit card debt may derive  from medical expenses or from a costly vacation. Moreover, bankruptcy  often results from multiple factors that can be difficult to isolate (e.g., both  unemployment and poor financial management may be factors). Further,  because the courts\u2019 formal role generally ends once a case is closed, the  courts are not in a position to collect data about the long-term impact of  bankruptcies.

Data-enabled forms contain embedded  data tags that are invisible to the user. The tags allow a computer system  to automatically extract the tagged data, as well as categorize it so that the  information can be compared and analyzed. In 2004, AOUSC and the  Trustee Program began discussions on using data-enabled forms for  bankruptcy filing documents, which would allow the data in those  documents to be more easily extracted. In September 2006, the Trustee  Program formally requested that the judiciary mandate data-enabled forms  through a required technical standard for certain documents filed  electronically in the bankruptcy courts. In March 2008, the judiciary  declined to mandate data-enabled forms, but said it was examining  alternatives that would still facilitate automated case review.", "The Trustee Program and other parties\u2014including some judges,  researchers, and private trustees\u2014have said that the use of data-enabled  forms would be beneficial for several reasons. First, data-enabled forms  would greatly reduce the number of hours the Trustee Program and other  parties devote to manual data entry. Second, it would allow for more  efficient collection of bankruptcy data, compilation of national bankruptcy  statistics, and analysis of the bankruptcy system. Third, they say, data- enabled forms would allow the Trustee Program to conduct its work more  effectively and efficiently. For example, a study prepared for the National  Institute of Justice\u2014the research, development, and evaluation agency of  the Department of Justice\u2014concluded that implementing data-enabled  forms would be an important step toward improving the Trustee  Program\u2019s ability to fight bankruptcy fraud and abuse by facilitating  statistical fraud detection. Similarly, the Trustee Program has noted that  data-enabled forms would allow it to more efficiently administer the  \u201cmeans test\u201d by allowing it to automatically sort cases by whether debtors  are above or below the applicable state median income.", "The judiciary has raised concerns about implementing data-enabled  bankruptcy forms. AOUSC officials have said the technology for data- enabled forms must be compatible with the current information system  and the electronic and hard copy documents should be identical to comply  with rules of court procedures and record-keeping standards. Further, the  judiciary, certain attorneys, and software vendors have raised potential  privacy and security concerns\u2014for example, that data-enabled forms  could make it easier to collect personal information and use it for  marketing or undesirable purposes. Finally, the judiciary also has  expressed concerns that developing and implementing the forms would  impose higher costs on the judiciary, attorneys, and debtors and  potentially could limit access to bankruptcy court. For example, pro se  debtors may not have access to the data-enabled bankruptcy software  needed to file a petition.", "In January 2008, the Judicial Conference\u2019s Advisory Committee on  Bankruptcy Rules established the Bankruptcy Forms Modernization  Project to review and revise the official bankruptcy forms. The project,  which is expected to last 5 to 7 years, is evaluating technologies that the  judiciary could adopt to facilitate the collection, analysis, and  dissemination of information collected via the forms.

The scope of what is provided by some of the specific data  elements is relatively narrow. For example, the act requires the judiciary  to report the number of cases in which creditors were \u201cfined for  misconduct.\u201d However, because courts may reprimand creditors in a  variety of ways, this statistic provides only a limited picture of sanctions  imposed against creditors in bankruptcy courts.", "Lack of specificity. Alternatively, some statistics are so broad in what is  included that the usefulness of the data is unclear. For example, the act  requires that the judiciary report \u201ctotal assets,\u201d but this does not  distinguish between net assets and assets with liens attached (such as a  home with a mortgage). Further, total assets includes assets that are  shielded from unsecured creditors, as defined by federal and state  exemption laws. As such, the statistic will not be an accurate indicator of  debtors\u2019 net worth or of the amount of equity that can actually be  liquidated and distributed to creditors.", "Accuracy. Much of the data in the new annual statistics is based on  information that debtors provide when submitting forms, schedules,  motions, and other court filings. As noted in AOUSC\u2019s statistical report,  self-reported data may be incomplete or inaccurate. For example, as  described earlier, debtors do not always correctly designate whether their  debts are primarily consumer versus business debt, and thus the new  statistics may include some business cases that have been incorrectly  designated as consumer cases. Similarly, certain data in the new trustee  final reports are derived from information provided by the debtor in the  bankruptcy forms.", "Definitional issues. Certain definitional issues may limit the usefulness of  some of the specific data elements in the statistical requirements and  uniform final reports.

With regard  to the definition of \u201cassets abandoned,\u201d they noted that requiring trustees  to determine which debts had been reaffirmed would cause additional  burden on trustees and delays in closing cases. With regard to \u201cclaims  discharged without payment,\u201d they noted that (1) trustees usually file a no- asset report before the expiration of a creditor\u2019s deadline for objecting to  the dischargeability of a debt, and (2) the Bankruptcy Code provides that  certain debts are not discharged regardless of how they are scheduled by  the debtor. As a result, program officials told us, their definition provides  information about the amount of claims that have been scheduled to be  discharged while allowing trustees to expeditiously close no-asset cases  without waiting for the objection deadline to pass and without requiring  the trustee to make an independent determination as to which of the debts  listed by the debtor are dischargeable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Releasing Case-Level Data Used for Bankruptcy Reform Act Statistics Could Be Beneficial", "paragraphs": ["AOUSC currently has no plans to provide public access to the raw, case- level data used to generate the statistics required by the Bankruptcy  Reform Act.

Nevertheless, policy makers and the public could be better served if the  judiciary took steps to further facilitate access to existing data already  collected and maintained in its systems. For example, one possible option  could be to expand the search and output capability of the U.S. Party/Case  Index to enable easier access to, and more productive use of, the full array  of data residing in this system. Similarly, despite the limitations of the  Bankruptcy Reform Act\u2019s statistics, publicly releasing the case-level data  used to generate these statistics could be a valuable resource in efforts to  further analyze and understand consumer bankruptcies. Implementation  of data-enabled forms by the judiciary also could be beneficial by allowing  more efficient use and analysis of information collected.

For example, AOUSC might consider whether it would be  practical to expand the search and output capability of the U.S. Party/Case  Index.

The agency commented that the  judiciary already provides a high level of access to case records and  information and that over the past decade it has substantially increased  the amount of information it makes available to users of the bankruptcy  system. The agency also reiterated the need to balance access and privacy  interests in making decisions about widespread public disclosure and  dissemination of information in case files. AOUSC said that in January  2009, it will begin assessing potential enhancements to the federal  judiciary\u2019s electronic public access services and technical interfaces, and  will consider making additional existing data available through the U.S.  Party Case/Index, as we suggested. The agency also said it will assess  issues related to releasing case-level Bankruptcy Reform Act data and will  present its recommendation to the appropriate Judicial Conference  committees.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the date of this letter.

This report focuses on consumer, or  personal, bankruptcies rather than business bankruptcies.", "To address both of the objectives, we gathered documentation from and  spoke with representatives of the U.S. Trustee Program\u2019s (Trustee  Program) Executive Office for U.S. Trustees, including units responsible  for information technology and the oversight of private trustees; two  Trustee Program regional offices; the Administrative Office of the United  States Courts (AOUSC); and selected individual bankruptcy courts,  including four bankruptcy judges and six bankruptcy clerks. We also  spoke with, and in some cases gathered documentation from,  representatives of the National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees and  National Association of Chapter 13 Trustees, two professional associations  representing Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 trustees, respectively; companies  that provide software for case management for private trustees and  bankruptcy filings for attorneys; the National Data Center and Automated  Access to Court Electronic Records, private organizations that provide  bankruptcy data for a fee; the National Association of Consumer  Bankruptcy Attorneys; the National Consumer Law Center; the American  Bankruptcy Institute; the Financial Services Roundtable; and academic  researchers who study the bankruptcy system and use the data that it  generates.", "In addition, we reviewed the strategic plans for information technology  developed by the Trustee Program and AOUSC. We also reviewed  correspondence between these two parties on the potential  implementation of data-enabled forms, and reviewed public comments  they received related to this issue.

In  addition, we reviewed our prior reports that have used bankruptcy data  and have identified some of the limitations of these data, including reports  related to child support enforcement and reaffirmation agreements.  Further, we reviewed materials produced by the National Bankruptcy  Review Commission. We also reviewed user guides, protocols, data  dictionaries, and other relevant information for the judiciary\u2019s major  bankruptcy data systems, including the Public Access to Court Electronic  Records system, U.S. Party/Case Index, and Case Management/Electronic  Case Files system. In addition, we reviewed the Official Bankruptcy Forms  and visited a bankruptcy court to observe how information from the forms  is inputted into the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed relevant provisions of the  Bankruptcy Reform Act and some corresponding legislative history. We  also reviewed documentation on the judiciary\u2019s implementation of the new  statistical requirements of the act, which included a tracking report  developed by AOUSC to monitor its efforts to implement the act; minutes  from the Judicial Conference\u2019s Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules;  changes to the Official Bankruptcy Forms; documents related to the  modifications made to the case management system to collect additional  data elements; training materials used to educate court staff on collecting  the new data; and documents on the initiation of the NewSTATS statistical  infrastructure.", "We also reviewed documentation on the Trustee Program\u2019s  implementation of new requirements related to uniform final reports,  including the agency\u2019s proposed and final rules related to these reports  and draft and final versions of the agency\u2019s report formats.
