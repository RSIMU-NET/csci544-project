However, we have previously reported that weaknesses in  these business operations result in billions of dollars being wasted,  reduced efficiencies, ineffective performance, inadequate accountability,  and lack of transparency.

We recommended that  Congress consider enacting legislation to establish a separate, full-time  CMO position at DOD with significant authority and experience and a  sufficient term of office to provide focused and sustained leadership over  business transformation efforts. DOD first took steps to establish a CMO  role in May 2007, when it designated the Deputy Secretary of Defense as  the department\u2019s CMO. Subsequently, Congress included a provision in  the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2008 to  codify the Deputy Secretary of Defense as the DOD CMO, and to  establish a new position known as the Deputy Chief Management Officer  (DCMO) to assist the Deputy Secretary. In 2007, we highlighted the  importance of a full-time CMO position separate and distinct from that of  the Deputy Secretary to help elevate, integrate, and institutionalize  responsibility for key management functions and focus concerted  attention on long-term business transformation efforts.", "In 2016, Congress included a provision in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017  to create a CMO position effective February 1, 2018 that would be distinct  from the Deputy Secretary of Defense and provided a number of key  responsibilities. In December 2017, Congress repealed and replaced this  provision in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 and later added additional  responsibilities and functions in the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year  2019.  The CMO\u2019s current responsibilities are codified in section 132a of  title 10, United States Code. Section 132a provides that the CMO is  responsible for, among other things, managing DOD\u2019s enterprise  business operations and shared services and exercising authority,  direction, and control over the designated defense agencies and DOD  field activities (DAFA) that provide shared business services for the  department. Furthermore, in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018, effective on  Jan. 1, 2019, the CMO exercises any responsibilities, duties and powers  relating to business systems or management that are exercisable by a  Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the department. In an August 2017  report to Congress, DOD announced its plans to establish a CMO  position separate from the Deputy Secretary of Defense in order to  improve the quality and productivity of the business operations of the  department, thereby reducing the costs of those operations. The report  stated that DOD would use the establishment of the CMO organization as  an opportunity to renew its focus on business operations reform and to  shift its business operations to enterprise services in order to reduce the cost of business operations. On February 1, 2018, the Secretary of  Defense announced the establishment of a CMO position with  responsibility for directing all enterprise business operations of the  department and other duties as set forth in section 132a of title 10, United  States Code.

To understand how the CMO collaborates with  other DOD entities to lead business operation reform and how the  responsibilities of the CMO and the CIO may change, we met with the  CMO, officials from the Office of the CIO, and an official from DOD\u2019s Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) Office.

Moreover, the NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2019 directed the Secretary of Defense, acting through the  CMO, to reform DOD\u2019s enterprise business operations across all  organizations and elements of the department with respect to any activity  relating to civilian resources management, logistics management,  services contracting, or real estate management. Fulfilling these  responsibilities depends, in part, on the CMO\u2019s visibility into the business  operations of all components of the department, including the military  departments, as well as the ability to identify and execute DOD-wide  business reforms, including those that may affect the military  departments.", "Congress addressed the issue of the CMO\u2019s relationship to the military  departments in section 132a, which authorizes the CMO, subject to the  authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense and Deputy  Secretary of Defense, to direct the secretaries of the military departments  and the heads of all other elements of DOD on matters for which the  CMO has responsibility under the statute. DOD leadership has provided  some guidance regarding the CMO\u2019s responsibilities for efforts that are  department-wide and therefore involve the military departments. For  example:  In a May 2017 memorandum, the Deputy Secretary of Defense  directed all DOD components to conduct a thorough review of  business operations throughout the department and to propose  initiatives that drive increased effectiveness in pursuit of greater  efficiency. The memorandum identified the DCMO as the lead for this  effort and tasked the DCMO with integrating all initiatives. All  responsibilities and authorities assigned to the DCMO were  transferred to the CMO on February 1, 2018.", "More recently, in May 2018, DOD issued its FY 2018-FY 2020  National Defense Business Operations Plan (Plan), which states that  the CMO is personally responsible for overseeing implementation of  business reforms. The Plan further establishes, and gives the CMO  responsibility for carrying out, a strategic objective to improve and  strengthen business operations through a move to DOD-enterprise or  shared services and reduce administrative and regulatory burden.", "However, DOD leadership has not determined how the CMO will exercise  this authority in instances where the military departments have concerns  or disagree with decisions that the CMO makes. In our discussions with  the Army, Navy, and Air Force\u2019s CMO offices, officials from each military  department explained that they frequently met with the CMO and were  involved in discussing business operation initiatives with potential for  implementation across multiple military departments. According to these  officials, these discussions were collaborative and the CMO did not have  to exercise his authority to direct the services. However, we found two  instances in which the lack of a determination as to how the CMO is to  direct the business-related activities of the military departments led to  questions about the respective roles and authorities of the CMO and the  military departments as they relate to business reform. In one case,  officials from the military departments questioned the CMO\u2019s authority to  make binding decisions; in the other, the military departments sought to  pursue reform activities without CMO involvement and oversight, even  though the CMO has responsibility for leading DOD\u2019s enterprise business  reform efforts.", "First, officials told us that in a July 2018 meeting of the Reform  Management Group (RMG) the CMO approved a decision to consolidate  DOD\u2019s contract writing systems into a single system. According to  OCMO officials, the effort to move to a single contract writing system  would increase data visibility, lessen or eliminate redundant contracting  needs, provide for greater management insight, and increase the buying  power of the department. However, officials told us the military  departments, which had voiced concerns about moving to one  consolidated system in a previous RMG meeting, expressed reservations.  Specifically, a DOD official who participated in the RMG meetings told us  the military departments cited a concern about loss of individual  authorities and requirements, among other issues. Several DOD officials  we spoke with described the RMG meeting as the first time the question  of the CMO\u2019s authority to make decisions for enterprise-wide business  reform and to direct the military departments had been raised at an RMG  meeting. According to officials who were present at the meeting,  participants discussed whether the RMG is a voting body and what  authority the CMO has to make unilateral decisions for the RMG. When  we spoke with officials about this matter in January 2019, they said this  question was still unresolved.", "Second, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, in a December  10, 2018 memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, requested the  Secretary direct the military departments to jointly review organizations,  activities, processes, and procedures that might be reformed or  restructured to enhance lethality and readiness or reduce cost. While the  departments asked for support the Secretary deemed appropriate from  the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and others, it did  not request support or involvement from the CMO. Further, the  memorandum stated that the military department secretaries envision a  process where they would make recommendations directly to the  Secretary. However, the memorandum made no mention of CMO  involvement in the review, notwithstanding Congressional, Secretary of  Defense, and Deputy Secretary of Defense direction that calls for the  CMO to oversee DOD\u2019s business reform efforts.", "Without a determination by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense  about how the CMO is to direct the business-related activities of the  military departments, the CMO\u2019s ability to lead DOD\u2019s reform of its  enterprise business operations and to direct the military departments may  be limited, potentially leading to fragmented business reform efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unresolved Issue #2: The CMO\u2019s Oversight Responsibilities for the Defense Agencies and DOD Field Activities (DAFA)", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s 19 defense agencies and eight DOD field activities are intended to  perform many of DOD\u2019s business operations, including consolidated  supply and service functions such as human resources services, on a  department-wide basis. We have previously identified numerous  instances of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication and have  recommended actions to increase coordination or consolidation to  address related inefficiencies that affect the DAFAs. For example, in  September 2018, we reported that there is fragmentation and overlap  within the DAFAs that provide human resources services to other defense  agencies or organizations within DOD. Our September 2018 report on  the DAFAs also found that DOD does not comprehensively or routinely  assess the continuing need for its DAFAs.", "GAO-18-592. DOD was statutorily required to periodically review the services and  supplies each DAFA provides to ensure there is a continuing need for each, and that the  provision of services and supplies by each DAFA, rather than by the military departments,  is more effective, economical, or efficient (See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 192 (c)). Since 2012, DOD has  relied on existing processes, such as its annual budget process, to fulfill this review  requirement. However, DOD did not provide sufficient evidence that these processes  satisfy the statute. For example, while DOD reviews the DAFAs during the budget  process, it does not specifically review the provision of services by the DAFAs rather than  the military departments. that provide shared business services for the department, as designated  by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense. In January 2018, the  Deputy Secretary reported to Congress that the Secretary of Defense  formally identified the Pentagon Force Protection Agency and  Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) as the DAFAs that provide  shared business services, and directed that they would fall under the  authority, direction, and control of the CMO. However, both of these  organizations had already been identified as providing shared business  services and aligned under the previous DCMO. In addition, the Deputy  Secretary\u2019s January 2018 report to Congress did not explain why these  two DAFAs, but not others, were designated as providing shared  business services.", "In the January 2018 report to Congress, the Deputy Secretary of Defense  also stated that, under his direction, the DCMO and Director of CAPE  were leading defense reform work that would result in recommendations  on, among other things, any required organizational changes. According  to DOD\u2019s report, such changes would include the designation of, and  oversight arrangements for, other DAFAs providing shared business  services that require CMO oversight. The recommendations were  expected in late summer 2018. However, when we asked OCMO officials  for a status update in November 2018, they acknowledged that they had  not yet conducted the review.", "In November 2018, OCMO officials told us they had recently begun a  review of the DAFAs but had not designated any additional DAFAs as  providing shared business services. OCMO officials explained that the  DAFAs were prioritized for review, with WHS being selected to be the first  reviewed. The review will assess what role WHS performs and how  efficiently it is performing that role, and will compare WHS performance to  commercial benchmarks, according to OCMO officials. As of January  2019, officials said they expected to complete the review of WHS on  February 16, 2019. According to officials, the next DAFAs to be reviewed  will be DLA, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and the  Defense Information Systems Agency. In addition, OCMO officials said  that they plan to conduct a review of business functions performed in  multiple DAFAs to identify opportunities to consolidate shared services for  greater efficiency. For example, because WHS performs some human  resource functions, as do certain other DAFAs, the OCMO is assessing  how human resources management can be improved across the  department. OCMO officials indicated they expect additional DAFAs to be  identified as shared business services as a result of this review.  Additionally, officials said they expect that the review will be completed in  January 2020, but have not determined when or how the Secretary of  Defense will designate additional DAFAs as providing shared business  services. They have also not determined what those decisions would  mean for the OCMO\u2019s management of its responsibility to provide direct  authority, control, and direction over those DAFAs.", "In section 921 of the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019,  Congress also expanded and codified the CMO\u2019s authority over the  DAFAs by requiring the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Under  Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, to direct the head of each DAFA  specified by the Secretary for the purpose of section 921, to transmit its  proposed budget for enterprise business operations for a fiscal year to the  CMO for review, beginning in fiscal year 2020. Section 921 further  provides that the CMO shall submit a report to the Secretary containing  the CMO\u2019s comments and certification of whether each proposed budget  achieves a required level of efficiency and effectiveness for enterprise  business operations, consistent with guidance for budget review  established by the CMO. Under section 921, the Secretary of Defense  has discretion to determine which DAFAs\u2019 proposed budgets are subject  to CMO review. In November 2018, OCMO officials told us that the  Secretary of Defense had not yet designated any DAFAs as required to  submit their budgets for review. However, they stated that the OCMO is  working with the DOD Comptroller to determine how the DAFA budget  review will be conducted. They also said that they have hired consultants  under an existing blanket purchase agreement contract to assist with  developing a methodology for this review. OCMO officials told us they  believed they would be ready to conduct the required review by fiscal  year 2020, as required by the statute. However, it is unclear whether this  review will result in a determination of which DAFAs are required to  submit their proposed budgets for review.", "Until the Secretary of Defense makes a determination regarding the  CMO\u2019s relationship to the DAFAs, including whether additional DAFAs  should be identified as providing shared business services and which  DAFAs will be required to submit their proposed budgets for CMO review,  the CMO\u2019s ability to effectively oversee and streamline the DAFAs\u2019  business operations may be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unresolved Issue #3: The Transfer of Responsibilities from the Chief Information Officer to the CMO", "paragraphs": ["As described in table 1 of this report, section 910 of the NDAA for Fiscal  Year 2018 provided that, effective January 1, 2019, the CMO would  assume certain responsibilities for business systems and management  that were formerly performed by the CIO. Section 903 of the John S.  McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 clarified this provision by amending  the statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 142) which established and provides  responsibilities for the DOD CIO. However, in July 2018, DOD officials  told us no formal action had been taken to determine which, if any,  responsibilities would transition or to assess the resource impact this  would have on both offices because they had concerns about the  statutory requirement and how it would affect IT management at the  department. For example, CMO officials expressed the belief that all IT  roles and responsibilities should be consolidated under one position. We  have previously found that having department-level CIO responsibilities  performed by multiple officials could make the integration of various  information and technology management areas, as envisioned by law,  more difficult to achieve.", "The CMO told us in July 2018 that he had begun engaging informally with  Congress to discuss the department\u2019s concerns about the transition of  certain responsibilities from the CIO to the CMO, and that he would  engage further once the newly confirmed CIO felt prepared to join those  discussions. However, in November 2018, the Acting CMO told us that  the OCMO was still exploring all of the authorities that Congress had  provided, and, as such, felt that further engagement with Congress was  premature at this point. The Acting CMO added that she and the CIO had  worked out an informal agreement regarding which areas they would  each manage, but did not identify specific tasks that would transfer to the  CMO or provide any details of this agreement. At the same time, OCMO  officials acknowledged in November 2018 that the OCMO had not  conducted an analysis to determine which responsibilities should formally  transfer or what resource ramifications, if any, this transfer would have on  both offices. Without an analysis to help DOD determine which duties  should transfer from the CIO to the CMO, including identifying any  associated resource impacts, DOD will remain reliant on this informal  agreement. Such reliance could cause confusion within the department  about who is responsible for key IT functions.

Additionally, in  November 2018, a senior OCMO official stated that the office needed to  complete its reorganization prior to the department issuing updated  guidance.", "Until the Deputy Secretary of Defense resolves the issues previously  discussed and issues guidance (such as a chartering directive) to codify  the CMO\u2019s authorities and responsibilities and specify how those are to  be operationalized, questions regarding the extent of the CMO\u2019s authority  and responsibility are likely to persist, preventing a shared understanding  across the department of the CMO\u2019s role. Further, the lack of guidance  could affect the ability of the department to make progress in conducting  necessary business reforms\u2014one of three key priorities identified in the  2018 National Defense Strategy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["DOD has made progress in implementing some of the authorities and  responsibilities Congress has provided the CMO. However, DOD has not  resolved several key issues that limit its ability to implement all statutory  authorities and responsibilities. Specifically, DOD has yet to resolve key  issues, such as how the CMO will exercise authority to direct the military  departments and exercise direction and control over DAFAs that provide  shared business services. Additionally, without analyzing the authorities  and responsibilities that will transfer from the CIO to the CMO and the  resource impact, if any, those new responsibilities will have on the  OCMO, DOD risks creating confusion within the department about which  official is responsible for key information technology functions. While DOD  has issued several documents delineating some of the CMO\u2019s authorities  and responsibilities, the department does not currently have formal and  current guidance, such as a DOD chartering directive, that  institutionalizes all the CMO\u2019s authorities and responsibilities. Considering  the evolution of the CMO\u2019s authorities and responsibilities since the  position was created, guidance that fully encompasses all CMO  authorities and responsibilities and explains how they are to be  operationalized could help to institutionalize and sustain the position  beyond the tenure of the current acting CMO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense:  The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Deputy Secretary of  Defense makes a determination as to how the CMO is to direct the  business-related activities of the military departments.

To  understand the authorities and responsibilities that Congress and DOD  have assigned to this position, we reviewed section 901 of the National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017, which initially  created the CMO position effective February 1, 2018; section 910 of the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018, which codified and expanded the CMO\u2019s  authorities and responsibilities; and section 921 of the John S. McCain  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019, which further expanded the CMO\u2019s  authorities and responsibilities. We reviewed DOD\u2019s August 2017 Report  to Congress and its April 2018 National Defense Business Operations  Plan. We also reviewed our November 2007 report on key strategies for  implementing CMO positions.", "To understand ongoing actions to implement the authorities and  responsibilities given to the CMO position, we interviewed DOD\u2019s former  CMO, who served from February to November 2018, as well as the  current acting CMO and the chiefs of the five directorates or their  representatives within the Office of the CMO (OCMO) in July 2018, to  understand the responsibilities of these directorates. We also met with the  nine reform teams charged with implementing initiatives to, among other  things, move DOD toward an enterprise-wide, shared-service model.  Additionally, we reviewed documentation from the reform teams to  understand what business operation reform initiatives the CMO has  prioritized and what progress has been made to implement and monitor  these initiatives. To understand key initiatives DOD is pursuing to improve  its business operations and how it monitors implementation of those  initiatives, we attended demonstrations of DOD\u2019s cost management  framework and its reform team portal. We also met with an official from  DOD\u2019s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) Office to gain  additional insights on oversight of the reform teams from one of the co- chairs on the Reform Management Group. Additionally, we reviewed  documentation from the OCMO containing personnel numbers and  funding levels to determine the level and type of resources available to  the CMO to assist in carrying out his responsibilities. To understand how  the CMO collaborates with other DOD entities to lead business operation  reform and how the responsibilities of the CMO and Chief Information  Officer (CIO) may change, we met with officials from the Office of the  DOD CIO. To understand how the CMO is interacting with and influencing  the military departments\u2019 business operations, we met with officials from  the Army, Air Force, and Navy CMO and CIO offices.", "We performed our work under the authority of the Comptroller General to  conduct evaluations to assist Congress with its oversight responsibilities.
