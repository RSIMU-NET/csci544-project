However, it is not planning to hold a Milestone B review--a key decision that formally initiates a system development program and triggers key oversight mechanisms--until after the initial UCLASS capability has been developed and fielded in fiscal year 2020. The Navy views UCLASS as a technology development program, although it encompasses activities commensurate with system development, including system integration and demonstration. Because the initial UCLASS system is to be developed, produced, and fielded before a Milestone B decision, Congress's ability to oversee the program and hold it accountable for meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals will likely be limited. Specifically, the program will operate outside the basic oversight framework provided by mechanisms like a formal cost and schedule baseline, statutory unit cost tracking, and regular reports to Congress on cost, schedule, and performance progress. The Navy believes its approach effectively utilizes the flexibility in the Department of Defense's (DOD) acquisition policy to gain knowledge needed to ensure a successful UCLASS system development program starting in fiscal year 2020. Yet the Navy expects to review preliminary designs, conduct a full and open competition, and award a contract for UCLASS development in fiscal year 2014, a point at which DOD policy and best practices indicate that a program would be expected to hold a Milestone B review to initiate a system development program. Apart from deferring Milestone B, the Navy's plan would be consistent with the knowledge-based acquisition process reflected in DOD policy.", "UCLASS faces several programmatic risks going forward. First, the UCLASS cost estimate of $3.7 billion exceeds the level of funding that the Navy expects to budget for the system through fiscal year 2020. Second, the Navy has scheduled 8 months between the time it issues its request for air vehicle design proposals and the time it awards the air vehicle contract, a process that DOD officials note typically takes 12 months to complete. Third, the UCLASS system is heavily reliant on the successful development and delivery of other systems and software, which creates additional schedule risk. Fourth, the Navy will be challenged to effectively manage and act as the lead integrator for three separate but interrelated segments--air vehicle, carrier, and control system--and 22 other government systems, such as the aircraft landing system, the timing and alignment of which are crucial to achieving the desired UCLASS capability. While the Navy recognizes many of these risks and has mitigation plans in place, they could lead to cost increases and schedule delays if not effectively addressed.", "The Navy's UCLASS acquisition strategy includes some good acquisition practices that reflect aspects of a knowledge-based approach. For example, the Navy is leveraging significant knowledge gained from prior technology development efforts, incorporating an open systems design approach, working to match the system's requirements with available resources, and reviewing preliminary designs for the air vehicle before conducting a competition to select a single contractor to develop and deliver the air vehicle segment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider directing the Navy to hold a Milestone B review for the UCLASS system after the system level preliminary design review is complete.If the Navy does not comply, Congress should consider limiting the amount of funding available for the UCLASS system until an acquisition program baseline is provided.

Efforts to develop an unmanned combat  air system for the Navy can be traced back to 2003 when DOD  established a joint Navy and Air Force program called the Joint  Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS). This joint effort drew on  knowledge that the Air Force had gained through early development of  the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle, an effort that began in the late 1990s.  The J-UCAS program was canceled in late 2005. The following year, the  Navy initiated the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS- D) program\u2014the immediate predecessor to UCLASS\u2014with the intent to  design, develop, integrate, test, and demonstrate the technical feasibility  of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier. In  2013, the Navy successfully launched and landed a UCAS-D on an  aircraft carrier. In total the Navy invested more than $1.4 billion in the  UCAS-D program. In 2011, as UCAS-D efforts were ongoing, the Navy  received approval from DOD to begin planning for the UCLASS  acquisition program.", "In our past work examining weapon acquisition and best practices for  product development, we found that leading commercial firms and  successful DOD programs pursue an acquisition approach that is  anchored in knowledge, whereby high levels of knowledge are  demonstrated at critical junctures. Specifically, there are three critical  junctures\u2014knowledge points\u2014in an acquisition program at which  decision makers must have adequate knowledge to make large  investment decisions. If the knowledge attained at each juncture does  not confirm the business case on which the acquisition was originally  justified, the program does not go forward. At the first knowledge point, a  match must be made between the customers\u2019 needs and the available  resources\u2014technical and engineering knowledge, time, and funding\u2014 before a system development program is started. At the second  knowledge point, about midway through development, the developer must  demonstrate that the system\u2019s design is stable and that it can meet  performance requirements. At the third knowledge point, the developer  must show that the system can be manufactured within cost, schedule,  and quality targets and that it is reliable before beginning production. The  first knowledge point is the most critical point of the three. At that point  programs should present their business case for review and approval,  which establishes an acquisition program baseline. This baseline  describes the cost, quantity, schedule, and performance goals of a  program and provides a framework for effective oversight and  accountability. This first knowledge point typically coincides with a  substantial financial commitment.", "DOD\u2019s acquisition policy and guidance encourage the use of a  knowledge-based acquisition approach, in which major decision reviews  are aligned with the start of key acquisition phases, including technology  development, system development\u2014referred to as engineering and  manufacturing development\u2014and production. Figure 1 aligns the  knowledge points with key decision points in DOD\u2019s acquisition process.", "According to DOD acquisition policy, the purpose of the technology  development phase is to reduce technology risk, determine and mature  the appropriate set of technologies to be integrated into a full system, and  to demonstrate critical technology elements on prototypes. A system  level preliminary design review is to be held during the technology  development phase to inform requirements trades; improve cost  estimation; and identify remaining design, integration, and manufacturing  risks. The results of the preliminary design review are to be reported to  decision makers at Milestone B\u2014the decision review in DOD\u2019s process  that corresponds with knowledge point 1 and initiates system  development. The purpose of system development is to develop a system  or an increment of capability, complete full system integration, develop an  affordable and executable manufacturing process, and demonstrate  system integration, interoperability, safety, and utility, among other things.", "System development provides a critical opportunity for objective oversight  before beginning production.", "At Milestone B, major defense acquisition programs are required by DOD  policy to have approved requirements, an independent cost estimate, and  an acquisition program baseline; begin tracking unit cost changes and  report unit cost growth against Nunn-McCurdy statutory thresholds; and  periodically report to Congress on the cost, schedule, and performance  status of the program in Selected Acquisition Reports. At that time, major  defense acquisition programs are also required by statute to present a  business case analysis and certify on the basis of that analysis that the  program is affordable, has reasonable lifecycle cost and schedule  estimates, and that technologies have been demonstrated in a relevant  environment, among other things. Taken together, these requirements  form the basic oversight framework to ensure that Congress and DOD  decision makers are adequately informed about the program\u2019s cost,  schedule, and performance progress. In addition, the information is  valuable for identifying areas of program risk and its causes, and helps to  ensure that decision makers consider the full financial commitment before  initiating a new development program. Once initiated at Milestone B,  major defense acquisition programs are required to measure program  performance against the program\u2019s baseline estimate. Changes to the  baseline are only authorized under certain conditions, including a  program restructure that is approved by the milestone decision authority,  or a breach of the critical Nunn-McCurdy statutory threshold where DOD  certifies continuation of the program to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy\u2019s UCLASS Acquisition Strategy Defers Key Oversight Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2014, the Navy plans to commit to investing an estimated  $3.7 billion to develop, produce, and field from 6 to 24 aircraft and modify  1 to 4 aircraft carriers as an initial increment of UCLASS capability\u2014 referred to as an early operational capability. The Navy plans to manage  UCLASS as if it were a technology development program, although its  strategy encompasses activities commensurate with a program in system  development and early production. Accordingly, it is not planning to hold a  Milestone B review to formally initiate a system development program\u2014 which would trigger key oversight mechanisms\u2014until after the initial  capability is fielded in fiscal year 2020. This strategy means the program  will not be subject to these oversight mechanisms including an acquisition  program baseline; Nunn-McCurdy unit cost growth thresholds; and  periodic reporting of the program\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance  progress. This strategy will likely limit Congress\u2019s ability to oversee this 6- year multibillion dollar program. Navy officials believe that their approach  effectively utilizes the flexibility in DOD\u2019s acquisition policy to ensure that  UCLASS requirements and concept of operations are well understood  and achievable before formally beginning a system development  program. Yet they emphasize that by fiscal year 2020 they may have  accumulated enough knowledge to allow them to bypass a formal  development program and proceed directly to production at Milestone C.

A  review of the full system level preliminary design\u2014including the air  vehicle, carrier, and control segments\u2014is scheduled for fiscal year 2015.  DOD policy and best practices indicate that around this review point a  program would typically be expected to hold a Milestone B review and  transition from technology development to system development. Figure 3  illustrates the later point in the process in which the Navy plans to  establish the UCLASS acquisition program baseline and formally initiate a  development program.", "Although the Navy does not plan to hold a Milestone B review until 2020,  if at all, it is effectively committing to system development and early  production in fiscal year 2015. According to the Navy\u2019s strategy, system  development and early production activities, including system integration  and air vehicle fabrication, will begin in fiscal year 2015 around the time of  the system-level preliminary design review. The Navy also expects to  increase annual funding for the UCLASS system from $146.7 million to  $522.5 million between fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Testing to  demonstrate the system\u2019s capabilities is scheduled to take place from  fiscal year 2017\u2014scheduled first flight\u2014through fiscal year 2020, when  an early operational capability is expected to be achieved. If the program  proceeds according to the Navy\u2019s plan, by 2020, it will have completed  many of the activities typically authorized by a Milestone B decision.  Moreover, since enough quantities of UCLASS are expected to be  delivered for operational use on one or more aircraft carriers, the strategy  could also be seen as having begun early production before a Milestone  C decision is held.", "In a March 2007 report we identified oversight challenges presented by  an acquisition strategy that calls for proceeding into system development,  demonstration, manufacturing, and fielding without the benefit of a  Milestone B decision. A framework of laws make major defense  acquisition programs accountable for their planned outcomes and cost,  give decision makers a means to conduct oversight, and ensure some  level of independent program review. The application of these acquisition  laws is typically triggered by a program\u2019s entry into system development.  While the activities the UCLASS program plans to undertake exemplify  that the program is entering into system development, these laws will not  be triggered because the program is not holding a Milestone B review and  formally initiating a development program. Therefore, the UCLASS  program will not be accountable for establishing a program baseline or for  reporting any cost growth to that baseline to DOD and Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UCLASS Faces Cost, Schedule, and Program Management Risks", "paragraphs": ["The UCLASS system faces several risks related to cost, schedule, and  program management that, if not addressed, could lead to additional cost  and significant schedule delays for the system.

However, the Navy  has only projected funding of $3.2 billion for the system through fiscal  year 2020. The variability in the cost estimates is due largely to cost  estimating ground rules and assumptions. For example, Navy officials  stated that the $3.7 billion cost estimate reflects an assumed savings  of 15 to 20 percent that they believe is achievable since competing  contractors\u2019 preliminary designs will be relatively mature. Navy and  DOD officials we spoke with emphasized that no true sense of cost  will be known until after the air vehicle segment preliminary design  reviews have been completed and a single contractor has been  selected. If the preliminary designs are less mature than assumed,  costs could increase significantly, further exceeding budgeted  resources.", "Source selection schedule is compressed: After the four  competing contractors have completed their preliminary air vehicle  designs, the Navy plans to conduct a full and open competition before  awarding the air vehicle segment contract. The Navy\u2019s strategy allows  for about 8 months between the time that it issues its request for air  vehicle proposals and the time it awards the contract. According to  OSD officials, this type of contract award process typically takes  approximately 12 months.", "UCLASS is dependent on development and delivery of other  systems: The Navy identifies the delivery of the Common Control  System software as a risk and notes that if it is delayed, alternative  control system software would be needed to achieve the established  deployment timeline. Using alternative software would increase  integration costs and extend the testing timeline, resulting in  duplicated development, integration, and testing once the common  control system software is delivered. The Navy expects this risk to be  mitigated over time as individual segments of the control system  software are built, delivered, integrated, and tested.", "UCLASS is also critically dependent on the development and fielding  of the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS), which  is a global positioning system-based aircraft landing system that  guides the aircraft to make a safe landing on the aircraft carrier deck.  However, in a March 2013 report, we found that the JPALS program  has experienced significant schedule delays. Additional JPALS  delays would likely affect the Navy\u2019s UCLASS schedule, in which case  the Navy may need to identify an alternative landing system for  UCLASS, thus increasing the cost and delaying delivery of the  capability. The Navy recognizes this risk. The program office holds  weekly integrated master schedule reviews with the JPALS program  and plans to mitigate risk through JPALS testing, initial deployments,  and continued communication with the JPALS program and other  Navy offices.", "UCLASS system integration will be challenging: The Navy plans  to act as the lead systems integrator for all three segments through  the development and fielding of the initial UCLASS system. The Navy  will have three separate but interrelated segments to manage, the  timing and alignment of which are crucial to success of the overall  system. The system is reliant on 22 existing government systems,  such as JPALS. The Navy recognizes that there is risk associated  with its role as the lead systems integrator, as it does not routinely act  in this capacity. Therefore, the Navy plans to manage this risk through  interaction with industry and regular system level reviews.

Navy officials note  that they plan to leverage navigation and control technologies, among  other things, from the demonstration program. By effectively  leveraging these types of previous investments, along with other  existing systems and technologies, the Navy could reduce cost and  schedule for the UCLASS system and promote affordability.", "Incorporating an open systems design approach: We reported in  July 2013 that the Navy is planning to use an open systems approach  for the UCLASS system. The Navy has identified key system  interfaces and, according to program officials, plans to require  contractors to comply with particular open system standards, which it  believes will reduce acquisition costs and simplify integration. The  Navy also plans to incorporate an open systems architecture  developed by OSD for the UCLASS system control segment. This  architecture implements a common framework, user interfaces,  software applications, and services, and is designed to be common  across unmanned aircraft systems. DOD estimates that the open  architecture will reduce costs and allow for rapid integration of  payloads.", "Matching requirements to available resources: In 2012, the Joint  Requirements Oversight Council issued a memorandum that required  the Navy to reduce its UCLASS requirements because at that time  they were deemed unaffordable. The Joint Requirements Oversight  Council specifically noted that the Navy\u2019s requirements should focus  on achieving an affordable, adaptable platform that supports a wide  range of missions within 3 to 6 years. As a result, the Navy scaled  down the UCLASS requirements and updated its analysis of  alternatives to include requirements that are more affordable and  feasible. Our prior work has found that matching requirements with  resources before beginning a system development program increases  the likelihood that the program will meet cost and schedule  objectives.", "Holding competition for preliminary designs: In fiscal year 2013,  the Navy plans to award four firm fixed-price contracts to competing  contractors to develop and deliver preliminary air vehicle designs. The  Navy then plans to review those preliminary designs, conduct a full  and open competition, and award a single air vehicle segment  contract. The Navy believes that this competition will drive efficiencies  and ultimately result in cost savings across the system\u2019s life cycle.

But the Navy\u2019s plan to develop,  manufacture, and field operational UCLASS systems on up to four aircraft  carriers before holding a Milestone B decision would defer the decision  and mechanisms that would otherwise enable oversight of these very  program activities until after they are over. Without a program baseline  and regular reporting on progress, it will be difficult for Congress to hold  the Navy accountable for achieving UCLASS cost, schedule, and  performance goals. As we have noted, these kinds of risks are present in  the program and warrant such oversight.

For example,  the Navy is leveraging knowledge gained from prior technology  development programs, incorporating an open systems design, matching  resources with requirements, and utilizing competition. Given the  competitive preliminary design process planned and subsequent  competitive contract award, it seems reasonable that a Milestone B  decision could be held following the competition and before the beginning  of system development, providing a solid oversight framework with little or  no change to the strategy\u2019s schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To enhance program oversight and accountability given that the Navy  does not plan to modify its acquisition strategy and hold a Milestone B  decision review for the UCLASS system following the system level  preliminary design review in fiscal year 2015, Congress should consider  directing the Navy to hold a Milestone B review for the system after the  system level preliminary design review is complete.", "If the Navy does not comply, Congress should consider limiting the  amount of funding available for the UCLASS system until the Navy  provides the basic elements of an acquisition program baseline, such as  development and production cost estimates, unit costs, quantities,  schedules, annual funding profiles, and key performance parameters  needed for such a large investment.
