The estimates differ primarily because FAA's estimate only includes projects that are eligible for AIP grants, while ACI's covers all projects, including $5.8 billion for projects not eligible for federal funding, such as parking garages. From 2001 through 2005, airports received an average of about $13 billion a year for planned capital development. This amount covers all types of projects, including those not eligible for federal grants. The primary source of this funding was bonds, which averaged almost $6.5 billion per year, followed by federal grants and passenger facility charges (PFC), which accounted for $3.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively (see figure below). If airports continue to attract this level of funding for planned capital development, this amount would annually fall about $1 billion short of the $14 billion in total planned development costs (the sum of FAA's estimated $8.2 billion in eligible costs and the industry's $5.8 billion in ineligible costs). Larger airports foresee a shortfall of about $600 million annually, while smaller airports foresee a shortfall of $400 million annually. FAA's reauthorization proposal would reduce the size of AIP by $750 million but increase the amount that airports can collect from PFCs. However, the benefit from increased PFCs would accrue mostly to larger airports and may not offset a reduced AIP grants program for smaller airports.

Air traffic has risen back above pre-September 11 levels, as has the level of  delays. FAA operates one of the safest air transportation systems in the  world, but it is also a system under strain. Already last year, one in four  flights was subject to flight delays. In addition, the system is expected to  absorb a variety of new and differing aircraft in the future, ranging from  the jumbo Airbus A380, which can hold more than 500 passengers, to very  light jets, which carry only a few passengers and could greatly increase the  number of aircraft in the air. Demand for air travel is expected to reach 1  billion passengers by 2015, according to FAA estimates. The consensus of  opinion is that the current aviation system cannot expand to meet this  projected growth. FAA is developing a modernization program for its air  traffic control system called the Next Generation Air Transportation  System (NextGen) to accommodate this growth. To fund this system, FAA  has proposed relying on a cost-based system using airline user fees and  fuel taxes instead of passenger ticket taxes and other excise taxes that are  due to expire at the end of September 2007. In regard to airports, the  administration is proposing $2.75 billion to fund the AIP program\u2014which  is substantially less than the current level\u2014and changing the way that  grants to the 3,400 airports in the national airport system are funded and  allocated under AIP.

For this  update, we are providing preliminary responses to these key questions:    How do FAA and Airports Council International (ACI) estimates of capital  development compare?", "How much have airports received for capital development and where is  the money coming from?", "If current funding levels continue, will they be sufficient to meet planned  capital development costs for 2007 through 2011?", "What are some of the potential effects of changes in how airport  development will be funded as part of the administration\u2019s FAA  reauthorization legislation?", "To determine how much planned development would cost over the next 5  years, we obtained planned capital development data from FAA and ACI, a  key industry association. To determine the sources of airport funding, we  obtained capital funding data from FAA, the National Association of State  Aviation Officials (NASAO) and Thomson Financial, a firm that tracks all  municipal bond issues. We obtained funding data from 2001 through 2005  because these were the most recent years for which consistent data were  available and then adjusted the amounts for inflation to 2006 dollars so  that they could be compared to planned development amounts, which are  also expressed in 2006 dollars. We screened the planned development and  funding data for accuracy and compared funding streams across databases  where possible. We did not, however, audit how the databases were  compiled. To compare the estimates between FAA and industry, we  reconciled survey data and identified areas where the largest differences  occur. We reviewed the reliability of these data and concluded that they  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted our work from August 2006 to March 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

FAA\u2019s estimates cover projects  for every airport in the national system, while ACI surveyed the 100 largest  airports (mostly large and medium hub airports) and then extrapolated a  total based on cost per enplanement calculations for small, medium, and  large hub airports that did not respond.", "Further analysis on a project-by-project level shows variances related to  three other factors:    Definition\u2014FAA data are based on planned project information taken  from airport master plans and state system plans, minus projects that  already have an identified funding source, while ACI includes all projects,  whether funding has been identified or not.

According to FAA officials, their objective is to increase the amount of  discretionary funding for airports so that higher priority projects can be  funded; however, that is only achieved when total AIP funds are greater  than the $2.75 billion budgeted by the administration. For example, at  $2.75 billion in AIP, the current law would generate $967 million in  discretionary grants versus $866 million under the proposed  reauthorization.

Although we do not know by how much such  purchases would decline, conventional economic reasoning, supported by  the opinions of industry stakeholders, suggests that some decline would  take place. Therefore, the tax rate should be set taking into consideration  effects on use and the resulting impact on revenue. FAA officials told us  that they believe that these effects would be small because the increased  tax burden is a small share of aircraft operating costs and therefore there  was no need to take its impact into account. Representatives of general  aviation, however, have said that the impact could be more substantial. If  consumption possibly falls short of projections or Congress appropriates  more funds for AIP, RE&D, or EAS than currently proposed, then fuel tax  rates and the international arrival and departure tax would  correspondingly have to be increased or additional funding from another  source, such as the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance or the General Fund,  would be needed.", "In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, airports have rebounded financially from the  September 2001 terrorist attacks.

To determine how much airports of various sizes are spending on  capital development and from which sources, we sought data on airports\u2019  capital funding because comprehensive airport spending data are limited  and because, over time, funding and spending should roughly equate. We  obtained capital funding data from the FAA, ACI, the National Association  of State Aviation Officials (NASAO), and Thomson Financial\u2014a firm that  tracks all municipal bonds. We screened each of these databases for their  accuracy to ensure that airports were correctly classified and compared  funding streams across databases where possible. We did not, however,  audit how the databases were compiled or test their overall accuracy,  except in the case of state grant data from the NASAO and some of the  Thomson Financial bond data, which we independently confirmed. We  determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  subtotaled each funding stream by year and airport category and added  other funding streams to determine the total funding. We met with FAA,  bond rating agencies, bond underwriters, airport financial consultants, and  airport and airline industry associations and discussed the data and our  conclusions to verify their reasonableness and accuracy.", "To determine whether current funding is sufficient to meet planned  development for the 5-year period from 2007\u20142011 for each airport  category and overall, we compared total funding to planned development.  We correlated each funding stream to each airports\u2019 size, as measured by  activity, and among other funding streams to better understand airports\u2019  varying reliance on them and the relationships among sources of finance.  We then discussed our findings with FAA, bond rating agencies, bond  underwriters, airport financial consultants, and airport and airline industry  associations to determine how our findings compared with their  knowledge and experiences.", "To determine some of the potential effects from changes to how airport  development is funded under the administration\u2019s proposed FAA  reauthorization legislation, we first analyzed the suggested changes to the  Airport Improvement Program\u2019s (AIP) funding and allocation. In particular  we analyzed the effect of various funding levels on how the program funds  would be allocated. Second, we evaluated the effects of raising the  passenger facility charge (PFC) ceiling, as the administration proposal  suggests, by estimating the potential PFC collections under a $6 PFC on  the basis of 2005 enplanements and collection rates assuming all airports  imposed a $6 PFC. Third, we determined the status of FAA\u2019s pilot program  for airport privatization. Moreover, we discussed the impact of all of the  proposed changes (funding/allocation, $6 PFC, and privatization) with  FAA, bond rating agencies, bond underwriters, airport financial  consultants, and airport and airline industry associations.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
