Sanctions  provide a range of tools that Congress and the President may use to  attempt to alter or deter the behavior of a foreign government, an  individual, or an entity in furtherance of U.S. national security or foreign  policy objectives. For example, sanctions may be imposed in response to  human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, or occupation of a foreign  country. Sanctions may include actions such as limiting trade; blocking  assets and interests in assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction; limiting access  to the U.S. financial system, including limiting or prohibiting transactions  involving U.S. individuals and businesses; restricting private and  government loans, investments, insurance, and underwriting; and denying  foreign assistance and government procurement contracts.", "The United States imposes comprehensive sanctions and targeted  sanctions.", "Comprehensive sanctions generally include broad-based trade  restrictions and prohibit commercial activity with an entire country.
