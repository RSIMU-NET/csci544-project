GAO reviewed monitoring documents for 54 of the 57 projects that were active from the beginning of fiscal year 2016 through the end of fiscal year 2017.

All three agencies used similar tools to monitor the performance of their projects, such as monitoring plans, performance indicators and targets, progress reports, and site visits. GAO found, however, that State did not fully document its monitoring activities for 16 of its 37 projects (43 percent). GAO found that State did not have the monitoring plans or complete progress reports for one-third of its projects and often lacked targets for performance indicators in its final progress reports. State officials said they had not required targets for each performance indicator for the projects GAO reviewed, or had not set targets due to limited resources in prior years. State has taken steps to improve its monitoring efforts, including issuing a November 2017 policy that requires targets to be set for each performance indicator and developing an automated data system that would require targets to be recorded. However, because the pilot data system allows targets to be recorded as \u201cto be determined\u201d and does not have controls to ensure entry of actual targets, it is uncertain whether performance targets will be regularly recorded. Without full documentation of monitoring activities and established performance targets, State has limited ability to assess project performance, including project efficiency or effectiveness.", "GAO reviewed the reliability of project performance information for 5 of the 54 counter-trafficking projects (2 State, 1 DOL, and 2 USAID) and found that State and USAID used inconsistent and incomplete performance information, while DOL used consistent and complete information. For example, some quarterly indicator results in State and USAID progress reports were inconsistent with annual total results, and narrative explanations for significant deviations from performance targets were sometimes not present in quarterly reports. According to agency officials, performance information from these projects is regularly used not only for direct project oversight but also for internal and external reporting, program decisions, and lessons learned. GAO found that State's and USAID's processes lack sufficient controls to ensure the reliability of project performance information, but did not find inadequate controls in DOL's process. For example, neither State nor USAID consistently used automated checks on indicator results to ensure consistency and completeness of performance indicator result calculations. In contrast, DOL used automated checks as part of its process. Without implementing controls to ensure that performance information is consistent and complete, State and USAID officials cannot fully or accurately understand what projects are, or are not, achieving, and how their efforts might be improved."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to State and one recommendation to USAID, including that both agencies establish additional controls to improve the consistency and completeness of project performance information, and that State maintain monitoring activity documentation and establish targets for each performance indicator.

Victims are often held  against their will in slave-like conditions or forced to work in the  commercial sex trade, garment factories, fishing boats, agriculture,  domestic service, and other types of servitude. In addition to inflicting  grave damage upon its victims, trafficking in persons is a multi-billion  dollar industry that undermines government authority, distorts markets,  fuels organized criminal groups and gangs, enriches transnational  criminals and terrorists, and imposes social and public health costs. The  Department of State (State) noted in its June 2018 Trafficking in Persons  Report that terrorist organizations also use trafficking in persons to recruit  adherents and finance their operations. Congress enacted the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act of 2000 to combat trafficking in persons, and has  reauthorized this act four times. The act, as amended, defines severe  forms of trafficking in persons as (1) sex trafficking in which a commercial  sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person  induced to perform such act is under age 18; or (2) the recruitment,  harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or  services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of  subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.  According to the International Labor Organization, in 2016, there were an  estimated 24.9 million people in forced labor, including 4.8 million people  in forced sexual exploitation. However, as we previously reported,  estimates of the number of trafficking victims are often questionable due  to data and methodological weaknesses.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 includes a  provision for GAO to report on the programs conducted by the  Department of State (State), the Department of Labor (DOL), the United  States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of  Defense (DOD), and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) that  address human trafficking and modern slavery, including a detailed  analysis of the effectiveness of such programs in limiting human  trafficking and modern slavery. Three of these agencies\u2014State, DOL,  and USAID\u2014have programs that design and award counter-trafficking  projects to implementing partners, through contracts, grants, or  cooperative agreements. These agencies then oversee and monitor  these projects. Since DOD and Treasury officials did not identify these  types of projects as part of their counter-trafficking in persons efforts, we  provide background information on their efforts but do not cover these  agencies in our reporting objectives. This report (1) identifies the recent  projects in international counter-trafficking in persons that key U.S.  agencies have awarded to implementing partners, and for selected  projects, assesses the extent to which key agencies have (2) documented  their monitoring activities, (3) ensured the reliability of the performance  information they use in monitoring projects, and (4) reviewed the  usefulness of the performance indicators they use in monitoring projects.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant agency documents  and interviewed agency officials. To report on agencies\u2019 programs, we  asked knowledgeable officials at State, DOL, USAID, DOD, and Treasury  to identify their projects that (1) had an international focus; (2) were  delivered by implementing partners to external recipients, such as  trafficking victims or host governments, as project beneficiaries; and (3)  addressed trafficking in persons, modern slavery, or forced labor.  Because State, DOL, and USAID managed such projects, we focus on  them as the three key agencies for the purposes of our reporting  objectives. According to officials from these three agencies, the projects  they identified range from those with counter-trafficking in persons as a  primary goal, to those in which this goal was integrated as part of the  agency\u2019s activities. We used the lists of projects that these agencies  provided to report the relevant counter-trafficking projects that agencies  awarded to implementing partners to carry out the projects. For our first  objective, we determined the projects that were active during fiscal year  2017, including those which began, were ongoing, or ended during fiscal  year 2017, and interviewed agency officials to confirm project information.", "To analyze the effectiveness of agencies\u2019 programs in limiting human  trafficking and modern slavery, we assessed the key agencies\u2019 monitoring  efforts for a subset of the projects. We identified State\u2019s, DOL\u2019s, and  USAID\u2019s projects that started before or during October 2015, which  corresponded to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and were active  through September 30, 2017, which corresponded to the fourth and last  quarter of fiscal year 2017. This resulted in a selection of 54 projects\u2014 37 from State, 3 from DOL, and 14 from USAID\u2014for our review. To  assess the extent to which State, DOL, and USAID documented their  monitoring activities for selected projects, we reviewed documentation of  key monitoring activities as specified in agency policy or the project award  agreements, including (1) the monitoring plan for each project, (2)  evidence of performance indicators and targets for each project, (3)  fiscal year 2017 progress reports for each project, (4) final progress  reports for the projects that ended by December 2017, and (5) evidence  of the agency\u2019s site visits for each project. Additionally, we interviewed  knowledgeable monitoring officials from each agency to understand  agencies\u2019 monitoring process and application of monitoring requirements  for counter-trafficking in persons projects.", "To assess the extent to which key agencies ensured the reliability of the  performance information, as well as the extent to which they reviewed the  usefulness of the performance indicators they use to monitor selected  international counter-trafficking in persons projects, we selected for  review a nongeneralizable sample of 5 projects\u20142 State projects, 1 DOL  project, and 2 USAID projects\u2014out of the 54 counter-trafficking in  persons projects identified by agencies that started before or during  October 2015 and were active through fiscal year 2017. We based our  selection of these projects primarily on the largest total award amounts.  For these five selected projects, we collected 2 years of progress reports  and other documents to assess the quantitative and qualitative  performance information. We assessed whether quarterly or semi-annual  indicator totals were consistent with annual and cumulative totals where  these were reported. Using this quantitative information, we judgmentally  selected indicators for inclusion in agency interviews where it appeared  likely that numerical errors had occurred or there appeared to be  significant project events, such as large over- or under-performance or  the elimination of the indicator. We interviewed agency officials, including  managers of each of the 5 projects, about the consistency and  completeness of monitoring information in these projects for about 60  indicators identified through our analysis, as well as to determine whether  our findings for these selected projects reflected general agency policies  and procedures, and to understand the processes and systems agencies  use to review indicators. We assessed the completeness and  consistency of project performance data that State, DOL, and USAID use  to monitor projects as part of our data reliability assessment. We found  State and USAID data to be unreliable in the projects we reviewed. We  discuss the implications of these unreliable data for State and USAID\u2019s  project management and reporting in our findings and recommendations.  We found the performance data that DOL used were consistent and  complete for the project we reviewed. While we examined indicator and  narrative information for consistency and completeness, we did not verify  the accuracy of performance information. See appendix I for more details  on our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Many forms of trafficking\u2014including sex  trafficking and labor trafficking\u2014can take place anywhere in the world and  occur without crossing country boundaries. As discussed in State\u2019s  annual Trafficking in Persons Report, trafficking victims include, for  example, Asian and African women and men who migrate to the Persian  Gulf region for domestic labor but then suffer both labor trafficking and  sexual abuse in the homes of their employers. Some victims are children.  For example, Pakistani children as young as 5 years are sold or  kidnapped into forced labor to work in brick kilns, some of which are  owned by government officials. Other victims are subjected to sexual  exploitation. In some cases, women and girls have been bought and sold  as sex slaves by members of the Islamic State. In other cases, adult men  and women have been forced to engage in commercial sex, and children  induced to do the same. Individuals, including men, are exploited in  forced labor in a variety of industries. Burmese men, for example, have  been forced to labor 20 hours a day, 7 days a week on fishing boats in  Thailand.

Our prior work on performance measurement identified 10 key  attributes of performance measures\u2014such as having a measurable  target\u2014that GAO has found are key to successfully measuring a  project\u2019s performance. For example, our prior work has shown that  numerical targets or other measurable values facilitate future  assessments of whether overall goals and objectives are achieved  because comparisons can be easily made between projected  performance and actual results. State TIP Office officials explained  that the final progress reports we reviewed lacked targets because the  TIP Office had not required targets for each indicator for the projects  we reviewed that started in fiscal years 2011 to 2016.

Moreover, in November  2017, State established a new policy asserting that, building on the logic  model or project charter, bureaus and independent offices must set  targets for each performance indicator to indicate the expected change  over the course of each period of performance. It further notes that  bureaus and independent offices should maintain documentation of  project design, including the logic model. Additionally, State TIP Office  officials said that State is developing a department-wide automated  information management system (State Assistance Management System  - Domestic, or SAMS-D) that officials expect to standardize entry of  performance information and, under the new system targets, must be  recorded for each indicator. State TIP Office officials have worked to pilot- test SAMS-D to provide feedback on the system, including suggestions to  improve the completeness of data collection, according to TIP Office  officials.", "Despite these efforts, the TIP Office\u2019s documentation of all monitoring  activities, and implementation of its November 2017 requirement to set  targets for all performance indicators, is uncertain. For example, even  though the TIP Office informed us that it began to institute a monitoring  plan requirement over the course of 2014 and early 2015, as previously  noted, eight projects we reviewed that started in September or October  2015 did not have monitoring plans.

State officials said that SAMS-D has the  capability to implement controls to alert users to update \u201cto be  determined\u201d targets, but pilot users of SAMS-D, which include the TIP  Office, have not provided feedback for this capability so far. Furthermore,  State TIP Office officials informed us that the TIP Office cannot require all  implementing partners to set targets, but that the TIP Office aspires to  update relevant targets regularly in the future and would encourage  implementing partners to update target values when appropriate.

In fiscal year 2017, State, DOL, and USAID  managed 120 counter-trafficking projects and monitored the performance  of the projects. However, weaknesses in State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s monitoring  processes limit their ability to collect reliable performance information and  assess project performance. First, we found that the State TIP Office did  not fully document its monitoring activities for many of the projects we  reviewed that started in between fiscal years 2011 to 2016. Monitoring the  implementation of projects and fully documenting the results of such  monitoring are key management controls to help ensure that project  recipients use federal funds appropriately and effectively. The State TIP  Office was also not setting targets for some project indicators, which may  have limited the TIP Office\u2019s ability to determine if implementation was on  track or if corrections needed to be made. Furthermore, we found that the  State TIP Office and USAID used project performance information  reported by the implementing partners\u2014used for internal and external  reporting purposes\u2014that was not always consistent or complete, and did  not have sufficient controls to ensure the reliability of performance  information. Finally, to ensure effective and efficient monitoring, projects  need to establish a reasonable number of indicators and update them as  needed. However, we found that the State TIP Office does not regularly  evaluate and revise all of its indicators for counter-trafficking in persons  projects, which can have large numbers of indicators.

For DOL, we reviewed its Management  Procedures and Guidelines (MPG) as well as the Comprehensive  Monitoring and Evaluation Plan Guidance Document referenced in the  fiscal year 2017 MPG. For USAID, we reviewed\u2014from its Automated  Directives System or ADS\u2014Chapter 203 on Assessing and Learning  and Chapter 201 on Program Cycle Operational Policy, which according  to USAID officials superseded Chapter 203. Once we determined what  tools the agencies use to monitor their counter-trafficking in persons  projects, we sought documentation of those tools to determine whether  agencies were implementing those tools.", "To assess the agencies\u2019 monitoring efforts, we identified all of State\u2019s,  DOL\u2019s, and USAID\u2019s projects that started before or during October 2015,  which corresponds to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, and were active  through September 30, 2017, which corresponds to the fourth and last  quarter of fiscal year 2017. This produced a list of a total of 57 State,  DOL, and USAID projects. Out of these 57 projects, we excluded 3  projects from our selection for various reasons. We excluded one DOL  project because DOL identified the project as being a research project for  which certain agency performance monitoring requirements (e.g.,  indicators, targets) are not applicable. We also excluded two USAID  projects because USAID identified each project as including several  projects with various start and end dates, thus making it difficult to  determine their time frames for inclusion in our report. This resulted in a  selection of 54 projects\u201437 from State, 3 from DOL, and 14 from USAID.  We reviewed documentation of key monitoring activities as specified in  agency policy or the project award agreements to determine the extent to  which the agencies had full documentation of key monitoring activities.  We also applied federal standards for internal control, which call for  agency management to design monitoring activities so that all  transactions are completely and accurately recorded, and GAO\u2019s key  attributes of effective performance measures, specifically the attribute of  having a numerical target. We made our determinations of the extent to  which agencies had full documentation of key monitoring activities, as  follows:", "State (37 projects). To determine whether State had fully  documented its monitoring activities, we reviewed the monitoring plan  for each project; fiscal year 2017 quarterly progress reports for each  project; and the final progress report, including indicators and targets,  for the seven projects that ended as of December 2017.", "We determined that State had \u201cfully documented\u201d the monitoring  plan, if State provided a monitoring plan worksheet for the project.  If State did not provide a monitoring plan worksheet for the  project, we determined the monitoring plan was \u201cnot documented.\u201d", "For each quarterly progress report for fiscal year 2017 as well as  the final progress report for projects that ended as of December  2017, we determined that State had \u201cfully documented\u201d the report,  if the report included both a qualitative and quantitative summary  of progress. For the State TIP Office projects we reviewed, the  qualitative summary of progress is captured in a narrative and the  quantitative summary of progress is captured in the logic model.  For the State DRL project we reviewed, the qualitative summary of  progress is captured in a narrative and the quantitative summary  of progress is captured in the monitoring plan. If either  component\u2014narrative or quantitative summary\u2014was not  documented, we determined that the report was \u201cpartially  documented.\u201d If both components were not documented, we  determined that the report was \u201cnot documented.\u201d", "We determined that State had \u201cfully documented\u201d indicators and  targets for projects that ended as of December 2017, if the final  progress report for the project included indicators as well as  targets for each indicator. If the final progress report included  indicators but did not specify targets for each indicator, we  determined that indicators and targets were \u201cpartially  documented.\u201d If the final progress report did not include  indicators and targets, we determined that indicators and targets  were \u201cnot documented.\u201d (We did not find any instances of \u201cnot  documented.\u201d)", "DOL (3 projects). To determine whether DOL had full documentation  of its monitoring activities, we reviewed the monitoring plan as well as  fiscal year 2017 semi-annual progress reports for each project.  Because DOL\u2019s three projects were ongoing as of December 2017,  we reviewed the second semi-annual progress report for fiscal year  2017 to determine whether DOL had \u201cfully documented\u201d indicators  and targets for each project. Overall, we determined that DOL had  \u201cfully documented\u201d (1) the monitoring plan for each project, if the  monitoring plan documented the performance metrics and data  collection frequency for the project; (2) each fiscal year 2017 semi- annual progress report for the project, if the report included a  qualitative and quantitative summary of progress for the period of  performance; and (3) indicators and targets for the project, if the  second semi-annual progress report included indicators as well as  targets for each applicable indicator.", "USAID (14 projects). To determine whether USAID had full  documentation of its monitoring activities, we reviewed the monitoring  plan for each project; fiscal year 2017 progress reports at the  reporting frequency specified in the agreements for each project; and  the final progress report, including indicators and targets, for the three  projects that ended as of December 2017. We also reviewed evidence  of site visits conducted during the life time of the projects. Overall, we  determined that USAID had \u201cfully documented\u201d (1) the monitoring plan  for each project, if the monitoring plan documented performance  metrics for the project; (2) the periodic progress reports for fiscal year  2017 as well as the final progress report for projects that ended as of  December 2017, if the report included a qualitative and quantitative  summary of progress for the period of performance; and (3) indicators  and targets for the three projects that ended as of December 2017, if  the final progress report included indicators as well as targets for each  applicable indicator. We determined that USAID \u201cfully documented\u201d a  project\u2019s site visit, if USAID provided evidence of having conducted at  least one site visit during the life time of the project.", "Additionally, we interviewed knowledgeable monitoring officials from each  agency to understand agencies\u2019 monitoring process and application of  monitoring requirements for counter-trafficking in persons projects.  Because State and DOL officials also identified site visits as a key tool  they use to monitor their counter-trafficking in persons projects, we  reviewed evidence of site visits conducted during the life time of the  projects to report on these efforts. We also interviewed State TIP Office  officials to discuss instances in which the agency did not have full  documentation of key monitoring activities.", "To assess the extent to which key agencies have ensured the reliability of  the performance information they use to monitor selected projects, we  selected for review a nongeneralizable sample of 5 projects\u20142 State  projects, 1 DOL project, and 2 USAID projects\u2014out of the 54 counter- trafficking in persons projects identified by agencies that started before or  during October 2015 and were active through fiscal year 2017. We based  our selection of these projects primarily on largest total award amounts.  For these selected projects, we obtained 2 years of progress reports and  other documents to assess the quantitative and qualitative performance  information. We developed a standardized template to capture all  quarterly or semi-annual indicator performance information reported for  each of these projects and assessed whether quarterly or semi-annual  totals were consistent with annual and cumulative totals where these  were reported. Using this quantitative information, we judgmentally  selected indicators for inclusion in agency interviews where it appeared  likely that numerical errors had occurred or there appeared to be  significant project events, such as large over- or under-performance or  the elimination of the indicator. We interviewed agency officials, including  managers of these five projects, about the consistency and completeness  of monitoring information in these projects for about 60 indicators  identified through our analysis. Additionally, we questioned these  officials about performance report narrative information describing project  activities that, in our judgement, appeared to be incomplete or  inconsistent with respect to indicator results. We also used these  interviews to determine whether our findings for these selected projects  reflected general agency policies and procedures. We assessed the  completeness and consistency of project performance data that State,  DOL, and USAID use to monitor projects as part of our data reliability  assessment. We found State and USAID data to be unreliable in the  projects we reviewed. We discuss the implications of these unreliable  data for State and USAID\u2019s project management and reporting in our  findings and recommendations. We found the performance data that DOL  used were consistent and complete for the project we reviewed. While we  examined indicator data and narrative information for consistency and  completeness, we did not verify the accuracy of performance information.", "To assess the extent to which key agencies have reviewed the  usefulness of the performance indicators they use to monitor selected  projects, we used the same nongeneralizable sample of five projects\u2014 two State projects, one DOL project, and two USAID projects. We  interviewed agency officials, including managers of these five projects,  about processes and systems they use to review the usefulness of  indicators on an ongoing basis, such as when conditions in the project  activity region change or if the agency and implementing partner learn  that certain project activities are less effective than expected. We  identified examples of indicators that had apparently been discontinued,  as well as continued indicators that showed minimal progress, and we  asked these officials to explain what had or had not been discontinued.  We also used these interviews to determine whether our findings for  these selected projects reflected general agency policies and procedures.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

USAID commented that it does not believe that our draft report  reflected the existing controls the USAID mission in Ghana shared  with us, and that the mission had furnished us with a file that,  according to USAID, contained correct information for all indicators  and their results from the time the activity began until our audit. While  the mission provided us with a spreadsheet, this document included  only annual performance totals for several years without  accompanying quarterly totals, or quarterly or annual narrative  information. We focused our analysis on the quarterly and annual  performance reports to understand the extent to which USAID was  ensuring the consistency and completeness of performance  information, including associated narratives, underlying its aggregate  and higher-level performance reports. We reported on inconsistent or  incomplete performance information only after discussing and  substantiating the specific errors we identified with USAID officials.  Further, we recognize USAID\u2019s efforts to address errors that the  agency identified prior to our review and we provide an example of  such efforts in the report.  2.

As discussed in the Objectives, Scope, and  Methodology section of our report (see app. I), we selected projects,  including the integrated project in Ghana, based on a list of counter- trafficking in persons projects provided by USAID. Because the same  operational policy that sets the monitoring and evaluation standards  for the agency applied to all indicators within a given project, we  examined available quarterly or semi-annual indicator data for all  reported indicators in selected projects to determine the completeness  and consistency of the data.
