This process has helped the State Department to more systematically identify unneeded property.

OBO\u2019s initial cable requested that posts report all government-owned real property that should be considered for disposal, including properties for which posts had disposal processes under way.

The property is currently being marketed and is valued at up to $10 million.", "We also found that the number of properties listed in the inventory does not accurately reflect the number of properties the State Department manages because, according to OBO, posts have inconsistently assigned property identification numbers. Posts sometimes assigned separate numbers to land and associated buildings. For example, the embassy in Paris is listed as three separate properties\u2014the land and two buildings. The buildings were acquired separately but are now connected. The three properties comprise one compound. At other times, posts assigned one number to multiple properties\u2014for example, in Brasilia, four separate lots were given one property identification number.", "Along with its other efforts, OBO is attempting to improve the accuracy, and therefore the reliability, of the State Department\u2019s worldwide overseas property inventory data. According to OBO officials, since individual posts are responsible for entering their own data, correcting inaccuracies requires that they routinely check and update data in their property inventories. To help posts keep accurate inventory data, OBO has provided 238 posts with computer software for recording their property inventories, along with a user manual that gives step-by-step instructions. However, according to OBO, 185 posts have installed or are in the process of installing the software, leaving 53 posts that are not using it\u2014thereby negatively affecting the consistency and accuracy of inventory data. In November 2001, OBO reported that about 20 posts had not corrected known errors or omissions in their property inventories.
