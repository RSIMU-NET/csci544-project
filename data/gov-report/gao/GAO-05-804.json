The restoration program reports that it had been appropriated over $17 million by September 2005. In anticipation of the authorization's expiration, GAO was asked to provide information for fiscal years 2000 through 2004, the most recent 5-year period for which complete information is available, about (1) funding for the program; (2) expenditures by the program for restoration projects, travel expenses, administrative expenses, overhead, and technical support; (3) expenditures by the management council and the task force; and (4) whether the Secretary complied with certain requirements of the Act. GAO obtained funding and expenditure information from FWS but did not audit that financial information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have taken a number of actions to formulate, establish, and implement the Klamath River Basin Conservation Area Restoration Program, including designating a conservation area, establishing the management council and the task force, formulating a long-term plan, and funding restoration projects in the Klamath River Basin. The restoration program reports receiving a little over $9.8 million in cash and noncash contributions during fiscal years 2000 through 2004 from federal and nonfederal sources. The federal portion totaled almost $6.3 million and consisted of about $5.1 million from FWS's lump-sum resource management appropriation account, and almost $1.2 million in cash and noncash contributions from federal entities that participated in restoration projects with FWS, according to FWS records. FWS records also show that the nonfederal portion consisted of almost $3.6 million in cash and noncash contributions from nonfederal entities that participated in restoration projects. During the same 5-year period, the restoration program spent about $7.6 million in cash and noncash contributions for restoration projects, about $200,000 for travel reimbursements, about $1.1 million for administrative expenses, and about $491,000 for overhead, according to information provided by FWS officials. Information was not available on technical support expenses incurred by the restoration program. The management council and the task force serve solely in an advisory capacity and do not directly select or manage projects. FWS officials told GAO that they paid about $800,000 to cover operating costs of the management council and the task force for the 5-year period. Regarding the financial requirements of the Act, FWS officials have correctly identified the need to fund some Restoration Program expenditures from monies that are not subject to the Act's restrictions, and FWS officials told GAO they believe they are in compliance with these provisions. However, FWS has not yet incorporated into their accounting procedures and record-keeping sufficient controls to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with those provisions of the Act. In addition, the Act requires that half of the restoration program's costs be funded by nonfederal sources. FWS officials collect some information on restoration projects regarding any nonfederal contributions, but they do not distinguish between cash and noncash contributions in project documents, document their valuation decisions regarding the noncash contributions, or take steps to verify that nonfederal contributions meet the Act's criteria. Incorporating these additional controls into the Restoration Program's operations would not be difficult or costly, and would provide reasonable assurance of compliance with those provisions of the Act."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In October 1986, to assist in restoring the Klamath River\u2019s fish resources,  Congress passed the Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources Restoration  Act (the Act). The Act authorized $21 million to be appropriated to the  Department of the Interior and charged the Secretary with implementing a  20-year program to designate and restore a conservation area within the  Klamath River Basin.  To assist the Secretary, the Act also established the  Klamath Fishery Management Council to monitor the fish population and  recommend annual fish harvest limits, and the Klamath River Basin  Fisheries Task Force to advise the Secretary regarding implementation of  the Restoration Program.", "Because the 1986 Act established a 20-year program and provided that the  $21 million authorization would expire on September 30, 2006, you asked  us to gather and analyze financial information about the Klamath River  Basin Conservation Area Restoration Program (Restoration Program), the  Management Council, and the Task Force for the most recent 5-year period  for which complete information is available. Specifically, you asked us to  provide information about (1) the sources and amounts of funding received  by and for the Restoration Program for fiscal years 2000 through 2004;   (2) how much of the funds received by and for the Restoration Program for  fiscal years 2000 through 2004 were spent for restoration projects, travel  reimbursements, administrative expenses, overhead, and technical  support; (3) the amounts of funding received by the Task Force and  Management Council for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 that were spent for  restoration projects, travel reimbursements, administrative expenses,  overhead, and technical support; and (4) whether the Secretary of the  Interior complied with specific requirements contained in the Act.", "To answer these questions, we obtained and analyzed information from  officials of the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (FWS), the Task Force, and the Management Council. We reviewed the  Klamath Act, Task Force meeting minutes, Management Council meeting  minutes, Federal Advisory Committee Act reports prepared by FWS  officials for the Task Force and the Management Council, budget and  accounting records maintained by FWS officials, and reports of studies and  other documents issued by the Task Force and the Management Council.", "Regarding the information on funding for the Restoration Program,  expenditures by the Restoration Program, and expenditures made on  behalf of the Management Council and the Task Force, we noted that the  Restoration Program\u2019s financial information for the 5-year period has not  been subject to any external audit. Furthermore, the funding and  expenditure information for the program are maintained by FWS on several  different systems designed for various management purposes. As discussed  with your staff, we did not perform a financial audit on the financial  information we collected from FWS officials for various reasons. For  example, FWS\u2019s appropriations do not contain a discrete line item for the  Restoration Program and this prevented us from doing an independent  verification of the appropriated amounts. Likewise, limitations in FWS\u2019s  record-keeping systems for restoration projects, employee time and  attendance, and cost accounting prevented us from validating some project  and expenditure information. However, we did discuss the financial  information extensively with FWS officials, perform certain analytical tests  on the information, and in some cases, receive revised financial  information from the FWS officials. Based on these procedures, we  concluded that the financial information was sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "In addition to not auditing the financial information, we did not evaluate  the efficiency or effectiveness of the Restoration Program, of individual  restoration projects, or of actions taken by the Task Force and the  Management Council. For the most part, we limited the scope of our work  to fiscal years 2000 through 2004; however, some compliance information  and some historical financial information we gathered included earlier  years, going back to the passage of the Act in 1986.

First, FWS\u2019s appropriations do not contain a discrete line item for the  Restoration Program. This prevented us from doing any independent  verification of the appropriated amounts. Second, FWS\u2019s restoration  project database does not distinguish between cash and noncash  contributions provided to the restoration project by project participants.  The restoration project database shows a single amount, called the cost- share amount, which is the sum of all contributions made by the project  participant to the project. For some projects, we could determine the  amount of cost share that consisted of cash and the amount that consisted  of noncash by looking in the contract file at the project agreement, or at  supporting documents, or even at the final report if the project had been  completed. However, for some restoration projects, even those documents  did not contain adequate information for us to make a distinction between  cash and noncash contributions. As a result, we were unable to determine  how much of contributions made by project participants was cash and how  much was noncash. Third, Restoration Program officials did not routinely  perform independent analysis to determine the value that should be  assigned to noncash contributions as called for by good financial  management practices. Rather, according to FWS officials, they typically  accepted the values assigned by the project participant as long as the  values appeared reasonable. They did this for various reasons, including  their lack of formal criteria for making such evaluations, and their  uncertainty about their authority to question the values. Therefore, the  composition and value of cost-share amounts maintained in FWS records  are subject to question.", "For the 5 years from the beginning of fiscal year 2000 through the end of  fiscal year 2004, according to FWS officials, the Klamath River Basin  Conservation Area Restoration Program received about $9.8 million in cash  and noncash contributions: almost $6.3 million from federal sources and  almost $3.6 million from nonfederal sources. The federal funds included  about $5.1 million in appropriations derived from FWS\u2019s Resource  Management appropriation account,which includes a lump-sum  appropriation that FWS allocates to various program activities, including  the Fisheries Program.  FWS operates several subprograms within the  Fisheries Program, including the Fish and Wildlife Management Program,  which administers several subactivity program elements, including  Anadromous Fish Management.", "During the 5 years under review, FWS allocated about $5 million in  appropriations to the Klamath River Basin Conservation Area Restoration  Program established under the Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources  Restoration Act. In addition, according to FWS officials, FWS provided  about $135,000 more to the Restoration Program during the 5-year period  from appropriations FWS has allocated to support the Anadromous Fish  Management subactivity of the Fisheries Program\u2019s Fish and Wildlife  Management Program. Also, according to FWS records, the Restoration  Program benefited during that same time period from the almost  $1.2 million in cash and noncash contributions from federal entities that  participated in restoration projects. The almost $3.6 million from  nonfederal sources came to the Restoration Program as cash and noncash  contributions from nonfederal entities that participated in restoration  projects, according to FWS records. See table 1 for a year-by-year  breakdown of the Restoration Program funding, based on unaudited  financial information provided by FWS officials.", "In addition to gathering financial information on the Restoration Program\u2019s  sources of funds for fiscal years 2000 through 2004, we gathered the same  information going back to the passage of the Act in 1986. Specifically, from  the beginning of fiscal year 1988 through June 2005, FWS records show  that the Klamath River Basin Conservation Area Restoration Program  received over $17.0 million in funding from the Resource Management  appropriations that FWS has allocated for the Restoration Program  established by the Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources Restoration Act  and another $188,000 from FWS\u2019s Resource Management appropriations  that FWS allocated for other activities funded by the Fisheries Program. In  addition, according to FWS officials, the Restoration Program benefited  during that same time period from about $1.7 million in cash and noncash  contributions from federal entities that participated in restoration projects  and from $5.8 million in cash and noncash contributions from nonfederal  entities that participated in restoration projects. Although the Act was  passed on October 27, 1986, the Restoration Program did not receive  designated appropriations for fiscal year 1987.

The project  participants used the $4.7 million of cash and noncash contributions on  those restoration projects in which they participated. We were not able to  obtain adequate information on the project participants\u2019 contributions to  describe the purposes for which those amounts were spent. See table 2 for  a year-by-year breakdown of the purposes and amounts of Restoration  Program expenditures paid from FWS appropriations.", "We used the expenditure categories in table 2 to report how FWS\u2019s  Resource Management appropriations were spent because they represent  the major functions for which the Restoration Program spends funds and,  with the exception of overhead, are the major categories FWS officials use  to track the Restoration Program budget. However, to fulfill our  engagement objectives, we also sought to provide information about what  amounts of the FWS\u2019s Resource Management appropriations received by  and for the Restoration Program from the beginning of fiscal year 2000  through the end of fiscal year 2004 were spent for the purposes of  restoration projects, travel reimbursements, administrative expenses,  overhead, and technical support.", "Restoration projects. Table 2 shows that almost $2.9 million was  committed to restoration projects from FWS\u2019s Resource Management  appropriations for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. Combining that amount  with the $4.7 million in cash and noncash contributions provided to  restoration projects by project participants brings the total invested by the  Restoration Program directly to restoration projects during the 5-year  period to a little over $7.6 million.", "Of the $2.9 million in project funding from FWS\u2019s Resource Management  appropriations, the Restoration Program provided almost $700,000 to three  federal entities to help fund 26 restoration projects carried out by those  federal entities, and provided almost $2.2 million to 18 nonfederal entities  to help fund 100 restoration projects carried out by those nonfederal  entities. The three federal entities that carried out the 26 restoration  projects are the same ones that brought cash and noncash contributions  totaling almost $1.2 million to the Restoration Program, and the 18  nonfederal entities that carried out the 100 restoration projects are the  same ones that brought cash and noncash contributions totaling almost  $3.6 million to the Restoration Program. Thus, according to FWS records,  total investment from federal and nonfederal sources in restoration  projects amounted to a little over $7.6 million that funded 126 restoration  projects from the beginning of fiscal year 2000 through the end of fiscal  year 2004. It should be recognized, however, that in addition to Restoration  Program projects, other restoration projects are undertaken in the Klamath  River Basin with funding from FWS through its other programs; and other  restoration projects still are undertaken in the Klamath River Basin with  funding from other federal entities, the states of California and Oregon, and  other nonfederal entities.", "Travel reimbursement expenses. Travel reimbursement expenses are  contained in each of three expenditure categories (project management,  program administration, and support of federal advisory committees)  shown in table 2, but they can be segregated. Specifically, total Restoration  Program travel reimbursement expenses amounted to about $200,000 for  the 5-year period, for an average of about $40,000 per year. This includes  travel by members of the two federal advisory committees, federal staff  who support the committees, and FWS officials who perform project  management and program administration activities.", "Program administration expenses. Table 2 shows program  administration expenses for the 5-year period of about $350,000. Table 2  also shows expenditures of about $800,000 in support of the two federal  advisory committees. Based on our discussions with FWS officials, we  consider the expenditures made in support of the federal advisory  committees to also be administrative expenses for the Restoration  Program. Summing the amounts for those two categories produces a total  of about $1.1 million for Restoration Program administrative expenses  during fiscal years 2000 through 2004.", "Overhead expenses. To provide information about what amounts of the  funds received by and for the Restoration Program from the beginning of  fiscal year 2000 through the end of fiscal year 2004 were spent for the  purposes of overhead expenses, we examined the use of Restoration  Program funds at the FWS Washington, D.C., office level, the FWS regional  office level, and the Yreka FWO level. Each year during the 5-year period,  the FWS headquarters in Washington, D.C., received varying amounts of the  Restoration Program appropriations for \u201cCost Allocation Methodology,\u201d a  process through which rent and other FWS administrative costs are shared  by the programs. As can be seen in table 2, we considered the amount  received by FWS headquarters, about $216,000, to be Restoration Program  overhead.", "The Portland Regional Office oversaw the operations of the Yreka FWO for  most of fiscal years 2000 through 2004 and during the first 4 of those years  it received a total of about $227,000 of Restoration Program appropriated  funds. According to an FWS official, an 8 percent assessment is applied by  the regional office to all Fisheries Program funds and used to pay for office  management, staff expertise, and support costs, including data  management; program oversight of the field office; budget and finance  services; human resources, external affairs, and employee assistance  services; as well as development and implementation of fisheries policies,  operating plans, evaluation methods, and administrative procedures for  field offices. Again, as seen in table 2, we considered the amount received  by the FWS regional office, about $227,000, to be Restoration Program  overhead.", "To identify any Restoration Program overhead expenses incurred at the  Yreka FWO level, we analyzed the various cost categories maintained by  Yreka FWO officials and the office expenses that are allocated to the  Restoration Program. After discussing our analysis with the Yreka FWO  officials, we decided that Restoration Program overhead incurred at the  Yreka FWO level could best be represented by four categories of  expenses. During fiscal years 2000 through 2004, the amounts of these  expenses allocated to the Restoration Program by FWS totaled about  $48,000. This amount is not shown separately in table 2 because, like the  travel expenses category, components of this amount are contained in each  of three expenditure categories (project management, program  administration, and support of federal advisory committees). Adding  together the Restoration Program overhead incurred at each of the three  FWS organizational levels (almost $216,000 at the FWS Washington, D.C.,  office level; almost $227,000 at the FWS regional office level; and about  $48,000 at the Yreka FWO level), we found that Restoration Program  overhead was about $491,000 during fiscal years 2000 through 2004.", "Technical support expense. We also attempted to provide information  about what amounts of the funds received by and for the Restoration  Program from the beginning of fiscal year 2000 through the end of fiscal  year 2004 were spent for technical support. As provided for in the Act,  staff from the Yreka FWO, along with staff from the State of California\u2019s  Department of Fish and Game, provide technical and administrative  support to the Management Council and the Task Force. The technical  support from FWS comes primarily from three staff:  the supervisory  biologist and the part-time staff biologist in the Yreka FWO, who spend  almost all of their time on Restoration Program activities, and the staff  biologist in the Yreka FWO, who spends part of his time on Restoration  Program activities. FWS is reimbursed from Restoration Program funds for  the portion of FWS staff salaries that is attributable to providing  administrative and technical support services to the two federal advisory  committees. The State of California is not reimbursed for its employees\u2019  salaries for the time they spend providing administrative and technical  support to the committees. Neither FWS officials nor the Restoration  Program\u2019s representatives from the State of California could provide us  with estimates of the value of technical support they provide. In addition to  the support provided by FWS and the State of California, both the Task  Force, through its Technical Work Group, and the Management Council,  through its Technical Assistance Team, receive technical assistance from  many of the entities represented by the Task Force members and the  Management Council members, but information was not available on the  value of those technical services either."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purposes for which the Task Force and the Management Council Spent Funds", "paragraphs": ["According to FWS officials, about $800,000 has been used to pay for the  committees\u2019 operating costs from the beginning of fiscal year 2000 through  the end of fiscal year 2004, a yearly average of about $160,000. The two  committees\u2019 operating costs are funded from FWS\u2019s Resource Management  appropriations. Officials in FWS\u2019s Yreka, California, field office, who  administer the Restoration Program, receive and expend the funds that pay  for the committees\u2019 operating costs. They provided us with information  that shows that the approximately $800,000 expended for the committees\u2019  operating costs was spent for salaries of federal staff (about $520,000);  travel for committee members and federal staff (about $120,000); and office  costs, including vehicles, supplies, copies, and meeting rooms (about  $150,000). Neither of the advisory committees makes expenditures for  restoration projects, and as mentioned earlier, we consider all expenditures  for the operations of the advisory committees to represent Restoration  Program administrative expenses.", "The Task Force and the Management Council submit Federal Advisory  Committee Act (FACA) reports each year showing expenditures related to  their operations. We obtained FACA reports produced by FWS officials for  the Task Force and the Management Council for fiscal years 2000 through  2004 for purposes of determining the types and amounts of expenditures  made by the Task Force and the Management Council. However, after  conducting some analytical testing procedures, and discussing the FACA  report financial information with the Designated Federal Officers for the  two federal advisory committees, we concluded that due to changes in  interpretations of the reporting instructions, the FACA data were not  reported on a consistent basis during the 5-year period. For example, some  amounts contained in the FACA reports for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, but  not for the other years, likely included some Restoration Program-related  expenses incurred and paid by the Department of Commerce and the  Department of Agriculture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Reasonable Assurance of Compliance with the Act\u2019s Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources Restoration Act imposes  several requirements upon the Secretary of the Interior as part of the  Secretary\u2019s responsibility for implementing the Restoration Program.

We considered whether the Secretary and the  Restoration Program administrators have complied with the Act\u2019s financial- related requirements and limitations. We found that more complete and  timely action in complying with the Act\u2019s requirements would better assure  that the requirements are fulfilled and that compliance with the Act\u2019s  limitations can be reasonably assured only by implementing control  mechanisms and record-keeping practices which are not yet in place."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Needed Actions Not Yet Taken on Nonfederal Match and Noncash Contributions Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In 1987, FWS officials drafted proposed regulations to address the  nonfederal match and noncash contribution provisions contained in the  Act, but the draft regulations were never formally promulgated. The Act  requires that 50 percent of the cost of the development and implementation  of the Restoration Program be provided, on a basis considered by the  Secretary of the Interior to be timely and appropriate, by one or more  nonfederal sources. The Act specifies that for purposes of determining  whether 50 percent of the cost is being provided by nonfederal sources, the  Secretary of the Interior should include the contributions of state and local  governments as long as such contributions do not entail the expenditure of  federal monies received by the state or local government. The Act also  directs the Secretary to consider as financial contributions by nonfederal  sources the value of noncash contributions (that is, services, including  volunteer services, and real and personal property) provided by the  nonfederal sources for the purposes of implementing the Restoration  Program.", "The Act further requires the Secretary to establish by regulation (1) the  training, experience, and other qualifications that volunteers must have in  order for their services to be considered as noncash contributions; and  (2) the standards under which the Secretary will determine the value of  noncash contributions, that is, services, and real and personal property.", "We found evidence that the Task Force, which is responsible for assisting  and advising the Secretary on the development and implementation of the  Restoration Program, had extensive discussions regarding the nonfederal  match and noncash contribution provisions of the Act, and the need for  regulations, during its public meetings in 1987, 1988, and 1989. We also  found that FWS officials drafted proposed regulations to address the  nonfederal match and noncash contribution provisions during that same  time period and that the Task Force reviewed and approved of the draft  regulations. However, according to Interior officials, the draft regulations  were never formally promulgated because Interior decided it was not  necessary to issue separate regulations regarding qualifications for  volunteer services and the standards for valuing noncash contributions.   The Department of the Interior based this decision, according to the  Interior officials, on its determination that existing Interior grants  management regulations, which prescribe rules Interior must follow to  meet cost-share requirements in federal grants and other federal awards,  provided sufficient guidance.", "Because of Interior\u2019s interpretation, new regulations specific to the  Restoration Program were not issued, and FWS officials maintain that it is  not necessary to issue any. However, inadequate internal controls impair  FWS officials\u2019 abilities to be reasonably assured of compliance with these  existing Interior regulations. For example, FWS officials told us that they  have not rejected any restoration project proposal due to the proposal\u2019s  lack of information on the values assigned or the methods for valuing the  proposed noncash contributions, even though our review of project files  identified several approved projects whose project documents lacked such  information. In addition, FWS officials told us that they typically accept the  values assigned to noncash contributions by those who propose projects as  long as the values appear reasonable, and that they do not have formal  criteria for making this reasonableness evaluation. This lack of reasonable  assurance of compliance prevents both congressional overseers, who may  seek information about program funding, and Restoration Program  administrators from being able to make consistent, reliable decisions about  when volunteers\u2019 services should count as noncash contributions and how  to value all types of noncash contributions to the Restoration Program.", "In addition to the potential problems associated with FWS\u2019s current  practices related to acceptance of volunteer services as noncash  contributions and valuation of noncash contributions, FWS officials have  not developed a methodology, or mechanism, for measuring whether  50 percent of the cost of the development and implementation of the  Restoration Program is being provided by nonfederal sources. In our  discussions with FWS officials, they expressed uncertainty about whether  certain nonfederal financial initiatives should be counted toward the cost- share requirement. For example, if the State of California provides funding  for restoration projects that have the same goals as the Restoration  Program\u2019s projects, but that do not involve any FWS participation, FWS  officials are unsure of whether the funding for those projects should be  counted toward meeting the nonfederal cost-share requirement.", "Furthermore, even though expenditures of federal money by a state or  local government to carry out the Restoration Program do not qualify for  meeting the Act\u2019s criteria that 50 percent of costs be provided from  nonfederal sources, FWS officials have not developed a methodology for  determining whether state or local government contributions to the  Restoration Program actually constitute expenditure of federal money for  purposes of the Act\u2019s cost-share provision. Without having established such  methodologies, FWS officials cannot determine whether the Restoration  Program is in compliance with the nonfederal cost-share provision of the  Act.", "FWS officials have requested and collected limited financial data on each  restoration project funded by the Restoration Program. For example,  FWS\u2019s Request For Proposals (RFP) for restoration projects to be funded  during fiscal year 2004 states: \u201cThe Klamath Act recognizes in-kind  contributions by volunteers as contributions to the Klamath Restoration  Program.\u201d However, our review of documents in FWS\u2019s project files,  including project proposals, proposed budgets, project agreements, and  final reports, showed that the documents often do not contain detailed  information needed to determine (1) the amount of cash contribution,  (2) the type of noncash contribution, (3) the value of the noncash  contribution, and (4) the method of valuing the noncash contribution.", "In addition, we found no indication in the project files that the data are  routinely analyzed and recorded concerning (1) the amount of a state or  local government\u2019s contribution that should be counted as nonfederal,  (2) whether the services of volunteers qualify as a noncash contribution,  and (3) whether the noncash contributions are properly valued. FWS  officials told us that they typically accept the values assigned to nonfederal  contributions by project participants. In their project records, FWS officials  record a single \u201ccost-share\u201d amount for each project, which they extract  from the project proposals submitted by project participants. The cost- share amount represents total contributions brought to the project by  project participants, but it does not distinguish between monetary  contributions and noncash contributions in the combined amount. In  addition, FWS officials do not maintain records on the value of any  nonfederal contributions to the Restoration Program that are not project  related, such as the State of California\u2019s contribution of technical services  to the Management Council and the Task Force. As a result, FWS officials  are not able to demonstrate that the Restoration Program is in compliance  with the Act\u2019s nonfederal match provision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improved Accounting Needed to Assure Compliance with the Act\u2019s Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["Although FWS officials told us they believe they are in compliance with  other provisions of the Act that restrict reimbursing certain travel  expenses, such compliance cannot be assured or demonstrated because  the FWS accounting system does not distinguish between Resource  Management appropriations allocated for the Restoration Program and  funds from the same lump-sum appropriation allocated for related  purposes. The Act places some limitations on the purposes for which the  money it authorizes to be appropriated can be spent. For example, the  funds appropriated for the Restoration Program may not be used to  reimburse any agency or governmental unit whose employees are  Management Council members or Task Force members for time spent by  any such employee performing Management Council or Task Force duties.  Likewise, the Act precludes the funds\u2019 use for reimbursing travel expenses  to federal employees who travel as members of the Management Council or  Task Force.", "Both the Management Council and the Task Force have members who are  federal employees, and each has at least one member who is a FWS  employee. Our work did not find any instance of noncompliance with the  above restrictions. However, FWS offices that receive Restoration Program  funds also receive some funds FWS has allocated to the Anadromous Fish  Management activity of the Fisheries Program which are designated by the  same account code (1331) as the Restoration Program funds. Although, as  mentioned above, the Restoration Program funds may not be used for  certain purposes, the Anadromous Fish Management funds can be and are  used for those purposes. Since neither the Restoration Program funds nor  the Anadromous Fish Management funds are designated by an additional  subactivity or project code that would distinguish between the two types of  funds, the source of funds that have been used for specific expenditures  cannot be determined or verified from the accounting records. As a result,  FWS\u2019s accounting records do not provide the detailed information needed  to assure that the restrictions on the use of Restoration Program  appropriated funds are being complied with."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since passage of the Klamath River Basin Fishery Resources Restoration  Act in 1986, the Restoration Program established to carry out the Act has  received about $24.7 million in cash and noncash contributions. Of the  $24.7 million, the Restoration Program received about $9.8 million during  fiscal years 2000 through 2004. The Secretary of the Interior and the  Director of FWS have taken a number of actions to formulate, establish,  and implement the Restoration Program, including designating a  conservation area, establishing the Management Council and the Task  Force, formulating a long-term plan, and funding over 350 restoration  projects in the Klamath River Basin. Regarding the financial requirements  of the Act, FWS officials have correctly identified the need to fund some  Restoration Program expenditures, such as certain travel and salary  expenses for FWS officials who are members of the Management Council  or the Task Force, from monies that are not subject to the Act\u2019s restrictions.   However, they have not yet incorporated into their accounting procedures  and record-keeping practices sufficient controls to provide reasonable  assurance of compliance with those provisions of the Act. In addition,  concerning the Act\u2019s requirement that 50 percent of the Restoration  Program\u2019s costs be provided by nonfederal sources, FWS officials do  collect some information regarding nonfederal contributions to restoration  projects, but they do not distinguish between cash and noncash  contributions in project documents, document their valuation decisions  regarding the noncash contributions, or take steps to verify that nonfederal  contributions meet the Act\u2019s criteria.

We performed our work primarily at the  headquarters offices of the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service (FWS) in Washington, D.C. We also traveled to FWS\u2019s  Yreka, California, field office, which administers the Restoration Program,  to inspect files and gather information. We gathered additional information  from other locations through telephone contacts with FWS officials in  FWS\u2019s Portland Regional Office and its California-Nevada Operations  Office. We also interviewed by telephone Task Force and Management  Council members who represent various entities in California and Oregon.", "To provide information about what total amount of funding was received  by and for the Restoration Program from the beginning of fiscal year 2000  through the end of fiscal year 2004, and what were the sources of that  funding, we first defined the boundaries of the Restoration Program  because there were numerous restoration-type activities undertaken by  federal and nonfederal entities in the Klamath River Basin during the 5-year  period we reviewed. After reviewing the provisions of the Act, having  preliminary discussions with FWS officials, and visiting the Klamath River  area, we defined the Restoration Program, for purposes of our work, as  consisting of all activities and projects that are at least partially funded by  appropriations FWS allocated for the Restoration Program pursuant to the  Act. Under the definition we adopted, the Restoration Program funding  also includes any cash or noncash contributions provided by federal or  nonfederal sources to those same activities and projects.", "Having defined the Restoration Program, we interviewed FWS  headquarters, regional office, and field office officials to determine the  types of Restoration Program funding and expenditure information  routinely collected and the location and accessibility of that information.  To obtain information on the amount of Resource Management  appropriations that FWS allocated to the Restoration Program established  pursuant to the Act, we reviewed budget request documents and  appropriations act documents for FWS and the Department of the Interior,  but did not find information on funding specifically for the Restoration  Program in those documents. We discussed this with FWS headquarters,  regional office, and field office budget officials and were told by them that  the appropriations for FWS do not contain a discrete line item for the  Restoration Program. Instead, funding for the Restoration Program is  combined with other funding within the \u201cGeneral Program Activities\u201d sub- element of the \u201cAnadromous Fish Management\u201d program element, which  can be found under the \u201cFish and Wildlife Management Program\u201d activity of  FWS\u2019s Fisheries Program account, which is funded through an allocation  from FWS\u2019s Resource Management appropriation. A Portland Regional  Office budget official, who oversaw funding for the Yreka Fish and Wildlife  Office (FWO), told us that FWS considers there to be an appropriation for  the Restoration Program for each of the 5 years of $1 million, less a  rescission each year that varied between 0.38 percent and 1.82 percent. We  obtained Office Fund Target documents from the Yreka FWO that  supported those amounts.", "To provide information about the amounts and sources of other funding  contributed by federal and nonfederal sources to activities and projects  that are at least partially funded by those appropriations allocated by FWS  to the Restoration Program, we obtained from FWS officials an electronic  copy of their Restoration Projects Database, maintained in FWS\u2019s Yreka,  California, office. That database contains information on only those  restoration projects that are at least partially funded by appropriations  FWS allocated for the Restoration Program pursuant to the Act. It also  contains, among other things, information on the cost-share contributions  provided to those restoration projects by federal and nonfederal entities.  We also obtained and reviewed for some funded restoration projects the  project proposals and project completion reports that had been prepared  by the cooperators to determine if the amounts of cost share reported in  those documents are consistent with the information in FWS\u2019s Restoration  Projects Database.", "To provide information about whether other amounts of monetary funding  or noncash contributions are provided to any of the Restoration Program\u2019s  nonproject activities, we obtained FWS budget and expenditure  information to identify the other activities and interviewed Yreka FWO  officials, Task Force members, and Management Council members to learn  of any other funding. We were told that no other cash contributions are  received by the Restoration Program\u2019s nonproject activities but noncash  contributions, in the form of technical services, are provided by some  federal and nonfederal sources to the Task Force and the Management  Council. However, FWS officials do not maintain records on the value of  those technical services.", "To provide information about what amounts of the funds received by and  for the Restoration Program from the beginning of fiscal year 2000 through  the end of fiscal year 2004 were spent for the purposes of restoration  projects, travel reimbursements, administrative expenses, overhead, and  technical support, we obtained budget and expenditure documents from  the Yreka FWO. We had several discussions with Yreka FWO officials to  gain an understanding of how the various financial amounts are derived  and the availability of source documents that support the amounts.  Through analysis of the financial information, we identified which items on  the financial documents represent the Restoration Program\u2019s restoration  projects, and which items represent travel reimbursements, administrative  expenses, and overhead. Through discussions with Yreka FWO officials,  we confirmed our interpretations of these amounts and confirmed Yreka  FWO officials do not maintain records on the value of technical services.", "To provide information about what amounts of funding received by the  Task Force and Management Council from the beginning of fiscal year 2000  through the end of fiscal year 2004 were spent for the purposes of  restoration projects, travel reimbursements, administrative expenses,  overhead, and technical support, we obtained through the Internet, from a  Web site maintained by the General Services Administration, Federal  Advisory Committee Act (FACA) reports produced by the Task Force and  the Management Council showing expenditures related to those two  federal advisory committees for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. We  considered using the FACA report financial information for determining the  amounts of Restoration Program funds that were spent by the Management  Council and the Task Force for the purposes of restoration projects, travel  reimbursements, administrative expenses, overhead, and technical  support. However, after conducting some analytical testing procedures and  discussing the FACA report financial information with the Designated  Federal Officers for the two federal advisory committees, we concluded  that the FACA report data would present a misleading picture of  Restoration Program expenditures.", "Our discussions with the Designated Federal Officers for the two federal  advisory committees, Management Council members, Task Force  members, and Yreka FWO officials, coupled with our review of  Management Council and Task Force meeting minutes, charters, and  operating procedures, showed that the Management Council and the Task  Force do not actually receive or expend any federal or nonfederal funding.  The funding that covers the Management Council\u2019s and the Task Force\u2019s  operational expenses comes from FWS appropriations, and FWS officials  in the Yreka FWO retain control of that funding and pay those expenses.", "To determine whether the Secretary of the Interior, the Management  Council, and the Task Force complied with specific duties and limitations  contained in the Act, we reviewed the Klamath River Basin Fishery  Resources Restoration Act and all of its amendments and identified the  provisions that require or prohibit specific actions or activities.

For each provision that  contains a financial-related restriction, such as the limitations on the  purposes for which money appropriated pursuant to the Act\u2019s authorization  can be spent (for example, restricted money may not be used to reimburse  any agency or governmental unit whose employees are Management  Council members or Task Force members for time spent by any such  employee performing Management Council or Task Force duties), we  asked FWS officials and the Chairmen of the Task Force and Management  Council whether they are aware of the legal restrictions and whether they  believe the restrictions have been complied with.", "To find corroborating or contradicting evidence regarding compliance with  the Act\u2019s financial-related provisions, we reviewed Federal Register notices  and existing Interior grants management regulations related to cost-share  requirements to determine if the necessary regulations had been issued.
