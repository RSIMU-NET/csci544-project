Impact Aid can be used for school expenses, such as facilities and teacher salaries. In response to concern about school facility conditions and concern that these conditions can affect student outcomes, GAO was asked to describe (1) the physical condition of schools in districts receiving Impact Aid because of students residing on Indian lands and (2) what is known about how school facilities affect student outcomes. GAO interviewed federal, state, and local officials; analyzed available independent school facility assessment data for three states; visited eight school districts that receive Impact Aid; and analyzed studies examining the relationship between school facilities and student outcomes. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Education provided technical clarifications, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Limited nationwide data are available about the physical condition of public school facilities in school districts that receive Impact Aid funding for students living on Indian lands, although data from three states indicate the conditions range from good to poor. Montana's assessment data showed that the majority (39 of 60) of Indian Impact Aid school districts had facilities in good condition. New Mexico's data showed that all 19 Indian Impact Aid school districts had facilities in either good or fair condition. Washington's data--based on assessments from 9 of 29 Indian Impact Aid school districts--indicated about half (4 of 9) of the Indian Impact Aid school districts had facilities in fair condition and about half (5 of 9) had facilities in poor condition. Facility assessments are not comparable across states. School district officials from 8 districts told GAO their facility conditions are affected by factors such as fiscal capacity, the age of buildings, and remote locations. The research studies GAO reviewed on the relationship between the condition of school facilities and student outcomes often indicated that better facilities were associated with better student outcomes, but there is not necessarily a direct causal relationship and the associations were often weak compared with those of other factors, such as the prevalence of poverty or other student characteristics. A majority of the studies GAO reviewed indicated that better school facilities were associated with better student outcomes--such as higher scores on achievement tests or higher student attendance rates. Most of the studies measured the extent to which better school facilities were associated with better outcomes, after taking into account the impact of other factors. None of the studies examined was able to conclusively determine how much school facility conditions contribute to student outcomes relative to other factors, such as student demographics, and none proved a causal relationship between school facilities and student outcomes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments spend billions of dollars annually on the  construction, renovation, and maintenance of public school facilities.  However, concerns persist about the conditions of some school facilities,  particularly those located near Indian lands. This is because Indian  students often attend schools in rural areas with higher levels of poverty,  and compared with other students often have poorer educational  outcomes, such as lower scores on standardized tests and lower  graduation rates. (In this report, we refer to American Indians and Alaska  Natives as Indians.) Some education experts believe the condition of  public school facilities can affect student outcomes, and numerous studies  have attempted to document possible associations. To maintain and build  public school facilities, school districts generally rely on their local tax  base. Some school districts have limited access to this source of revenue  because a portion of the nearby land is owned by the federal government,  which is exempt from local property taxes. Although funding for school  operations and construction is primarily considered a state and local issue,  the Congress established the Impact Aid Program in 1950 to provide  funding to school districts that are adversely impacted by a lack of local  revenue because of the presence of federal land. Under the Impact Aid  basic support program, the Department of Education (Education) awards  funding to school districts generally on the basis of the number of  federally connected students they serve, such as those students residing  on Indian lands or military bases or who have parents in the military or  who work on federal lands. In 2008, Congress provided $1.1 billion for  basic educational expenses under the Impact Aid program. Education  distributed these funds to about 1,200 school districts, with about half of  the funds going to Impact Aid school districts that have students residing  on Indian lands.", "In response to your request that we describe the condition of facilities in  school districts that receive Impact Aid for students residing on Indian  lands, this report addresses the following questions:  1.  What information is available on the physical condition of facilities in  school districts that receive federal Impact Aid due to students  residing on Indian lands?  2.  What is known about how school facilities affect student outcomes?", "We use the term \u201cIndian Impact Aid\u201d to refer to those school districts that qualify to  receive Impact Aid basic support funding because they meet the minimum eligibility  criteria, namely they have at least 400 students in average daily attendance who are  federally connected, in this case who reside on Indian lands, or such students comprise at  least 3 percent of the total number of students in the district.", "27 percent of all students residing on Indian lands. In addition, we visited   2 school districts in each of the 4 states to obtain school district officials\u2019  perspectives on factors that affect facility maintenance and to observe  their facilities. To determine what is known about how the condition of  school facilities affects student outcomes, we conducted a literature  search for studies that quantitatively analyzed relationships between  school facility variables and a variety of student outcomes, such as student  achievement test scores and student attendance rates. We selected a set of  24 studies\u2014those in peer-reviewed journals and others that our  methodologists regarded as sufficiently rigorous\u2014and systematically  reviewed these studies.

The federal government provided about 8 percent of  funding for public education in school year 2005-2006. The allocation of  federal funds reflects a concern with student outcomes as evidenced by  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, which  has the goal of ensuring that all children have a fair, equal, and significant  opportunity to obtain a high-quality education. The No Child Left Behind  Act of 2001 (NCLBA), which reauthorized and amended ESEA, requires  school districts to make improvements when they fail to make adequate  yearly progress in raising student achievement.", "The federal government has historically provided for the education of  Indian children in part through the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Indian Affairs. Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Education, previously a part of  the Bureau of Indian Affairs, funds 170 schools serving students living on  Indian lands; however, most Indian students now attend public schools. In  some cases, these schools and Indian Impact Aid schools are in the same  communities, and students may transfer from one to the other. Among  some 580,000 Indian children who attend public elementary and secondary  schools in the United States, about one-third of them are enrolled in Indian  Impact Aid school districts.

For  example, they may use these funds for costs associated with teacher  salaries and benefits; transportation; textbooks; and facility maintenance,  repair, renovation, and construction. Some districts also hold a portion of  these funds in reserve for use in future years. To be eligible for basic  support payments for having students living on Indian lands, a school  district must have at least 400 federally connected students, or these  students must comprise at least 3 percent of their total number of  students. The method for determining Indian Impact Aid basic support  payments provides more funding per federally connected student in school  districts where these students are a larger share of the total number of  students and the basic support payments represent a larger share of  current school district expenditures. For Indian Impact Aid school  districts, the average amount of this basic support per student living on  Indian lands was $4,534 in fiscal year 2008. After adjusting for inflation,  this average rose 7 percent from fiscal years 2002 to 2005 and has  subsequently fallen back to about fiscal year 2002 levels.", "The Impact Aid program also includes funding for construction, through  both a formula grant program and a competitive grant program for school  districts with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or high  percentages of children who have a parent on active military duty.  Congress provided about $17.8 million to the formula grant program in  both fiscal years 2006 and 2007, but no funding for fiscal years 2008 or  2009. Formula grants are restricted to Impact Aid school districts with at  least 50 percent of students living on Indian land or at least 50 percent of  students who have a parent on active military duty. The competitive  construction grant program did not receive any funding in fiscal years 2006  or 2007, but received approximately $17 million for fiscal years 2008 and  2009. These grants are for school facility emergencies and modernization  and are restricted to school districts with at least 40 percent of students  living on Indian lands or at least 40 percent of students who have a parent  on active military duty. The competitive grant program to date has  provided funding only for emergency repairs. In July 2009, this program  awarded grants from the fiscal year 2008 appropriation\u2014totaling about  $17 million\u2014to 13 Indian Impact Aid school districts. The American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) appropriated $100  million for construction projects by Impact Aid school districts. The  Recovery Act requires that Education provide nearly $40 million of this  appropriation as formula grants and nearly $60 million as competitive  grants.

Facility managers who routinely assess the  condition of their facilities can identify problems at their earliest stages  and evaluate buildings for future maintenance and repair needs. Facility  assessments take a variety of forms, from staff walking through a facility  and visually inspecting its condition and identifying repair and  maintenance issues to a more comprehensive assessment in which  individual building systems, such as electrical, heating, and air  conditioning, are assessed by a professional inspector and deficiencies are  identified. To compare the relative condition of facilities, assessors often  use a \u201cfacility condition index\u201d (FCI), which is computed as the cost of  repairing or replacing parts of the facility that are identified as deficient  divided by the cost of replacing the entire facility. FCIs are useful in  comparing the relative condition of facilities only if they are calculated  using a consistent methodology. A lower FCI indicates a facility in better  condition. In some cases, assessments of school facilities also include  estimates of the costs for projects that do not specifically address a facility  deficiency. These may include projects for bringing facilities into  compliance with current building codes that the school was not required  to meet when built; providing additional space in schools that are  overcrowded; or providing equipment to meet the school\u2019s needs, such as  a science lab facility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Little Information Is Available on the Condition of School Facilities in Districts That Receive Impact Aid for Students Living on Indian Lands, but Data from Selected States Indicate Conditions Ranged from Good to Poor", "paragraphs": ["Limited independent information is available about the physical condition  of public school facilities that receive Impact Aid funding for students  living on Indian lands.

According to federal officials with whom we  spoke:    Education collects information on the condition of Indian Impact Aid  schools from surveys it receives from school districts that are awarded  construction formula grants. School districts that received construction  payments in the prior year are required to complete a brief survey as part  of the Impact Aid application in which they rank the overall condition of  their school facilities on a scale of 1 (excellent) to 6 (replace).

The other  states with large numbers of Indian Impact Aid school districts (8 of 11)  had no independent information about the physical condition of the school  facilities in their school districts (see table 1.) For example, Alaska  requires districts to assess their own facilities and submit condition  assessment reports to apply for state maintenance and construction  grants. However, the data Alaska collects about school condition are not  independently verified by the state. Arizona began independently assessing  school facilities in 2004 as part of its public school assessment program to  ensure that schools meet state minimum condition standards. Arizona has  collected information on variables related to facilities, including the  number, type, and size of buildings and whether the school site,  equipment, and building systems meet the state\u2019s adequacy standards.

This  occurred in 2008 when Montana assessed school facilities in its 422 public  school districts using a facility condition assessment approach that  involved inspecting various school building components, identifying the  observable deficiencies, and estimating the costs to repair the deficiencies  and replace the entire facility. Montana inspected 11 building systems for  each facility, including the HVAC system (heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning); electrical system; plumbing system; foundations; exterior  sidings; floor systems; roof systems; interior finishes (walls, floors, and  windows); special fixtures (cabinets, chalkboards, and fixed seating);  conveying systems (elevators); and fire and building code systems (fire  detection and suppression, and building accessibility). Montana\u2019s  inspections resulted in an FCI value for each school district based on  assessments of all of the facilities in the school district. Montana\u2019s FCI  used a scale of 0 to 100 percent and the higher the percentage, the closer  the cost of the repairs were to the cost of a new facility. Montana  considers school facilities with FCIs from 0 to 9 percent to be in good  condition, FCIs from 10 to 19 percent to be in fair condition, and FCIs of   20 percent and greater to be in poor condition. Facilities with FCIs greater  than 50 percent are considered to be experiencing such levels of fatigue  that the merits of reinvestment in the existing structure should be  carefully considered.", "New Mexico created a facility assessment program that required it to  evaluate the capital needs of every school facility in the state, rank all   789 public schools in terms of needed capital improvements, and prioritize  funding on an annual basis for those public school facilities most in need  of repair. This program enables it to optimize the allocation of limited  resources. In 2003, New Mexico assessed all K-12 public school facilities  and developed the New Mexico condition index (NMCI) that measures  both the physical condition and the adequacy of a school facility against  New Mexico\u2019s adequacy standards. Facility assessments include  evaluations of eight building systems, including site utilities; structural  systems (foundations, exterior walls, doors, and roof); interior systems  (walls, ceilings, and floors); mechanical and plumbing systems, electrical  systems; building and fire code systems (accessibility and fire detection  suppression); equipment (gym equipment and technology); and special  fixtures (cabinets and chalk boards). The NMCI incorporates weighting  factors for specific deficiencies, such as conditions that present health or  safety threats, inadequate space, and inadequate equipment. In addition,  New Mexico\u2019s assessment process includes a life-cycle analysis that takes  into consideration whether a building system is within or beyond its  recommended life. New Mexico updates the facility condition data when it  completes new assessments of facilities, receives new data from school  construction applications, or receives information from the life-cycle  analysis. Each year, New Mexico uses the NMCI to rank the schools from  the highest score (indicating those most in need of repair or replacement)  to the lowest score and typically provides funding for the 100 schools most  in need of capital improvement.", "Washington collects building condition evaluations from school districts  that apply for a study and survey grant. This state program provides school  districts with funds to complete a long-range planning document, which is  a prerequisite for state school construction assistance and includes an  independent evaluation of school facilities. Washington provided the  evaluation information to us for the 118 school districts that have  submitted building evaluations since 2003, including 9 evaluations from  Indian Impact Aid school districts and 109 from other school districts,  from a total of 295 school districts statewide. School districts may apply  for a study and survey grant once every 6 years. As a part of the process to  complete the building condition evaluation form, the building inspector  scores the condition of various components of a building\u2019s exterior system  (foundation, wall, and roof); interior system (floor, wall, and ceiling);  mechanical system (electrical, plumbing, and HVAC); and safety and  building code system (fire alarm and detection, and emergency lighting).  Each building component is awarded points based on its assessed  condition. For example, if the inspector determines the exterior walls of  the facility to be in good condition, a total of 8 points can be awarded  compared with a total of 2 points that can be awarded if the exterior doors  and windows are determined to be in good condition. The component  scores are summed to create the buildings\u2019 evaluation score, which can  range from 0 to 100 points. The building evaluation scores can provide  relative information about the condition of different facilities, but they  differ from FCI calculations because they do not include an estimate of the  repair and replacement costs. According to state officials, the building  evaluation scores are used in the process for prioritizing school districts  for funding. The scores are not used to categorize school districts in terms  of the condition of their facilities. However, the evaluations of several  school districts in Washington conducted by one consultant included a  scoring table that associated different building scores to different levels of  condition. Based on this table, a score of 90 to 100 indicates good  condition, a score of 60 to 89 indicates fair condition, a score of 30 to   59 indicates poor condition, and a score of 0 to 29 indicates unsatisfactory  condition.", "Montana, New Mexico, and Washington each measure facility condition  differently, and, as a result, we are not able to make comparisons about  school condition among the states.

Officials in one New Mexico school district said that  they were able to secure a limited level of bonding on the basis of  expected Impact Aid funds. Most officials said that they are unable to  issue bonds because so few property owners pay taxes, which is a source  of revenue to repay the bonds. Some officials said they accumulate funds  over time for a reserve to pay for emergency repairs and larger  maintenance and major capital improvement projects. These officials said  that Impact Aid is critical to their ability to accumulate such funds.  According to officials in one Arizona school district, Impact Aid funds  made it possible for the district to accumulate several million dollars that  it plans to spend in 2010 on building improvements (e.g., upgrading  windows) and digging a water well. At one school district in Montana,  officials said that they maintain an emergency fund because without such  a reserve, a major problem with a facility could cause a school to be  closed. Additionally, several school district officials in Arizona and New  Mexico said that they often need to replace roofs, but generally have to  partially repair or patch them until sufficient funds are accumulated for a  replacement.", "District officials told us that older schools, like any older buildings, are  often expensive to maintain because they are less efficient and other  problems are more likely to surface once a repair is started. At both school  districts we visited in Montana, officials said that the districts\u2019 schools are  quite old, with sections in one district dating back to 1919 and the other  dating back to 1930.

This year, officials expect to replace the elementary  school boiler\u2014originally installed in 1942 (see fig. 3). According to district  officials, the older boilers are inefficient and make it difficult to maintain a  comfortable building temperature. Several school district officials in  Arizona, Montana, and Washington also said that their older buildings have  single pane windows, which make it difficult to maintain an adequate  classroom temperature compared with more efficient double pane  windows. Officials also said that the older buildings generally do not meet  and are not required to meet the current building codes, and attempts to  retrofit buildings to make them more accessible are often difficult and  expensive.", "A school\u2019s remote location was also cited as a contributing factor to  facility conditions. Several of the school districts we visited were located  in remote areas, and one district spanned about 3,000 square miles. School  district officials in New Mexico and Arizona said that because of their  remote locations, quality services may be difficult to obtain and may cost  more. School officials in these states said higher costs are often due to a  lack of commercial builders in rural areas. For example, at one remote  school district we visited in New Mexico, officials said the area lacks  maintenance services for HVAC and quality roofing contractors. Officials  said the HVAC system needs constant repairs, and repair services take  longer and cost more when contractors must travel from urban to rural  areas. According to officials from one New Mexico district, to minimize  the number of trips and effectively respond to building repairs among  schools that span 60 miles, maintenance personnel are required to check  the online maintenance system at the school for any work orders that can  be completed while maintenance personnel are on location. State officials  in New Mexico are also trying to understand whether relative remoteness  was a factor in building two different schools for about 100 students that  cost $3.5 million in one remote area of the state and $8 million in another  remote area. The state has appointed a task force to address concerns that  some remote school districts are not receiving the same quality of services  as others from electricians, carpenters, and other contractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Research Suggests That Better School Facilities Are Associated with Better Student Outcomes, and School District Officials Agreed, but There Is Little Evidence of a Causal Relationship", "paragraphs": ["The research studies we reviewed on the relationship between the  condition of school facilities and student outcomes often showed that  better facilities were associated with better student outcomes; however,  there is not necessarily a direct causal relationship, and the associations  were often weak compared with their associations with other factors.  Also, some researchers suggest that specific characteristics of facilities,  such as lighting, may be directly associated with student outcomes. Other  characteristics of facilities, such as the general condition of the buildings,  may be indirectly associated with student outcomes through their effects  on other factors. We identified and reviewed 24 studies that analyzed the  relationship between facility conditions and student outcomes. A majority  of these studies indicated that better school facilities were associated with  better student outcomes\u2014such as higher scores on achievement tests or  higher student attendance rates. Most of the studies measured the extent  to which better school facilities were associated with better outcomes  after taking into account the impact of other factors that can affect student  outcomes, such as poverty and other demographic characteristics.", "However, none of these studies proves that better facilities caused better  student outcomes. About one-half of the studies we reviewed examined  broad measures, such as the general condition of the school buildings  based on evaluations by facilities specialists or by teachers, or the  suitability of school buildings\u2014the extent to which district officials rated  the facilities as being suitable for the grades being served. Based on these  studies, it is unclear to what extent better facility conditions contribute to  better student outcomes, or whether the associations identified may exist  because other factors, such as the level of community commitment to  education, contribute to both better facilities and better student outcomes,  and none proved a causal relationship. The other studies focused on  specific aspects of facilities, such as heating, air conditioning, ventilation,  or lighting. None of the studies we examined was able to conclusively  determine how much school facility conditions contribute to student  outcomes relative to other factors, such as the educational achievement of  students\u2019 parents or teachers\u2019 qualifications."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Studies of Broad School Facilities Measures", "paragraphs": ["Of the studies that focused on broad measures, such as measures of  physical conditions or the suitability of school facilities, about one-half   (7 of 13) found that schools with better facilities generally had better  student outcomes. These included cases in which researchers noted  possible direct connections between better facilities and student outcomes  and cases in which they noted indirect connections, with better facilities  contributing to conditions that in turn contribute to better student  outcomes. Some studies indicated associations between facilities and  student outcomes with some but not all measures of student outcomes.  One of the studies examining all elementary and secondary schools in the  District of Columbia estimated that students attending schools in fair  condition had average achievement test scores 5.45 points higher on a 0 to  100 point scale than those attending schools in poor condition. This was  the case after taking into account other factors that may have an influence  on student achievement, such as race and income. Similarly, a study in the  Los Angeles Unified School District found that in schools with facilities  that met health and safety compliance requirements, the schools\u2019 average  student California Academic Performance Index scores were likely to be  higher. Compared with schools in the lowest compliance category,  schools in the highest compliance category had an estimated average  score that was 36 points higher on the composite index, with scores  ranging from 200 to 1,000. This was the result after taking into account  factors, such as the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced  price school lunch and the percentage of students who were black or  Hispanic. This study found that although the school facilities that were in  better condition were associated with better student achievement, some of  the other important factors, such as poverty, were more strongly  associated with achievement. For example, holding all else constant,  schools with the lowest percentage of students who were eligible for free  or reduced price lunch were expected to have average achievement scores  113 points higher on the 200 to 1,000 point scale than schools in which all  students were eligible for free or reduced price lunch\u2014more than three  times the estimated difference between school facilities in the worst and  the best compliance categories.", "One study used a potentially more rigorous methodology by comparing  achievement test scores at schools before and after renovation of 3 of the  district\u2019s 21 elementary schools. The study showed that math, but not  reading test scores, improved as the proportion of students in recently  renovated schools increased. The researcher concluded that a larger  sample would be needed to provide better evidence of a connection  between school facilities and student achievement.", "Another study found no association between better school facilities in  Wyoming and student achievement. The study found that before and after  taking into account the income status of students\u2019 families, there was no  statistically significant association between schools in better condition  and schools with higher average achievement. Similarly, no statistically  significant association was found between student achievement and the  suitability of the school facilities.", "School district officials at all of the eight Indian Impact Aid school districts  we visited said that in their experience, better school facilities are  associated with better student outcomes, though they also often cited  other factors that some believed had more influence, such as whether  students\u2019 families placed a high value on education. Several district  officials noted that many of their students are from low-income families  that may not place an emphasis on education. Although officials in several  districts we visited said their students are affected by the condition of  school facilities just as other students are affected, other officials  remarked that their students, who often come from homes in poor  condition, may be especially affected by a school\u2019s good condition because  it provides a more comfortable environment.", "Some studies indicate that better facilities can contribute to student  outcomes indirectly\u2014through their effects on other factors\u2014and school  officials with whom we spoke believed this was true in their districts. For  example, a study of Virginia middle schools indicated that although better  student achievement was associated with the quality of school facilities,  better student achievement was more highly associated with a variable  identified as \u201cschool climate,\u201d which measures attitudes in the school  community that support learning, such as students\u2019 respect for others who  get good grades and teachers\u2019 commitment to helping students. The  authors concluded that rather than having a direct effect on student  achievement, better school facilities can indirectly influence student  achievement by contributing to a good school climate for learning. School  officials we interviewed noted that good facilities contribute to students\u2019  pride in their school. One official noted that good school facilities send a  message to students that the community values education, which can  result in better student outcomes. Similarly, a study of New York City  elementary schools found that better school building conditions were  associated with better student attendance rates, and that these in turn  were associated with better English and math achievement.", "Several school officials also noted the importance of good school facilities  for attracting and retaining good teachers who in turn can improve student  achievement. Research points to teacher quality as an important school- level factor that influences student learning. The association between  good school facilities and teacher retention was the focus of one study  that identified several factors associated with teachers\u2019 plans to remain  another year in their current school, including better school facility  conditions. This study found an association between the school facility  and teacher retention even after taking into account several other factors,  including the teachers\u2019 ages, their tenure at the school, and their  satisfaction with pay and the community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies of Specific Characteristics of School Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Studies we reviewed that focused on the effect of specific characteristics  of the school facility found that some factors, such as lighting, are directly  associated with better outcomes. Rather than simply examining whether  students have enough light to be able to see classroom materials, some  studies have examined the extent to which classrooms provide daylight or  light that simulates daylight. For example, a study of 24 elementary  schools in Georgia found that third-grade students in classrooms with  more daylight had higher average achievement test scores after taking into  account the free or reduced price lunch variable and other aspects of the  school facility design. Including daylight in the analysis explained an  additional 2.5 percent of the variation in average test scores among the  schools. Similarly, a study of 102 schools in California, Colorado, and  Washington found that students in the classrooms with the most daylight  increased their test scores overall about 21 percent more than those  students in rooms with the least amount of daylight after taking into  account additional information, including teacher characteristics and  grade levels. A follow-up study taking into account additional information,  including teacher characteristics and grade levels confirmed these  findings, showing that students in the classrooms with the most daylight  increased their test scores overall about 21 percent. Another study found  that classrooms with full-spectrum fluorescent light bulbs, which simulate  daylight, were associated with faster academic progress compared with  classrooms using high-pressure sodium vapor bulbs, which do not  simulate daylight as well. Average test scores in classrooms with full- spectrum bulbs indicated that students increased their level of academic  achievement by about 2 grade levels over the 2-year study period,  compared with 1.6 years for students in classrooms with the high-pressure  sodium vapor bulbs.", "Few of the school administrators with whom we spoke cited lighting as a  factor related to student outcomes, although we found that the extent to  which students were exposed to natural light varied in the schools we  visited. While many schools had classrooms with windows that let in light,  the level of natural light varied considerably. One school had installed  dividing walls to create smaller classrooms out of large spaces, and some  of the resulting classrooms had no natural light. In at least one school we  visited in Washington, renovations included upgrading lighting to provide  full-spectrum light and reduce energy use.", "Studies examining the quality of air in classrooms found associations  between better air quality and better health or lower absenteeism. A study  of schools in Finland found that in an elementary school with moisture or  mold problems, there was a higher occurrence of respiratory infections,  repeated wheezing and prolonged coughing, and emergency room visits  than in other schools. Another study of schools in Finland had similar  results and showed that although background concentrations of fungi in  wooden buildings were significantly higher than in concrete or brick  buildings, moisture damage increased fungal concentrations significantly  in the concrete or brick buildings, but not in wooden school buildings.  Moisture damage increased the likelihood that students would have  respiratory symptoms in schools constructed of concrete or bricks.  Another Swedish study found that two day-care centers that installed  electrostatic air cleaning systems reduced the concentrations of fine  particles in the air, and absenteeism fell by 55 percent at the larger center  and by a smaller proportion at the smaller center. Absenteeism almost  returned to the original level after the system at the larger center was  turned off. Another study found that new ventilation systems in Swedish  schools reduced the prevalence of asthmatic symptoms in classrooms  compared with those without the new systems. Studies in Danish  elementary school classrooms found that ventilation systems that drew in  larger volumes of outdoor air were associated on average with an 8  percent increase in the speed at which students worked. Air quality was a  concern in two of the districts we visited, such as at a middle school we  visited in Washington where the main hallway had no ventilation or air  circulation and the stale air had a noticeable odor. School administrators  cited the poor air quality as a concern they felt was a high priority to  address. Another school in the same district faced complaints about air  quality, and administrators speculated that the air quality was adversely  affected by old carpeting.", "One study considered the effects of temperature control in elementary  schools in Denmark and found an association between comfortable  temperatures and student performance. The study found that reducing  classroom temperatures from 77 degrees Fahrenheit was associated with  improved speed in math and language tests. The study indicated that a 1.8  degree Fahrenheit drop in temperature was associated with about a 4  percent increase in the speed at which students worked. The number of  errors students made decreased when performing some tasks, but not  others. School officials in several districts we visited cited difficulties in  maintaining comfortable temperatures in classrooms and concurred that  when students are too cold or too warm, it is difficult for them to  concentrate on their studies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the report to the Department of Education for  review and comment.

We conducted a literature search to identify  research studies and analyzed selected studies. We also visited school  districts in four states\u2014Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, and Washington.", "To determine what information is available about the physical condition of  school facilities in Indian Impact Aid school districts, we contacted  officials from Education\u2019s Impact Aid Office, NCES, and Indian Impact Aid  associations for independent national data on school condition. We  decided to accept only assessment data that were prepared by an  independent party with no apparent vested interest in the results of the  assessment. We determined that Education collects surveys about school  condition from school districts that received an Impact Aid construction  formula grant, but we determined that the survey data were of limited use  because they were not based on independent assessments and did not  cover all Indian Impact Aid schools. We determined that although NCES  published the results of its study of a nationally representative sample of  school districts in which it asked school principals about the condition of  their schools, we could not use these data because we are not able to  obtain statistically meaningful responses for Indian Impact Aid schools  due to sample size, and NCES did not independently verify the survey  responses that were provided by school principals. We found that national  associations like the National Indian Impacted Schools Association and  the National Council for Impacted Schools do not document the condition  of school facilities in Indian Impact Aid school districts.", "Because we could not identify a source for nationwide data, we sought  state-level data. Education provided us with the list of states with school  districts that received fiscal year 2008 Impact Aid funds for students living  on Indian lands. From this list of 27 states, we identified 11 states with a  large number of Indian Impact Aid districts (at least 15 districts) and  contacted their state education officials to determine whether they had  independent assessment data about the physical condition of public  school facilities. We determined that four states\u2014Arizona, Montana, New  Mexico, and Washington\u2014had assessment data for some or all of their  public schools.", "We obtained and analyzed these data from the four states, which did not  maintain the data in similar fashions. Montana and its contractor provided  us with a copy of its complete school building and system-level analyses of  repair and replacement costs, which we used to generate our school  district-level analysis. New Mexico provided us with school district-level  data of building system repair and replacement costs. Arizona collected  only deficiency information at the school building-level, which we used to  create our district-level information for site selection. Washington  maintained hard copies of the building-level evaluation reports, which we  keypunched to create raw data for district-level files. On the basis of our  analysis, we were able to describe the condition of schools in Indian  Impact Aid districts in three of the four states. We determined that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the analysis used in this report. We were  not able to use Arizona\u2019s data because, although it describes a variety of  information, including the number, type, and size of buildings and whether  the school site and building systems meet the state\u2019s adequacy standards,  the data do not determine whether the school facilities are in good, fair, or  poor condition. For the other three states, we combined the facilities data  with Education\u2019s Common Core of Data to describe the characteristics of  the school districts, which we used for selecting school districts for site  visits.", "Because each state\u2019s assessment program is unique, it does not allow for  comparisons among states. For example, while both Montana and New  Mexico create a facility condition index that is based on the ratio of  renewal cost to replacement cost, New Mexico weights deficiencies in a  manner consistent with its own state priorities, (e.g., classroom space);  whereas, Montana does not rely on any explicit weighting scheme. In  addition, each state bundled its building system groups differently,  consistent with state priorities with the respective indexes for each bundle  being incorporated into the calculation of the overall facility condition  index. In contrast, the assessment program in Washington does not  calculate a facility condition index. Only districts seeking funds for  planning grants or construction participate in the Washington assessment  program, unlike in Montana and New Mexico where all school districts  were assessed. Because of these differences, facility condition measures  are not strictly comparable across states. While comparison among states  would not be valid to evaluate the condition of schools in Indian Impact  Aid districts, the condition of school facilities can safely be compared  within each state. This comparison allows for an assessment of the quality  of school condition in Indian Impact Aid districts relative to that of other  districts in the same state.", "In Washington, only districts applying for a study and survey grant submit  documentation of the condition of their school facilities. The districts that  do participate in the study and survey grant program are required to  provide matching funds, which in turn may indicate the ability to obtain  school board or community approval to levy a bond. Of 29 Indian Impact  Aid school districts, 9 have submitted building evaluation reports since  2003. Similarly, 109 of 266 other school districts statewide have completed  and submitted an evaluation report for their district. Because less than  one-half of the districts submitted evaluation data and the districts that did  are self-selected, it is not known whether the assessed districts differ  systematically from the nonassessed group. In addition, whether and how  systematic differences between the assessed and nonassessed groups  occur could be different for Indian Impact Aid districts and other districts  in Washington. Differences in facility condition between Indian Impact Aid  districts and other districts in Washington could be attributable to these  underlying selection-related differences and not to any real differences  between the two populations of school districts in Washington.", "We selected two school districts in each of the four states to visit to obtain  district officials\u2019 perspectives on factors that affect facility maintenance  and to observe their facilities. We selected districts that provided variety  on the basis of selection criteria, such as information about the relative  condition of the school districts\u2019 facilities, the proportion of the school  district\u2019s revenue composed of Impact Aid, proportion of students who are  Indians, and number of students enrolled. (See table 2.)", "To determine what is known about how school facilities affect student  outcomes, we conducted a search for research studies that addressed this  topic. We identified studies dating back to 1980 and selected those that  were either from peer-reviewed journal articles or were methodologically  rigorous studies from (or sponsored by) other sources, such as  government institutions. Two GAO staffers, one analyst from the audit  team and one methodologist from the research group, systematically  reviewed each of the studies selected, evaluating the design, measurement  strategies, and methodological integrity and entering this information into  a database. From more than 100 studies that we initially selected, 24 were  selected to be included in our review. We excluded studies because, for  example, they did not provide sufficient detail on the analytical approach  or failed to control for other plausible explanations for differences. The  selected studies were sufficiently rigorous and included tests of  hypotheses; measures of association; and multivariate techniques, such as  ordinary least squares regression (see table 3).", "In addition to these 24 studies, we reviewed 4 additional studies that  focused on the relationship between facility condition and teacher  outcomes rather than student outcomes.

Many of the studies focus on comparisons of schools without information  about the outcomes in schools before and after changes in school  facilities. This makes it difficult to isolate the effects of improvements in  school facilities. Some studies used small samples or had low response  rates to surveys or had missing data for many schools in the original  sample. Several studies focused on schools in other countries and the  extent to which their results are applicable to schools in the United States  is uncertain. In at least one case, the research was funded in part by a  group\u2014such as a building association\u2014that may have had an interest in  the results.", "We conducted our work from September 2008 to October 2009 in  accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that  are relevant to our objectives.
