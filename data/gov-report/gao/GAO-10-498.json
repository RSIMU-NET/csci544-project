While the composition of Treasury's debt portfolio changed in response to this increase, Treasury has taken a number of steps in the past year to return the composition of the debt portfolio to pre-market crisis structure. One action Treasury has undertaken has been to reduce its reliance on cash management bills (CMB). While CMBs provided Treasury with needed borrowing flexibility immediately following the financial market crisis in 2008, Treasury paid a premium for its sustained use of CMBs in 2008 and 2009. In recent months, Treasury also has begun to stabilize shorter-term bill issuance and increase issuance of longer-term coupons. Given the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook, Treasury will continue to be presented with the challenge of raising significant amounts of cash at the lowest costs over time. This makes evaluating the demand for Treasury securities increasingly important. Sufficient information from market participants on their demand for Treasury securities, including the type of information that GAO received from its survey of the largest domestic holders of Treasury securities, will be critical as Treasury moves forward to meet these challenges. In GAO's survey, investors reported increased demand for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and suggested ways for Treasury to further improve TIPS liquidity and thereby lower borrowing costs. Treasury receives input from market participants through a variety of formal and informal channels, but overall satisfaction with these communication channels varies by type of market participant. Market participants suggested to GAO a number of changes including increasing investor diversification on the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) and regular collection of information from end-investors. Primary dealers, who are satisfied with their communication, raised concerns about the recent increase in direct bidding and its effect on Treasury auctions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, GAO is  required to monitor the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s  (Treasury) implementation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)  and, under subsection 116, submit special reports as warranted from  oversight findings. This report examines new debt management challenges  that Treasury faces and the efforts that Treasury has undertaken to  borrow more than $3.082 trillion over the 2-year period beginning  December 2007. Treasury\u2019s borrowing financed regular government needs,  as well as federal government actions related to both the financial-market  crisis and the recession, including TARP investments in financial  institutions, housing support through purchases of mortgage-backed  securities, support of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System\u2019s (Federal Reserve) actions taken to stabilize financial markets,  and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).  The current rapid and substantial increase in federal debt since 2008 takes  place in the context of the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook that will  present Treasury with continued financing challenges long after the return  of financial-market stability and economic growth.", "In this report, we describe Treasury\u2019s borrowing actions since the start of  the crisis and the challenges of managing its growing debt portfolio in the  context of the medium- and long-term fiscal outlook by answering the  following questions: (1) What actions did Treasury take between  December 2007 and December 2009 to borrow funds for TARP-related  disbursements, the Supplementary Financing Account Program (SFP), the  Recovery Act, and other cash needs, and (2) What changes should  Treasury make, if any, to better gauge end-investor demand and increase  auction participation?", "To identify the actions that Treasury has taken to borrow funds for TARP- related disbursements and other cash needs, we analyzed the scale, timing,  term-to-maturity, and composition of Treasury\u2019s borrowing between  December 2007 and December 2009, using data and information obtained  from Treasury and the Federal Reserve. We also interviewed market  experts, primary dealers and end-investors of Treasury securities, and  Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) staff and  officials on Treasury debt management challenges. To describe the cost of  the use of cash management bills (CMB) during this time period, we  estimated the differential between CMB yields and the yields on  outstanding Treasury bills of similar maturity at the time of auction using  data from Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Public Debt and the Wall Street  Journal. We also replicated the analysis estimating the differential  between CMB yields and the yields on Treasury auctions that most closely  matched the CMB auction in terms of issue date and maturity using data  from Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Public Debt. See appendix I for a detailed  description of the methodologies that we used to estimate the cost to  Treasury of the use of CMBs.", "In order to evaluate what changes Treasury should make, if any, to better  gauge end-investor demand and increase auction participation, we  analyzed Treasury\u2019s communication with investors and identified possible  actions. In June 2009, we conducted 12 structured interviews with the two  largest holders of Treasury securities in each of the following sectors:  mutual funds; commercial banks; life insurance companies; property  casualty insurance companies; state and local government retirement  funds; and private pension funds. In addition, in August 2009 we  conducted a Web-based survey that was sent to 66 of the largest domestic  holders of Treasury securities in each of these sectors except private  pension funds. The survey addressed topics similar to those covered in  our structured interviews, including: Treasury auctions and holdings,  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), risk exposure, and  Treasury\u2019s information sources. On October 15, 2009, we briefed Treasury  on the findings from the survey, which are discussed and expanded upon  in this report. See appendix II for our detailed survey methodology and  appendix III for a copy of the survey. Because the sample of holders of  Treasury securities was not drawn randomly, the survey is not  generalizable to the broader population of organizations in the sectors we  included in the survey.", "To assess the reliability of data used in this study, including publicly  available data from Treasury and the Federal Reserve, we examined the  data to look for outliers and anomalies and addressed such issues as  appropriate. We chose data that are commonly used by Treasury,  researchers, and other market analysts to examine Treasury markets and  auction performance. Where possible and appropriate, we corroborated  the results of our data analysis with other sources, such as analyses done  by other market experts or testimonial evidence. On the basis of our  assessment we believe the data are reliable for the purpose of this review.  We conducted our review from December 2008 to May 2010 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Government expenditures include regular  withdrawals for programs such as Medicare and Social Security as well as  extraordinary withdrawals for programs such as TARP. Treasury also  makes interest and principal payments for outstanding debt and debt that  is maturing on a continual basis. Treasury\u2019s primary debt management  goal is to finance the government\u2019s borrowing needs at the lowest cost  over time, subject to a statutory limit. To meet this objective, Treasury  issues debt through auctions across a wide range of securities mainly in a  \u201cregular and predictable\u201d pattern based on a preannounced auction  schedule, which it releases on a quarterly basis. Treasury does not \u201ctime  the market\u201d\u2014or take advantage of low interest rates\u2014when it issues  securities. Instead, Treasury is able to lower its borrowing costs by relying  on regularly scheduled auctions because investors and dealers value  transparency, stability, and certainty of large liquid supply.", "Market participants often characterize Treasury securities as the premium  risk-free asset. Investors, traders, banks, and foreign central banks actively  use them for hedging, liquidity, capital requirements, and reserve  purposes. Treasury securities are also a popular investment for end- investors seeking liquidity and low risk. Treasury\u2019s \u201cregular and  predictable\u201d auctions are for nominal marketable securities that range in  maturity from 4 weeks to 30 years and for TIPS that are issued with 5-, 10-,  and 30-year maturities. TIPS offer a variety of benefits to Treasury, and  inflation protection to investors, who are willing to pay a premium for this  protection in the form of an interest rate on TIPS that may be lower than a  comparable nominal issuance over the life of the instrument.", "Treasury responds to increases in borrowing needs in a traditional manner  by: (1) increasing the issuance size of existing securities; (2) increasing the  frequency of issuances; and (3) introducing new securities to its auction  calendar as necessary. Treasury announces upcoming changes during  quarterly refundings so that the market is not surprised. In some instances,  Treasury supplements its \u201cregular and predictable\u201d auction schedule with  flexible securities called cash management bills (CMB). Because of the  nature of CMBs, Treasury does not publish information about CMBs on its  quarterly auction schedule as it does for other securities. Instead, Treasury  announces CMB auctions anywhere from 1 to 4 days ahead of the auction.  Treasury also indicates whether it might issue CMBs over the upcoming  quarter in quarterly refunding statements. The term to maturity\u2014or length  of time the CMB is outstanding\u2014varies according to Treasury\u2019s cash  needs. Treasury generally uses CMBs to finance intramonth funding gaps  due to timing differences of large cash inflows and outflows. Treasury  also uses CMBs to meet sudden and unexpected borrowing needs, such as  those that arose from the government\u2019s responses to the financial market  crisis and economic downturn in 2008 and 2009.", "The outstanding mix of Treasury securities can have a significant influence  on the federal government\u2019s interest payments. Longer-term nominal  securities typically carry higher interest rates (which translate to  increased cost to the government), primarily due to investor concerns  about the uncertainty of future inflation. However, longer-term securities  offer the government the certainty of fixed interest payments over a longer  period and reduce the amount of debt that Treasury needs to refinance in  the short term. In contrast, shorter-term securities generally carry lower  interest rates but add uncertainty to the government\u2019s interest costs and  require Treasury to conduct more frequent auctions to refinance maturing  debt, which also poses rollover risk. Among Treasury\u2019s short-term  securities, those that are issued on a \u201cregular and predictable\u201d schedule  generally carry the lowest interest rates.", "Two groups, (1) the primary dealers and (2) the Treasury Borrowing  Advisory Committee (TBAC) of the Securities Industry and Financial  Markets Association (SIFMA) provide regular input to Treasury debt  management decisions.

They are also required by the FRBNY to participate in all Treasury  auctions. On a quarterly basis, Treasury surveys the primary dealers and  also meets with half of them in person.

During the November 2009 TBAC  press conference, Treasury officials announced that the transition has  begun with a shift of bill issuances to nominal note and bond issuance and  TIPS issuance. This shift will allow Treasury to retain flexibility in meeting  uncertain financing needs in the future. Flexibility is retained by  increasing the borrowing capacity that Treasury has available for shorter- term securities, which are used when unexpected financing needs arise.  During the February 2010 TBAC press conference Treasury indicated a  shift in the transition with the announcement that nominal note and bond  issuance will stabilize in the next year and perhaps even decrease. In  February, Treasury stated that nominal auctions sizes were at levels that  give Treasury the flexibility to address a broad range of potential financing  scenarios. Market participants we spoke with anticipated the stabilization  of note and bond issuance, but cautioned that any decrease in the amount  of nominal note and bond issuance would depend on tax receipts.", "Treasury has said that it expects the average term to maturity of  outstanding marketable debt to approach the historical average of 5 years  (or 60 months) by the end of fiscal year 2010 and could perhaps exceed it  in the next 3-5 years. Treasury officials have indicated the changes they  are making to the overall debt portfolio will bring short-term bill levels  closer to historical averages while stabilizing or perhaps even decreasing  nominal note and bond issuance. Treasury has emphasized the importance  of making these changes in a gradual, transparent, and incremental  manner. Some market participants have expressed concern about a  reduction in bill supply. Investors use bills to invest their funds  temporarily in a safe and highly liquid asset. Bills are also used by  institutional investors that are required to buy financial assets maturing in  a year or less.

Treasury\u2019s use of CMBs was substantial and  continued well after the beginning of the financial-market crisis. The  sustained increase was due in part to the Supplementary Financing  Program (SFP), a temporary program created in September 2008 to  provide cash for use in Federal Reserve initiatives intended to address  heightened liquidity pressures in the financial markets.", "In 2008 and 2009, Treasury\u2019s gross issuance of CMBs was $1.432 trillion  and $1.142 trillion respectively (of which $785 billion and $835 billion were  issued for the SFP in 2008 and 2009). This compares to average issuance of  about $254 billion annually from 2005 to 2007. (See fig. 2.) To issue $1.432  trillion worth of CMBs in 2008, Treasury held 47 auctions (of which 21  were issued for the SFP), compared to an average of 18 auctions annually  from 2005 to 2007.", "CMBs that were issued in 2008 and 2009 also departed from historical  norms in that their terms to maturity increased significantly. Prior to 2008,  Treasury typically used CMBs to fund intramonth funding gaps and, in  certain instances, to provide Treasury borrowing flexibility when it was  approaching the debt limit. Between 2002 and 2007, CMBs typically had a  term to maturity of less than 2 weeks. During 2005, 2006, and 2007, the  average term to maturity of CMBs was 10 days, 9 days, and 10 days  respectively. In contrast, in 2009, the average term to maturity of CMBs  was 109 days or 15.6 weeks. Removing those CMBs that were used for the  SFP (debt issued for the SFP does not pay for government expenditures),  the average term to maturity of the remaining CMBs was 99 days in 2008  and 198 days in 2009. During its February 2008 quarterly refunding  process, Treasury announced its plans to issue longer-dated CMBs. This  was a change to Treasury\u2019s recent practice of not issuing CMBs with  maturities greater than 21 days and according to Treasury was necessary  in order to spread the extraordinary financing needs away from the front  end of the bill market. Treasury stated that longer-dated maturities would  be issued because of seasonal fluctuations in cash balances, volatility  associated with the timing of tax refunds, and the increased use of  electronic payments versus check payments. On February 13, 2008,  Treasury auctioned a 63-day CMB, which had a longer maturity than any  other CMB issued in the previous 3 fiscal years. Treasury issued additional  CMBs with terms to maturity of greater than 300 days during both fiscal  years 2008 and 2009. Longer-dated CMBs were also, in many instances,  reopenings of existing Treasury bills. Twenty of the 37 non-SFP CMBs  issued in 2008 and 2009 were reopenings of outstanding Treasury bills.  Treasury officials told us that they consulted with market participants and  decided that longer-dated CMBs, for example 9-month bills, were a  prudent, short-term mechanism to raise cash and approximately the length  of time that it would take for coupon issuance to \u201ccatch up\u201d and shoulder  a bigger share of Treasury\u2019s financing needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Paid a Premium for the Sustained Use of CMBs in 2008 and 2009", "paragraphs": ["While CMBs provided Treasury with needed borrowing flexibility  immediately following the start of the financial market crisis in 2008,  Treasury paid a premium for its sustained use of CMBs in 2008 and 2009.  We reported in 2006 that Treasury had paid a premium for its use of CMBs  during the period of 1996 to 2005. During that period, Treasury paid a  higher yield on most CMBs than outstanding Treasury bills of a similar  maturity paid in the secondary market. In the low-interest-rate  environment during 2008 and 2009, all debt, but particularly short-term  debt, was relatively inexpensive for Treasury; however, since the dollar  amount of CMBs issued in 2008 was 5.6 times greater than the amount  issued in 2007, even a small premium could be costly.", "Our analysis shows that of the 37 CMBs not issued for the SFP in 2008 and  2009, most had a higher yield when compared with outstanding Treasury  bills of a similar maturity in the secondary market. The difference between  these CMB yields and similar maturing outstanding bills\u2014known as the  yield differential\u2014was positive for the second half of 2008 and all of 2009,  averaging 2.7 basis points higher (or $184 million based on the amount  issued) than outstanding bills of a similar maturity. CMBs play an  important role in Treasury debt management, and it is likely that Treasury  will always need to use CMBs, but Treasury could achieve savings by  limiting the amount of CMBs it issues.", "Treasury has already begun its transition out of CMBs that are not linked  to the SFP. As part of that transition, it has extended the average term to  maturity of outstanding marketable securities by stabilizing short-term  debt issuances and transitioning to nominal note and bond issuances. In  February 2010, Treasury officials said that they planned to stabilize  nominal note and bond issuance in the first half of 2010 and perhaps  reduce nominal note and bond issuance in the second half of 2010. As of  September 2009, 28.5 percent of Treasury\u2019s debt portfolio was in bills. If  Treasury does not alter its current pattern of issuance, Treasury projects  this share will decline to 19 percent by September 2010 and to 16 percent  by September 2011.

Faced with this challenge,  communication with investors becomes essential. When we surveyed  major domestic holders of Treasury securities in August 2009, many  survey participants indicated that their demand could increase for TIPS.  As seen in table 1, as of July 31, 2009, survey respondents reported holding $143 billion in TIPS\u2014which represented approximately 26 percent of the  total marketable TIPS outstanding. This amount also constituted  approximately 21 percent of the survey respondents\u2019 total portfolio of  Treasury securities. This share allocated to TIPS may indicate that our  survey respondents already viewed TIPS favorably. According to Treasury  data, TIPS generally represent a much smaller percentage of total  outstanding Treasury securities. At the time of our survey in August 2009,  TIPS constituted only 8 percent of all Treasury marketable securities  outstanding.  stor  The increased investor interest in TIPS, as reported through our survey corroborates information we received from individu conducted earlier with large domestic holders of Treasury securities. The  investment managers we interviewed at public and private pension fund s,  mutual funds, insurance companies, and commercial banks expressed  continued or growing interest in TIPS during 2009.", "At the start of 2009, financial-market experts were recommending that  investors purchase TIPS and other inflation-protected investments. Over  the course of the year, mutual funds began reporting large inflows into  inflation-protected funds, which consist mostly of TIPS. During 2009, the  five largest inflation-protected bond mutual funds increased their total net  assets by almost 70 percent. The largest of these funds saw its net assets  increase by an average of almost $1 billion per month in 2009. Also during  2009, one of the largest fixed income managers introduced three new  mutual funds designed to protect investors against inflation. One o new funds is intended to provide a hedge against inflation but also pro tax-efficient income by allocating at least half of its investments to  municipal bonds. The other two new funds are intended to produce  monthly income payments that consist of both inflation-adjusted interest  and principal. These two funds consist primarily of investments in TIPS  and have initial target maturity dates of 2019 and 2029."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Changes to TIPS Suggest That Treasury Is Responding to Investor Concerns about the Liquidity of TIPS", "paragraphs": ["GAO and others have recommended that Treasury take action to improve  the liquidity of TIPS, which could lower Treasury\u2019s cost of borrowing.

By the  onset of the financial crisis in 2008, the share of Treasury securities  relative to each sector\u2019s total assets was less than half their historical  averages for the preceding two decades. By the end of 2007, no sector  reported holding more than 5-\u00bd percent of its total assets in Treasury  s ecurities.", "In 2009, Treasury decided to increase TIPS issuance, reversing the trend of  the past few years. As we previously reported, Treasury reduced the  annual gross amount of TIPS issuance by 19 percent from 2006 to 2008.  Treasury then gradually increased total TIPS issuance in 2009 by 4 percent  to $58 billion. During the August 2009 TBAC press conference, Treasury  officials stated that they are committed to the TIPS program and to issuing  TIPS in a regular and predictable manner across the yield curve. Further,  during the November 2009 and February 2010 TBAC meetings, Treasury  officials announced that they planned to gradually increase TIPS issuance  and would consider making changes to the TIPS auction calendar by  increasing the number of TIPS auctions. These changes, which are meant  to improve TIPS liquidity, are based on Treasury\u2019s own analysis and on  input that Treasury received from market participants and GAO. At the  time of this report, Treasury had already begun to increase TIPS issuance.  The size of the 10-year TIPS auction held in January 2010 was $10 billion\u2014 an increase of 25 percent over the previous 10-year TIPS auctions that held  in July 2009.", "If investors continue to express and demonstrate interest in TIPS,  Treasury may be able to issue a greater amount of TIPS at a lower cost  than in past years. Survey respondents who anticipated a change in their  demand for TIPS said that any reallocation into TIPS would most likely be  drawn from holdings of nominal Treasury securities or non-Treasury  assets. Investments into TIPS were less likely to come from an overall  increase in total assets. As previously reported, if Treasury has to increase  the supply of nominal securities substantially to fund larger deficits, yields  may have to rise in order to attract enough buyers due to the saturation of  the nominal Treasury market. Therefore, issuing TIPS may make sense  since a substantial shift in the composition of Treasury issuance into TIPS  from nominal Treasuries could also lead to lower interest rates paid on the  remaining nominal Treasury issuance. The most common reasons cited by  our survey respondents for this specific anticipated shift into TIPS were  inflation protection and TIPS\u2019 valuation relative to other investments\u2014the  same reasons most often cited for a general interest in TIPS. Compared to  other sectors that we surveyed, mutual fund companies and state and local  government retirement funds also responded that some of their  investments in TIPS were dedicated based upon active allocation  decisions made by clients.", "Treasury has also responded to investor concern about the maturity of  TIPS issued across the yield curve by reintroducing the 30-year TIPS. At  the November 2009 TBAC meeting, there was general consensus to  eliminate the 20-year TIPS and replace it with the 30-year TIPS. TBAC  members thought this change may allow Treasury to lower its cost of  borrowing while it would create a TIPS issue that could be better  compared to the 30-year nominal issuance point.

The most common reasons listed  for this were infrequency of TIPS auctions, portfolio needs, relative  valuation, and liquidity.

In interviews with us in February 2010,  some primary dealers said that Treasury should modify its current TIPS  auction schedule to decrease the amount of time between TIPS auctions,  thereby staggering the supply of TIPS so that issuance is not as  concentrated. Since 2005, Treasury has held eight TIPS auctions every  calendar year\u2014two auctions each in January, April, July and October.

Primary dealers said they  believe both more direct bidding and the increase in the volatility of direct  bidding \u201cdis-incentivizes\u201d primary dealers because it means they have less  certainty of information surrounding a particular Treasury auction. For  example, if an investor purchases Treasury securities directly at auction  instead of going through a primary dealer, a primary dealer could have less  information available about the auction. Volatility in direct bidding also  increases uncertainty. Increased uncertainty could lead to primary dealers  making less aggressive bids, which could lead to increased borrowing  costs for Treasury. Some primary dealers also told us that an overall lack  of transparency regarding direct bidding potentially contributes to \u201csloppy  auctions.\u201d A sloppy auction typically means poor reception or demand for  a Treasury auction relative to what was expected and leads to higher  yields at the auction.
