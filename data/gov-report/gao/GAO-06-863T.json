Federal policy recognizes the need to prepare for debilitating Internet disruptions and tasks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with developing an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery. GAO was asked to summarize its report being released today--Internet Infrastructure: DHS Faces Challenges in Developing a Joint Public/Private Recovery Plan, GAO-06-672 (Washington, D.C.: June 16, 2006).

Recent physical and cyber incidents, such as Hurricane Katrina, have caused localized or regional disruptions but have not caused a catastrophic Internet failure. Federal laws and regulations that address critical infrastructure protection, disaster recovery, and the telecommunications infrastructure provide broad guidance that applies to the Internet, but it is not clear how useful these authorities would be in helping to recover from a major Internet disruption. Specifically, key legislation on critical infrastructure protection does not address roles and responsibilities in the event of an Internet disruption. Other laws and regulations governing disaster response and emergency communications have never been used for Internet recovery. DHS has begun a variety of initiatives to fulfill its responsibility for developing an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery, but these efforts are not complete or comprehensive. Specifically, DHS has developed high-level plans for infrastructure protection and incident response, but the components of these plans that address the Internet infrastructure are not complete. In addition, the department has started a variety of initiatives to improve the nation's ability to recover from Internet disruptions, including working groups to facilitate coordination and exercises in which government and private industry practice responding to cyber events. However, progress to date on these initiatives has been limited, and other initiatives lack time frames for completion. Also, the relationships among these initiatives are not evident. As a result, the government is not yet adequately prepared to effectively coordinate public/private plans for recovering from a major Internet disruption. Key challenges to establishing a plan for recovering from Internet disruptions include (1) innate characteristics of the Internet that make planning for and responding to disruptions difficult, (2) lack of consensus on DHS's role and when the department should get involved in responding to a disruption, (3) legal issues affecting DHS's ability to provide assistance to restore Internet service, (4) reluctance of many in the private sector to share information on Internet disruptions with DHS, and (5) leadership and organizational uncertainties within DHS. Until these challenges are addressed, DHS will have difficulty achieving results in its role as a focal point for helping the Internet to recover from a major disruption."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to join today\u2019s hearing on reconstitution of  critical networks such as the Internet. Since the early 1990s, increasing  computer interconnectivity\u2014most notably growth in the use of the  Internet\u2014has revolutionized the way that our government, our nation, and  much of the world communicate and conduct business. Our country has  come to rely on the Internet as a critical infrastructure supporting  commerce, education, and communication. While the benefits of this  technology have been enormous, this widespread interconnectivity poses  significant risks to the government\u2019s and our nation\u2019s computer systems  and, more importantly, to the critical operations and infrastructures they  support.", "Federal regulation establishes the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) as the focal point for the security of cyberspace\u2014including  recovery efforts for public and private critical infrastructure systems.  Additionally, federal policy recognizes the need to be prepared for the  possibility of debilitating Internet disruptions and tasks DHS with  developing an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery. Last  July, we testified before you on DHS\u2019s responsibilities for cybersecurity- related critical infrastructure protection. In that testimony, we discussed  the status of DHS\u2019s efforts and challenges faced by DHS in fulfilling its  responsibilities. We reported that DHS had much work ahead of it. In a  related report, we recommended that DHS prioritize cybersecurity-related  responsibilities\u2014including establishing recovery plans for key Internet  functions.", "As requested, our testimony summarizes a report we released that (1)  identifies examples of major disruptions to the Internet, (2) identifies the  primary laws and regulations governing recovery of the Internet in the  event of a major disruption, (3) evaluates DHS\u2019s plans for facilitating  recovery from Internet disruptions, and (4) assesses challenges to such  efforts. The report includes matters for congressional consideration and  recommendations to DHS for improving Internet recovery efforts. In  preparing for this testimony, we relied on our work supporting the  accompanying report. That report contains a detailed overview of our  scope and methodology.

From its origins in the 1960s as a research project sponsored by  the U.S. government, the Internet has grown increasingly important to  both American and foreign businesses and consumers, serving as the  medium for hundreds of billions of dollars of commerce each year. The  Internet has also become an extended information and communications  infrastructure, supporting vital services such as power distribution, health  care, law enforcement, and national defense. Today, private industry\u2014 including telecommunications companies, cable companies, and Internet  service providers\u2014owns and operates the vast majority of the Internet\u2019s  infrastructure. In recent years, cyber attacks involving malicious software  or hacking have been increasing in frequency and complexity. These  attacks can come from a variety of actors, including criminal groups,  hackers, and terrorists.", "Federal regulation recognizes the need to protect critical infrastructures  such as the Internet. It directs federal departments and agencies to identify  and prioritize critical infrastructure sectors and key resources and to  protect them from terrorist attack. Furthermore, it recognizes that since a  large portion of these critical infrastructures is owned and operated by the  private sector, a public/private partnership is crucial for the successful  protection of these critical infrastructures. Federal policy also recognizes  the need to be prepared for the possibility of debilitating disruptions in  cyberspace and, because the vast majority of the Internet infrastructure is  owned and operated by the private sector, tasks DHS with developing an  integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery. In its plan for  protecting critical infrastructures, DHS recognizes that the Internet is a  key resource composed of assets within both the information technology  and the telecommunications sectors. It notes that the Internet is used by  all critical infrastructure sectors to varying degrees and provides  information and communications to meet the needs of businesses and  government.", "In the event of a major Internet disruption, multiple organizations could  help recover Internet service. These organizations include private  industry, collaborative groups, and government organizations. Private  industry is central to Internet recovery because private companies own the  vast majority of the Internet\u2019s infrastructure and often have response  plans. Collaborative groups\u2014including working groups and industry  councils\u2014provide information-sharing mechanisms to allow private  organizations to restore services. In addition, government initiatives could  facilitate response to major Internet disruptions.", "Federal policies and plans assign DHS lead responsibility for facilitating a  public/private response to and recovery from major Internet disruptions.  Within DHS, responsibilities reside in two divisions within the  Preparedness Directorate: the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD)  and the National Communications System (NCS). NCSD operates the U.S.  Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), which coordinates  defense against and response to cyber attacks. The other division, NCS,  provides programs and services that assure the resilience of the  telecommunications infrastructure in times of crisis. Additionally, the  Federal Communications Commission can support Internet recovery by  coordinating resources for restoring the basic communications  infrastructures over which Internet services run. For example, after  Hurricane Katrina, the commission granted temporary authority for  private companies to set up wireless Internet communications supporting  various relief groups; federal, state, and local government agencies;  businesses; and victims in the disaster areas.", "Prior evaluations of DHS\u2019s cybersecurity responsibilities have highlighted  issues and challenges facing the department. In May 2005, we issued a  report on DHS\u2019s efforts to fulfill its cybersecurity responsibilities. We  noted that while DHS had initiated multiple efforts to fulfill its  responsibilities, it had not fully addressed any of the 13 key cybersecurity  responsibilities noted in federal law and policy. We also reported that DHS  faced a number of challenges that have impeded its ability to fulfill its  cyber responsibilities. These challenges included achieving organizational  stability, gaining organizational authority, overcoming hiring and  contracting issues, increasing awareness of cybersecurity roles and  capabilities, establishing effective partnerships with stakeholders,  achieving two-way information sharing with stakeholders, and  demonstrating the value that DHS can provide. In this report, we also  made recommendations to improve DHS\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission as an  effective focal point for cybersecurity, including recovery plans for key  Internet functions. DHS agreed that strengthening cybersecurity is central  to protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures and that much remained  to be done, but it has not yet addressed our recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Cyber and Physical Incidents Have Caused Disruptions, the Internet Has Not Yet Suffered a Catastrophic Failure", "paragraphs": ["The Internet\u2019s infrastructure is vulnerable to disruptions in service due to  terrorist and other malicious attacks, natural disasters, accidents,  technological problems, or a combination of the above. Disruptions to  Internet service can be caused by cyber and physical incidents\u2014both  intentional and unintentional. Recent physical and cyber incidents have  caused localized or regional disruptions, highlighting the importance of  recovery planning. However, these incidents have also shown the Internet  as a whole to be flexible and resilient. Even in severe circumstances, the  Internet has not yet suffered a catastrophic failure.", "To date, cyber attacks have caused various degrees of damage. For  example, in 2001, the Code Red worm used a denial-of-service attack to  affect millions of computer users by shutting down Web sites, slowing  Internet service, and disrupting business and government operations. In  2003, the Slammer worm caused network outages, canceled airline flights,  and automated teller machine failures. Slammer resulted in temporary loss  of Internet access to some users, and cost estimates on the impact of the  worm range from $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion. The federal government  coordinated with security companies and Internet service providers and  released an advisory recommending that federal departments and agencies  patch and block access to the affected channel. However, because the  worm had propagated so quickly, most of these activities occurred after it  had stopped spreading.", "In 2002, a coordinated denial-of-service attack was launched against all of  the root servers in the Domain Name System. At least nine of the thirteen  root servers experienced degradation of service. However, average end  users hardly noticed the attack. The attack became visible only as a result  of various Internet health-monitoring projects. The response to the attacks  was handled by the server operators and their service providers. The  attack pointed to a need for increased capacity for servers at Internet  exchange points to enable them to manage the high volumes of data traffic  during an attack. If a massive disruptive attack on the domain name server  system were successful, it could take several days to recover from.  According to experts familiar with the attack, the government did not have  a role in recovering from it.", "Like cyber incidents, physical incidents could affect various aspects of the  Internet infrastructure, including underground or undersea cables and  facilities that house telecommunications equipment, Internet exchange  points, or Internet service providers. For example, on July 18, 2001, a 60- car freight train derailed in a Baltimore tunnel, causing a fire that  interrupted Internet and data services between Washington and New York.  The tunnel housed fiber-optic cables serving seven of the biggest U.S.  Internet service providers. The fire burned and severed fiber optic cables,  causing backbone slowdowns for at least three major Internet service  providers. Efforts to recover Internet service were handled by the affected  Internet service providers; however, local and federal officials responded  to the immediate physical issues of extinguishing the fire and maintaining  safety in the surrounding area, and they worked with telecommunications  companies to reroute affected cables.", "In addition, Hurricane Katrina caused substantial destruction of the  communications infrastructure in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, but  it had minimal affect on the overall functioning of the Internet outside of  the immediate area. According to an Internet monitoring service provider,  while there was a loss of routing around the affected area, there was no  significant impact on global Internet routing. According to the Federal  Communications Commission, the storm caused outages for over 3 million  telephone customers, 38 emergency 9-1-1 call centers, hundreds of  thousands of cable customers, and over 1,000 cellular sites. However, a  substantial number of the networks that experienced service disruptions  recovered relatively quickly.", "Federal officials stated that the government took steps to respond to the  hurricane, such as increasing analysis and watch services in the affected  area, coordinating with communications companies to move personnel to  safety, working with fuel and equipment providers, and rerouting  communications traffic away from affected areas. However, private-sector  representatives stated that requests for assistance, such as food, water,  fuel, and secure access to facilities were denied for legal reasons; the  government made time-consuming and duplicative requests for  information; and certain government actions impeded recovery efforts.", "Since its inception, the Internet has experienced disruptions of varying  scale\u2014including fast-spreading worms, denial-of-service attacks, and  physical destruction of key infrastructure components\u2014but the Internet  has yet to experience a catastrophic failure. However, it is possible that a  complex attack or set of attacks could cause the Internet to fail. It is also  possible that a series of attacks against the Internet could undermine  users\u2019 trust and thereby reduce the Internet\u2019s utility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Laws and Regulations Apply to the Internet, but Numerous Uncertainties Exist in Using Them for Internet Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Several federal laws and regulations provide broad guidance that applies  to the Internet infrastructure, but it is not clear how useful these  authorities would be in helping to recover from a major Internet disruption  because some do not specifically address Internet recovery and others  have seldom been used. Pertinent laws and regulations address critical  infrastructure protection, federal disaster response, and the  telecommunications infrastructure.", "Specifically, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 7 establish critical infrastructure protection as a  national goal and describe a strategy for cooperative efforts by the  government and the private sector to protect the physical and cyber-based  systems that are essential to the operations of the economy and the  government. These authorities apply to the Internet because it is a core  communications infrastructure supporting the information technology and  telecommunications sectors. However, this law and regulation do not  specifically address roles and responsibilities in the event of an Internet  disruption.", "Regarding federal disaster response, the Defense Production Act and the  Stafford Act provide authority to federal agencies to plan for and respond  to incidents of national significance like disasters and terrorist attacks.  Specifically, the Defense Production Act authorizes the President to  ensure the timely availability of products, materials, and services needed  to meet the requirements of a national emergency. It is applicable to  critical infrastructure protection and restoration but has never been used  for Internet recovery. The Stafford Act authorizes federal assistance to  states, local governments, nonprofit entities, and individuals in the event  of a major disaster or emergency. However, the act does not authorize  assistance to for-profit companies\u2014such as those that own and operate  core Internet components.", "Other legislation and regulations, including the Communications Act of  1934 and the NCS authorities, govern the telecommunications  infrastructure and help to ensure communications during national  emergencies. For example, the NCS authorities establish guidance for  operationally coordinating with industry to protect and restore key  national security and emergency preparedness communications services.  These authorities grant the President certain emergency powers regarding  telecommunications, including the authority to require any carrier subject  to the Communications Act of 1934 to grant preference or priority to  essential communications. The President may also, in the event of war or  national emergency, suspend regulations governing wire and radio  transmissions and authorize the use or control of any such facility or  station and its apparatus and equipment by any department of the  government. Although these authorities remain in force in the Code of  Federal Regulations, they have been seldom used\u2014and never for Internet  recovery. Thus it is not clear how effective they would be if used for this  purpose.", "In commenting on the statutory authority for Internet reconstitution  following a disruption, DHS agreed that this authority is lacking and noted  that the government\u2019s roles and authorities related to assisting in Internet  reconstitution following a disruption are not fully defined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Initiatives Supporting Internet Recovery Planning Are under Way, but Much Remains to Be Done and the Relationship Between Initiatives Is Not Evident", "paragraphs": ["DHS has begun a variety of initiatives to fulfill its responsibility to develop  an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery, but these efforts  are not complete or comprehensive.

The other key document, the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan, consists of both a base plan and sector- specific plans. The base plan, which was recently released, describes the  importance of cybersecurity and networks such as the Internet to critical  infrastructure protection and includes an appendix that provides  information on cybersecurity responsibilities.

Until it  addresses these challenges, DHS will have difficulty achieving results in its  role as focal point for recovering the Internet from a major disruption.", "First, the Internet\u2019s diffuse structure, vulnerabilities in its basic protocols,  and the lack of agreed-upon performance measures make planning for and  responding to a disruption more difficult. The components of the Internet  are not all governed by the same organization. In addition, the Internet is  international. According to private-sector estimates, only about 20 percent  of Internet users are in the United States. Also, there are no well-accepted  standards for measuring and monitoring the Internet infrastructure\u2019s  availability and performance. Instead, individuals and organizations rate  the Internet\u2019s performance according to their own priorities.", "Second, there is no consensus about the role DHS should play in  responding to a major Internet disruption or about the appropriate trigger  for its involvement. The lack of clear legislative authority for Internet  recovery efforts complicates the definition of this role. DHS officials  acknowledged that their role in recovering from an Internet disruption  needs further clarification because private industry owns and operates the  vast majority of the Internet.", "The trigger for the National Response Plan, which is DHS\u2019s overall  framework for incident response, is poorly defined and has been found by  both us and the White House to need revision. Since private-sector  participation in DHS planning activities for Internet disruption is  voluntary, agreement on the appropriate trigger for government  involvement and the role of government in resolving an Internet disruption  is essential to any plan\u2019s success.", "Private-sector officials representing telecommunication backbone  providers and Internet service providers were also unclear about the types  of assistance DHS could provide in responding to an incident and about  the value of such assistance. There was no consensus on this issue. Many  private-sector officials stated that the government did not have a direct  recovery role, while others identified a variety of potential roles, including    providing information on specific threats;    providing security and disaster relief support during a crisis;  funding backup communication infrastructures;   driving improved Internet security through requirements for the  government\u2019s own procurement;    serving as a focal point with state and local governments to establish  standard credentials to allow Internet and telecommunications companies  access to areas that have been restricted or closed in a crisis;   providing logistical assistance, such as fuel, power, and security, to  focusing on smaller-scale exercises targeted at specific Internet disruption  issues; limiting the initial focus for Internet recovery planning to key national  security and emergency preparedness functions, such as public health and  safety; and   establishing a system for prioritizing the recovery of Internet service,  similar to the existing Telecommunications Service Priority Program.", "A third challenge to planning for recovery is that there are key legal issues  affecting DHS\u2019s ability to provide assistance to help restore Internet  service. As noted earlier, key legislation and regulations guiding critical  infrastructure protection, disaster recovery, and the telecommunications  infrastructure do not provide specific authorities for Internet recovery. As  a result, there is no clear legislative guidance on which organization would  be responsible in the case of a major Internet disruption. In addition, the  Stafford Act, which authorizes the government to provide federal  assistance to states, local governments, nonprofit entities, and individuals  in the event of a major disaster or emergency, does not authorize  assistance to for-profit corporations. Several representatives of  telecommunications companies reported that they had requested federal  assistance from DHS during Hurricane Katrina. Specifically, they  requested food, water, and security for the teams they were sending in to  restore the communications infrastructure and fuel to power their  generators. DHS responded that it could not fulfill these requests, noting  that the Stafford Act did not extend to for-profit companies.", "A fourth challenge is that a large percentage of the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure\u2014including the Internet\u2014is owned and operated by the  private sector, meaning that public/private partnerships are crucial for  successful critical infrastructure protection. Although certain policies  direct DHS to work with the private sector to ensure infrastructure  protection, DHS does not have the authority to direct Internet owners and  operators in their recovery efforts. Instead, it must rely on the private  sector to share information on incidents, disruptions, and recovery efforts.  Many private-sector representatives questioned the value of providing  information to DHS regarding planning for and recovery from Internet  disruption. In addition, DHS has identified provisions of the Federal  Advisory Committee Act as having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on cooperation with  the private sector. The uncertainties regarding the value and risks of  cooperation with the government limit incentives for the private sector to  cooperate in Internet recovery-planning efforts.", "Finally, DHS has lacked permanent leadership while developing its  preliminary plans for Internet recovery and reconstitution. In addition, the  organizations with roles in Internet recovery (NCS and NCSD) have  overlapping responsibilities and may be reorganized once DHS selects  permanent leadership. As a result, it is difficult for DHS to develop a clear  set of organizational priorities and to coordinate between the various  activities necessary for Internet recovery planning. In May 2005, we  reported that multiple senior DHS cybersecurity officials had recently left  the department. These officials included the NCSD Director, the Deputy  Director responsible for Outreach and Awareness, the Director of the US- CERT Control Systems Security Center, the Under Secretary for the  Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate and the  Assistant Secretary responsible for the Information Protection Office.  Additionally, DHS officials acknowledge that the current organizational  structure has overlapping responsibilities for planning for and recovering  from a major Internet disruption.", "In a July 2005 departmental reorganization, NCS and NCSD were placed in  the Preparedness Directorate. NCS\u2019s and NCSD\u2019s responsibilities were to  be placed under a new Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security and  Telecommunications\u2014in part to raise the visibility of cybersecurity issues  in the department. However, almost a year later, this position remains  vacant. While DHS stated that the lack of a permanent assistant secretary  has not hampered its efforts in protecting critical infrastructure, several  private-sector representatives stated that DHS\u2019s lack of leadership in this  area has limited progress. Specifically, these representatives stated that  filling key leadership positions would enhance DHS\u2019s visibility to the  Internet industry and potentially improve its reputation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of GAO Recommendations Should Improve DHS Internet Recovery Planning Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Given the importance of the Internet infrastructure to our nation\u2019s  communication and commerce, in our accompanying report we suggested  matters for congressional consideration and made recommendations to  DHS regarding improving efforts in planning for Internet recovery.  Specifically, we suggested that Congress consider clarifying the legal  framework that guides roles and responsibilities for Internet recovery in  the event of a major disruption. This effort could include providing  specific authorities for Internet recovery as well as examining potential  roles for the federal government, such as providing access to disaster  areas, prioritizing selected entities for service recovery, and using federal  contracting mechanisms to encourage more secure technologies. This  effort also could include examining the Stafford Act to determine whether  there would be benefits in establishing specific authority for the  government to provide for-profit companies\u2014such as those that own or  operate critical communications infrastructures\u2014with limited assistance  during a crisis.", "Additionally, to improve DHS\u2019s ability to facilitate public/private efforts to  recover the Internet in case of a major disruption, we recommended that  the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security implement the  following nine actions:    Establish dates for revising the National Response Plan\u2014including efforts  to update key components that are relevant to the Internet.", "Use the planned revisions to the National Response Plan and the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan as a basis to draft public/private plans for  Internet recovery and obtain input from key Internet infrastructure  companies.", "Review the NCS and NCSD organizational structures and roles in light of  the convergence of voice and data communications.", "Identify the relationships and interdependencies among the various  Internet recovery-related activities currently under way in NCS and NCSD,  including initiatives by US-CERT, the National Cyber Response  Coordination Group, the Internet Disruption Working Group, the North  American Incident Response Group, and the groups responsible for  developing and implementing cyber recovery exercises.", "Establish time lines and priorities for key efforts identified by the Internet  Disruption Working Group.", "Identify ways to incorporate lessons learned from actual incidents and  during cyber exercises into recovery plans and procedures.", "Work with private-sector stakeholders representing the Internet  infrastructure to address challenges to effective Internet recovery by further defining needed government functions in responding to a major  Internet disruption (this effort should include a careful consideration  of the potential government functions identified by the private sector  earlier in this testimony),   defining a trigger for government involvement in responding to such a    documenting assumptions and developing approaches to deal with key  challenges that are not within the government\u2019s control.", "In written comments, DHS agreed with our recommendations and stated  that it recognizes the importance of the Internet for information  infrastructures. DHS also provided information about initial actions it is  taking to implement our recommendations.", "In summary, as a critical information infrastructure supporting our  nation\u2019s commerce and communications, the Internet is subject to  disruption\u2014from both intentional and unintentional incidents. While  major incidents to date have had regional or local impacts, the Internet has  not yet suffered a catastrophic failure. Should such a failure occur,  however, existing legislation and regulations do not specifically address  roles and responsibilities for Internet recovery.", "As the focal point for ensuring the security of cyberspace, DHS has  initiated efforts to refine high-level disaster recovery plans; however,  pertinent Internet components of these plans are not complete. While DHS  has also undertaken several initiatives to improve Internet recovery  planning, much remains to be done. Specifically, some initiatives lack  clear timelines, lessons learned are not consistently being incorporated in  recovery plans, and the relationships between the various initiatives are  not clear.", "DHS faces numerous challenges in developing integrated public/private  recovery plans\u2014not the least of which is the fact that the government  does not own or operate much of the Internet. In addition, there is no  consensus among public and private stakeholders about the appropriate  role of DHS and when it should get involved; legal issues limit the actions  the government can take; the private sector is reluctant to share  information on Internet performance with the government; and DHS is  undergoing important organizational and leadership changes. As a result,  the exact role of the government in helping to recover the Internet  infrastructure following a major disruption remains unclear.", "To improve DHS\u2019s ability to facilitate public/private efforts to recover the  Internet in case of a major disruption, our accompanying report suggested  that Congress consider clarifying the legal framework guiding Internet  recovery. We also made recommendations to DHS to establish clear  milestones for completing key plans, coordinate various Internet recovery- related activities, and address key challenges to Internet recovery  planning. Effectively implementing these recommendations could greatly  enhance our nation\u2019s ability to recover from a major Internet disruption.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
