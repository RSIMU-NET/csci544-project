The Recovery Act requires GAO to do bimonthly reviews of the use of funds by selected states and localities. In this first report, GAO describes selected states' and localities' (1) uses of and planning of Recovery Act funds, (2) accountability approaches, and (3) plans to evaluate the impact of funds received. GAO's work is focused on 16 states and the District of Columbia--representing about 65 percent of the U.S. population and two-thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance available through the Recovery Act. GAO collected documents from and interviewed state and local officials, including Governors, \"Recovery Czars,\" State Auditors, Controllers, and Treasurers. GAO also reviewed guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and other federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About 90 percent of the estimated $49 billion in Recovery Act funding to be provided to states and localities in FY2009 will be through health, transportation and education programs. Within these categories, the three largest programs are increased Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) grant awards, funds for highway infrastructure investment, and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF). The funding notifications for Recovery Act funds for the 16 selected states and the District of Columbia (the District) have been approximately $24.2 billion for Medicaid FMAP on April 3, $26.7 billion for highways on March 2, and $32.6 billion for SFSF on April 2. Fifteen of the 16 states and the District have drawn down approximately $7.96 billion in increased FMAP grant awards for the period October 1, 2008 through April 1, 2009. The increased FMAP is for state expenditures for Medicaid services. The receipt of this increased FMAP may reduce the state share for their Medicaid programs. States have reported using funds made available as a result of the increased FMAP for a variety of purposes. For example, states and the District reported using these funds to maintain their current level of Medicaid eligibility and benefits, cover their increased Medicaid caseloads-which are primarily populations that are sensitive to economic downturns, including children and families, and to offset their state general fund deficits thereby avoiding layoffs and other measures detrimental to economic recovery. States are undertaking planning activities to identify projects, obtain approval at the state and federal level and move them to contracting and implementation. For the most part, states were focusing on construction and maintenance projects, such as road and bridge repairs. Before they can expend Recovery Act funds, states must reach agreement with the Department of Transportation on the specific projects; as of April 16, two of the 16 states had agreements covering more than 50 percent of their states' apportioned funds, and three states did not have agreement on any projects. While a few, including Mississippi and Iowa had already executed contracts, most of the 16 states were planning to solicit bids in April or May. Thus, states generally had not yet expended significant amounts of Recovery Act funds. The states and D.C. must apply to the Department of Education for SFSF funds. Education will award funds once it determines that an application contains key assurances and information on how the state will use the funds. As of April 20, applications from three states had met that determination- South Dakota, and two of GAO's sample states, California and Illinois. The applications from other states are being developed and submitted and have not yet been awarded. The states and the District report that SFSF funds will be used to hire and retain teachers, reduce the potential for layoffs, cover budget shortfalls, and restore funding cuts to programs. Planning continues for the use of Recovery Act funds. State activities indlude appointing Recovery Czars; establishing task forces and other entities, and developing public websites to solicit input and publicize selected projects. GAO found that the selected states and the District are taking various approaches to ensuring that internal controls manage risk up-front; they are assessing known risks and developing plans to address those risks. State auditors are also planning their work including conducting required single audits and testing compliance with federal requirements. Nearly half of the estimated spending programs in the Recovery Act will be administered by non-federal entities. State officials suggested opportunities to improve communication in several areas. Officials in nine of the 16 states and the District expressed concern about determining the jobs created and retained under the Recovery Act, as well as methodologies that can be used for estimation of each."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Nation faces what is generally reported to be the most serious  economic crisis since the Great Depression.

The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Recovery Act\u2019s  combined spending and tax provisions will cost $787 billion over ten  years, of which more than $580 billion will be in additional federal  spending. The stated purposes of the Recovery Act are to:    preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery;   assist those most impacted by the recession;    provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by  spurring technological advances in science and health;  invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other  infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and  stabilize state and local government budgets, in order to minimize and  avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and  local tax increases.", "The Recovery Act specifies several roles for GAO including conducting  bimonthly reviews of selected states\u2019 and localities\u2019 use of funds made  available under the act.

The states are Arizona, California,  Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan,  Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  and Texas. These states contain about 65 percent of the U.S. population  and are estimated to receive collectively about two-thirds of the  intergovernmental federal assistance funds available through the Recovery  Act.

As noted  above, three of the largest streams of funds flowing to states and localities  are (1) the temporary increase in FMAP funding which will provide states  with approximately $87 billion in assistance; (2) the State Fiscal  Stabilization Fund, which will provide nearly $54 billion to help state and  local governments avert budget cuts, primarily in education; and (3)  highway infrastructure investment funds of approximately $27 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicaid FMAP", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care for  certain categories of low-income individuals, including children, families,  persons with disabilities, and persons who are elderly. The federal  government matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a  formula based on each state\u2019s per capita income in relation to the national  average per capita income. The amount of federal assistance states receive  for Medicaid service expenditures is known as the FMAP. Across states,  the FMAP may range from 50 to no more than 83 percent, with poorer  states receiving a higher federal matching rate than wealthier states.", "Under the Recovery Act, states are eligible for an increased FMAP for  expenditures that states make in providing services to their Medicaid  populations. The Recovery Act provides eligible states with this increased  FMAP for 27 months between October 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. On  February 25, 2009, CMS made increased FMAP grant awards to states, and  states may retroactively claim reimbursement for expenditures that  occurred prior to the effective date of the Recovery Act. Generally, for  fiscal year 2009 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the increased  FMAP, which is calculated on a quarterly basis, provides for: (1) the  maintenance of states\u2019 prior year FMAPs; (2) a general across-the-board  increase of 6.2 percentage points in states\u2019 FMAPs; and (3) a further  increase to the FMAPs for those states that have a qualifying increase in  unemployment rates.

Under this program, funds are  apportioned annually to each state department of transportation (or  equivalent) to construct and maintain roadways and bridges on the  federal-aid highway system.

After reserving these and certain other funds, the  remaining funds are to be distributed to states by formula, with 61 percent  of the state award based on the state\u2019s relative share of the population  aged 5 to 24 and 39 percent based on the state\u2019s relative share of the total  U.S. population. The Recovery Act specifies that 81.8 percent (about $39.5  billion) of these remaining funds are to be distributed to states for support  of elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education, and early  childhood education programs. The remaining 18.2 percent of SFSF (about  $8.8 billion) is available for public safety and other government services  including for educational purposes.

As shown in figure 3, about two-thirds of Recovery Act funds expected to  be spent by states in the current 2009 fiscal year will be health related,  primarily temporary increases in Medicaid FMAP funding. Health,  education, and transportation is estimated to account for approximately  90 percent of fiscal year 2009 Recovery Act funding for states and  localities. However, by fiscal year 2012, transportation will be the largest  share of state and local Recovery Act funding. Taken together,  transportation spending, along with investments in the community  development, energy, and environmental areas that are geared more  toward creating long-run economic growth opportunities will represent  approximately two-thirds of state and local Recovery Act funding in 2012.", "The administration has stipulated that every taxpayer dollar spent on  economic recovery must be subject to unprecedented levels of  transparency and accountability. To that end, the Recovery Act  established the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to  coordinate and conduct oversight of funds distributed under the Act in  order to prevent fraud, waste and abuse. The Board includes a Chairman  appointed by the President, and ten Inspectors General specified by the  Act. The Board has a series of functions and powers to assist it in the  mission of providing oversight and promoting transparency regarding  expenditure of funds at all levels of government. The Board will report on  the use of Recovery Act funds and may also make recommendations to  agencies on measures to avoid problems and prevent fraud, waste and  abuse.", "The Board is also charged under the Act with establishing and maintaining  a web site, www.recovery.gov, (Recovery.gov) to foster greater  accountability and transparency in the use of covered funds. The website  currently includes overview information about the Recovery Act, a  timeline for implementation, a frequently asked questions page, and an  announcement page that is to be regularly updated. The administration  plans to develop the site to encompass information about available  funding, distribution of funds, and major recipients. The website is  required to include plans from federal agencies; information on federal  awards of formula grants and awards of competitive grants; and  information on federal allocations for mandatory and other entitlement  programs by state, county, or other appropriate geographical unit.  Eventually, prime recipients of Recovery Act funding will provide  information on how they are using their federal funds. Currently,  Recovery.gov features projections for how, when, and where the funds  will be spent, as well as which states and sectors of the economy are due  to receive what proportion of the funds.

Generally, for fiscal year 2009 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2011,  the increased FMAP, which is calculated on a quarterly basis, provides for:  (1) the maintenance of states\u2019 prior year FMAPs; (2) a general across-the- board increase of 6.2 percentage points in states\u2019 FMAPs; and (3) a further  increase to the FMAPs for those states that have a qualifying increase in  unemployment rates.", "In our sample of 16 states and the District, officials from 15 states and the  District indicated that they had drawn down increased FMAP grant  awards, totaling $7.96 billion for the period of October 1, 2008 through  April 1, 2009\u201447 percent of their increased FMAP grant awards. In our  sample, the extent to which individual states and the District accessed  these funds varied widely, ranging from 0 percent in Colorado to about 66  percent in New Jersey. Nationally, the 50 states and several territories  combined have drawn down approximately $11 billion as of April 1, 2009,  which represents almost 46 percent of the increased FMAP grants  awarded for the first three quarters of federal fiscal year 2009 (Table 3).", "In order for states to qualify for the increased FMAP available under the  Recovery Act, they must meet certain requirements. In particular    Maintenance of Eligibility: In order to qualify for the increased  FMAP, states generally may not apply eligibility standards,  methodologies, or procedures that are more restrictive than those in  effect under their state Medicaid programs on July 1, 2008. In  guidance to states, CMS noted that examples of restrictions of  eligibility could include (1) the elimination of any eligibility groups  since July 1, 2008 or (2) changes in an eligibility determination or  redetermination process that is more stringent than what was in effect  on July 1, 2008. States that fail to initially satisfy the maintenance of  eligibility requirements have an opportunity to reinstate their eligibility  standards, methodologies, and procedures before July 1, 2009 and  become retroactively eligible for the increased FMAP.", "Compliance with Prompt Payment: Under federal law states are  required to pay claims from health practitioners promptly. Under the  Recovery Act, states are prohibited from receiving the increased FMAP  for days during any period in which that state has failed to meet this  requirement. Although the increased FMAP is not available for any  claims received from a practitioner on each day the state is not in  compliance with these prompt payment requirements, the state may  receive the regular FMAP for practitioner claims received on days of  non-compliance. CMS officials told us that states must attest that they  are in compliance with the prompt payment requirement, but that  enforcement is complicated due to differences across states in  methods used to track this information. CMS officials plan to issue  guidance on reporting compliance with the prompt payment  requirement and are currently gathering information from states on the  methods they use to determine compliance.", "Rainy Day Funds: States are not eligible for an increased FMAP if any  amounts attributable (either directly or indirectly) to the increased  FMAP are deposited or credited into any reserve or rainy day fund of  the state.", "Percentage Contributions from Political Subdivisions: In some  states, political subdivisions\u2014such as cities and counties\u2014may be  required to help finance the state\u2019s share of Medicaid spending.

In guidance to states, CMS has  stated that further guidance will be developed for this reporting  requirement. CMS guidance to states also indicates that, for federal  reimbursement, increased FMAP funds must be drawn down separately,  tracked separately, and reported to CMS separately.

However, the receipt of this  increased FMAP may reduce the state share for their Medicaid programs.  States have reported using these available funds for a variety of purposes.  In our sample, individual states and the District reported that they would  use the funds to maintain their current level of Medicaid eligibility and  benefits, cover their increased Medicaid caseloads\u2014which are primarily  populations that are sensitive to economic downturns, including children  and families, and to offset their state general fund deficits thereby avoiding  layoffs and other measures detrimental to economic recovery. Ten states  and the District reported using these funds to maintain program eligibility.  Nine states and the District reported using these funds to maintain  benefits. Specifically, Massachusetts reported that during a previous  financial downturn, the state limited the number of individuals eligible for  some services and reduced certain program benefits that were optional for  the state to cover. However, with the funds made available as a result of  the increased FMAP, the state did not have to make such reductions.  Similarly, New Jersey reported that the state used these funds to eliminate  premiums for certain children in its State Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program, allowing it to retain coverage for children whose enrollment in  the program would otherwise have been terminated for non-payment of  premiums. Nine states and the District reported using these funds to cover  increases to their Medicaid caseloads, primarily to populations that are  sensitive to economic downturns, such as children and families. For  example, New Jersey indicated that these funds would help the state meet  the increased demand for Medicaid services. According to a New Jersey  official, due to significant job losses, the state\u2019s proposed 2010 budget  would not have accommodated all the applicants newly eligible for  Medicaid and that the funds available as a result of the increased FMAP  have allowed the state to maintain a \u201csafety net\u201d of coverage for uninsured  and unemployed people. In addition, 10 states and the District indicated  that the increased funds made available would help offset deficits in their  general funds. Pennsylvania reported that because funding for its Medicaid  program is derived, in part, on state revenues, program funding levels  fluctuate as the economy rises and falls. However, the state was able to  use funds made available to offset the effects of lower state revenues.  Arizona officials also reported that the state used funds made available as  a result of the increased FMAP to pay down some of its debt and make  payroll payments, thus allowing the state to avoid a serious cash flow  problem.", "Finally, six states in our sample also reported that they used funds made  available as a result of the increased FMAP to comply with prompt  payment requirements. Specifically, Illinois reported that these funds will  permit the state to move from a 90-day payment cycle to a 30-day payment  cycle for all Medicaid providers. Three states also reported using these  funds to restore or to increase provider payment rates.", "In our sample, many states and the District indicated that they need  additional guidance from CMS regarding eligibility for the increased FMAP  funds. Specifically, 5 states raised concerns about whether certain  programmatic changes could jeopardize the state\u2019s eligibility for these  funds. For example Texas officials indicated that guidance from CMS is  needed regarding whether certain programmatic changes being considered  by Texas, such as a possible extension of the program\u2019s eligibility period,  would affect the state\u2019s eligibility for increased FMAP funds. Similarly,  Massachusetts wanted clarification from CMS as to whether certain  changes in the timeframe for the state to conduct eligibility re- determinations would be considered a more restrictive standard. Four  states also reported that they wanted additional guidance from CMS  regarding policies related to the prompt payment requirements or changes  to the non-federal share of Medicaid expenditures. For example, California  officials noted that the state reduced Medicaid payments for in-home  support services, but that counties could voluntarily choose to increase  these payments without altering the cost sharing arrangements between  the counties and the state. The state wants clarification from CMS on  whether such an arrangement would be allowable in light of the Recovery  Act requirements regarding the percentage of contributions by political  subdivisions within a state toward the non-federal share of expenditures.", "In response to states\u2019 concerns regarding the need for guidance, CMS told  us that it is in the process of developing draft guidance on the prompt  payment provisions in the Recovery Act. One official noted that this  guidance will include defining the term practitioner, describing the types  of claims applicable under the provision, and addressing the principles  that are integral to determining a state\u2019s compliance with prompt payment  requirements. Additionally, CMS plans to have a reporting mechanism in  place through which states would report compliance under this provision.  With regard to Recovery Act requirements regarding political subdivisions,  CMS described their current activities for providing guidance to states.  Due to the variability of state operations, funding processes, and political  structures, CMS has been working with states on a case-by-case basis to  discuss particular issues associated with this provision and to address the  particular circumstances for each state.

Under the Recovery  Act, priority is also to be given to projects that are projected to be  completed within three years. In addition, within 120 days after the  apportionment by the Department of Transportation to the states (March  2, 2009), and specifically before June 30, 2009, 50 percent of the  apportioned funds must be obligated. Any amount of this 50 percent of  apportioned funding that is not obligated may be withdrawn by the  Secretary of Transportation and redistributed to other states that have  obligated their funds in a timely manner. Furthermore, one year after  enactment the Secretary will withdraw any remaining unobligated funds  and redistribute them based on states\u2019 need and ability to obligate  additional funds.

States are required to reach agreement with the  Department of Transportation (DOT) on a list of projects reimbursement  from DOT for these projects. States will then request reimbursement from  DOT as the state makes payments to contractors working on approved  projects.", "As of April 16, 2009, the U.S Department of Transportation reported that  nationally $6.4 billion of the $26.6 billion in Recovery Act highway  infrastructure investment funding provided to the states had been  obligated \u2013 meaning Transportation and the states had reached  agreements on projects worth this amount. As shown in Table 4 below, for  the locations that GAO reviewed, the extent to which the Department of  Transportation had obligated funds apportioned to the states and  Washington D.C. ranged from 0 to 65 percent. For two of the states, the  Department of Transportation had obligated over 50 percent of the states\u2019  apportioned funds, for 4 it had obligated 30 to 50 percent of the states\u2019  funds, for 9 states it had obligated under 30 percent of funds, and for three  it had not obligated any funds.", "In most states we visited, while they had not yet expended significant  funds, they were planning to solicit bids in April or May. They also stated  that they planned to meet statutory deadlines for obligating the highway  funds. A few states had already executed contracts. As of April 1, 2009, the  Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), for example, had  signed contracts for 10 projects totaling approximately $77 million. These  projects include the expansion of State Route 19 in eastern Mississippi  into a four-lane highway. This project fulfills part of MDOT\u2019s 1987 Four- Lane Highway Program which seeks to link every Mississippian to a four- lane highway within 30 miles or 30 minutes. Similarly, as of April 15, 2009,  the Iowa Department of Transportation had competitively awarded 25  contracts valued at $168 million. Most often, however, we found that  highway funds in the states and the District have not yet been spent  because highway projects were at earlier stages of planning, approval, and  competitive contracting. For example, in Florida, the Department of  Transportation (FDOT) plans to use the Recovery Act funds to accelerate  road construction programs in its preexisting 5- year plan which will result  in some projects being reprioritized and selected for earlier completion.  On April 15, 2009, the Florida Legislative Budget Commission approved  the Recovery Act-funded projects that FDOT had submitted.", "For the most part, states were focusing their selection of Recovery Act- funded highway projects on construction and maintenance, rather than  planning and design, because they were seeking projects that would have  employment impacts and could be implemented quickly. These included  road repairs and resurfacing, bridge repairs and maintenance, safety  improvements, and road widening. For example, in Illinois, the  Department of Transportation is planning to spend a large share of its  estimated $655 million in Recovery Act funds for highway and bridge  construction and maintenance projects in economically distressed areas,  those that are shovel-ready, and those that can be completed by February  2012. In Iowa, the contracts awarded have been for projects such as bridge  replacements and highway resurfacing\u2014shovel-ready projects that could  be initiated and completed quickly. Knowing that the Recovery Act would  include opportunities for highway investment, states told us they worked  in advance of the legislation to identify appropriate projects. For example,  in New York, the state DOT began planning to manage anticipated federal  stimulus money in November 2008.

The applications from other states are being developed and  submitted and have not yet been awarded. The states and the District  report that SFSF funds will be used to hire and retain teachers, reduce the  potential for layoffs, cover budget shortfalls, and restore funding cuts to  programs. The applications to Education must contain certain assurances.  For example, states must assure that, in each of fiscal years 2009, 2010,  and 2011, they will maintain state support at fiscal year 2006 levels for  elementary and secondary education and also for public institutions of  higher education (IHEs). However, the Secretary of Education may waive  maintenance of effort requirements if the state demonstrates that it will  commit an equal or greater percentage of state revenues to education than  in the previous applicable year. The state application must also contain (1)  assurances that the state is committed to advancing education reform in  increasing teacher effectiveness, establishing state-wide education  longitudinal data systems, and improving the quality of state academic  standards and assessments; (2) baseline data that demonstrates the state\u2019s  current status in each of the education reform areas; and (3) a description  of how the state intends to use its stabilization allocation.", "Within two weeks of receipt of an approvable SFSF application, Education  will provide the state with 67 percent of its SFSF allocation.

States must distribute these funds to  school districts using the primary state education formula but maintain  discretion in how funds are allocated to public IHEs. If, after restoring  state support for education, additional funds remain, the state must  allocate those funds to school districts according to the funding formula  found in Title I, Part A, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965 (ESEA), commonly known as the No Child Left Behind Act. However,  if a state\u2019s education stabilization fund allocation is insufficient to restore  state support for education, then a state must allocate funds in proportion  to the relative shortfall in state support to public schools and IHEs.  Education stabilization funds must be allocated to school districts and  public IHEs and cannot be retained at the state level.", "Once stabilization funds are awarded to school districts and public IHEs,  they have considerable flexibility over how they use those funds. School  districts are allowed to use stabilization funds for any allowable purpose  under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), (commonly  known as the No Child Left Behind Act), the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA), the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or the  Perkins Act, subject to some prohibitions on using funds for, among other  things, sports facilities and vehicles. In particular, because allowable uses  under the Impact Aid provisions of ESEA are broad, school districts have  discretion to use Recovery Act funding for things ranging from salaries of  teachers, administrators, and support staff to purchases of textbooks,  computers, and other equipment. The Recovery Act allows public IHEs to  use SFSF funds in such a way as to mitigate the need to raise tuition and  fees, as well as for the modernization, renovation, and repair of facilities,  subject to certain limitations. However, the Recovery Act prohibits public  IHEs from using stabilization funds for such things as increasing  endowments, modernizing, renovating, or repairing sports facilities, or  maintaining equipment. According to Education officials, there are no  maintenance of effort requirements placed on local school districts.  Consequently, as long as local districts use stabilization funds for  allowable purposes, they are free to reduce spending on education from  local-source funds, such as property tax revenues.", "States have broad discretion over how the $8.8 billion in SFSF funds  designated for basic government services are used. The Recovery Act  provides that these funds can be used for public safety and other  government services and that these services may include assistance for  education, as well as for modernization, renovation, and repairs of public  schools or IHEs, subject to certain requirements. Education\u2019s guidance  provides that the funds can also be used to cover state administrative  expenses related to the Recovery Act. However, the Act also places  several restrictions on the use of these funds. For example, these funds  cannot be used to pay for casinos (a general prohibition that applies to all  Recovery Act funds), financial assistance for students to attend private  schools, or construction, modernization, renovation, or repair of stadiums  or other sports facilities.", "States\u2019 expected that SFSF uses by school districts and public IHEs would  include retaining current staff and spending on programmatic initiatives,  among other uses. Some states\u2019 fiscal condition could affect their ability to  meet maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements in order to receive SFSF  monies, but they are awaiting final guidance from Education on  procedures to obtain relief from these requirements. For example, due to  substantial revenue shortages, Florida has cut their state budget in recent  years and the state will not be able to meet the maintenance-of-effort  requirement to readily qualify for these funds. The state will apply to  Education for a waiver from this requirement; however, they are awaiting  final instructions from Education on submission of the waiver. Florida  plans to use SFSF funds to reduce the impact of any further cuts that may  be needed in the state education budget.", "In Arizona, generally, state officials expect that SFSF recipients, such as  local school districts, will use their allocations to improve the tools they  use to assess student performance and determine to what extent  performance meets federal academic standards, rehire teachers that were  let go because of prior budget cuts, retain teachers, and meet the federal  requirement that all schools have equal access to highly qualified teachers,  among other things. Funds for the state universities will help them  maintain services and staff as well as avoid tuition increases. Illinois  officials stated that the state plans to use all of the $2 billion in State Fiscal  Stabilization funds, including the 18.2 percent allowed for government  services, for K-12 and higher education activities and hopes to avert layoffs  and other cutbacks many districts and public colleges and universities are  facing in their fiscal year 2009 and 2010 budgets. State Board of Education  officials also noted that U.S. Department of Education guidance allows  school districts to use stabilization funds for education reforms, such as  prolonging school days and school years, where possible. However,  officials said that Illinois districts will focus these funds on filling budget  gaps rather than implementing projects that will require long-term  resource commitments.

As a result, school  district officials we interviewed in Newark and Trenton said they are  waiting for state officials to tell them what their allocations are for each of  the federal Recovery Act education programs. The timing of the federal  and state guidelines for these funds are important as the local schools  districts are planning their upcoming fiscal year budgets and would like to  know how the Recovery Act funds would complement their upcoming  school spending. According to the governor\u2019s chief of staff, the state  already funds local school districts with $8.8 billion in state funds, so  ensuring accountability for the use of state funds to so many school  districts is not a new challenge to the state oversight agencies. On April 1,  2009, the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance to the states on  how Recovery Act funds could be used for education. State officials are  continuing to review the guidance, and on April 16, 2009, issued guidance  to local school districts outlining each district\u2019s allocation of additional  funds made available under the Recovery Act for programs authorized  under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

For example, Michigan  plans to apply for $67 million in Recovery Act funds for crime control and  prevention activities under the Department of Justice\u2019s Edward Byrne  Memorial Justice Assistance Grants. Michigan Department of Community  Health officials told us that about $41 million of these funds will support,  among other things, state efforts to reduce the crime lab backlog, funding  for multi-jurisdictional courts, and localities\u2019 efforts regarding law  enforcement programs, community policing, and local correctional  resources. An additional $26 million in Recovery Act funds will go directly  to localities to support efforts against drug-related and violent crime.

In  Georgia, officials amended the state budget by reducing revenue  estimates, using reserves, and cutting program funding. These actions  were necessary despite the inclusion of additional Medicaid funds made  available as a result of the Recovery Act. The largest budget cuts in New  Jersey come from scaling back of state rebates of local property taxes by  $500 million, and reducing state payments to the pension funds by $895  million.", "Officials in the selected states acknowledged the Recovery Act\u2019s  contributions to easing immediate fiscal pressures but remain wary of  continued fiscal pressures likely to remain after federal assistance ends.  Officials in several states reported that their planning efforts focused on  maintaining existing services rather than creating new programs or staff  positions which could extend their state\u2019s financial liabilities beyond the  end date for Recovery Act funds. Officials generally expected to use  Recovery Act funds to fill gaps in existing programs rather than funding  new initiatives. In the midst of program budget cuts, state officials  acknowledged the challenge of ensuring that, where required to do so,  they use Recovery Act funds to supplement and not supplant current state  program funds. For example, in Arizona, programs receiving Recovery  Act funds may have a share of the state general fund reduced to help  balance the fiscal year 2010 budget, thus demonstrating the state has met  the prohibition on supplanting state funds could be a challenge.

Officials from all 16 of the selected states and the District told us  they have established or were establishing methods and processes to  separately identify (i.e., tag), monitor, track, and report on the use of the  Recovery Act funds they receive. The states and localities generally plan  on using their current accounting system for recording Recovery Act  funds, but many are adding identifiers to account codes to track recovery  act funds separately. Many said this involved adding digits to the end of  existing accounting codes for federal programs. In California for instance,  officials told us that while their plans for tracking, control, and oversight  are still evolving, they intend to rely on existing accountability  mechanisms and accounting systems, enhanced with newly created codes,  to separately track and monitor Recovery Act funds that are received by  and pass through the state. Several officials told us that the state\u2019s  accounting system should be able to track Recovery Act funds separately.", "In one state, Arizona, officials told us that state agencies will primarily be  responsible for administering, tracking, reporting on and overseeing  Recovery Act funds for their respective programs because the state  government is highly decentralized.

Under Arizona\u2019s decentralized government, some larger  agencies, and program offices within them, have their own accounting  systems that will need to code and track Recover Act funds as well. The  Arizona General Accounting Office has issued guidance to state agencies  on their responsibilities, including how they were to receive, disburse, tag  or code in their accounting systems, track separately, and to some extent  report on these federal resources.", "A concern expressed by state officials is that agencies within the state  often use different accounting software making it difficult to ensure  consistent and timely reporting. For example, Georgia officials stated that  the majority of state agencies use the same software; however, some  agencies do not use this software and others have greatly customized the  software. Similarly, officials from the Illinois Office of the Internal Auditor  said that the state is assessing an issue that could affect reporting \u2014  specifically that there are currently more than 100 separate financial  systems used throughout the Illinois state government. Furthermore,  Colorado state officials are concerned that their accounting system is  outdated and said they faced challenges in meeting federal reporting  requirements.

As a result, they may have to compile a list of Recovery  Act funding received outside of their central financial management system.

For example, in New Jersey officials  noted that certain towns and cities, as well as regional planning  organizations, can apply for and directly receive federal funds under the  terms of the Recovery Act. According to the state Inspector General, the  risk for waste, fraud and abuse increases the farther removed an  organization is from state government controls. While some state officials  said that they have statewide investigative authority, they would not be  able to readily track the funding going directly to local and regional  government organizations and nonprofits as a result of the funding  delivery and reporting requirements set up in the Recovery Act. In  addition, staff from the State Auditor\u2019s office noted that some smaller  cities and towns in New Jersey are not used to implementing guidance  from the state or federal government on how they are using program funds  and this could result in the localities reporting using funds for ineligible  purposes.", "Officials in many states expressed concern about being held accountable  for funds flowing directly from federal agencies to localities or other  recipients. For example, officials in Colorado expressed concern that they  will be held accountable for all Recovery Act funds flowing to the state,  including those funds for which they do not have oversight or even  information about, because some funds flow directly to non-state entities  within Colorado (such as school districts and transportation districts).", "Officials in some states said they would like to at least be informed about  funds provided to non-state entities in order to facilitate planning for the  use of these funds and so they can coordinate Recovery Act activities. For  example, Georgia officials do not expect to track and report on funds  going directly to localities, but would like to be informed about these  funds so that the state can coordinate with localities. They cited Recovery  Act-funded broadband initiatives and health funding to nonprofit hospitals  as areas where a lack of coordination could result in a duplication of  services or missed opportunities to leverage resources. Officials at the  Colorado Department of Public Safety told us that, because Colorado and  other states expressed interest in receiving data on localities\u2019 grant  funding, the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance in the U.S. Department of  Justice began providing data to the states on localities\u2019 funding.", "In another example, officials told us that the Ohio Administrative  Knowledge System (OAKS) will allow the state to tag Recovery Act  funding. However, they said in many cases state agencies will rely on  grantees and contractors to track the funds to their end use. Because the  state intends to code each Recovery Act funding stream separately and  recipients typically manage more than one funding stream at a time, state  officials said recipients should be able to track Recovery Act funds  separately from other funding sources. However, state and local officials  we interviewed raised concerns about the capacity of grantees and  contractors to track funds spent by sub-recipients. For example, officials  with the Ohio Department of Education said they can track Recovery Act  funds to school districts and charter schools, but they have to rely on the  recipients\u2019 financial systems to be able to track funds beyond that. An  official with the Columbus City Schools said that while they could provide  assurances that Recovery Act funds were spent in accordance with  program rules; they could not report back systematically how each federal  Recovery Act dollar was spent. Officials with the Columbus Metropolitan  Housing Authority also noted limitations in how far they could reasonably  be expected to track Recovery Act funds. They said they could track  Recovery Act dollars to specific projects but could not systematically  track funds spent by subcontractors on materials and labor. These officials  added, however, that if they required the contractors to collect this  information from their subcontractors, they would be able to report back  with great detail. Still, they said, without additional guidance from the  federal government on specific reporting requirements, they were hesitant  to specify requirements for their contractors to collect the data.", "Pennsylvania officials said that the state will rely on sub-recipients to meet  reporting requirements at the local level. Recipients and sub-recipients can  be local governments or other entities such as transit agencies. For  example, about $367 million in Recovery Act money for transit capital  assistance and fixed guideway (such as commuter rails and trolleys)  modernization was allocated directly to areas such as Philadelphia,  Pittsburgh, and Allentown. State officials also told us that the state would  not track or report Recovery Act funds that go straight from the federal  government to localities and other entities, such as public housing  authorities.", "Officials in several states indicated that either their states would not be  tracking Recovery Act funds going to the local levels or that they were  unsure how much data would be available on the use of these funds. For  example, Massachusetts officials told us that the portion of recovery funds  going directly to recipients other than Massachusetts state government  agencies, such as independent state authorities, local governments, or  other entities, will not be tracked through the Office of the Comptroller.  While state officials acknowledged that the Commonwealth lacks  authority to ensure adequate tracking of these funds, they also are  concerned about the ability of smaller entities to manage Recovery Act  funds, particularly smaller municipalities that traditionally do not receive  federal funds and who are not familiar with Massachusetts tracking and  procurement procedures, and recipients receiving significant increases in  federal funds. In order to address this concern, the state administration  introduced emergency legislation that, according to state officials,  includes a provision requiring all entities within Massachusetts that  receive Recovery Act money to provide information to the state on their  use of Recovery Act funds. Nevertheless, two large non-state government  entities we spoke with\u2014the city of Boston and the Massachusetts Bay  Transportation Authority (an independent authority responsible for the  metropolitan Boston\u2019s transit system)\u2014believe that their current systems,  with some modifications, will allow them to meet Recovery Act  requirements. For example, the city of Boston hosted the Democratic  National Convention in 2004 and officials said that their system was then  capable of segregating and tracking a sudden influx of temporary funds.", "This response was common among the selected states. For example,  officials in Florida told us that the state\u2019s accounting system will not track  the portion of Recovery Act funds that flow directly to local entities from  federal agencies. Officials in Michigan\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Office told us  that their oversight responsibilities do not include most sub-recipients that  receive direct federal funding, so any upfront safeguards to track or  ensure accountability have not been determined. Mississippi officials  also said that although special accounting codes will be added to the  Statewide Automated Accounting System in order to track the expenditure  of Recovery Act funds, the system would not track Recovery Act fund allocated directly to local and regional government organizations and  nonprofit organizations.", "In Arizona, the portion of recovery funds going directly to recipients other  than Arizona government agencies, such as independent state authorities,  local governments, or other entities, may not be tracked by the state. State  officials expressed concern that they may not be able to attest to localities\u2019  ability to tag, track, and report on Recovery Act funds when these entities  receive the moneys directly from federal agencies rather than through  state agencies. Department heads and program officials generally  expected that they could require sub-recipients receiving funds from the  state, through agreements, grant applications, and revised contract  provisions, to separately track and report Recovery Act funding. For  example, unemployment program managers said they were issuing new  intergovernmental agreements with localities to cover new reporting  requirements. However, several of the state officials did raise questions  about the ability of some local organizations to do this, such as small, rural  entities, boards or commissions, or private entities not used to doing  business with the federal government. Furthermore, several of the state  department officials acknowledged that either some state agency  information systems have data reliability problems, which will have to be  resolved, or they had sub-recipients who in the past had problems  providing timely and accurate reporting, but said that they would work  with these entities to comply, and also had sanctions to use as a last  resort.", "Officials in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and New York, also expressed  concern that the new requirement to provide reports on use of Recovery  Act funds within 10 days after a quarter ends may be challenging to meet  by both state and local entities. In some program areas, some state  officials raised concerns that the Recovery Act requirement will create  much shorter deadlines for processing financial data that local areas will  have difficultly meeting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected States\u2019 and Localities\u2019 Internal Controls and Safeguards to Manage and Mitigate the Risk of Mismanagement, Waste, Fraud, and Abuse of Recovery Act Funds", "paragraphs": ["The selected states and the District are taking various approaches to  ensure that internal controls are in place to manage risk up-front, rather  than after problems develop and deficiencies are identified after the fact,  and have different capacities to manage and oversee the use of Recovery  Act funds.

A readily available source of information on internal control  weaknesses and other risks present in the states and other jurisdictions  receiving Recovery Act funding is the Single Audit report, prepared to  meet the requirements of the Single Audit Act, as amended (Single Audit  Act) and OMB\u2019s implementing guidance in OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits  of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations. The Single  Audit Act adopted a single audit concept to help meet the needs of federal  agencies for grantee oversight and accountability as well as grantees\u2019  needs for single, uniformly structured audits. The Single Audit Act requires  states, local governments and nonprofit organizations expending over  $500,000 in federal awards in a year to obtain an audit in accordance with  requirements set forth in the Act.  A single audit consists of (1) an audit  and opinions on the fair presentation of the financial statements and the  Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA); (2) gaining an  understanding of and testing internal control over financial reporting and  the entity\u2019s compliance with laws, regulations, and contract or grant  provisions that have a direct and material effect on certain federal  programs (i.e., the program requirements), and (3) an audit and an  opinion on compliance with applicable program requirements for certain  federal programs. The audit report also includes the auditor\u2019s schedule of  findings and questioned costs, and the auditee\u2019s corrective action plans  and a summary of prior audit findings that includes planned and  completed corrective actions. Auditors are also required to report on  significant deficiencies in internal control and on compliance associated  with the audit of the financial statements.", "For example, in California, the most recent single audit conducted by the  State Auditor for fiscal year 2007 identified 81 material weaknesses, 27 of  which were associated with programs we reviewed for purposes of this  report. The State Auditor plans to use past audit results to target state  agencies and programs with a high number and history of problems,  including data reliability concerns, and is closely coordinating with us on  these efforts. For example, the fiscal year 2007 State Single Audit Report  identified 8 material weaknesses pertaining to the ESEA Title I program  and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act programs. The audit  findings included a material weakness in the California Department of  Education\u2019s management of cash because it disbursed funds without  assurances from LEAs that the time between the receipt and disbursement  of federal funds was minimized, contrary to federal guidelines. Education  officials told us that they have addressed some of these material  weaknesses and, in other cases, they are still working to correct them. If  these and other material weaknesses are not corrected, they may affect  the state\u2019s ability to appropriately manage certain Recovery Act funds. The  State Auditor\u2019s Office told us that it is in the process of finalizing the fiscal  year 2007 State Single Audit Report and plans to issue the report within  the next 30 days. In addition, the State Auditor\u2019s Office is summarizing the  results of the single audit to identify those programs that continue to have  material weaknesses. Finally, the State Auditor\u2019s Office plans to use the  results of other audits it has conducted in conjunction with the single  audit to develop its approach for determining the state\u2019s readiness to  receive the large influx of federal funds and comply with the requirement  regarding the use of those funds under the Recovery Act.", "Arizona\u2019s fiscal year 2007 Single Audit report identified a number of  material weaknesses related to the state Department of Education. The  report identified a material weakness involving IDEA where the state  department had not reviewed sub-recipients to ensure that federal awards  were used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations,  and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements. The Audit report also  identified one financial reporting material weaknesses related to the state  Department of Administration\u2019s ability to prepare timely financial  statements, including its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).  In fiscal year 2007, the CAFR was issued in June 2008, approximately 6  months after the scheduled deadline. According to the Auditor General\u2019s  Office, the fiscal year 2008 CAFR will also be completed late as the last  agency submitted its financial statement on March 9, 2008. According to  the Auditor General\u2019s Office, this control deficiency affects the timeliness  of financial reporting which affects the needs of users.

Control activities for states and localities consist of the  policies, procedures, and guidance that enforce management\u2019s directives  and achieve effective internal control over specific program activities.  Examples of such policies and procedures particularly relevant to the  Recovery Act spending are (1) proper execution and accurate and timely  recording of transactions and events, (2) controls to help ensure  compliance with program requirements, (3) establishment and review of  performance measures and indicators, and (4) appropriate documentation  of transactions and internal control.", "Documented policies, procedures and guidance that are effectively  implemented will be critical tools for states and localities management and  staff as well as program recipients for achieving good management of  Recovery Act programs.

Under the current approach for  risk determination in accordance with Circular No. A-133, certain risks  unique to the Recovery Act programs may not receive full consideration.  Recovery Act funding carries with it some unique challenges.

Massachusetts officials explained that the oversight  community is facing budget cuts of about 10 percent at a time when  increased oversight and accountability is critically needed. To illustrate  the impact of the impending budget situation, the Inspector General stated  that his department does not have the resources to conduct any additional  oversight related to Recovery Act funds.

While Georgia is waiting on further federal guidance, the state is  adapting an existing system (used by the State Auditor to fulfill its Single  Audit Act responsibilities) to help the state report on Recovery Act funds.  The statewide web-based system will be used to track expenditures,  project status, and job creation and retention. The Georgia governor is  requiring all state agencies and programs receiving Recovery Act funds to  use this system. Some states indicated that they have not yet determined  how they will assess impact.", "Preserving existing jobs and stimulating job creation and promoting  economic recovery are among the Recovery Act\u2019s key objectives.

Officials  from several of the states we met with expressed a need for clearer  definitions of \u201cjobs retained\u201d and \u201cjobs created.\u201d Officials from a few states  expressed the need for clarification on how to track indirect jobs, while  others expressed concern about how to measure the impact of funding  that is not designed to create jobs. Mississippi state officials suggested the  need for a clearly defined distinction for time-limited, part-time, full-time,  and permanent jobs; since each state may have differing definitions of  these two categories. Officials from Massachusetts expressed concern that  contractors may overestimate the number of jobs retained and created.  Some existing programs, such as highway construction, have  methodologies for estimating job creation.

The Iowa Department of  Transportation tracks the number of worker hours by highway project on  the basis of contractor reports and will use these reports to estimate jobs  created. In New Jersey, state and local agencies will collect or estimate  data on the number of jobs created or retained as a result of Recovery Act  funds in different ways. For example, the Newark Housing Authority will  use payroll data to keep track of the exact number of union tradesmen and  housing authority residents employed to turn damaged vacant units into  rentable ones.

State officials envision that funds made available as a  result of the Recovery Act will be used to support program budgets that  had been reduced in the state\u2019s efforts to balance the budget. Arizona has  about $7 billion in its General Fund with a current budget of about $10  billion. State officials are working to close a budget gap of about $1.3  billion for fiscal year 2008, an estimated budget gap of about $2.1 billion  for state fiscal year 2009 and about $2.8 billion for fiscal year 2010 through  reductions and other strategies. These strategies were limited to some  extent, because voter propositions protect major programs from  significant cuts, including Medicaid, education, and corrections, meaning  other programs must absorb the cuts. The state\u2019s budget imbalance has  been complicated by lower-than-anticipated revenues. For example, state  fiscal year 2009 revenue is significantly lower than estimated and has left  the state unable to support previously approved spending levels. Arizona\u2019s  Budget Office has estimated its future revenues and expenditures for each  fiscal year through 2014. It projects an increasing deficit in each fiscal  year, from $2.1 billion in 2009 to $4.1 billion in 2014, a situation which  most likely would mean continued cuts. The state\u2019s Budget Stabilization  Fund, known as its \u201crainy day\u201d fund\u2014a reserve fund built up during more  favorable economic conditions to be used during difficult economic  times\u2014has been depleted.", "As of April 13, 2009, decisions about finalizing the fiscal year 2010 budget  were still in flux in part because Governor Brewer\u2014only in office since  January after the former Governor, Janet Napolitano, became Secretary of  the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2014has not issued a formal  budget proposal. The Governor recognized that further reductions in  government services may be necessary to help close the significant deficit  between state revenues and expenditures. Given this, in early March, the  Governor certified that the state would accept the funds made available by  the Recovery Act and use certain funds to create jobs and promote  economic growth within the state. Because of the state\u2019s economic and  budgetary challenges, some state agency and local officials we met with  expected to use the funds as they had been using them under their existing  programs and did not expect to use Recovery Act funding on new  initiatives. They also were confident recipients had sufficient critical uses  for the funds and could use them immediately.", "However, state officials expressed concerns that using Recovery Act funds  to make longer term operational and program commitments would mean  higher future state spending that would not be sustainable once Recovery  Act funds were no longer available, given the state of the economy. As a  result, officials from one state agency explained that they are advising  subrecipients to spend their funds on shorter term projects. Furthermore,  with program budgets being cut to help relieve fiscal pressures, some state  officials have said it may be challenging to ensure compliance with  provisions requiring certain Recovery Act funds to be used to supplement  and not supplant FY 2010 program funds. Officials with the state  Department of Education, however, had one concern about passing the  supplanting test. They said that it was unclear whether states could treat  Recovery Act funds provided under the fiscal stabilization program as  \u201cstate\u201d funds versus \u201cfederal\u201d funds. If they could use the funds as state  resources, they would be able to meet the supplanting restrictions, but if  not, they would have serious challenges in complying, jeopardizing the use  of the funds. On the other hand, some state officials and program  managers did not think it would be difficult to demonstrate they were not  supplanting state funds in part because state funding for the programs had  already been cut so significantly\u2014in other words, there were few state  funds to supplant. For example, they did not think it would be difficult to  show that activities supported with Recovery Act resources, such as  keeping teachers, could only be accomplished with federal support.", "One issue raised by officials in the Office of the Governor and within some  state and local program offices was covering the costs to oversee and  track the use of the Recovery Act funds, given past budget cuts, staff  reductions, and increasing workloads\u2014for example, increasing numbers  of unemployed individuals who want services. These officials noted that  their service delivery capacity will be challenged to administer funds  flowing into eligible programs. Some of the officials wondered what  flexibility they had to use some of the Recovery Act funds to cover  administrative costs. On the other hand, some state agency officials said  that they expected to be able to oversee and track Recovery Act funds  with existing resources because funding to current programs that had  administrative processes in place would be increased.

State officials we spoke with noted that they do  not foresee that it will be difficult to track Recovery Act funds separately  from other funds. However, an official in the state Department of  Economic Security noted that the Recovery Act funds will stress the  tracking and reporting capacity of the financial management systems they  use because the systems are old, are not very flexible, and were not  designed for these purposes. The official said that the systems must be  enhanced to provide the capacity needed for Recovery Act funds and that  they are working to design a solution for this problem.", "Department heads and program officials generally expect that they will  require subrecipients, through agreements, grant applications, and revised  contract provisions, to track and report Recovery Act funding separately.  For example, unemployment program managers said they were issuing  new intergovernmental agreements with localities to cover new reporting  requirements. However, several of the state officials raised questions  about the tracking and reporting abilities of some local organizations, such  as small, rural entities, boards or commissions, or private entities not used  to doing business with the federal government. Furthermore, several of the  state department officials acknowledged that either some state agency  information systems have data reliability problems that will have to be  resolved, or they had subrecipients that in the past had problems  providing timely and accurate reporting, but said that they would work  with these entities to comply, and also had sanctions to use as a last  resort. Furthermore, state officials expressed some concern that the new  requirement to provide financial reports on subrecipients\u2019 use of funds  within 10 days after a quarter ends may be challenging to meet by both  state and local entities, because they may not have actual data in time to  meet this reporting time frame.", "Finally, the state may lack the ability to track the portion of Recovery Act  funds going directly to recipients other than Arizona government agencies,  such as independent state authorities, local governments, or other entities.

These controls and techniques include submitting  financial and performance reports for review, as well as conducting  supervisory and compliance reviews, on-site inspections, external audits,  and audits by the state Auditor General. Although Arizona is largely  decentralized\u2014state agencies and localities have responsibility for  monitoring and are accountable for their respective Recovery Act funds\u2014 the state executives are reaching out to the state agencies to help ensure  they are ready. For example, the state budget director met with the heads  of the programs potentially receiving Recovery Act funds to gauge each  program\u2019s preparedness. In addition, a number of state agencies were  conducting or had plans to conduct meetings, training, and outreach to  funding recipients to help them understand the goals and objectives of the  act and their responsibilities for managing the funding it would provide.  Similarly, in early April 2009, the state\u2019s General Accounting Office  released a technical bulletin, the purpose of which was to establish  consistent policies and procedures that all state agencies receiving  Recovery Act funds must \u201cimmediately implement in order to effectively  manage activities under the act.\u201d A senior official in the state comptroller\u2019s  office said that office plans to conduct a survey to inventory current  internal controls at state agencies to help ensure controls are in place to  limit the risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of Recovery Act  funds.", "Several risks still to be addressed have been identified as a result of using  audits as an internal control. For example, Arizona\u2019s fiscal year 2007 Single  Audit report identified a number of material weaknesses related to the  state Department of Education. The report identified a material weakness  involving IDEA in which the state department had not reviewed  subrecipients to ensure that federal awards were used for authorized  purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of  contracts or grant agreements. The audit report also identified one  financial reporting material weakness related to the state Department of  Administration\u2019s ability to prepare timely financial statements, including  its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). This is mostly  because many of the larger state agencies maintain separate accounting  systems and submit financial data to the Department of Administration for  inclusion in its consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2007, the  CAFR was issued in June 2008, approximately 6 months after the  scheduled deadline. According to the Auditor General\u2019s Office, the fiscal  year 2008 CAFR will also be completed late, as the last agency submitted  its financial statement on March 9, 2008. According to the Auditor  General\u2019s Office, this control deficiency affects the timeliness of financial  reporting, which affects the needs of users. It is especially important that  Arizona try to address the timeliness issue with regard to financial  statements given the number and strict reporting timelines that are  imposed on the state under the Recovery Act. For most of the other  programs, managers stated that they had no outstanding material  weaknesses and that any past weaknesses had been brought into  compliance.", "According to state officials, another area of risk that the state agency is  trying to manage is that some Recovery Act funds, particularly in the  transportation area, are reimbursable, meaning that either ADOT or  localities will have to spend funds from their own budgets until they are  reimbursed by Recovery Act funds. Because of the state\u2019s challenging  financial situation, it may be a challenge for some state and local  government entities to spend the funds up front with the limited cash they  have on hand. This is particularly true for rural transit projects. According  to an ADOT official, to address this risk, they are vetting applications for  rural transit funds closely, with an eye toward granting funds only to those  localities that have shown they have the cash on hand to pay up front for  the costs of the rural transit projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Agencies and Localities Will Continue or Enhance Current Monitoring Techniques to Oversee Recovery Act Funds, but in Some Cases, Reduced Resources Could Pose Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Representatives of a number of state executive offices, state agencies, and  select localities reported that they would at a minimum continue to  monitor Recovery Act funding as they had monitored federal funding  provided to these same programs in the past.

In addition, some individual state departments do not  use the COFRS grant module and therefore must manually post aggregate  revenue and expenditure data to COFRS. Consequently, given the state\u2019s  current capabilities, data on total Recovery Act funding received by the  state may not be able to be drawn from COFRS and may have to be  compiled through a manual exercise outside of the central financial  management system, raising internal control concerns among some  officials we talked with. These concerns include inadequate audit  documentation on how the information is compiled, potential human error  in inputting and aggregating information, and potentially inconsistent or  duplicative reporting from various agencies on the extent and nature of  Recovery Act funding received and used.

Officials wondered, for example, whether the state would be required to  report centrally on all funds coming through the state or whether state  agencies will report as normal through federal departments, or both; what  the frequency and form of reports will be; and the level to which funds will  need to be tracked and reported (e.g., at the recipient level, subrecipient  level, etc.).

In addition, it will report on a set of  new performance measures being developed by the federal Department of  Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance. Department of Public Safety officials  are concerned about the timing of reporting job creation and retention  data, however, because the Recovery Act requires states to report 10  calendar days after the end of each quarter, which is faster than the  normal reporting time frames and, according to officials, will necessitate  that recipients report to the department within 5 calendar days of the end  of the quarter.

However, because specific program  cuts were not determined, identifying the preserved programs and their  economic effects is impossible. While some state departments have  received guidance on counting jobs created or retained, officials from at  least one local department said they needed more guidance about how to  measure the number of new jobs created. Another official said that her  department will report jobs created or retained but questioned how  indirect jobs would be counted. According to this official, spending  Recovery Act funds to purchase items such as equipment or vehicles will  have substantial economic effects, particularly the creation of indirect  jobs, but she was not certain how these jobs would be counted and asked  whether clarification would come through Office of Management and  Budget or other guidance.

The amount of federal assistance states receive for  Medicaid service expenditures is known as the Federal Medical Assistance  Percentage (FMAP). Across states, the FMAP may range from 50 percent  to no more than 83 percent, with poorer states receiving a higher federal  matching rate than wealthier states. The Recovery Act provides eligible  states with an increased FMAP for 27 months between October 1, 2008,  and December 31, 2010. On February 25, 2009, CMS made increased  FMAP grant awards to states, and states may retroactively claim  reimbursement for expenditures that occurred prior to the effective date  of the Recovery Act. Generally, for fiscal year 2009 through the first  quarter of fiscal year 2011, the increased FMAP, which is calculated on a  quarterly basis, provides for (1) the maintenance of states\u2019 prior year  FMAPs; (2) a general across-the-board increase of 6.2 percentage points in  states\u2019 FMAPs; and (3) a further increase to the FMAPs for those states  that have a qualifying increase in unemployment rates. The increased  FMAP available under the Recovery Act is for state expenditures for  Medicaid services. However, the receipt of this increased FMAP may  reduce the funds that states must use for their Medicaid programs, and  states have reported using these available funds for a variety of purposes.", "For the first two quarters of 2009, Iowa\u2019s FMAP rate was 68.82 percent, a  7.09 percentage point increase over fiscal year 2008. Iowa has received  increased FMAP grant awards of $136 million for fiscal year 2009, and, as  of April 15, 2009, Iowa had drawn down $86 million in increased FMAP  grant awards, which is about 63 percent of its awards to date. Iowa  officials indicated they will use funds made available as a result of the  increased FMAP to cover increased caseloads, maintain existing  populations of recipients, avoid cuts to eligibility, and maintain current  levels of benefits. In addition, such funds will provide Iowa officials with  the means to offset budget shortfalls, including shortfalls for the state\u2019s  Medicaid program. Iowa officials indicated that they expect the recession  to continue longer for the state than for the nation as a whole, and if the  increased FMAP funds are not available for all of federal fiscal year 2011,  the resulting deficit will likely be addressed through the use of reserve  funds or cuts in program funding.

Iowa\u2019s Governor certified that the state would \u201cmaintain its efforts\u201d for  Department of Transportation programs funded under the Recovery Act.  However, Iowa noted in its certification that transportation spending  would be influenced by the difference in the definition of the word  \u201cexpend\u201d for different covered programs; the uncertainty of the amount  collected from state user fees to fund the programs; and variables (such as  weather) that may affect the state\u2019s timeline for spending Recovery Act  transportation funds.", "Within 3 days of the enactment of the Recovery Act, the Iowa Department  of Transportation competitively awarded contracts for 19 highway and  bridge projects valued at about $56 million. Contracts were awarded for  projects such as bridge replacements and highway resurfacing\u2014shovel- ready projects that could be initiated and completed quickly. As of April  15, 2009, Iowa had competitively awarded a total of 25 contracts valued at  $168 million, or 47 percent of the Recovery Act funds apportioned. As of  April 16, 2009, the U.S. Department of Transportation had obligated $221.2  million for 107 Iowa projects. According to Iowa transportation officials,  the agency could begin spending Recovery Act funds quickly because it  maintained an inventory of shovel-ready projects and its accounting  system needed few changes to track the projects.", "U.S. Department of Education State Fiscal Stabilization Fund: The  Recovery Act created a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF), to be  administered by the U.S. Department of Education. The SFSF provides  funds to states to help avoid reductions in education and other essential  public services. The initial award of SFSF funding requires each state to  submit an application to the U.S. Department of Education that assures,  among other things, that it will take actions to meet certain educational  requirements, such as increasing teacher effectiveness and addressing  inequities in the distribution of highly qualified teachers.", "On April 2, Iowa was allocated $316 million for the education portion of  the SFSF.

In April, the Governor proposed using almost 82 percent  of this amount, or $386 million, to support elementary, secondary, and  higher education, as required. These funds will be used for activities such  as updating standards and implementing a new data system. For the  remaining 18 percent of the SFSF allocation, or $86 million, the Governor  proposes to fund universities and community colleges, law enforcement,  and corrections in fiscal year 2010.

The federal government  matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a formula  based on each state\u2019s per capita income in relation to the national average  per capita income. The amount of federal assistance states receive for  Medicaid service expenditures is known as the Federal Medical Assistance  Percentage (FMAP). Across states, the FMAP may range from 50 percent  to no more than 83 percent, with poorer states receiving a higher federal  matching rate than wealthier states. The Recovery Act provides eligible  states with an increased FMAP for 27 months between October 1, 2008,  and December 31, 2010. On February 25, 2009, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) made increased FMAP grant awards to states,  and states may retroactively claim reimbursement for expenditures that  occurred prior to the effective date of the Recovery Act. Generally, for  federal fiscal year 2009 through the first quarter of federal fiscal year 2011,  the increased FMAP, which is calculated on a quarterly basis, provides for  (1) the maintenance of states\u2019 prior year FMAPs; (2) a general across-the- board increase of 6.2 percentage points in states\u2019 FMAPs; and (3) a further  increase to the FMAPs for those states that have a qualifying increase in  unemployment rates. The increased FMAP available under the Recovery  Act is for state expenditures for Medicaid services. However, the receipt of  this increased FMAP may reduce the funds that states must use for their  Medicaid programs, and states have reported using these available funds  for a variety of purposes.", "As of April 1, 2009, Pennsylvania has drawn down $330.8 million in  increased FMAP grant awards, which is almost 32 percent of its awards to  date.

State  officials also noted that such funds are allowing them to forgo reductions  that they otherwise would have had to make because state funding  streams are smaller this year. For example, Pennsylvania officials  indicated that the state's share for Medicaid expenditures is 20 percent of  their state revenues; thus this funding fluctuates as the economy rises and  falls. Funding made available as a result of the increased FMAP will also  be used to offset the state\u2019s general fund deficit and to help ensure that the  Medicaid prompt payment requirements are met.

The federal government  matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a formula  based on each state\u2019s per capita income in relation to the national average  per capita income. The amount of federal assistance states receive for  Medicaid service expenditures is known as the Federal Medical Assistance  Percentage (FMAP). Across states, the FMAP may range from 50 to no  more than 83 percent, with poorer states receiving a higher federal  matching rate than wealthier states. The Recovery Act provides eligible  states with an increased FMAP for 27 months between October 1, 2008,  and December 31, 2010. On February 25, 2009, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) made increased FMAP grant awards to states,  and states may retroactively claim reimbursement for expenditures that  occurred prior to the effective date of the Recovery Act. Generally, for  federal fiscal year 2009 through the first quarter of federal fiscal year 2011,  the increased FMAP, which is calculated on a quarterly basis, provides for  (1) the maintenance of states\u2019 prior year FMAPs, (2) a general across-the- board increase of 6.2 percentage points in states\u2019 FMAPs, and (3) a further  increase to the FMAPs for those states that have a qualifying increase in  unemployment rates. The increased FMAP available under the Recovery  Act is for state expenditures for Medicaid services. However, the receipt of  the increased FMAP may reduce the funds that states must use for their  Medicaid programs, and states have reported using these available funds  for a variety of purposes.", "As of April 1, 2009, Texas had drawn down $665,665,000, or 46 percent, of  its initial increased FMAP grant awards of $1,448,824,000 in FMAP funds.  Texas officials commented that the funds made available as a result of the  increased FMAP will allow the state to maintain the program\u2019s level of  service and eligibility standards and cover increased caseloads, among  other uses. Texas officials indicated that guidance from CMS is needed  regarding whether certain programmatic changes being considered by  Texas, such as a possible extension of the program\u2019s eligibility period,  would affect the state\u2019s eligibility for increased FMAP funds.", "Transportation\u2014Highway Infrastructure Investment: The Recovery  Act provides additional funds for highway infrastructure investment using  the rules and structure of the existing Federal-Aid Highway Surface  Transportation Program, which apportions money to states to construct  and maintain eligible highways and for other surface transportation  projects.

The initial award of SFSF funding requires each  state to submit an application to Education that assures, among other  things, it will take actions to meet certain educational requirements such  as increasing teacher effectiveness and addressing inequities in the  distribution of highly qualified teachers.", "Texas\u2019 initial SFSF allocation is $2,662,203,000. According to Texas  officials, the state generally plans to use its SFSF allocation to assist in  continuing the historical levels of support for elementary, secondary, and  higher education in the state. In April 2009, officials from the Office of the  Governor informed us that the state was in the process of preparing its  application for submission to the U.S. Department of Education\u2014and that  the application would reflect the fact that providing funding for public  education is a priority in the state. The officials noted that the state\u2019s  application likely would not be submitted until the state legislature (which  is in session until June 1, 2009) has finalized an appropriation for  elementary, secondary, and higher education. Also, the officials  commented that the state was awaiting further federal guidance on the  appropriate use of Recovery Act funds. Generally, however, Texas  Education Agency officials said that the federal funds could be used, for  example, to support efforts related to high-quality assessment  performance in schools, teacher incentives, and teacher equity. Also,  according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, public  institutions of higher education in Texas anticipate expending Recovery  Act funds for three purposes\u2014mitigating tuition and fee increases;  supporting modernization, repair, and renovation of facilities; and  providing incentive funding based on degrees awarded. To provide  tracking and oversight of the Recovery Act funds, board officials  commented that existing systems for implementing policies for  accountability, internal controls, compliance, and reporting would be  leveraged to the maximum extent possible to avoid the administrative  burden associated with creating a completely new system.

An illustration of such  avoidance involves unemployment insurance. While the Texas Governor  accepted some Recovery Act funds for unemployment insurance, he did  not request Unemployment Insurance Modernization funds because the  Governor believed that receiving those funds would place additional tax  burdens on businesses, which would impede job creation and hamper the  economy.", "Even though Texas generally continues to fare better economically than  most states, nearly all available data suggest that the Texas economy is in  recession, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas.

The co-chairs further noted that the state legislature should  prudently plan on having a reasonable reserve in the state\u2019s economic  stabilization fund so that the state does not face a large deficit in the next  biennium, ending August 31, 2011. In response to the co-chairs\u2019 request for  ways to reduce spending in fiscal year 2009, state agencies identified  approximately $396 million in potential budget reductions based on hiring  freezes, reduced services, delayed capital purchases, and other cost- cutting efforts. At the time of their request, the co-chairs noted that the  Recovery Act\u2014which was being debated in Washington, D.C.\u2014could not  responsibly be factored into the state\u2019s budget process because many  details were not known.", "In discussions with our review team in March 2009, representatives of the  Office of the Lieutenant Governor commented that because of Recovery  Act funds, state agencies were not required to implement the 2.5 percent  spending reductions anticipated for state fiscal year 2009 and, further, the  state did not have to tap into its rainy day fund. The representatives told us  that absent the availability of Recovery Act funds, state agencies likely  would have been asked to make cuts of about 10 percent for the fiscal  2010-2011 biennium budget, in addition to the state drawing upon the rainy  day fund.", "On the other hand, officials representing the Office of the Governor  commented that budget deficit situations do not necessarily result in the  state using its rainy day fund. The officials stressed that\u2014to meet the  requirement to pass a balanced budget\u2014a variety of other solutions could  be considered, such as budget reallocations among state agencies and  programs, as well as spending cuts. As an example, these officials noted  that even though the state\u2019s overall budget was reduced in 2003, the state  raised education spending by $1 billion that year.

Also, after the Recovery  Act passed, the Office of the Governor began hosting regularly scheduled  meetings (twice weekly) of a Stimulus Working Group comprising  representatives of major state agencies to help ensure statewide  communication of the need for accountability and transparency regarding  Recovery Act funds. Similarly, a periodic forum of the internal audit staff  of Texas state agencies serves as another means of statewide  communication. Also, in March 2009, the Office of the Comptroller of  Public Accounts scheduled training regarding federal awards and financial  statements\u2014training that included representatives from the Office of the  Governor to discuss Recovery Act funds.

Based on its  experience in auditing Texas\u2019 use of previous federal awards and reporting  internal control deficiencies or material weaknesses, the State Auditor\u2019s  Office noted that relatively high risks generally can be anticipated with  certain types of programs\u2014such as (1) new programs with completely  new processes and internal controls, (2) programs that lack clear guidance  on allowable uses of Recovery Act funds, (3) programs that distribute  significant amounts of funds to local governments or boards, and (4)  programs that rely on subrecipients for internal controls and monitoring.  The State Auditor\u2019s Office also noted that general economic stability and  public education programs are considered to be high risk because they are  new programs and federal guidance regarding the state\u2019s appropriate use  of the funds the funds is uncertain. The State Auditor\u2019s Office further  noted that highway construction and workforce programs are also high  risk because funds flow through contractors or to local entities,  respectively.", "Officials from Office of the Governor acknowledged that there are  inherent risks associated with large, complex programs as well as  programs that involve a large number of contracts and rely on  subrecipients. However, the officials emphasized that Texas has  experience in monitoring these types of programs, and officials noted that  state agencies have controls in place to mitigate these risks. Regarding the  Medicaid program, for example, the officials noted that in 2003, the  Governor appointed an Inspector General for the Texas Health and Human  Services Commission and charged the Inspector General with monitoring  and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. Also, the officials noted that the  state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office has a Medicaid Fraud Investigation Unit.", "The Texas State Auditor\u2019s Office made a recommendation regarding the  monitoring of subrecipients for risk in its most recent audit of the Texas  Education Agency. The audit report did not find that subrecipients were  improperly spending federal funds or were not meeting federal  requirements; however, the report did note, however, that the agency had  \u201ca limited number of resources available to monitor fiscal compliance.\u201d  The audit report recommended that the Texas Education Agency continue  to add resources, within its budget constraints, to increase its monitoring  of federal fiscal compliance performed. According to the State Auditor\u2019s  Office, following the audit in February 2009, the Texas Education Agency  created a comprehensive correction plan, which the agency is  implementing to address this resource issue.", "After the Recovery Act was enacted, the Texas Education Agency  announced in March 2009 that it was creating a task force on federal  stimulus and stabilization to coordinate the agency\u2019s plans. Also in March  2009, the agency reported that it had established new accounting codes for  tracking Recovery Act funds. Furthermore, the agency indicated that its  application guidance for the temporary funding would specify that (1)  grantees are expected to expend funds in ways that do not result in  unsustainable continuing commitments after the funding expires and (2)  the funds must be separately tracked and monitored.", "Generally, state officials recognized that a potential vulnerability can be  associated with significant increases in funding levels. An example is the  weatherization assistance program. As noted in table 1, of the estimated  $1.2 billion in Recovery Act funds to be used for housing and  infrastructure programs in Texas, weatherization assistance is the largest  component program in terms of funding ($327 million). This funding level  represents about a 25-fold increase over the estimated annual amount ($13  million) that existed before the Recovery Act, according to Texas  Department of Housing and Community Affairs data. Tentatively, the  department indicated that its program implementation plan will include  using an existing network of 34 weatherization assistance program  providers (e.g., various community action entities) as well as awarding  other contracts to cities with populations over 75,000. Under the program,  subrecipients have 2 years to fully expend the weatherization funding.

The District plans to use these Recovery Act funds in accordance with the  U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Guidance Letter Number 14-08. This guidance  states that it is the intent of the Recovery Act that WIA adult funds be used  to provide the necessary services to substantially increase the number of  adults to support their entry or reentry into the job market, and that WIA  dislocated worker funds be used to provide the necessary services to  dislocated workers to support their reentry into the recovering job market.
