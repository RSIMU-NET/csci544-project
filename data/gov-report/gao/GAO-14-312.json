To insulate the Trust from political influence over its investment decisions, the Trust was established independent of the federal government. It is exempted from the federal law that governs the financial operations of the U.S. government and which establishes the duties and powers of the GAO.

The Trust has also commissioned four external performance audits since its creation\u2014the first in 2004 and the most recent in 2012. These reviews have encompassed a wide range of issues, including the accuracy of monthly reports, compliance with Trust investment manager hiring policies, processes to ensure accuracy of financial recordkeeping and internal controls, adequacy of due diligence procedures, and the role of non-traditional investments.", "Performance audit practices of comparable entities can differ from the Trust in scope and frequency. The large majority of state pension plans and two federal programs GAO reviewed that manage investment assets are subject to performance audits that can be initiated and conducted by an external entity, and some of these audits have addressed issues Trust-commissioned audits have not included. Forty-two of the 50 state plans GAO contacted are subject to performance audits that can be initiated and conducted by an external auditor, such as state Auditors General or equivalent, or by offices of internal audit. In some cases, the external auditor reviews the plan annually, while in others, plans are audited less frequently. Both federal programs\u2014the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's single-employer insurance program and the Thrift Savings Plan\u2014are also subject to externally initiated and conducted performance audits. State and federal audits varied in subject and scope, and in some cases, examined issues that Trust-commissioned reviews have not yet included, such as ethics and conflict of interest policies. Experts told GAO that Trust performance audit practices are comparable to those of large private sector plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.", "Based on our review of oversight models that apply to state plans and other information, GAO developed several options to enhance the Trust's performance audit practices, and stakeholders identified potential advantages and limitations pertaining to them. For example, the Board's Office of Inspector General (OIG) could be granted authority to conduct performance audits, which would help ensure these reviews are initiated and performed independent of the Trust. However, both Board and Trust officials had reservations about this option, stating that the OIG lacks sufficient expertise in aspects of the Trust investment program, and expressing concerns about what they perceive as an unconstructive working relationship. The Trust's practice of commissioning periodic performance audits could be established as a formal requirement, either through a memorandum of agreement between the key parties, or through a statutory amendment, with external input on subject and scope of the audits. Trust and Board officials stated that this would be a reasonable option, and in early 2014 developed an initial proposal to implement such an agreement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["This report makes no recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (Trust) is responsible  for investing and overseeing about $25 billion in federal assets used to  pay benefits to retired railroad workers through the railroad retirement  program managed by the Railroad Retirement Board (Board).

What performance audit policies and practices exist for the oversight  of the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (Trust)?  2.  What performance audit policies apply to comparable organizations,  such as large state public pension plans?  3.  What options, if any, could be pursued to improve Trust performance  audit policies and what tradeoffs do stakeholders believe such options  entail?", "To answer the first question, we interviewed representatives of the Board,  the Railroad Retirement Board Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the  Trust, including officials who were intimately involved in creation of the  Trust. We also reviewed relevant federal law, regulations, and legislative  histories, the Trust\u2019s written policies and publications\u2014including annual  reports and audit reports\u2014and related publications of other federal  agencies such as the Social Security Administration. To answer the  second question, we interviewed officials of large public retirement plans  in each of the 50 states, and conducted in-depth case studies of seven  large state plans.officials, such as the Executive Director of the largest plan or investment  entity, and representatives of state auditors general or comparable entity  with authority to audit or otherwise review state plans.

We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Trust was established by statute as a tax-exempt entity to manage  and invest the assets used to pay a portion of Railroad Retirement  Program benefits. Congress anticipated that the Trust would be managed  much like a private sector pension plan trust.seven trustees that, like trustees of multiemployer plans established   The Trust is governed by  through collective bargaining, include representatives of both  management and labor. Three of the trustees are selected by railroad  management, three by railroad labor, and one independent trustee is  selected by the other six. The Trust may invest Trust assets in stocks,  bonds and other investment vehicles in a manner similar to other defined  benefit (DB) plans. While the Trust is not subject to the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which governs private  sector pension plans, its trustees are subject to fiduciary standards  comparable to the fiduciary duties under ERISA. For example, each  member of the Board of Trustees must act solely in the interests of the  Board and, thereby, plan participants and beneficiaries; for the exclusive  purpose of providing plan benefits and defraying administrative costs;  with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent person familiar  with such matters would use; and diversify investments to minimize the  risk of large losses and avoid disproportionate influence over any industry  or firm. As of September 2013, the Trust held about $25 billion in  assets, placing it among the 50 largest DB plan trusts in the nation as of  2013. Trust assets consist mostly of equity and fixed income  investments, but also include substantial assets allocated to alternative  investments such as private equity, absolute return strategies, and  commodities. From 2003 through 2013, according to a Trust  representative, the Trust has had an average annual return on investment  of about 6.4 percent. However, along with other plans, the Trust also  suffered substantial investment losses during the financial crisis of 2008  and 2009. The Trust lost 19 percent in 2008 alone and suffered much  lower losses in 2009 and 2011.", "The Trust operates in coordination with the Board, a federal agency  established in 1937 to provide old-age pensions to retired employees of  the nation\u2019s railroads. In 2013, the Board oversaw the payment of about  $11.6 billion in retirement and survivor benefits to about 568,000  beneficiaries. The Board pays two types of benefits to retired workers and  their spouses, which are funded through federal payroll taxes assessed  on private railroads and their employees. Tier I benefits are calculated to  be comparable to Social Security benefits, for which railroad retirees  generally are not eligible. The Board also pays Tier II benefits, which  are intended to provide a benefit similar to that of a DB plan. Benefits  under Tier II are based on a worker\u2019s 5 years of highest earnings and the  number of years spent in railroad employment. Assets not needed for  immediate payment of Tier II benefits are invested by the Trust in  accordance with its investment policy.", "The legislation creating the Trust includes language making it clear that  the Trust is not part of the federal government. Specifically, the Trust is  not a department, agency, or instrumentality of the federal government,  and it is exempted from title 31 of the U.S. Code which governs the  financial operations of the federal government and establishes the powers   In addition, the  and duties of the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Board is not represented on the Board of Trustees because the Board is  a federal agency. However, as required by law, an independent qualified  public accountant audits the Trust\u2019s financial statements each year. It  has been reported that these aspects of the Trust stemmed from  concerns about government involvement in investment decisions that  were repeatedly raised in Congress and elsewhere. It was reportedly  feared, for example, that politically motivated investment decisions would  lead to suboptimal investment returns and would provide political  advantages to those influencing the decisions. Concerns about this  \u201cpolitical risk\u201d were of particular concern because the partial privatization  of the much larger Social Security Trust Fund was a prominent public  policy issue at the time. These concerns led to a desire to eliminate  even the appearance of possible political influence and significantly  influenced the Trust\u2019s current structure.", "While the Trust manages the pool of assets in a manner similar to that of  a private or public sector traditional DB plan, it also differs significantly  from such plans in certain ways. As figure 1 illustrates, the Trust\u2019s role is  important but relatively narrow\u2014its sole purpose is to manage and  oversee the assets used to ensure payment of Tier II railroad retirement  benefits. The Board assumes various other responsibilities of a DB  pension plan, such as keeping track of benefit accruals and ensuring  benefit payments. As a result, the Trust is a relatively small organization  compared to the Board and pension plans of comparable size. While the  Trust employs about 18 staff, the Board, which has many other duties\u2014 including unemployment and sickness benefit programs\u2014and regional  offices around the United States, employs about 865. A public pension  plan like the Pennsylvania State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, whose  assets under management are comparable to that of the Trust, employs  about 200 staff.", "Other essential aspects of a typical DB plan, such as maintaining records  of accrued benefits, providing technical assistance to participants, and  authorizing and making benefit payments, are carried out by the Board or  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). In addition, the Board  assumes responsibility for interacting with workers or beneficiaries as  needed. The Trust is thus free of these responsibilities, and is able to  focus on overseeing its invested assets. Table 1 compares the Trust and  the Tier II program to typical public and private DB plans.", "Although the Trust does not have its own OIG, since the Trust\u2019s inception,  the Board\u2019s OIG has repeatedly expressed concerns about the adequacy  of Trust oversight. In November 2002, the OIG contacted the Trust\u2019s  Chief Investment Officer to inquire about investment practices and the  transfer of assets from Board accounts at Treasury to the Trust. The OIG  requested written confirmation that transferred funds had been received,  which investments had been purchased, and current investment yields.  The Trust Chair responded by noting that the Trust transmits investment  information in a statutorily-required annual report, as well as monthly  reports pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with the Board,  Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In a  subsequent correspondence, the Chairman noted that Congress had  specified that the Trust was to be audited by an independent auditor, and  delegated to the Board the responsibility to bring civil action if it believes  the Trust is not complying with the statute. Since that time, the Trust has  declined to provide any information directly to the OIG, although the  Board has opted to share information pertaining to the Trust in some  cases. In 2008, the OIG issued a report expressing concern that the  Trust\u2019s authorizing legislation provided the Board with a passive oversight  role, and did not provide the Board with the ability to uncover  circumstances requiring enforcement action. The report further noted  limitations of annual financial statement audits, stating that such audits  provide a \u201csnapshot\u201d of an organization\u2019s financial health at a point in  time, are not equivalent to a performance audit, and cannot assess  program performance compared to applicable criteria. The report  concluded that the annual financial statement audit should be  supplemented by performance audits, which can offer information about  the effectiveness of internal controls, assess compliance with law, and  assess the efficiency of recruitment and retention strategies.", "The overall importance of adequate oversight of pension assets has been  highlighted in recent years by a number of incidents involving officials  responsible for managing large pools of retirement assets. For example,  in 2011, high ranking officials of a large state pension plan were  implicated in practices that violated fiduciary and ethical duties.  Specifically, they were found to have guided investments to certain  middlemen known as \u201cplacement agents\u201d in exchange for trips and other  benefits, possibly to the detriment of beneficiaries. Similarly, in 2009, the PBGC Office of Inspector General (PBGC OIG) issued a report  regarding a former PBGC Director\u2019s inappropriate involvement in  contracting for investment services. Among other things, the PBGC OIG  found that the former Director was communicating directly with some  bidders at the same time he was actively considering their proposals, and  so had clearly violated prohibitions against contact with potential service  providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trust Oversight Includes Mandatory Reporting and Voluntary Periodic Performance Audits", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Trust Regularly Communicates with the Board and Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Under the law, the Trust must submit an annual management report to  the Congress, President, Board, and Director of OMB.

For example, the report  includes a discussion of the evolution, current status and performance of  the Trust\u2019s investment portfolio.

The Annual Management Report also includes  relevant Trust policies such as Trust by-laws, investment guidelines, and  a conflicts of interest policy statement. In addition to Annual Management  Reports, the Trust also submits monthly and quarterly reports to the  Board.

The Board then uses this information to prepare monthly financial  reports submitted to Treasury.", "In addition to reviewing these reports, Board and Trust officials stated that  the organizations conduct regular formal meetings. In addition, the Board,  in cooperation with the Trust, receives and reviews communications and  information throughout the year. Board officials explained that Board  members and trustees meet face-to-face twice annually, during which the  Board receives a presentation on economic, legal, and other issues that  could affect the Trust and its investments. The presentation may also  include a detailed discussion of investment performance and outlook by  asset class. A Board official said that such meetings typically include a  question and answer session. These meetings are supplemented by  quarterly conference calls between Trust and Board financial and legal  staff in which investment performance, ongoing audits, or other issues are  discussed.", "Board officials indicated that, after more than 10 years of experience  working with and overseeing the Trust, they saw no need for enhanced  oversight, noting that these reports and communications effectively  provide continuous oversight, and in the event of a participant complaint,  the Board would stand in for a claimant\u2019s interest and take action in the  event of malfeasance or mismanagement.

For example, the 2004 audit, conducted by the internal audit  departments of two railroad firms, sought to ensure that various core  functions, including financial reporting functions, were in place and  operating as intended. In contrast, the 2009 review sought to examine  various aspects of investment related practices, for which a railroad  internal audit department would not likely have sufficient expertise.  Instead, according to a Trustee, the Trust hired a consulting firm that it  believed to have considerable expertise in investment strategy and  management. This report went into some detail about the nature and  management of the Trust\u2019s alternative investments such as hedge funds  and private equity, and examined the Trust\u2019s \u201cdue diligence\u201d procedures  regarding the search for investment managers and ongoing manager  oversight.", "Each report contained recommendations and, according to Trust  documents, the Trust either implemented, committed to implement, or  explained why it would not implement each recommendation. In at least  one instance, the Trust has not pursued the auditor\u2019s recommendations.  Specifically, while the 2006 internal risk assessment generally found few  gaps in Trust processes and controls of risk, the auditor also proposed a  second audit phase to explore a number of issues more deeply.  According to a Trust representative, the Trust audit committee opted not  to commit to the significant cost of this second phase, since the risk  analysis found only a few \u201cgaps\u201d out of the 19 areas evaluated, and  because the Trust either took corrective action or determined that the  Trust\u2019s existing policies sufficiently addressed the concern. Since that  time, some of the specified issues have been addressed in subsequent  reviews, but others have not. For example, the audit proposed a more in- depth review of recruiting, staff compensation, and organizational culture,  but the Trust has not followed up with an audit of these issues.", "Although Trust representatives indicated that they intended to continue  the practice of periodic performance audits, the Trust does not have a  written policy regarding performance audits, their frequency, or their  subject matter.

An EBSA official stated that given the value of TSP\u2019s asset  holdings, they would be concerned if EBSA was not able to initiate an  audit to examine program areas they felt warranted closer review.  Nonetheless, a plan official in one state said the plan resisted such audits  in part out of a concern for politically motivated reviews and a perceived  lack or expertise in investment matters. The official explained that the  Auditor General\u2019s office was seen as a stepping stone to the  governorship, and that plan officials were concerned that audits could be  used for political purposes.

In another state, a state  agency is required to conduct an audit every 3 years related to  investment strategy, performance, and practices as well as ethics and  conflicts of interest. The most recent of these audits assessed whether  fiduciaries act for the sole benefit of participants, and whether the highest  ethical practices were being upheld.

For instance, as shown in table 4, unlike TSP and four states, a  Trust audit included a review related to the qualifications and  compensation of its Board of Trustees and Trust staff. Further, Trust  audits of some topics have been more detailed than those of some state  audits. For instance, the Trust\u2019s 2009 audit included an assessment of its  practices for selecting and monitoring external investment managers, as  did several state audits. However, the Trust audit also assessed the  Trust\u2019s practices for terminating contracts based on the performance of  external investment managers which one state audit did not include.  Table 4 lists broad audit topics and indicates whether the Trust, state  plans, and federal agencies have conducted related reviews.", "Conversely, some state and federal performance audits have included  findings on topics that Trust audits have not included, or addressed topics  in more detail. As table 4 indicates, two federal and six state entities have  audited plan ethics and conflicts of interest policies and practices  whereas the Trust audits have not. In some cases, such reviews have  resulted in findings and recommendations in areas that could be relevant  to the Trust.

Although limited in scope, officials in one state said these types of  reviews have identified issues such as conflicts of interest and the misuse  of state funds. Finally, while a 2006 Trust audit considered qualifications  and compensation of the Board of Trustees and Trust staff as part of a  broad risk assessment, some state audits examined this issue in more  detail. For example, a Trust audit considered the risk that improper  compensation of staff would drive inappropriate behavior or limit ability to  attract and retain staff. The review found that the Trust has processes  and controls in place to address this concern, including a staff handbook  and an annual review for each employee. In contrast, an audit of a state  plan appeared to encompass more, finding that while the plan has a  consistently high quality investment staff, it has relatively low staffing  levels in several asset classes, a tendency to leave vacancies unfilled for  many months, and underdeveloped and underutilized human resources.

One expert stated that smaller plans may have a more  difficult time justifying the use of the resources necessary to commission  performance audits. Nonetheless, where resources are available, experts  said that audits can be beneficial to a plan\u2019s trustees and management.  For instance, one expert said these reviews help ensure the plan is  complying with all reporting and disclosure requirements.", "In addition to periodic audits, private plans are also subject to potential  external review by ERISA enforcement agencies. To enforce the fiduciary  standards established in ERISA, for example, EBSA may review private  sector plans to ensure officials are in compliance with ERISA standards  and, like plan participants and others, take civil action to enforce  compliance. While not subject to ERISA, the Trust\u2019s authorizing  legislation includes similar fiduciary standards and the Trust is subject to  potential civil action by the Board for violations of law. While such action  is possible, Board officials stated that the Board has never had cause to  take such action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Parties Noted Tradeoffs with Expanded Trust Oversight", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Parties Disagreed about Need and Extent of Additional Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The Board\u2019s OIG officials emphasized their long-held belief that the  current level of oversight is inadequate, and that the Trust should be   In a 2011 report, the OIG  subject to more rigorous performance audits.stated that without stricter accountability, transparency, and oversight on  issues such as administrative expenses and overall financial health, the  Trust runs the risk of fraud, waste and abuse. Further, according to the  OIG, there is no comparable example where federal program assets are  completely outside the jurisdiction of a federal agency\u2019s appointed  Inspector General. OIG officials told us that that the Board can take  enforcement action if it believes the Trust is not in compliance with its  founding legislation, but that without more transparency, fraud or  mismanagement would be difficult to detect. The OIG maintained that an  external organization should have oversight authority so that it can  independently verify Trust reports. The OIG added that\u2014despite explicit  statutory language making it clear that the Trust is not an agency of the  federal government\u2014the Trust\u2019s control of about $25 billion in federal  government assets makes its status as a non-governmental organization  somewhat illogical, and that it should be subject to greater oversight. The  official added that if the railroad industry fell on hard times and the Trust  was unable able to make benefit payments, industry officials would likely  need to seek federal financial assistance.", "Both Trust and Board representatives stated that, in their view, the  current oversight is adequate, citing annual mandatory financial audits,  regular reporting and communications between the Board and Trust, and  voluntary periodic Trust-commissioned performance audits. Also, officials  cited the statutory \u201ctax ratchet\u201d, which raises or lowers the Tier II  employer and employee tax rate to ensure that the Trust assets equal  between 4 and 6 years of expected benefit payments. Officials noted that  this mechanism both ensures that the Trust\u2019s financial position will not  unduly deteriorate so long as there is a viable railroad industry in the  United States to pay required taxes, and ensures that railroad labor and  management have a self interest in overseeing a financially healthy Trust.", "Selected representatives of railroad management and labor generally  concurred with Board and Trust officials. For example, representatives of  the Association of American Railroads\u2014an organization representing  U.S. railroads\u2014stated that they did not have concerns about the Trust\u2019s  current oversight structure. Similarly, an official of the Brotherhood of  Maintenance of Way Employes indicated that the Trust is doing well  financially, and did not have concerns with regard to Trust oversight  because the Trust is quite transparent, and labor organizations are able  to obtain periodic reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Important Tradeoffs with Enhanced Trust Oversight Policy Options", "paragraphs": ["Based on discussions with experts and key stakeholders, as well as our  review of oversight models that apply to large state plans, private sector  plans subject to ERISA, and comparable federal entities, we identified  four possible policy options for expanding Trust oversight. We spoke with  key stakeholders about these policy options and solicited their views on  the potential benefits and drawbacks of each. Table 5 summarizes  stakeholder views on these policy options.", "An OIG official told us that, in their opinion, this would be the most logical  option because the Trust controls Board assets and the OIG is  responsible for overseeing the Board. However, the official noted that the  OIG has limited staff, and that such authority would require additional  staff resources. To make this option more agreeable to the Trust, an OIG  official said that any necessary statutory language could clearly delineate  what the OIG\u2019s role would and would not be. The official said the OIG  would seek to verify that there are proper checks and balances in place  and to assess internal controls. The official stated the OIG would not seek  to advise the Trust on investment policy, which is beyond the OIG\u2019s area  of expertise.", "However, representatives of the Trust and the Board that we contacted  were unanimously opposed to such a proposal. Board officials stated that  such a development would be counter to the Trust\u2019s originating  legislation, and one official stated that externally-initiated audits could  open the door to political influence, stating that audit objectives could be  framed in a way that would pressure the Trust\u2019s investment policies in a  particular direction. For example, an audit could be designed to review  \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d investments, or investments that might be portrayed  as not environmentally conscious. Similarly, a Trustee expressed concern  about \u201cheadline risk\u201d, where an outside auditor might make an issue  about the Trust\u2019s investments in alternative investments such as private  equity. Trust representatives also expressed concerns about what they  perceived as an unconstructive, confrontational relationship with the OIG.  One official said this has been manifest in a number of ways since the  Trust was established, including on matters relating to investment  management and returns. A Trust official noted that the OIG has  commented on Trust investments and related issues, and said that should  the OIG be granted authority to audit the Trust, such concerns could  result in an audit that would influence Trust investments. The official  added that the Trust has a professionally developed investment strategy,  and does not wish to take advice about investments or about its selection  of investment advisors from the OIG or any other government agency.", "Also, as summarized below, Trust officials noted that the OIG\u2019s stance  with regard to the Statement of Social Insurance (SOSI) has led them to  undertake a costly and, in their view, unnecessary second audit of their  financial statements each year. An OIG official told us that because the  SOSI is included in Board financial statements, in their view the audit of  the December 31 asset values is necessary based on OMB guidance.  The official further noted that while the difference in the value of Trust  assets between September 30 and December 31 is generally not large, in  2008 there was an 18 percent difference.", "Background   U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require federal agencies charged with  responsibility for selected federal social insurance programs such as the Railroad  Retirement, Social Security and Medicare programs\u2014to present the Statement of  Social Insurance (SOSI) as a basic financial statement in their respective annually  audited financial statements. The SOSI presents the projected actuarial present value  of the estimated future revenue and estimated future expenditures of these social  insurance programs over 75 years. In preparing its annual SOSI for the Railroad  Retirement program, the Board considers projections of employment levels,  economic factors, and demographic factors such as mortality rates, widow remarriage  rates, retirement rates, as well as current asset values provided by the Trust. The  Department of the Treasury has cautioned that the assumptions used to prepare  SOSI\u2019s are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty, and that depending on future  events, there will be differences between the SOSI estimates and actual results.", "OIG Action  In 2006, the OIG informed the Board that it would not provide an unqualified opinion  on its financial statements if the Board continued to accept unaudited December 31  asset values from the Trust. The Board then requested that the Trust pay for an audit  of the December 31 asset values.", "Trust Position  A Trust official stated that this is unnecessary because Trust assets are audited at the  end of the Trust\u2019s fiscal year\u2014September 30. Further, the Trust noted that the  variance between audited December 31 and unaudited December 31 values are  invariably quite small\u2014averaging about .12 percent and never exceeding \u00bd of 1  percent. According to a Trust official, the various assumptions made by the Board  actuary in preparing the SOSI have much more impact on the projections than the  difference between the audited and unaudited asset values.", "Impact  According to the Trust, the additional audit is also wasteful\u2014costing $152,000 in  2013 and a total of about $1.6 million since 2005.", "Finally, Board and Trust officials indicated that the OIG would not have  sufficient expertise to conduct performance audits of the Trust. One  official noted that the internal audit departments of two railroad firms were  hired for the first audit that covered various administrative issues.  However, Trust officials decided that these auditors would not have the  expertise to conduct subsequent reviews, the scope of which required  greater knowledge of investment management.

However, one trustee stated that, while the Trust has every  intention of continuing the practice of conducting periodic audits, they  would be amenable to formalizing this process. An OIG official also  generally supported this idea, but had previously stated that reviews  every 3 years would not be sufficient, and that more ongoing oversight is  needed.

One Trust  representative noted that, if the Trust was comparable in size to a large  public pension plan, establishing an internal office would make some  sense.

However, the Trust is not without oversight beyond  mandatory financial audits. Through regular reports and other  communications, the Trust\u2019s financial condition is monitored by the Board  and other agencies of the federal government. Further, the Trust has  appropriately recognized the importance of oversight and transparency by  taking the initiative to commission four performance audits since it was  organized in 2002. These voluntarily initiated audits are comparable to  and in some cases more comprehensive than those of the state pension  plans we reviewed.", "Nonetheless, our review suggests that there are aspects of the approach  to accountability for the Trust that could be strengthened. First, while 42  of the 50 state plans we surveyed and both federal agencies we reviewed  are subject to performance audits that are initiated and conducted by  external entities, the Trust is not. Instead, it has commissioned private  firms to conduct audits whose subject and scope the Trust defines.  However, a lack of independently initiated audits raises the risk that  auditors could be directed away from potentially problematic issues.  Second, 29 of the 50 state plans we contacted are subject to external  audits on a specific calendar cycle, and those plans with an internal  auditor are audited on an ongoing basis. Although the Trust has opted to  commission performance audits every 2 to 3 years since its creation, it  does not have a written policy requiring such audits, defining their scope,  or establishing their frequency. Finally, while some states require that  specific subjects be periodically reviewed, the Trust does not. For  example, one state now requires plans to undergo ethics and conflict of  interest reviews every 3 years\u2014the most recent of which assessed  whether fiduciaries act for the sole benefit of participants, and whether the  highest ethical practices were being upheld.", "Any improvement in Trust\u2019s performance audit oversight should help  ensure that its investment decisions are insulated from political influence.  Our review of state pension plans and selected federal programs  suggests that while external audits are not necessarily a source of such  influence, such influence may not be beyond the bounds of possibility.  However, concerns about such \u201cpolitical risk\u201d should be balanced against  the management and financial risk that exists in situations where  oversight is not clearly independent.", "The Trust\u2019s recent initiative to document a performance audit policy and  to involve the Board in determining the subject and scope of future audits  adds a welcome external perspective that is likely to enhance the  independence of future audits. However, Trust action\u2014including any  interagency agreements\u2014would not necessarily be permanent, and  under current law the parties could revoke such an agreement at any  time.
