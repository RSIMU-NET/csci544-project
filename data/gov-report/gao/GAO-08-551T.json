This directive requires the establishment of a governmentwide standard for secure and reliable forms of ID. GAO was asked to testify on its report, being released today, assessing the progress selected agencies have made in implementing HSPD-12. For this report, GAO selected eight agencies with a range of experience in implementing ID systems and analyzed actions these agencies had taken. GAO was also asked to summarize challenges in the DOD personnel security clearance process. This overview is based on past work including reviews of clearance-related documents. Military servicemembers, federal workers, and industry personnel must obtain security clearances to gain access to classified information. Long-standing delays in processing applications for these clearances led GAO to designate the Department of Defense's (DOD) program as a high-risk area in 2005. In its report on HSPD-12, GAO made recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to, among other things, set realistic milestones for implementing the electronic authentication capabilities. GAO has also made recommendations to OMB and DOD to improve the security clearance process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Much work had been accomplished to lay the foundations for implementation of HSPD-12--a major governmentwide undertaking. However, none of the eight agencies GAO reviewed--the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, and Labor; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--met OMB's goal of issuing ID cards by October 27, 2007, to all employees and contractor personnel who had been with the agency for 15 years or less. In addition, for the limited number of cards that had been issued, most agencies had not been using the electronic authentication capabilities on the cards and had not developed implementation plans for those capabilities. A key contributing factor for this limited progress is that OMB had emphasized issuance of the cards, rather than full use of the cards' capabilities. Furthermore, agencies anticipated having to make substantial financial investments to implement HSPD-12, since ID cards are considerably more expensive than traditional ID cards. However, OMB had not considered HSPD-12 implementation to be a major new investment and thus had not required agencies to prepare detailed plans regarding how, when, and the extent to which they would implement the electronic authentication mechanisms available through the cards. Until OMB revises its approach to focus on the full use of the capabilities of the new ID cards, HSPD-12's objectives of increasing the quality and security of ID and credentialing practices across the federal government may not be fully achieved. Regarding personnel security clearances, GAO's past reports have documented problems in DOD's program including delays in processing clearance applications and problems with the quality of clearance related reports. Delays in the clearance process continue to increase costs and risk to national security, such as when new DOD industry employees are not able to begin work promptly and employees with outdated clearances have access to classified documents. Moreover, DOD and the rest of the federal government provide limited information to one another on how they individually ensure the quality of clearance products and procedures. While DOD continues to face challenges in timeliness and quality in the personnel security clearance process, high-level government attention has been focused on improving the clearance process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on  the federal government\u2019s progress in implementing Homeland  Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) and challenges with  the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) personnel security clearance  process.

Specifically,  OMB\u2019s milestones were not focused on implementation of the  electronic authentication capabilities that are available through PIV  cards, and had not set acquisition milestones that would coincide  with the ability to make use of these capabilities. Furthermore,  despite the cost of the cards and associated infrastructure, OMB had  not treated the implementation of HSPD-12 as a major new  investment and had not ensured that agencies have guidance to  ensure consistent and appropriate implementation of electronic  authentication capabilities across agencies. Until these issues are  addressed, agencies may continue to acquire and issue costly PIV  cards without using their advanced capabilities to meet HSPD-12  goals.", "While OMB had established milestones for near-term card issuance,  it had not established milestones to require agencies to develop  detailed plans for making the best use of the electronic  authentication capabilities of PIV cards. Consequently, agencies had  concentrated their efforts on meeting the card issuance deadlines.  For example, several of the agencies we reviewed chose to focus  their efforts on meeting the next milestone\u2014that cards be issued to  all employees and contractor personnel and be in use by October 27,  2008. Understandably, meeting this milestone was perceived to be  more important than making optimal use of the cards\u2019  authentication capabilities, because card issuance is the measure  that OMB is monitoring and asking agencies to post on their public  Web sites.", "The PIV card and the services involved in issuing and maintaining  the data on the card, such as the PKI certificates, are costly. For  example, PIV cards and related services offered by GSA through its  shared service offering cost $82 per card for the first year and $36  per card for each of the remaining 4 years of the card\u2019s life. In  contrast, traditional ID cards with limited or no electronic  authentication capabilities cost significantly less. Therefore,  agencies that do not implement electronic authentication techniques  are spending a considerable amount per card for capabilities that  they are not able to use. A more economical approach would be to  establish detailed plans for implementing the technical  infrastructure necessary to use the electronic authentication  capabilities on the cards and time the acquisition of PIV cards to  coincide with the implementation of this infrastructure.", "Without OMB focusing its milestones on the best use of the  authentication capabilities available through PIV cards, agencies are  likely to continue to implement minimum authentication techniques  and not be able to take advantage of advanced authentication  capabilities.", "Before implementing major new systems, agencies are generally  directed to conduct thorough planning to ensure that costs and time  frames are well understood and that the new systems meet their  needs. OMB establishes budget justification and reporting  requirements for all major information technology investments.  Specifically, for such investments, agencies are directed to prepare a  business case\u2014OMB Exhibit 300\u2014which is supported by a number  of planning documents that are essential in justifying decisions  regarding how, when, and the extent to which an investment would  be implemented.", "However, OMB determined that because agencies had ID  management systems in place prior to HSPD-12 and that the  directive only directed agencies to \u201cstandardize\u201d their systems. the  implementation effort did not constitute a new investment.  According to an OMB senior policy analyst, agencies should be able  to fund their HSPD-12 implementations through existing resources  and should not need to develop a business case or request additional  funding.", "While OMB did not direct agencies to develop business cases for  HSPD-12 implementation efforts, PIV card systems are likely to  represent significant new investments at several agencies. For  example, agencies such as Commerce, HUD, and Labor had not  implemented PKI technology prior to HSPD-12, but they are now  directed to do so. In addition, such agencies\u2019 previous ID cards were  used for limited purposes and were not used for logical access.  These agencies had no prior need to acquire or maintain card  readers for logical access control or to establish connectivity with  their ID management systems for logical access control and,  consequently, had previously allocated very little money for the  operations and maintenance of these systems. For example,  according to Labor officials, operations and maintenance costs for  its pre-HSPD-12 legacy system totaled approximately $169,000,  while its fiscal year 2009 budget request for HSPD-12  implementation is approximately $3 million\u201417 times more  expensive.", "While these agencies recognized that they are likely to face  substantially greater costs in implementing PIV card systems, they  had not always thoroughly assessed all of the expenses they are  likely to incur. For example, agency estimates may not have  included the cost of implementing advanced authentication  capabilities where they are needed. The extent to which agencies  need to use such capabilities could significantly impact an agency\u2019s  cost for implementation.", "While the technical requirements of complying with HSPD-12  dictated that a major new investment be made, generally, agencies  had not been directed by OMB to take the necessary steps to  thoroughly plan for these investments. For example, six of the eight  agencies we reviewed had not developed detailed plans regarding  their use of PIV cards for physical and logical access controls. In  addition, seven of the eight agencies had not prepared cost-benefit  analyses that weighed the costs and benefits of implementing  different authentication capabilities. Without treating the  implementation of HSPD-12 as a major new investment by requiring  agencies to develop detailed plans based on risk-based assessments  of agencies\u2019 physical and logical access control needs that support  the extent to which electronic authentication capabilities are to be  implemented, OMB will continue to limit its ability to ensure that  agencies properly plan and implement HSPD-12.", "OMB Had Not Provided Guidance for Determining Which PIV Card Authentication Capabilities to  Implement for Physical and Logical Access Controls  Another factor contributing to agencies\u2019 limited progress is that  OMB had not provided guidance to agencies regarding how to  determine which electronic authentication capabilities to implement  for physical and logical access controls. While the FIPS 201 standard  describes three different assurance levels for physical access (some,  high, and very high confidence) and associates PIV authentication  capabilities with each level, it is difficult for agencies to link these  assurance levels with existing building security assurance standards  that are used to determine access controls for facilities. The  Department of Justice has developed standards for assigning  security levels to federal buildings, ranging from level I (typically, a  leased space with 10 or fewer employees, such as a military  recruiting office) to level V (typically, a building, such as the  Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency headquarters, with a large  number of employees and a critical national security mission). While  there are also other guidelines that agencies could use to conduct  assessments of their buildings, several of the agencies we reviewed  use the Justice guidance to conduct risk assessments of their  facilities.", "Officials from several of the agencies we reviewed indicated that  they had not been using the FIPS 201 guidance to determine which  PIV authentication capabilities to use for physical access because  they had not found the guidance to be complete. Specifically, they  were unable to determine which authentication capabilities should  be used for the different security levels. The incomplete guidance  has contributed to several agencies\u2014including Commerce, DHS,  and NRC\u2014not reaching decisions on what authentication  capabilities they were going to implement.", "More recently, NIST has begun developing guidelines for applying  the FIPS 201 confidence levels to physical access control systems.  However, this guidance has not yet been completed and was not  available to agency officials when we were conducting our review.", "Agencies also lacked guidance regarding when to use the enhanced  authentication capabilities for logical access control. Similar to  physical access control, FIPS 201 describes graduated assurance  levels for logical access (some, high, and very high confidence) and  associates PIV authentication capabilities with each level. However,  as we have previously reported, neither FIPS 201 nor supplemental  OMB guidance provides sufficient specificity regarding when and  how to apply the standard to information systems. For example,  such guidance does not inform agencies how to consider the risk  and level of confidence needed when different types of individuals  require access to government systems, such as a researcher  uploading data through a secure Web site or a contractor accessing  government systems from an off-site location.", "Until complete guidance is available, agencies will likely continue  either to delay in making decisions on their implementations or to  make decisions that may need to be modified later."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts Are Under Way to Address the Limited Progress Made in Achieving Interoperability to Enable Cross-Agency Authentication of Cardholders", "paragraphs": ["As defined by OMB, one of the primary goals of HSPD-12 is to  enable interoperability across federal agencies.

To overcome this limitation, HSPD-12 and OMB guidance  direct that ID cards have standard features and means for  authentication to enable interoperability among agencies.", "While steps had been taken to enable future interoperability,  progress had been limited in implementing such capabilities in  current systems, partly because key procedures and specifications  had not yet been developed. As we have previously stated, NIST  established conformance testing for the PIV card and interface, and  GSA established testing for other PIV products and services to help  enable interoperability. In addition, the capability exists for  determining the validity and status of a cardholder from another  agency via PKI. However, procedures and specifications to enable  cross-agency interoperability using the CHUID\u2014which is expected  to be more widely used than PKI\u2014had not been established. While  PIV cards and FIPS 201-compliant readers may technically be able  to read the information encoded on any PIV card\u2014including cards  from multiple agencies\u2014this functionality is not adequate to allow  one agency to accept another agency\u2019s PIV card, because there is no  common interagency framework in place for agencies to  electronically exchange status information on PIV credentials.

Without such procedures and policies, agencies  will issue PIV cards to their contractor staff for access only to their  own facilities. Contractors who work at multiple agencies may need  to obtain separate PIV cards for each agency.", "GSA recognized the need to address these issues and has actions  under way to do so. According to GSA, the Federal Identity  Credentialing Committee is developing guidance on the issuance  and maintenance of PIV cards to the contractor community. GSA is  also developing a standard specification that will enable  interoperability in the exchange of identity information among  agencies. According to GSA officials, they plan to complete and  issue guidance by the end of September 2008. Additionally, NIST is  planning to issue an update to a special publication that focuses on  interfaces for PIV systems. Such guidance should help enable  agencies to establish cross-agency interoperability\u2014a primary goal  of HSPD-12."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of GAO Recommendations Should Help Achieve the Objectives of HSPD-12", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the objectives of HSPD-12 are achieved, we  made several recommendations in our report. First, we  recommended that OMB establish realistic milestones for full  implementation of the infrastructure needed to best use the  electronic authentication capabilities of PIV cards in agencies. In  commenting on a draft of our report, OMB stated that its guidance  requires agencies to provide milestones for when they intend to  leverage the capabilities of PIV credentials. However, in order to  ensure consistent governmentwide implementation of HSPD-12, it is  important for OMB to establish such milestones across agencies,  rather than to allow individual agencies to choose their own  milestones.", "Next, we recommended that OMB require each agency to develop a  risk-based, detailed plan for implementing electronic capabilities.  OMB stated that previous guidance required agencies to provide  milestones for when they plan to fully leverage the capabilities of  PIV credentials for physical and logical access controls. However,  agencies were required to provide only the dates they plan to  complete major activities, and not detailed, risk-based plans. Until  OMB requires agencies to implement such plans, OMB will be  limited in its ability to ensure agencies make the best use of their  cards\u2019 electronic authentication capabilities.", "We also recommended that OMB require agencies to align the  acquisition of PIV cards with plans for implementing the cards\u2019  electronic authentication capabilities. In response, OMB stated that  HSPD-12 aligns with other information security programs. While  OMB\u2019s statement is correct, it would be more economical for  agencies to time the acquisition of PIV cards to coincide with the  implementation of the technical infrastructure necessary for  enabling electronic authentication techniques. This approach has  not been encouraged by OMB, which instead measures agencies  primarily on how many cards they issue.", "Lastly, we recommended that OMB ensure guidance is developed  that maps existing physical security guidance to FIPS 201 guidance.  OMB stated that NIST is in the process of developing additional  guidance to clarify the relationship between facility security levels  and PIV authentication levels. In March 2008, NIST released a draft  of this guidance to obtain public comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-standing Challenges Exist in DOD\u2019s Personnel Security Clearance Program", "paragraphs": ["In our previous reports, we have also documented a variety of  problems present in DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance program.  Some of the problems that we noted in our 2007 high-risk report  included delays in processing clearance applications and problems  with incomplete investigative and adjudicative reports to determine  clearance eligibility. Delays in the clearance process continue to  increase costs and risk to national security, such as when new  industry employees are not able to begin work promptly and  employees with outdated clearances have access to classified  documents. Moreover, DOD and the rest of the federal government  provide limited information to one another on how they individually  ensure the quality of clearance products and procedures. While  DOD continues to face challenges in timeliness and quality in the  personnel security clearance process, high-level governmentwide  attention has been focused on improving the security clearance  process.", "As we noted in February 2008, delays in the security clearance  process continue to increase costs and risk to national security. An  August 2007 DOD report to Congress noted that delays in processing  personnel security clearances for industry have been reduced, yet  that time continues to exceed requirements established by the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).", "The act currently requires that adjudicative agencies make a  determination on at least 80 percent of all applications for a security  clearance within an average of 120 days after the date of receipt of  the application, with 90 days allotted for the investigation and 30  days allotted for the adjudication. However, DOD\u2019s August 2007  report on industry clearances stated that, during the first 6 months  of fiscal year 2007, the end-to-end processing of initial top secret  clearances took an average of 276 days; renewal of top secret  clearances, 335 days; and all secret clearances, 208 days.", "We also noted in February 2008, that delays in clearance processes  can result in additional costs when new industry employees are not  able to begin work promptly and increased risks to national security  because previously cleared industry employees are likely to  continue working with classified information while the agency  determines whether they should still be eligible to hold a clearance.  To improve the timeliness of the clearance process, we  recommended in September 2006 that OMB establish an interagency  working group to identify and implement solutions for investigative  and adjudicative information-technology problems that have  resulted in clearance delays. In commenting on our  recommendation, OMB\u2019s Deputy Director for Management stated  that the National Security Council\u2019s Security Clearance Working  Group had begun to explore ways to identify and implement  improvements to the process.", "DOD and the Rest of the Government Provide Limited Information on How to Ensure the Quality of  Clearance Products and Procedures  As we reported in February 2008, DOD and the rest of the federal  government provide limited information to one another on how they  individually ensure the quality of clearance products and  procedures. For example, DOD\u2019s August 2007 congressionally  mandated report on clearances for industry personnel documented  improvements in clearance processes but was largely silent  regarding quality in clearance processes. While DOD described  several changes to the processes and characterized the changes as  progress, the department provided little information on (1) any  measures of quality used to assess clearance processes or (2)  procedures to promote quality during clearance investigation and  adjudication processes. Specifically, DOD reported that the Defense  Security Service, DOD\u2019s adjudicative community, and OPM are  gathering and analyzing measures of quality for the clearance  processes that could be used to provide the national security  community with a better product. However, the DOD report did not  include any of those measures.", "In September 2006, we reported that while eliminating delays in  clearance processes is an important goal, the government cannot  afford to achieve that goal by providing investigative and  adjudicative reports that are incomplete in key areas. We  additionally reported that the lack of full reciprocity\u2014when one  government agency fully accepts a security clearance granted by  another government agency\u2014is an outgrowth of agencies\u2019 concerns  that other agencies may have granted clearances based on  inadequate investigations and adjudications. Without fuller  reciprocity of clearances, agencies could continue to require  duplicative investigations and adjudications, which result in  additional costs to the federal government. In the report we issued  in February 2008, we recommended that DOD develop measures of  quality for the clearance process and include them in future reports  to Congress. Statistics from such measures would help to illustrate  how DOD is balancing quality and timeliness requirements in its  personnel security clearance program. DOD concurred with that  recommendation, indicating it had developed a baseline  performance measure of the quality of investigations and  adjudications and was developing methods to collect information  using this quality measure.", "Recent High-Level Governmentwide Attention Has Been Focused On Improving the Security Clearance  Process  In February 2008, we reported that while DOD continues to face  timeliness and quality challenges in the personnel security clearance  program, high-level governmentwide attention has been focused on  improving the security clearance process. For example, we reported  that OMB\u2019s Deputy Director of Management has been responsible  for a leadership role in improving the governmentwide processes  since June 2005. During that time, OMB has overseen, among other  things, the growth of OPM\u2019s investigative workforce and greater use  of OPM\u2019s automated clearance-application system. In addition, an  August 9, 2007, memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense  indicates that DOD\u2019s clearance program is drawing attention at the  highest levels of the department. Streamlining security clearance  processes is one of the 25 DOD transformation priorities identified  in the memorandum.", "Another indication of high-level government attention we reported  in February 2008 is the formation of an interagency security  clearance process reform team in June 2007. Agencies included in  the governmentwide effort are OMB, the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence, DOD, and OPM. The team\u2019s memorandum of  agreement indicates that it seeks to develop, in phases, a reformed  DOD and intelligence community security clearance process that  allows the granting of high-assurance security clearances in the least  time possible and at the lowest reasonable cost. The team\u2019s July 25,  2007, terms of reference indicate that the team plans to deliver \u201ca  transformed, modernized, fair, and reciprocal security clearance  process that is universally applicable\u201d to DOD, the intelligence  community, and other U.S. government agencies.", "A further indication of high level government attention is a  memorandum issued by the President on February 5, 2008 which  called for aggressive efforts to achieve meaningful and lasting  reform of the processes to conduct security clearances. In the  memorandum, the President acknowledged the work being  performed by the interagency security clearance process reform  team and directed that the team submit to the President an initial  reform proposal not later than April 30, 2008.", "In closing, OMB, GSA, and NIST have made significant progress in  laying the foundation for implementation of HSPD-12. However,  agencies did not meet OMB\u2019s October 2007 milestone for issuing  cards and most have made limited progress in using the advanced  security capabilities of the cards that have been issued. These  agency actions have been largely driven by OMB\u2019s guidance, which  has emphasized issuance of cards rather than the full use of the  cards\u2019 capabilities. As a result, agencies are acquiring and issuing  costly PIV cards without using the advanced capabilities that are  critical to achieving the objectives of HSPD-12. Until OMB provides  additional leadership by guiding agencies to perform the planning  and assessments that will enable them to fully use the advanced  capabilities of these cards, agencies will likely continue to make  limited progress in using the cards to improve security over federal  facilities and systems.", "Regarding security clearances, in June 2005, OMB took  responsibility for a leadership role for improving the  governmentwide personnel security clearance process. The current  interagency security clearance process reform team represents a  positive step to address past impediments and manage security  clearance reform efforts. Although the President has called for a  reform proposal to be provided no later than April 30, 2008, much  remains to be done before a new system can be implemented.", "Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, this concludes our  statement.
