Ensuring that these foreign investments do not harm U.S. national  security can be a challenge. Concerns have included foreign acquisitions  of U.S. companies in traditional sectors, such as semiconductors, and  cutting-edge fields, such as artificial intelligence, as well as an increase in  the number of acquisitions from certain countries. The Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency  committee that reviews certain foreign acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers  of U.S. businesses to determine the effect of a transaction on the national  security of the United States. Informed by the committee\u2019s review, the  President of the United States has the authority to block or suspend a  transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United  States.

We analyzed information on workload and  staffing levels to determine the extent to which CFIUS workload and  staffing levels have changed from 2011 through 2016, the most recent  information available at the time of our review. We also conducted  individual semistructured interviews with selected stakeholders, which  consisted of officials from the 9 CFIUS voting member agencies, the 2 ex  officio nonvoting member agencies, and 3 selected nonmember agencies  that have CFIUS case-related expertise, as well as with 16 external  experts to collect views and information on the challenges, such as  workload, that CFIUS faces, potential changes to address the challenges,  and their possible benefits and drawbacks.

The amendment authorized the  President to investigate the impact of certain foreign acquisitions of U.S.  companies on national security and to suspend or prohibit acquisitions  that might threaten to impair national security. FINSA further amended  the Defense Production Act, established CFIUS as it currently exists, and  guides the committee. One of the purposes of FINSA\u2019s enactment was to  ensure national security while promoting foreign investment and the  creation of U.S. jobs.", "CFIUS reviews transactions involving a large variety of countries and  industry sectors to determine if such transactions pose a threat to national  security and whether the transactions should be allowed to proceed (for  more information on the characteristics of transactions reviewed by  CFIUS, see app. II). FINSA does not formally define national security, but  provides a number of factors for CFIUS and the President to consider in  determining whether a transaction poses a risk. These factors include the  potential national security-related effects on U.S. critical technologies and  whether the transaction could result in the control of a U.S. business by a  foreign government. CFIUS also may consider other factors that it finds  appropriate in determining whether a transaction poses a national  security risk (for a full list of factors, see app. III).", "Under FINSA, CFIUS is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and  includes voting members from the Departments of Commerce, Defense,  Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, and State; and the Offices of the  U.S. Trade Representative, and Science and Technology Policy. In  addition, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the  Department of Labor (DOL) are nonvoting ex officio members. Various  other White House offices also observe and, as appropriate, participate in  CFIUS activities (see fig. 1). CFIUS may also solicit perspectives and  expertise from nonmember agencies, such as the Department of  Agriculture, designating them as members for purposes of the review of  particular transactions, as appropriate, which can include negotiating or  imposing mitigation measures or referring the transaction to the President  for decision. The committee, which meets weekly at a staff level,  generally has three core functions: (1) review transactions that have been  submitted to the committee and take action as necessary to address any  national security concerns; (2) monitor and enforce compliance with  mitigation measures; and (3) identify transactions of concern that have  not been notified to CFIUS for review.", "The Secretary of the Treasury, as the chair of CFIUS, is responsible for a  number of tasks. According to Department of the Treasury (Treasury)  officials, these tasks, including coordinating operations of the committee,  facilitating information collection from parties to a transaction, reviewing  and sharing data on mergers and acquisitions with member agencies,  and managing CFIUS timeframes, are carried out by Treasury employees  specifically staffed to support CFIUS.

Transactions that have not been notified to CFIUS for  review are known as \u201cnon-notified transactions.\u201d According to member  agency officials, Treasury and several other member agencies have  processes for identifying non-notified transactions for CFIUS to potentially  review. For instance, Treasury staff compile data on mergers and  acquisitions and distribute information about potential non-notified  transactions to member agencies for review. In addition, according to  member agency officials, in 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) began a working group, now called Project Iceberg, which is  responsible for identifying and understanding counterintelligence threats  posed by foreign investments that have not been notified to CFIUS. The  working group holds monthly meetings that intelligence agencies as well  as CFIUS member agencies are invited to attend.

CFIUS reviews each transaction individually, with a focus on the aspects  of the transaction that could pose a risk. For each transaction reviewed,  the committee identifies agencies with relevant expertise to act as co-lead  with Treasury to guide the transaction through the CFIUS process.  CFIUS reviews are confidential and protected from public disclosure. A  CFIUS review could be concluded when CFIUS members reach  consensus about whether the transaction should be allowed to proceed,  including on the basis of mitigation, if necessary, or when the parties  withdraw their notice, whether for commercial reasons or in light of  CFIUS\u2019s national security concerns. Absent one of these conclusions to  a CFIUS review, the committee may send the transaction to the  President, with a recommendation that the President suspend or prohibit  it. See figure 2 for an overview of the steps that comprise the CFIUS  process for reviewing selected transactions.", "Before a transaction is reviewed by CFIUS, Treasury may conduct a pre- notice consultation with parties to a notified transaction. Upon request,  Treasury and other agencies meet with the parties, provide informal  guidance on the CFIUS review process, and may review early drafts of  the notice.", "Once the parties have developed the final draft, they submit it to the  committee for review. When Treasury, with input from member agencies,  determines that the notice of the transaction is complete, the official  CFIUS review of the transaction commences.", "CFIUS conducts a national security review of each notified transaction,  which includes determining whether it is a covered transaction and  developing a national security threat assessment. The national security  review lasts up to 30 days and begins the day after Treasury determines  the filing is complete and circulates the filing to CFIUS member agencies.  At the beginning of the national security review, CFIUS identifies co-lead  agencies. According to Treasury officials, typically within the first 10 to 12  days of the national security review, CFIUS develops a \u201ccovered  transaction analysis,\u201d which determines whether the transaction is a  covered transaction according to FINSA. According to Treasury officials,  there typically is consensus among voting members on whether the  transaction is a covered transaction. During the national security review,  CFIUS also assesses whether there is credible evidence that the foreign  party in control of that U.S. business might take action to impair the  national security of the United States as well as whether the covered  transaction is a foreign government-controlled transaction. Concurrently,  ODNI develops a national security threat assessment, with input and  support from the intelligence community, to be completed during the first  20 days of the national security review.", "If CFIUS finds that the covered transaction does not present national  security risks or that other provisions of law provide adequate and  appropriate authority to address the risks, CFIUS may end its review. If  CFIUS chooses to conclude its review at this point, CFIUS is to advise  the parties in writing that the transaction has been cleared and allowed to  proceed. According to information provided by Treasury, CFIUS has  historically concluded action on the majority of transactions during or at  the end of the 30-day national security review. The committee\u2019s  determination must be certified to specified members of Congress after  the review is completed. However, if at the end of the national security  review, CFIUS has not yet determined that there are no unresolved  national security concerns and the committee requires additional time,  CFIUS may proceed to a national security investigation, which must be  completed within 45 days.", "If, during the 45-day national security investigation, CFIUS identifies an  unresolved national security concern, it works with the parties to mitigate,  if appropriate, any national security risks that may exist. If an agency  identifies an unresolved national security concern, the agency develops  an analysis of the potential risks posed by the covered transaction and  includes recommendation for action, such as mitigation measures or  referral to the President, and shares this analysis with other members of  the committee. Mitigation measures may include ensuring that only  authorized persons have access to certain technologies, information, or  facilities, or providing the U.S. government the right to review certain  business decisions and to object if the decisions raise national security  concerns. According to Treasury officials, CFIUS member agencies aim  for mitigation that would be effective, can be monitored, and would be  enforceable. If there is a difference of opinion among CFIUS member  agencies about the level or type of mitigation that should be utilized,  CFIUS agencies discuss the matters to reach consensus.", "In some cases, parties may choose to withdraw and resubmit the notice.  If CFIUS has determined that national security concerns cannot be  mitigated, according to Treasury officials, CFIUS typically advises the  parties that the committee will refer the matter to the President for  decision. According to Treasury officials, parties have the opportunity to  withdraw and resubmit the notice if they need additional time to discuss  CFIUS\u2019s concerns or to present additional information or mitigation  proposals for CFIUS\u2019s consideration. Sometimes parties choose to  withdraw and abandon the transaction if, for instance, CFIUS proposes  mitigation measures that the parties choose not to accept. Parties may  also abandon the transaction for commercial reasons unrelated to the  CFIUS review. If parties choose to withdraw and resubmit a transaction,  the national security review begins again, and the committee has another  75 days to complete the review of the transaction.", "If CFIUS obtains consensus from committee members that there are no  unresolved national security concerns or the national security concerns  have been mitigated, the national security investigation ends, and the  covered transaction receives safe harbor. Treasury and the co-lead  agency send written certification to specified members of Congress that  there are no unresolved national security concerns. However, if the  committee concludes that a proposed foreign investment threatens to  impair the U.S. national security and the threat cannot be mitigated,  CFIUS will elevate the notice to the President for determination and  CFIUS may recommend that the President suspend or prohibit the  transaction. According to Treasury officials, parties may also withdraw  their notice at this point rather than have the President decide whether to  block the transaction.", "If, at the end of the national security investigation, CFIUS elevates a  transaction to the President for determination, the President has 15 days  from the completed investigation to decide to prohibit or suspend the  acquisition, or to take no action.

In 2017, CFIUS reviewed 238 transactions, according to  Treasury officials. According to member agency officials, the increased  volume of covered transactions resulted in increased work for all CFIUS  members, no matter which agency is the co-lead, because each member  agency must review each transaction notified to the committee.", "The number of reported covered transactions requiring national security  investigations almost doubled during this same period, increasing from 40  transactions in 2011 to 79 transactions in 2016. Treasury officials told us  that they estimated that the total number of transactions that proceeded  to national security investigations was greater in 2017 than it was in  2016. They said that the increase in the number of covered transactions  that require a national security investigation is another indication that the  committee\u2019s workload has increased. One Treasury official noted that the  number of times that parties withdraw and resubmit transactions can  increase the workload of the committee as it must review the transaction  each time it is submitted.", "Additionally, the number of reported covered transactions that include  mitigation measures has increased. Each year, CFIUS places mitigation  measures on a relatively small number of covered transactions. For  example, according to Treasury officials, 18 (roughly 10 percent) of 172  transactions the committee reviewed in 2016 resulted in mitigation  measures.

They said that additional  time and staff have been required to address this rise in complexity and to  complete these reviews. For instance, one member agency official told us  that reviews of transactions from parties whose companies use new and  emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics,  typically require input from agency subject matter experts to help the  committee understand how, if at all, the acquisition of these technologies  by foreign parties could create national security concerns.", "According to member agency officials, the amount of time and number of  staff needed to review a transaction can fluctuate greatly based on,  among other things, the technology involved. One agency official said that  6 of their employees, on average, are involved in reviewing a less  complex transaction, but up to 15 employees may be necessary to  complete the review if the technology involved is more complicated. The  number of agency staff involved can increase further if senior level  management is required to participate in the review. This official also  stated that most of the transactions reviewed in the past were from  sectors that agency officials were familiar with and involved more  predictable issues, but recently, transactions more frequently involved  complex technology, which required additional expertise. Officials from  another member agency stated that a majority of their staff involved in  reviewing transactions do not have CFIUS as a primary duty and that  their agency has reallocated resources to address the increased case  load. One Treasury official stated that one case was so complex that it  required one staff member to dedicate all of their time to its review, and  the other responsibilities of this employee had to be shifted to other  members of the staff.", "Additionally, according to member agency officials, reviews of  transactions involving technologies the government frequently uses have  increased, requiring additional time and staff to understand how this  technology affects various agencies. For instance, member agency  officials said that reviewing transactions involving semiconductors, which  are commonly used in an array of products used by the government,  typically requires additional time and staff because CFIUS member  agencies must understand, among other things, how the approval of a  transaction could affect systems across government agencies.", "According to CFIUS member agency officials, the structures of the  transactions the committee reviews have also become more complex,  requiring more time and staff to assess. For example, business  arrangements\u2014such as complex corporate arrangements, joint ventures,  loan arrangements, nondisclosure agreements, and memoranda of  understanding\u2014may require the work of additional staff. Treasury officials  also stated that these arrangements can make it more difficult to  determine whether the transaction is covered by CFIUS authorities, as  there may be commercial relationships that affect the parties\u2019 decision- making. According to Treasury officials, such arrangements can also  increase the complexity of the national security review, as they may  create additional \u201cindirect threats\u201d that must also be analyzed.", "Member agency officials explained that it has become more challenging  to identify the ultimate beneficial owners\u2014the persons who ultimately own  and control a company\u2014due to the structure of the transaction. According  to Treasury officials, in certain countries, it can be difficult to distinguish  between control by a private entity and control by a state entity due to the  various relationships created by the transaction structure. In these cases,  CFIUS often requires additional information from the parties in such  transactions before the national security review can begin. Member  agency officials stated that they had been encountering these  arrangements more frequently, and additional time and staff had been  required to examine the national security implications of these  transactions.", "Finally, the nature of the national security concerns the committee  considers has expanded beyond the traditional threats, requiring more  time and staff to assess them, according to member agency officials.  National security concerns include traditional ones, such as threats to  U.S. critical infrastructure. Emerging concerns include the possibility of a  foreign entity obtaining access to personally identifiable information that, if  disclosed, could be exploited for purposes that have national security  consequences or the proximity of property to areas considered sensitive  by the U.S. government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Not Coordinated Assessments of Staffing Levels Needed to Complete CFIUS Core Functions", "paragraphs": ["According to agency officials, the number of staff assigned to CFIUS  activities has not kept pace with the increase in covered transactions  reviewed by CFIUS.

First, the time and staff necessary to monitor mitigation  measures varies. For instance, according to one member agency official,  some mitigation measures require daily monitoring from officials, while  other mitigation measures require only the review of an annual report  submitted by parties to the transaction. Several member agency officials  acknowledged that they have fewer staff than they would like to devote to  monitoring mitigation measures.", "Second, these member agency officials also said that they are not able to  devote the amount of time they would like to the task of identifying non- notified transactions. CFIUS member agencies review data on mergers  and acquisitions to identify non-notified transactions of concern, those  that have not been notified to CFIUS for review. In recent years,  according to agency officials, CFIUS has seen an increase in the number  of non-notified transactions CFIUS could potentially review. One official  indicated that in 2016, their agency examined 2,683 potential non-notified  transactions, an increase of roughly 38 percent from 2014. Member  agency officials stated that because non-notified transactions are  frequently reviewed after the acquisition has been completed, the process  of mitigating potential national security concerns of non-notified  transactions can be difficult. Several member agency officials suggested  that they would like to devote more time to examining non-notified transactions, but staff constraints limit the amount of time agencies can  spend conducting this task.", "Several member agency officials said that they do not know if current  staffing levels would be able to address a further increase in CFIUS  workload. Treasury officials noted that the volume of transactions  reviewed by CFIUS will likely continue to increase. Moreover,  congressional bills have been introduced that, if enacted, would alter the  CFIUS process. As discussed later in this report, agency officials stated  that some of these potential changes would likely further increase CFIUS  workload. According to several CFIUS member agency officials, if the  CFIUS workload were to increase, additional staff would likely be  necessary to complete committee functions, such as identifying non- notified transactions and monitoring mitigation measures.

The increased number of covered transactions notified to  CFIUS and the complexity of these cases compared with the modest  increase in the number of people assigned to reviewing them have,  according to member agency officials, taxed the staff of CFIUS member  agencies. Member agency officials and external experts have expressed  particular concern that CFIUS member agencies were limited in their  ability to complete core functions, such as identifying non-notified  transactions and monitoring mitigation measures. At the same time,  congressional bills have been introduced proposing changes to FINSA  that could increase the committee\u2019s workload. Officials from Treasury and  other member agencies are aware of pressures on their CFIUS staff  given the current workload and have expressed concerns about possible  workload increases. Treasury and OMB have begun to collect information  from agencies on their current CFIUS staffing levels. This is a crucial first  step that could facilitate a better understanding for both the committee  and Congress of the current staffing levels across the committee\u2019s  organizational structure. However, Treasury, as CFIUS lead, has not  coordinated member agency efforts to assess the current and future  staffing levels needed to complete the committee\u2019s core functions.  Without attaining an understanding of the staffing levels needed to  address the current and future CFIUS workload, particularly if legislative  changes to CFIUS\u2019s authorities further expand its workload, CFIUS may  be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives and address threats to the  national security of the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of the Treasury, as the chair of CFIUS, and working with  member agencies, should coordinate member agencies\u2019 efforts to better  understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and  projected CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions.

Computer and electronic transactions, such as those by  companies that produce semiconductor technology, accounted for  approximately 32 of the 72 covered transactions from the manufacturing  sector that CFIUS reviewed in 2016. For instance, in 2016, CFIUS  reviewed the potential acquisition of Aixtron, a Germany-based  semiconductor firm with assets in the United States, by the Chinese firm  Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund. That year, the President chose to  prohibit the acquisition of the U.S. business of Aixtron upon determining  that the foreign purchasers might take action that threatens to impair the  national security of the United States in exercising control of the U.S.  business of Aixtron.
