Federal and selected state law enforcement agencies that process firearm-related background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) collectively investigate and prosecute a small percentage of individuals who falsify information on a firearms form (e.g., do not disclose a felony conviction) and are denied a purchase. Federal NICS checks resulted in about 112,000 denied transactions in fiscal year 2017, of which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) referred about 12,700 to its field divisions for further investigation. U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) had prosecuted 12 of these cases as of June 2018.", "At the state level, officials from 10 of 13 selected states said they did not investigate or prosecute firearm denials, some citing competing resource demands and the lack of statutes with which states prosecute as reasons. The remaining 3 states investigated a high proportion of firearms denials. One of the 3 states reported about 1,900 referrals for prosecution in 2017 and about 470 convictions.", "Challenges. ATF and selected states reported challenges in investigating and prosecuting firearms denials.

ATF policy provides that field divisions may send \u201cwarning notices\u201d to denied persons in lieu of prosecution, but ATF has not assessed field divisions' use of these notices, which could provide greater awareness of their deterrence value and inform whether any policy changes are needed. Officials from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys said that prosecuting denial cases can require significant effort and may offer little value to public safety compared to other cases involving gun violence. Selected state officials said that denial investigations can take law enforcement officials away from their core duties. State prosecutors said gathering evidence to prove individuals knew they were prohibited was a challenge.", "Types of cases. ATF field divisions investigate denial cases based on USAO criteria and generally only refer cases to USAOs for prosecution when aggravating circumstances exist, such as violent felonies or multiple serious offenses over a short period of time. Officials from two of three selected states refer all denial cases for investigation, while one state uses risk-based criteria for selecting cases that include conditions such as felony convictions and misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.

These case examples included the specific  circumstances that convinced the field division to investigate and refer the  case for prosecution. We also researched legal databases to identify the  specific circumstances of the cases prosecuted, the statutes used to  charge the defendants, and the outcome of the cases. Further, we  interviewed EOUSA officials about how USAOs determine the  circumstances that would lead a USAO to prosecute a firearms denial  case.

In fiscal year  2017, ATF\u2019s DENI Branch referred 1,889 delayed denial cases to our six  selected field divisions\u2014which field divisions are required to investigate\u2014 and 5,435 standard denials cases, which they are to consider for further  investigation. In the six field divisions, the number of standard denial  referrals more than tripled from fiscal years 2011 to 2017, and in two field  divisions, the number of standard referrals in 2017 was more than five  times the number in 2011. For example, in one field division, the number  of standard referrals was 166 in 2011 and increased to 1,064 in 2017.  ATF officials did not know why the number of standard and delayed  denials had increased during this period.", "Officials from all six of our selected ATF field divisions also said that  investigating denial cases can be time-intensive and require use of their  limited resources. The officials said that delayed denials can be  particularly time-intensive because they are required to be investigated  and the investigation involves a defined set of actions, including the  possible retrieval of the firearm. For example, these investigations  typically involve steps to verify the prohibition of the individual, including  obtaining court records; contacting the individual and FFL that sold the  firearm; and arranging to retrieve the firearm for those individuals found to  be prohibited. A fiscal year 2016 ATF funding request through the  annual congressional budget justification submission noted the drain on  investigative resources because of the requirement for ATF to follow-up  on delayed denials. While the investigation of standard denials also can  take time, officials from our six selected field divisions said they have  greater discretion over whether or not to investigate these denials. For  example, each field division has discretion to screen all or some of the  standard denials, which can include confirming the person was correctly  denied and contacting the denied individual and the firearms dealer.", "Officials from all of the six selected field divisions said that, in light of the  high volume and time-intensiveness of denial cases, they have taken  various steps to prioritize the types of cases to investigate. For example,  per ATF policy, field divisions prioritize delayed denials over standard  denials because a prohibited person may be in possession of a firearm.", "Officials from three of the six field divisions said that after verifying that  the applicant is prohibited by reviewing the criminal history attached to the  case file, they generally close standard denials without further  investigation. The officials added that while these cases may meet USAO  criteria and be referred to a field division for investigation, they ultimately  do not have prosecutive merit based on coordination with prosecutors  who have experience in prosecuting these cases. Officials from one field  division said that they typically do not devote resources to verifying the  prohibited status, and instead triage standard denials based on certain  criteria, such as a recent violent felony or domestic violence conviction.  Accordingly, officials in that field division only refer to a criminal  investigator for further review what they consider the greatest threats to  public safety."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Prosecutions of Firearms Denials", "paragraphs": ["EOUSA officials said that USAOs generally do not accept and prosecute  denial cases that do not involve aggravating circumstances, as these  cases can require significant effort for prosecutors relative to the short  length of punishment and may offer little value to public safety because  the offender does not obtain the firearm, compared to other cases  involving gun violence. The officials added that USAOs filed about 9,200  firearm-related cases in fiscal year 2016 and about 10,400 in fiscal year  2017, but that cases involving falsifying information when attempting to  purchase a firearm generally are only a small fraction of USAO efforts.  Instead, USAOs primarily focus on cases where persons obtain firearms  and are prohibited persons or use the firearms in connection with a  criminal offense. According to ATF DENI Branch data, the majority of  the 25 cases that USAOs prosecuted in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 that  involved firearms denials (standard and delayed) resulted in reaching  plea agreements with the defendants.", "Federal law provides that it is unlawful \u201cfor any person in connection with  the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any firearm or ammunition from  a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed  collector, knowingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written  statement or to furnish or exhibit any false, fictitious, or misrepresented  identification, intended or likely to deceive such importer, manufacturer,  dealer, or collector with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of  the sale or other disposition of such firearm or ammunition \u2026.\u201d  Generally, to convict someone for making a false statement on the ATF  Form 4473, the prosecutor must establish beyond a reasonable doubt  that the seller was a FFL; the defendant made a false statement or used  a false identification while acquiring or attempting to acquire a firearm; the  defendant knew the statement or identification was false; and the false  statement or identification was intended to, or likely to, deceive a FFL  about the lawfulness of the firearm sale. EOUSA officials said that  prosecutions for falsifying information are very challenging because of the  requirement to prove intent, and can become further complicated  because the purchaser may not know that he or she is prohibited and was  not intentionally trying to deceive an FFL. The officials added that these  cases are not appealing to judges and juries from a public safety  standpoint. They also said that they find juries questioning why the case  is being prosecuted in instances when the individual did not get the gun,  resulting in juries refusing to convict these individuals or jury  nullification.", "EOUSA officials said that the number of prosecutions of firearms denials  can be low, particularly in standard denial cases where the system  worked and the subject did not obtain a firearm, and because of the  priority often given to other cases involving gun violence. EOUSA officials  said that delayed denial cases can require less effort to prosecute than  standard denials, since USAOs do not need to prove an individual\u2019s intent  in making a false statement in purchasing the firearm, only that the  prohibited individual is intentionally in possession of a firearm. For  instance, generally, to obtain a conviction for a felon in possession of a  firearm, the prosecution must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that  the defendant had previously been convicted of a crime punishable by  imprisonment for a term of more than 1 year; the defendant knowingly  possessed a firearm; and the firearm previously passed in interstate  commerce.

According to ATF headquarters officials,  warning notices are intended to inform the individual that he or she is  prohibited from purchasing a firearm, should not attempt to purchase a  firearm again, and may be subject to prosecution. For delayed denials,  ATF policy also requires field divisions to send a written warning notice in  all instances where the special agent is unable to make contact with the  prohibited person within 3 business days, or when other circumstances  exist, such as extraordinary distance or inclement weather. Officials from  our six selected field divisions said that while warning notices for delayed  denials are not always delivered in writing, all individuals involved in  delayed denials receive a warning in some form\u2014e.g., written, oral, or via  text message\u2014from the ATF special agent investigating the denial.  Officials from one field division said that they send text messages to  denied purchasers in lieu of warning letters because they are less  intimidating to prohibited persons, the texts save time and money, and  are more effective in helping retrieve firearms.", "For standard denials, warning notifications are not required.

The 6  selected field divisions varied in the extent to which they sent warning  notices related to standard denials. Specifically, three of the six divisions  had established a practice to send notices to all prohibited persons.  Officials from these three divisions said that such letters are intended to  (1) educate the denied person that he or she is prohibited from  purchasing firearms, (2) deter the individual from attempting future  purchases, and (3) serve as evidence during any subsequent  investigation or prosecution that the individual knew that he or she was  prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Officials from one of these field  divisions also said that the practice of addressing standard denials by  sending warning notices is a good use of limited resources while  addressing a public safety concern.", "Of the three field divisions that routinely send warning notices for all  standard denials, two send them via certified mail, while the other sends  letters via standard mail due to limited resources. According to officials  from these three field divisions, the costs associated with mailing warning  notices also includes staff time to locate recipient information and mail the  letters, in addition to supervisory review, as is done in at least one field  division. A group supervisor in one of these field division\u2019s sub-offices  said that while their field division primarily uses certified mail, the sub- office hand delivers these notices for all standard and delayed denials.  Officials from one of these three field divisions said that they confirm the  prohibited status of individuals before sending the warning notices, while  officials at another field division said they do not confirm the prohibited  status prior to mailing but that the notice includes information on how to  appeal the denial. These three divisions received an average of about  800 standard denials in fiscal year 2017.", "Officials from the three divisions that do not routinely send warning  notices for standard denials said that notices are only sent for standard  denials in rare cases. Such cases can include when there are aggravating  circumstances. Criminal activity or not cooperating with the ATF\u2014after  the attempted purchase are examples of aggravating circumstances.", "Officials from one field division stated that warning notices were used for  standard denials by individual agents in the past, but there was no field  division policy to do so routinely. Officials from another field division said  that due to limited resources, the decision was made to not send these  notices, though they said the notices could be an effective deterrent for  prohibited individuals from trying to possess a firearm or attempting to  purchase from an FFL.

While ATF policy provides that individual field  divisions determine their use of warning notices, ATF headquarters is  uniquely positioned to assess use of the notices across all field divisions.  Assessing the extent to which ATF field divisions use warning notices for  standard denials would provide ATF headquarters with greater  awareness regarding agency-wide efforts to use the notices as a  deterrence tool in lieu of prosecution.

State  troopers echoed this point, adding that denial investigations are difficult to  conduct given the amount of documentation needed for prosecution when  they have other duties. Local law enforcement officials in Oregon and  Pennsylvania also said that denial investigations are disruptive, as they  are usually forwarded to officers when they are on patrol, sometimes  many weeks or months after the firearms background check was initiated.", "Investigators in all three states also said they face challenges assisting  with prosecutions of denied persons, including gathering the necessary  documentation to prove the individual knew they were prohibited. For  example, Virginia troopers said that obtaining records on out-of-state  convictions and mental health prohibitions, and locating documentation  on older convictions, can be especially difficult. Troopers in Oregon and  Virginia commented that in their experience, there can be some degree of  inaccuracy in the criminal records in their state.

Virginia State Police  officials told us that some areas within police divisions that receive a high  volume of denials for investigation use specialized troopers that spend all  or most of their time investigating firearms denials. These Virginia  troopers reported that they have become more efficient than troopers that  do not specialize because the repetition of performing multiple  investigations improves the learning curve and the quality of their  investigations. Virginia State Police officials said that while any area may  assign troopers to work exclusively on denial investigations, most areas  either cannot afford to remove a trooper from road coverage or do not  investigate enough cases involving persons denied firearms to make it an  effective use of resources. According to Oregon officials, five specialized  troopers in the state investigated more than 1,100 of the almost 2,600  firearms denials referred for investigation in 2016.

There are also challenges due to record retention policies for  specific prohibitions. For example, a Virginia prosecutor said that  prosecuting denials for misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence  convictions in Virginia that are more than 10 years old is difficult because  these records may be destroyed under state law after 10 years. Oregon  state investigators we interviewed said that, under state statutes,  successfully prosecuting someone for falsifying information on firearms  purchase forms requires proving that the person \u201cknowingly and willingly\u201d  falsified information on the form, which can be difficult to prove.

The defendant was prohibited from purchasing a  firearm based on convictions for repeatedly driving while under the  influence, a misdemeanor with a potential prison term of 5 years in that  state. The attorney said the jury believed that it was a pointless  prosecution for a firearm\u2019s denial offense. In Virginia, one prosecutor also  described a case where a person was denied because of a mental health  prohibition, and the person was found not guilty of the charges of  falsifying information when attempting to purchase the firearm. He  attributed this to a sympathetic defendant and jury reluctance to impose a  criminal conviction on an individual without a criminal record.", "Further, state officials said that the penalties handed down when denied  individuals are convicted tended to be minor. The Oregon prosecutors  said that common penalties are fines (usually in the hundreds of dollars)  and probation ranging up to 1 year depending on the criminal background  of the denied person. According to a Pennsylvania state police official, in  some instances the charges are pled down to a lesser violation, such as  disorderly conduct, which result in an approximately $300 fine. The two  Pennsylvania prosecutors we interviewed said that most denial  prosecutions in their jurisdictions are pled down to misdemeanors,  eliminating the need for a trial. According to the prosecutors, common  penalties for misdemeanor convictions include probation and the  requirement to pay court costs (upwards of $1,000 in one county). The  prosecutors added that there is an occasional jail sentence for denied  felons with substantial criminal records that can result in about 1 to almost  2 years in jail. Prosecutors across the states said that they try to plead  cases\u2014thus avoiding trial\u2014whenever possible. One Pennsylvania  prosecutor said that cases without strong evidence that cannot be pled  are sometimes dropped because conviction would be difficult. Another  Pennsylvania prosecutor said jury apathy in one strong case led to fewer  denial cases. Virginia prosecutors said that most convictions are for  misdemeanor charges and result in probation, fines, and court costs.  They did say, however, that jail time has resulted for denied individuals  with violent felony convictions."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["At the federal level, the number of firearms denial cases ATF has referred  to its field divisions for investigation has increased substantially over  recent years, which has placed a burden on field division resources.

For federal efforts, we  requested data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) National  Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) regarding firearms  denials provided to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives (ATF) by state and prohibiting category for fiscal years 2011  through 2017. We reviewed the internal controls in place for these data  and determined that the data were reliable for our purposes. We  requested and received data from the ATF Automated National Instant  Criminal Background Check System Referral Application and the NForce  Case Management System that showed how many of these denials, both  standard and delayed, were forwarded from ATF\u2019s Denial Enforcement  NICS Intelligence (DENI) Branch to ATF field divisions, broken out by the  prohibiting category of the denials. This provided us the total count of  denials that ATF may investigate nationwide. To assess the reliability of  these data we reviewed internal controls and the data quality assurance  program of ATF. We determined that these data were reliable for the  purpose of our reporting objectives.", "To examine federal prosecutions of denied persons, we requested  information from ATF\u2019s case management system that identified the NICS  cases that were prosecuted, including those instances where a conviction  was recorded. For state investigations and prosecutions, we selected the  13 states that perform their own background checks for all firearms  transactions and searched their state police and state agency websites to  identify the state\u2019s background check units, or staff associated with this  function and inquired about their policy regarding the investigation of  persons denied firearms purchase. From these contacts we determined  that 10 of these selected states did not perform investigations, while 3  point-of-contact (POC) states did investigate these denials.", "We analyzed data from the state police in Oregon, Pennsylvania and  Virginia that identified the number of firearms denials recorded, the  prohibiting category of the denials, and the number of these denials  referred to state or local law enforcement for investigation. To assess the  reliability of these data we interviewed knowledgeable individuals about  the procedures for creating these data, and reviewed the internal controls  in place within these systems. We determined that this data was reliable  for the purpose of our reporting objectives. We spoke to state and local  investigators and prosecutors in these states to discuss the investigative  processes followed and the frequency of prosecution. Though these  prosecutors tended to lack hard data on the number of these cases  prosecuted and the outcome of these prosecutions, they were able to  share their experiences prosecuting these cases, and to estimate the  approximate quantity of these cases that have been addressed by their  offices.

We found that 6 field divisions received  about 60 percent of the total ATF standard denial referrals over the 2011  through 2017 fiscal year period. These six field divisions also received  more than half of the delayed denial referrals distributed to the 25 ATF  field divisions over that time period.

We also discussed the types of cases that  each field division referred to the appropriate USAO for prosecution, and  were provided detailed examples from ATF headquarters of these denial  cases for each of the six field divisions. We spoke to EOUSA officials to  discuss the circumstances that would lead a USAO to prosecute a  firearms denial and the challenges faced in these prosecutions. For state  denial investigation challenges we spoke to state troopers and local law  enforcement to learn about the procedures for conducting these  investigations, the challenges that investigators face, and how and when  these firearms denial investigations are referred to prosecutors. We also  spoke with multiple prosecutors from each of these states and discussed  their offices\u2019 policies for accepting these denial cases, how often these  cases were prosecuted in these localities and the general outcome of the  cases. Though we did not speak to a representative sample of  prosecutors across our selected states, we believe their views provide  insights into the types of challenges faced by prosecutors in those states.", "To identify the circumstances that lead to investigations and prosecutions  of firearms denials, we reviewed federal denial investigations by visiting  the ATF DENI Branch, the office that uses USAO criteria to screen  federal NICS denials for referral to ATF field divisions. There, we  observed how denials are screened and discussed internal controls. We  also requested USAO referral criteria from the 34 USAO districts that  comprise the six ATF field divisions that received the most denial referrals  from 2011 to 2017. We also analyzed standard and delayed denial  referral data that captured the prohibited categories of the referrals to  those field divisions. Further, we analyzed standard and delayed denial  case data for the investigations that were referred for prosecution for  fiscal years 2015 through 2017, and those that were ultimately  prosecuted.

Typically, a case is placed in \u201cpend\u201d status because the record is missing  information necessary to make a final determination.

After PSP began investigating all firearms denials in 2014,  according to PSP officials, the number of denials remained largely the  same, but the number of investigations rose from 620 to 4,154. PSP  officials told us they believe that the policy to investigate all denials acts  as a deterrent, and that as prohibited individuals learn that investigations  follow a denial these individuals will not attempt to purchase a firearm.", "According to PSP officials, as PICS refers all confirmed firearms denials  for investigation, PICS does not use screening criteria to make  determinations about whether firearms denials should be referred for  investigation, or which denials are more likely to be accepted for  prosecution. However, PICS does prioritize and determine which denials  involve more serious criminal violations. According to PSP\u2019s Firearms  Unit staff, many referrals are not pursued based on the investigator\u2019s  assessment of the case or a prosecutor\u2019s declination of the case when  the referral was received.", "The PSP partners with local law enforcement to investigate firearms  denials. Investigations are split up between the PSP and municipal police  departments based on the jurisdiction of where the applicant submitted  the firearms purchase. In 2016, 68 percent of cases referred for  investigation were referred to state police, while 32 percent were referred  to local law enforcement. In 2017, cases referred to local law enforcement  increased to 62 percent, while 38 percent were referred to state police. If  the subject is federally prohibited, a case may be referred to ATF for  investigation, though based on our analysis this is relatively uncommon.  In 2015 and 2016, 16 and 5 cases, respectively, were referred to ATF for  investigation, while in 2017 one case was referred to ATF.", "Firearms denials are automatically funneled into a state investigative  database where an investigation file is created according to PSP officials.  When a denial is referred to a PSP troop for investigation, it is assigned  to a state investigator if the state police has jurisdiction. If local law  enforcement has jurisdiction, the PSP troop or PSP investigation staff will  pass the referral to local law enforcement, according to PSP officials.  Though some PSP units have investigators that specialize in firearm  denials cases, generally denial investigations are assigned to the next  available investigator, according to PSP officials.", "After an investigation is assigned, the investigator will review all provided  documentation and verify that the subject is actually prohibited, according  to PSP officials. The investigator will then pull an incident number and  take steps to obtain necessary documentation. The investigator will then  respond to the location of the violation, review the ATF Form 4473, and  attempt to interview the employee who handled the attempted  transaction. Finally, the investigator will locate and interview the subject of  the denial. Cases are not prioritized for investigation because all firearms  denials are investigated and are immediately assigned to an investigator  upon receipt from PICS, according to PSP officials. While no denial  categories are designated as priority, protective orders may be  investigated more vigorously when there is an indication of violence,  according to PSP officials. PSP does not track the length of time or  resources required for conducting investigations of firearms purchase  denials, according to PSP officials.", "Some jurisdictions may send the subject a letter to notify them that they  are prohibited and under investigation, according to PSP officials. Other  jurisdictions may send a letter only when prosecutors decide not to press  charges, explaining to the recipient why they were denied, that they are  not eligible to purchase a firearm, and that they could have been  prosecuted for that reason.", "If the case is considered for prosecution, the investigator may meet with  the District Attorney\u2019s office and review the case for prosecutorial merit,  according to PSP officials. If prosecution is sought, the investigator will  type up the charges, process the subject, and arraign.

District Attorneys may also refer cases for prosecution to the State  Attorney General due to lack of resources or a conflict of interest. Trials  for firearms denials are extremely rare in Pennsylvania, according to  prosecutors that we spoke with.

Based on our  discussions with Pennsylvania prosecutors and PSP Firearms Division  staff, most cases that are prosecuted result in misdemeanor pleas, rather  than felony convictions, and common penalties are probation and fines.  One county prosecutor told us that most convictions reduced to a  misdemeanor are for \u201cstatement under penalty,\u201d a third degree  misdemeanor. Other cases might be pled down to misdemeanor  disorderly conduct, which carries a $300 fine, according to PSP officials.  According to county prosecutors that we spoke with, there is an  occasional prison sentence for denied felons which can result in about 12  months in prison, and have resulted in sentences of almost 2 years in  prison.", "One prosecutor told us the most frequent firearms prohibitor among  convictions is a crime punishable by greater than 1 year in prison, such  as a second or subsequent DUI conviction within 10 years, as many of  those are graded as misdemeanors of the first degree, punishable by up  to 5 years in prison. Typically, when asked, these individuals are unaware  of the maximum penalty. Another state prosecutor we spoke with stated  that the most prosecuted prohibiting categories also involved felony DUIs,  as well as matters related to mental health and domestic violence.

The FTC is the federally designated point of contact  for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and  is responsible for any investigations of firearms denials. The Virginia  State Police (VSP) is responsible for conducting background checks  using VCheck, Virginia\u2019s Internet-based instant background check  program, and for enforcing state and federal laws related to firearms  purchases in Virginia. Under Virginia law, generally, a licensed dealer is  required to obtain written consent and other identifying information\u2014 including but not limited to the name, date of birth, gender, race,  citizenship, and Social Security number of a potential unlicensed  purchaser\u2014and provide the Department of State Police with this  information and request criminal history record information by a telephone  call to or other communication authorized by the State Police prior to  selling, renting, trading, or transferring any firearm from the dealer\u2019s  inventory.", "The FTC provides personnel to conduct transactions onsite at anticipated  high volume gun shows. Pursuant to Virginia law, the Department of State  Police are to be available at every firearms show held in Virginia to make  determinations, in accordance with the procedures set out for background  checks required for the transfer of certain firearms, of whether a  prospective purchaser or transferee is prohibited under state or federal  law from possessing a firearm. One prosecutor we spoke with estimated  that 25 percent of his illegal possession cases are from private sales at  gun shows. At a gun show, when an individual attempts to purchase a  firearm from a licensed dealer, the individual has to complete the state  background check form (SP-65B) and the federal form (ATF 4473) and  the FTC will conduct a full NICS check. Should the transaction be denied,  the trooper may arrest the applicant depending on the reason for the  denial. A Virginia prosecutor explained that in his jurisdiction when two  private parties, neither of whom is a FFL, initiate a sale outside of the  state transaction system, troopers may approach the purchaser and ask  questions related to his or her eligibility to purchase a firearm. If the  purchaser appears to be prohibited based on their testimony they may be  subject to arrest as well.", "Process for Conducting a Background Check  For transactions conducted through an FFL, the gun dealer submits a  background check request to VSP via a toll free number or through an  online application. Upon receipt of the request, VSP reviews the  applicant\u2019s criminal record information to determine if the applicant is  prohibited from possessing or transporting a firearm by state or federal  law. This check includes a review of an applicant\u2019s entire criminal history,  with no exclusion based on when the prohibiting offense occurred,  according to FTC officials. For example, a recent prohibiting felony  conviction is treated the same as the same conviction from decades ago.", "The applicant\u2019s information is submitted to the FTC, where it is checked  against databases at the federal and state level. Information is screened  through NICS, National Crime Information Center, and the Virginia  Criminal Information Network. The FTC provides an instant response to  approve the transaction or place it in delayed, research status. Databases  maintained by VSP and accessible by the Virginia Criminal Information  Network include:", "Virginia\u2019s wanted and missing persons files and protective orders;", "Virginia\u2019s criminal history record files; and", "Virginia\u2019s database of adjudications of legal incompetence and  incapacity, and involuntary commitments to mental institutions.", "If the instant VCheck search indicates that the purchaser is approved, a  unique computer-generated approval number that is required to transfer  the firearm is provided to the dealer to complete the transaction. If a  possible identification is made in the state or federal databases, the  instant check produces a \u201cdelayed\u201d status and a review is conducted to  determine identification and eligibility of the purchaser. If a background  check enters delayed status, the dealer will be requested to provide  additional information about the purchaser. The dealer is to be notified  immediately upon a final determination of eligibility. Pursuant to federal  law, if the dealer has not been notified of a final determination by the end  of the third business day, the dealer may complete the sale and transfer  of the firearm. If a firearm is transferred prior to a final determination of  eligibility, the dealer is requested to notify VSP immediately. When a  delayed transaction is ultimately approved or denied, the FTC updates  the dealer on the status of the transaction by telephone or online  depending on how it was entered. When research efforts have been  exhausted, if no clear reason to deny is identified, the transaction is  approved. More than 99 percent of delayed applications are resolved  before 30 days, according to FTC officials.", "All transactions that are not immediately approved and enter delayed  status are assigned a priority level, based on the possible prohibiting  category. Virginia investigates a subset of all denials based on risk, but  prioritizes denials with active warrants, active protection orders, mental  health issues, and certain felony convictions. According to VSP officials, a  \u201cpriority 1\u201d transaction is a possible hit for mental health reasons, a  protective order, or a possible wanted subject. A \u201cpriority 2\u201d transaction is  any possible hit in NICS, such as convicted felons and out-of-state mental  health cases. A \u201cpriority 3\u201d transaction is any hit in the Interstate  Identification Index, or Virginia\u2019s Computerized Criminal History.  According to VSP officials, convicted felons are normally a priority 3  unless they appear in the NICS database. A \u201cpriority 4\u201d transaction is a hit  from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, namely an alien or  immigrant attempting to purchase a firearm, or a possible request for  information, such as a Be On The Lookout or Alert notice, from a police  agency or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  (ATF). According to VSP officials, while a transaction may be given an  initial priority level, VSP moves some priority 3 and 4 hits to the front of  the list, such as those involving recent felony indictments or a  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Denial decisions undergo  supervisory review to verify that the denial is correct and accurate,  including a review of the police report to document findings, and to ensure  that the prohibited person\u2019s rights have not been restored, according to  VSP officials.", "According to a VSP official, in practice, there are rarely any transactions  in Virginia in which a firearm is transferred before the purchaser is  determined to be ineligible, known as a delayed denial. According to an  FTC official, there were no delayed denials in the previous 2 years. After  3 business days of conducting a background check, at which time  firearms dealers may transfer a firearm, firearms dealers typically contact  the FTC to notify them of the possible transfer, and ask whether to hold  the gun for a few more days, according to VSP officials. If the FTC  believes the purchaser will ultimately be denied, they will suggest the  firearm be held, but it is up to the dealer to decide whether to do so. The  FTC will also ask to speak with the purchaser to explain that if they  accept the firearm and are later denied, VSP would have to send an  officer to retrieve the firearm and charges may be filed against the  purchaser for illegal possession of the firearm. VSP will then advise that if  unsure of his or her prohibited status, the applicant should wait until the  background check is complete.", "According to a VSP official, there are advantages to being a point-of- contact state, such as the ability to provide better service to citizens and  to build relationships with FFLs that would not be possible as a NICS  state. For example, VSP conducts training sessions and regular outreach  to firearms dealers. VSP officials estimate that in 80 percent of cases  involving firearms purchases on behalf of a prohibited person, sometimes  referred to as \u201cstraw purchases,\u201d leads come from dealers notifying VSP  of something suspicious. According to VSP officials, straw purchases are  treated very seriously, and can result in prison sentences of 5 to 10  years. Figure 9 shows the process for purchasing a firearm from a dealer  in Virginia.", "Individuals denied the right to purchase a firearm may exercise a right of  access, review, and correction of criminal history record information or  institute a civil action within 30 days of the denial. Typically, after a  denial, individuals are provided a Virginia Firearms Transaction Program  brochure or referred to the VSP website for appeal procedures if they  believe that they are not prohibited by state or federal law from  purchasing or possessing a firearm. These individuals may contact the  FTC via phone or e-mail to discuss the determination and provide  additional information, provide fingerprinting to facilitate future  transactions, request a correction of record, or institute a civil action.

The  trooper then collects necessary information, such as information about  the denial from VCheck, the criminal history of the purchaser, and court  records.

However, most areas either  cannot afford to remove a trooper from road coverage availability, or don\u2019t  investigate enough firearms denial cases to make it an effective use of  resources. These sections assign denial investigations to troopers on a  case by case basis.", "Prosecutors are often consulted as to whether a case will be prosecuted,  where the prosecutor comments on the strength of the case based on the  evidence available, according to investigators and prosecutors we spoke  with. Investigators told us that prosecutors are generally more agreeable  to taking on firearms denial cases involving recent felony convictions.", "They also said that if the case is accepted for prosecution, the trooper will  obtain warrants to make an arrest. If the Commonwealth Attorney finds  that the case does not have prosecutorial merit, the case is closed and  the name of the Commonwealth Attorney consulted is put in the case  management system report, according to a VSP official. Table 6 shows  Virginia denial investigations from fiscal years 2011 through 2017.", "According to VSP officials, the time spent on denial investigations  depends on the type of denial, location, and the information needed to  bring charges or close the case. However, on average a case may  involve about 4 hours of investigation. Officials in another division stated  that in-state convictions can range from 4 to 6 hours of investigative work,  while out-of-state convictions can take significantly more time, from 4 to  15 hours. Obtaining records from out of state can be difficult, and can  take weeks or months. For example, one state requires a fee per  conviction copy, which requires a check to be mailed, processed, and  then for the files to be mailed back to the investigator. VSP officials told  us that cases involving straw purchases can take 50 hours or more,  however, these cases can result in longer prison sentences of 5 to 10  years. They added that additional time may be spent on search  warrants, examining video from firearms stores, reviewing phone records,  and conducting interviews. Further, denial investigations involving  dishonorable discharges and mental health denials from out of state  typically take the longest to investigate, in part because some states  won\u2019t release these records for the purpose of prosecution.
