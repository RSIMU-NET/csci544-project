Specifically, its analysis was not sufficiently accurate, comprehensive, documented, or validated. A primary weakness is that the estimate is largely based an assumption--known as the transition traffic factor--that 76 percent of the services provided under the current contracts would be moved to a different provider under the Networx contracts. However, according to program officials, this assumption is intentionally conservative and represents a worst-case scenario that is unlikely to occur. Additionally, GSA may have double-counted a cost and did not update its analysis to reflect a nearly 2-year delay. Finally, GSA did not document significant assumptions and data sources used in its analysis, or validate it. These weaknesses can be attributed in part to the lack of a cost estimation policy that reflects best practices. While GSA's intentionally conservative approach minimizes the risk that it would have inadequate funds to pay for committed transition costs, it increases the risk that GSA will retain excess funds that could be used for other purposes. GSA has accumulated adequate funding to support its anticipated transition costs. As of fiscal year-end 2006, GSA had approximately $142 million in a transition reserve. GAO analysis of the estimate indicates it is unlikely that GSA will need more than it has already accumulated to fund the transition. Specifically, the $142 million already retained will be adequate to cover anticipated costs 96 percent of the time. The recent merger of two GSA funds gives the agency additional flexibility that reduces its need to accumulate the entire $151.5 million it estimated would be needed. With Networx contracts scheduled to be awarded starting in March 2007, GSA will soon have the information necessary to reassess the main assumption underlying its estimate--the transition traffic factor--and address the weaknesses GAO identified. Once this has been accomplished, GSA can reevaluate the funding needed to meet anticipated commitments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As innovations in telecommunications services continue to transform the  way the federal government conducts business, the General Services  Administration\u2019s (GSA) governmentwide telecommunications acquisition  programs offer federal agencies the opportunity to apply innovative  services and solutions to their operations.

To  accomplish the first objective, we conducted a search of over 250  documents from both government and industry for examples of best  practices in the field of cost estimation and identified common  characteristics among them. We determined that high-quality, reliable  estimates should be accurate, comprehensive, well-documented, and  validated. Using these characteristics, we analyzed transition estimate  documentation developed by GSA, documentation provided by GSA on the  previous transition, the Networx Request for Proposals, and other relevant  documents. To accomplish the second objective, we analyzed financial  and operational documents from related GSA programs. In addition, we  interviewed GSA program officials about both objectives and conducted  an analysis of GSA\u2019s estimate to examine the effects of varying the main  cost driver in the estimate. We conducted our work at GSA\u2019s Washington,  D.C., area headquarters between June 2006 and January 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

An  option chosen by more than 135 agencies is the FTS2001 program, which  consists of two large governmentwide telecommunications contracts\u2014one  awarded to Sprint in December 1998 and the other to MCI in January  1999\u2014and FTS2001 crossover contracts.", "GSA is planning to replace the FTS2001 contracts, FTS2001 crossover  contracts, and separate wireless contracts with a new set of contracts.  Collectively known as the Networx program, these new contracts are to  provide governmentwide telecommunications services through two  indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity acquisitions\u2014Networx Universal  and Networx Enterprise. The Universal acquisition is expected to satisfy  the requirements for a full range of national and international network  services and, according to GSA, to ensure the continuity of broad-ranging  services with global geographic coverage rendered under expiring  contracts. The Enterprise acquisition is expected to offer agencies  leading-edge services and solutions with less extensive geographic and  service requirements than Universal. The services required in these  contracts focus on Internet-based offerings and related security and  management services.", "GSA expects the transition to begin when Networx Universal awards are  made in March 2007 and to continue until fiscal year 2010. Because the  FTS2001 contracts with Sprint Nextel Corporation and Verizon Business  expired in December 2006 and January 2007, respectively, GSA and the  incumbent vendors negotiated separate sole-source contracts that  essentially extend the terms of the FTS2001 contracts for 42 months.  These sole-source contracts were awarded to ensure uninterrupted service  and allow agencies adequate time to complete the transition to Networx.", "GSA is working with representatives of federal agencies to prepare for the  upcoming transition to Networx, both directly and through the  Interagency Management Council (IMC), a group of senior federal  information resource officials who advise GSA on issues related to  telecommunications contracts. The IMC has worked with GSA to  document lessons learned from the transition to FTS2001 that began in the  late 1990s, GSA\u2019s most recent governmentwide telecommunications  transition. One important lesson learned was that GSA and agency plans  for funding transition expenses should be determined early to allow  agencies to gauge the impact of transition expenses on their budgets.  Specifically, the lessons-learned document recommended that guidelines  be established to allow agencies to complete the financial planning  required to ensure that the resources needed for transition were available.  This led the IMC and GSA to develop a Taxonomy and Allocation of  Transition Costs document that identified which Networx transition costs  would be borne by GSA and which would be borne by transitioning  agencies.", "This taxonomy document indicated that GSA will incur or reimburse  agencies, including:    GSA contractor support costs to, for example, aid in planning for the  transition and oversight of Networx contractors. GSA officials also  indicated that contractor support will be used to develop a methodology  for tracking transition progress and the establishment of a transition  coordination center; and   certain costs incurred by agencies during transition.", "In 2004, following the development of the taxonomy document, GSA  generated an estimate of its costs for the transition. GSA\u2019s methodology  for its estimate was to:    develop assumptions for the estimate,    define and develop a baseline for the estimate based on experiences and  lessons learned from the previous transition,    determine the network growth as well as the total business volume  projections for fiscal year 2006 based on historical traffic and cost trends,   define the transition cost elements,    define and develop a formula for calculating an estimate for each cost  element, and   design and develop the estimated transition cost model for sensitivity  analysis.", "Using this methodology, GSA estimated that it would need a total of $151.5  million for a 30-month transition, most of which would be used to  reimburse agencies\u2019 transition costs. Table 1 below details the transition  costs GSA expects to pay.", "GSA planned to pay for its costs and the reimbursement of certain agency  costs using its Information Technology (IT) Fund. The IT Fund was a full- cost recovery revolving fund whereby GSA fully recovered all costs of its  technology programs and its operations via estimated fee rates. The fees,  which are charged to agencies for the use of GSA contracts cover the  direct costs of its operations\u2014such as the development and management  of contract vehicles\u2014and indirect costs associated with its headquarters,  such as support for the Offices of the Chief Information Officer and the  Chief Financial Officer. The IT Fund allowed GSA to stabilize rates for its  services when expenses varied and was used to provide funding for the  previous transition to FTS2001. The IT Fund also contained a working  capital reserve that was used to offset losses due to fluctuations in  business volumes and other unexpected contingencies. At each fiscal year- end, the uncommitted balance of funds remaining was to be transferred to  the general fund of the treasury as miscellaneous receipts.", "Recently, a new law changed the structure of the IT Fund and GSA\u2019s  organization. On October 6, 2006, the General Services Administration  Modernization Act combined the IT Fund with another GSA revolving  fund\u2014the General Supply Fund\u2014to create the Acquisition Services Fund.  This legislation, which also merged GSA\u2019s technology and supply  programs, made all capital assets and balances remaining in the IT and  General Supply Funds available for the purposes of the Acquisition  Services Fund.

Further,  the analysis has not been updated after a nearly 2-year delay in the  contract award. While GSA appears to have included all pertinent costs, it  may have double-counted a cost, calling into question the  comprehensiveness of its analysis. In addition, GSA did not document  significant assumptions and data. Finally, GSA\u2019s analysis was not validated  by an independent cost estimate nor was an uncertainty analysis  performed that would allow GSA to quantify the level of confidence it has  in its estimate.

First, the estimate\u2019s main cost driver is based on the  assumption that agencies will transition 76 percent of the services  acquired under the current FTS2001 contracts to a different provider  under Networx\u201460 percent due to agencies being forced to change  providers and 16 percent due to voluntary changes. However, according to  program officials, the 76 percent \u201ctransition traffic factor\u201d is intentionally  conservative and represents a worst-case scenario that is unlikely to  occur.", "The 76 percent transition traffic factor is also overly conservative when  compared with the previous transition. Then, approximately 60 percent of  services were shifted from an incumbent to a different provider under  FTS2001, the bulk being forced to change providers when an incumbent  providing more than half of the services (AT&T) was not awarded an  FTS2001 contract. This forced shift happened in part because GSA limited  the FTS2001 awards to only two vendors. In contrast, GSA has placed no  such limit on the number of Networx vendors, and therefore, all  incumbent FTS2001 vendors could potentially be awarded a Networx  contract. Further, because the most-used FTS2001 incumbent (Verizon  Business) provides approximately 50 percent of the services under the  current FTS2001 contracts, the assumption of a 60 percent forced shift  would only be realized if no awards were made to Verizon Business and at  least one other incumbent. Finally, GSA\u2019s assumption of a 16 percent  voluntary shift is significantly higher than the 3 percent that voluntarily  changed providers during the previous transition.", "Program officials could not identify any basis for the assumption that  voluntary changes will reach 16 percent. However, the officials stated that  the percentage of voluntary changes could be higher because agencies will  likely have more options when selecting vendors and because of improved  guidance on federal requirements regarding the fair opportunity process,  which is intended to give each awardee an equal opportunity to compete  for agencies\u2019 telecommunications services requirements based on  agency-established selection criteria.", "Second, the analysis has not been updated to reflect schedule changes.  When the estimate was developed in 2004, GSA expected to award the first  Networx Universal contracts in mid-2005. Since that time, delays have  pushed the time frame back almost 2 years. Universal awards are now  expected in March 2007. GSA\u2019s analysis has not been adjusted to reflect  additional inflation during this period, which could increase the estimates  total by as much as $9 million.", "Finally, GSA has not revised its analysis to reflect an assessment of most  likely costs using currently available information. The analysis assumes  that reimbursable agency transition costs would be greater than during the  previous transition due to growth in the volume of services ordered. While  GSA estimated that service levels would grow 60 percent over the previous  transition by the time of contract award, as of August 2006, service levels  had actually grown by 55.9 percent and are now expected to remain stable.  The overestimation of service growth added approximately $1.7 million to  the estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Analysis May Not Be Comprehensive", "paragraphs": ["Estimates are comprehensive when their level of detail ensures that all  pertinent costs are included and no costs are double-counted.

For several of the transition costs estimated,  GSA based its calculations on the actual charges incurred during the  previous transition. However, officials indicated that a specific agency  cost that is estimated separately in its current estimate may have already  been included in a more general category of its previous costs. Despite this  uncertainty, GSA calculated the separate total for this specific agency cost  based on current service levels and added it to its estimate.

In addition, GSA  could not document the data sources used to estimate costs for contractor  support in planning and implementing the transition. While many costs in  its estimate are based on the charges incurred during the previous  transition, GSA officials stated that it was not appropriate to use previous  costs as a basis for the contractor cost element. These officials explained  that unlike the previous transition, GSA would not provide agencies with  on-site contractor support. Officials made this decision, in part, because  the 2\u00bd years of transition planning that has occurred to date is expected to  result in better preparation by agencies and the ability for them to  facilitate their transitions without direct assistance from GSA or its  contractors. Instead of basing their projection of contractor costs on prior  charges, program officials told us that GSA management decided that  contractor support costs should not exceed $35 million.

Because this factor is the primary cost driver in the  estimate, significant changes in transitioning traffic result in similarly  significant changes in total costs. This effect can be illustrated using GSA\u2019s  transition cost estimate model (see fig. 1). For example, if a transition  traffic factor of 66 percent is used (GSA\u2019s assumption of 16 percent for a  voluntary transition plus a forced shift of 50 percent that would occur if  Verizon Business is not awarded a Networx contract), the total estimated  cost of the transition falls to about $136 million. Similarly, if all  incumbents are awarded Networx contracts and only GSA\u2019s assumption of  a 16 percent voluntary transition occurs, the total estimated cost of the  transition is reduced to approximately $40 million.

Instead, the officials that prepared the estimate stated that they based  their work loosely on best practices learned as a result of past experiences  and were comfortable with the estimate. Officials believe there is no  reason to revise their estimate to address the issues we raised in this  report because their purpose in producing it was to minimize the risk of  underestimating costs.

The  uncertainty analysis we performed on GSA\u2019s cost estimate indicates that  the funding GSA has already accumulated will most likely be adequate to  pay for expected transition costs. By varying the transition traffic factor,  our analysis indicates that the $142 million already retained should be  adequate to cover expected expenses 96 percent of the time. Figure 2  illustrates the probability that a particular level of funding will be adequate  to account for the total actual costs incurred. For example, the $151.5  million estimate represents a confidence level of 100 percent: there is  almost no chance that costs will exceed the estimate. The full detail of our  methodology is detailed in appendix II.", "The merger of the IT and General Supply Funds provides GSA with  additional flexibility, further reducing the need to retain the entire amount  of the estimate. As discussed, legislation combined the two funds into an  Acquisition Services Fund, making their capital assets and balances  available for the purposes of the new Federal Acquisition Service. The  legislation also allows the Federal Acquisition Service to establish a  reserve to retain surplus revenues from GSA\u2019s technology and service  programs specifically for the purpose of offsetting losses and other  unexpected contingencies. Further, at the end of each year, the statute  requires GSA to return to the Treasury any funds not expended or held in a  working capital reserve. During fiscal year 2006, GSA\u2019s technology  programs experienced losses, but its supply programs reported overall  positive earnings of approximately $126 million. If operations continue in  this fashion, excess revenue will be available in the combined fund to  offset losses or account for contingencies, such as the Networx transition,  be retained within the Acquisition Services Fund, or be returned to the  Treasury.", "With Networx contracts scheduled to be awarded starting in March 2007,  GSA will soon be in a position to reassess its main assumption, the  transition traffic factor, and the resulting level of funding needed to meet  anticipated commitments.

In addition,  the merger of two revolving funds gives it increased flexibility in meeting  costs.

To verify the reliability of these records, we obtained and analyzed the  results of the most recent GSA financial audits and audit reports from  GSA\u2019s Inspector General, and we interviewed GSA\u2019s independent financial  auditor regarding the quality control procedures in place. The independent  auditor did not specifically review the dollar amounts in the Information  Technology or General Supply Funds for accuracy but did test the controls  in place for compliance with laws and regulations.

By examining the effects of varying the estimates  elements, a degree of uncertainty about the estimate can be expressed,  possibly as an estimated range or qualified by some factor of confidence.  For example, an estimate that produces a 100 percent confidence level  indicates that, based on the methodology used to create that estimate,  there is almost no chance that costs will exceed the estimate.", "We performed our uncertainty analysis on GSA\u2019s estimate using a Monte  Carlo simulation.

For this factor, we chose a minimum of 3 percent,  which represents the voluntary shift to a different vendor that occurred  during GSA\u2019s previous transition to FTS2001. For the maximum, we used  76 percent, as this value was chosen by GSA officials as a worst-case  scenario in an effort to mitigate the risks of underestimating costs.
