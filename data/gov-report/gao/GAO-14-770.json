Specifically, the majority of stakeholders rated FAA as moderately to very capable of operating an efficient ATC system, but the majority also rated FAA as only marginally to moderately capable of implementing NextGen, FAA's initiative to modernize the system. Almost all (75) of the stakeholders identified challenges that they believe FAA faces, particularly in implementing the NextGen initiatives. These challenges included difficulty in (1) convincing reluctant aircraft owners to invest in the aircraft technology necessary to benefit from NextGen (46 stakeholders) and (2) mitigating the effects of an uncertain fiscal environment (43 stakeholders). FAA officials acknowledged and generally agreed with these challenges.", "Sixty four stakeholders suggested a range of changes they believe could improve the efficiency of ATC operations and NextGen's implementation. The change stakeholders suggested most often was to modify how FAA's ATC operations and NextGen programs are funded, including the need to ensure that FAA has a predictable and long-term funding source. Other suggested changes were to improve human capital activities, such as air traffic controllers' training, and improve coordination with industry stakeholders. GAO has reported on these issues in the past, and in some cases, made recommendations, with which FAA concurred but has not yet implemented. GAO also asked stakeholders whether separating ATC services from FAA, such as the privatization of the ATC service provider, was an option; 27 of the stakeholders believed it was an option; another 26 believed it was an option, but had significant reservations about such a change. Support for this option was mixed among categories of stakeholders (see table below). Stakeholders identified several issues that would need to be taken into account before making any changes to the provision of ATC services, including lessons learned from other countries, funding sources for such a system, and the extent of Congress's role in overseeing a separate ATC system.", "a Maybe represents stakeholders who qualified their \u201cYes\u201d responses with significant reservations.", "b Included in this other category are three industry categories with fewer than four stakeholders\u2014Research & Development Organizations, Other Federal Agencies, and Passenger and Safety Groups."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) handles over 50,000 flights a  day and more than 700 million passengers each year and is generally  considered not only the busiest and most complex air traffic control  system in the world but also the safest.

However, over the past two decades,  U.S. aviation stakeholders have debated whether the FAA should be the  entity in the United States that operates and modernizes the air traffic  control (ATC) system. Since its inception in 1958, FAA has overseen the  entire NAS, owning and operating the ATC system and regulating  industry safety, aircraft, and operations. In 1995, Congress considered  reforming FAA in response to government and industry frustration with  the agency's slow pace in modernizing the ATC system and concerns  about constrained spending for aviation due to efforts to reduce the  budget deficit. Similar conditions exist today: the recent constrained fiscal  environment has forced federal agencies\u2014including FAA\u2014to cut their  spending through budget sequestration and employee furloughs. At the  same time, the current ATC system continues to use aging technologies  and infrastructure\u2014such as analog communications and ground-based  radar\u2014and FAA continues to face challenges modernizing the ATC  system through its Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen)  initiative. These conditions have rekindled industry debate about whether  (1) organizational changes need to be made within FAA and (2)  alternative NAS structures\u2014such as making FAA an independent agency  or commercializing ATC services\u2014could provide ATC services, as well as  modernize the ATC system, more efficiently.", "You requested that we gather U.S. aviation industry views on FAA\u2019s ATC  system operations and modernization.

According to a 2012 comparison of air traffic  management performance between FAA and the combined 37 ANSPs of  Europe, the United States had a similar arrival punctuality rate with  Europe for a similar amount of continental airspace. Another international  comparison, completed in 2013, of performance data from FAA and 22  global ANSPs showed similar results, with FAA ranking second in  productivity. However, it is difficult to compare performance, as air  spaces are different. For example, FAA\u2019s ATC system controls about 60  percent more flights than Europe, its airspace is nearly twice as dense as  that of the European ANSPs, and it has 23 percent fewer air traffic  controllers.

We have  chronicled the difficulties FAA has faced completing what it envisioned  initially in 1981 as a 10-year program to upgrade and replace NAS  facilities and equipment. For example, in August 1995, we found  substantial cost and schedule overruns. To address these difficulties, in  the past, Congress gave FAA acquisition and human capital flexibilities to  improve the agency\u2019s management of the modernization program.  Specifically, in 1995, Congress directed FAA to implement new  acquisition and personnel management systems and exempted the  agency from certain federal acquisition and personnel laws and rules. In  June 2005, we found that FAA had largely implemented these  flexibilities.", "However, modernization difficulties persisted, and Congress directed FAA  in 2003 to conceptualize and plan NextGen. NextGen was envisioned at  that time as a major redesign of the air transportation system to increase  efficiency, enhance safety, and reduce flight delays. NextGen is planned  to incorporate precision satellite navigation and surveillance; digital,  networked communications; an integrated weather system; and more.  This complex undertaking requires acquiring new integrated air traffic  control systems; developing new flight procedures, standards, and  regulations; and creating and maintaining new supporting infrastructure.  This transformation is designed to dramatically change the roles and  responsibilities of both air traffic controllers and pilots and change the way  they interface with their systems. The involvement of airlines and other  aviation stakeholders is also critical, since full implementation of NextGen  will necessitate airlines and others to invest in new avionics and other  technologies to take advantage of NextGen technologies. See figure 3 for  the expected benefits from NextGen implementation as depicted through  improvements to the phases of flight.", "In addition, to address stakeholder and congressional concerns over  NextGen management practices and the pace of modernization efforts  over the last decade, FAA has reorganized several times.

Full  implementation of NextGen will necessitate that system users make  significant investment in new technologies. FAA estimated in 2013 that, of  the estimated $18.1-billion overall implementation cost that is to be  shared between airlines and FAA, airlines would need to invest $6.6  billion on avionics to realize the full potential benefits from NextGen  capabilities. Forty-six of the stakeholders we interviewed raised this  issue as a challenge for FAA, such as in convincing users to equip their  aircraft with avionics to take advantage of NextGen technologies.  Stakeholders explained that users have been reluctant to equip their  aircraft due to the expense and uncertainty over FAA\u2019s ability to meet  timelines for deploying NextGen technologies. In April 2013, we found  that airlines and other stakeholders had expressed skepticism about the  progress FAA had made to date in implementing NextGen technologies,  skepticism that, in turn, had affected their confidence about whether  benefits would justify these investments. While some stakeholders  agreed that equipping aircraft is necessary for successful and continuous  modernization, they differed in who bore responsibility for paying for  equipage\u2014users or FAA. In August 2013, we noted that the 2012 FAA  Modernization and Reform Act required FAA to report on options to  encourage equipping aircraft with NextGen technologies and the costs  and benefits of each option. FAA officials we interviewed said that they  have completed the installation of the ground infrastructure for Automatic  Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and that aviation system  users, in turn, must equip their aircraft with ADS-B Out avionics by the  FAA\u2019s 2020 equipage deadline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigating the Effects of an Uncertain Fiscal Environment", "paragraphs": ["Both the aviation stakeholders and FAA officials we interviewed regard  budget uncertainty as a challenge for FAA. Forty-three stakeholders  raised budget uncertainty as a difficulty for FAA\u2019s ability to continue  operation of an efficient ATC system and/or implementation of NextGen.  One factor stakeholders raised as contributing to budget uncertainties is  the annual appropriations process. In all but 3 of the last 30 years,  Congress has passed \u201ccontinuing resolutions\u201d to provide funding for  agencies to continue operating until agreement is reached on final  appropriations. Further, according to the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, prior to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act  of 2012, FAA had operated under 22 extensions, that provided short-term  funding for the agency since the expiration of the 2007 Aviation  Authorization legislation. According to some stakeholders, the stops and  starts associated with continuing resolutions make it difficult for FAA to  carry out long-term planning and strategic development of future  technologies and innovation. We found in September 2009 and March  2013 that continuing resolutions can create budget uncertainty for  agencies about both when they will receive their final appropriation and  what level of funding will ultimately be available. We further found that  operating under continuing resolutions can also complicate agency  operations and cause inefficiencies, such as leading to repetitive work,  limiting agencies\u2019 decision-making options, and making trade-offs more  difficult. On the other hand, attempting to mitigate the effects of an  unpredictable funding stream is not a new challenge for FAA, or for many  other federal agencies that have had to operate in times of an uncertain  fiscal environment.", "Stakeholders also indicated that the current budgetary conditions\u2014the  fiscal year 2013 budget sequestration (the across-the-board cancellation  of budgetary resources) along with the associated employee furloughs  and the October 2013 government shutdown\u2014have made FAA\u2019s funding  less predictable. In turn, this can make it difficult for FAA to run a 24/7  operation and maintain the ATC system as part of the transition to  NextGen. In March 2014, we detailed the effects of the fiscal year 2013  budget sequestration on federal agencies, including FAA, such as  reducing or delaying some public services and disrupting some  operations. We found that the DOT took actions to minimize the effects  of sequestration on FAA operations by beginning to plan for it during the  summer of 2012, focusing on ensuring the safety of the traveling public,  according to DOT officials. DOT halted these actions when it was  provided with statutory authority to make a one-time transfer of $253  million between budget accounts to address these issues. As a result of  this transfer, FAA minimized the number of planned furlough days and  restored ATC services and other aviation activities; however, these efforts  did not prevent delays from occurring in major metropolitan areas\u2014 including New York, Chicago, and Southern California\u2014according to  FAA, because fewer controllers were available to manage air traffic.", "FAA senior management generally agreed with the stakeholders\u2019  perspective that unpredictable budgets make planning and managing the  ATC system and NextGen programs difficult and result in delays and  inefficiencies. The senior managers did not offer specific solutions;  however, they indicated that if FAA received more funding that was  available across fiscal years, rather than just for one fiscal year at a  time, and had a greater ability to move funds between accounts, FAA  would be able to improve its operations and NextGen implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Human Capital Activities to Meet Future NextGen and Operational Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with what we have found in the past, the stakeholders and  FAA senior management agree that improving human capital activities is  a challenge for FAA.

Officials also said that implementing PBN is one of their top  priorities and is part of an effort to deliver near term-benefits and  capabilities to system users by 2016. Officials explained that they are  working on PBN, through several metroplex-based initiatives, and all  parts of the country will not see PBN benefits at the same time.", "Consistent with what we have found in previous work, stakeholders told  us that FAA needs to deliver benefits of NextGen in the near term. To  convince aviation system users to make investments in NextGen  equipment, FAA must continue to deliver systems, procedures, and  capabilities that demonstrate near-term benefits and returns on users\u2019  investments. Forty stakeholders identified as a challenge FAA\u2019s inability  to articulate to the industry what NextGen is and what near-term benefits  NextGen is going to provide to users. Similarly, in April 2013, we noted  the need for FAA to demonstrate to stakeholders NextGen benefits over  the next few years. For example, we found that FAA had made some  progress in key operational improvement areas, such as upgrading  airborne traffic management to enhance the flow of aircraft in congested  airspace, revising standards to enhance airport capacity, and focusing  FAA\u2019s PBN efforts at priority OAPM sites with airport operations that  have a large effect on the overall efficiency of the NAS. However, we also  found that in pursuing these near-term benefits, FAA had to make trade- offs in selecting sites and did not fully integrate implementation of its  operational improvement efforts at airports. We concluded that because  of the interdependency of the improvements, their limited integration  could also limit benefits in the near term. Accordingly, we recommended,  among other things, that FAA should proactively identify new PBN  procedures for the NAS, based on NextGen goals and targets, and  evaluate external requests so that FAA can select appropriate solutions  and implement guidelines for ensuring timely inclusion of operational  improvements at metroplexes such as OAPMs. DOT concurred with  these recommendations and is working to address them.", "FAA senior managers said they were aware of stakeholders\u2019 desire for  near-term benefits and told us that they either have taken or plan to take  the following steps to address stakeholders\u2019 concerns.", "FAA plans to emphasize \u201chigh priorities\u201d for users based on  recommendations of two FAA advisory committees\u2014the NextGen  Advisory Committee (NAC) and the RTCA (once called the Radio  Technical Commission for Aeronautics).

FAA officials  acknowledged that reducing the \u201cfootprint\u201d of the air traffic control  infrastructure has been difficult but added that they are working on their  first set of facility consolidation recommendations, as required by law, and  will have those recommendations ready by the end of 2014. In August  2013, we found that if aging systems and associated facilities were not  retired, FAA would miss potential opportunities to reduce its overall  maintenance costs at a time when resources needed to maintain both  systems and facilities may become scarcer and recommended that FAA  develop a strategy for implementing the FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Organization\u2019s  (ATO) plans. FAA concurred with this recommendation and is working to  develop such a strategy by September 2014. An example of a facility FAA  plans to close\u2014a very high frequency omnidirectional radio range (VOR)  station\u2014is shown in figure 5."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Industry Stakeholders Suggested Changes That Could Improve ATC System Performance and Modernization and Identified Issues to Be Considered If ATC Operations Were Separated from FAA", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Suggested Changes to Improve Performance of ATC Operations and Modernization of the ATC", "paragraphs": ["Overall, while stakeholders generally thought the current ATC system  was operating at least moderately efficiently under FAA\u2019s leadership,  when asked what potential changes, if any, to FAA could improve the  performance of ATC operations and NextGen implementation, 64 of the  76 stakeholders we interviewed suggested changes. The six most often  suggested changes are discussed below. (See app. V for a list and  examples of the changes to FAA that the stakeholders suggested during  our interviews with them.) Some of these changes address the six  challenges raised by stakeholders previously mentioned, while the rest  address other challenges stakeholders identified.", "Change how FAA Is Funded. The change suggested by the most  stakeholders (36 of the 64 stakeholders who suggested a change) was to  modify how FAA\u2019s ATC operations and NextGen programs are funded. As  discussed earlier, budget uncertainty was raised by stakeholders as a  challenge for FAA\u2019s ATC operations, NextGen modernization, or both.  While 36 stakeholders said a change to the funding process or source of  funding was needed, most focused on the outcome they would like to  see, namely a more stable or predictable funding stream. Fewer  stakeholders (11) offered specific suggestions on how to achieve this  outcome. For example, one stakeholder suggested providing FAA with a  top-line budget number and then allowing FAA to determine how to  allocate resources based on its priorities. FAA officials suggested  changes to the agency\u2019s funding mechanism that could improve FAA\u2019s  ability to operate the ATC system and implement NextGen, including  allowing FAA the flexibility to use funds for their highest priority areas,  increasing the fees for registering aircraft, and authorizing FAA to use  multi-year funds.", "Improve Human Capital Activities. Twenty-four of the 64 stakeholders  who suggested a change suggested human capital improvements.  Stakeholder suggestions included updating the air traffic controller\u2019s  handbook, improving the training air traffic controllers receive on new  technologies, and streamlining the hiring process. For example,  stakeholders said changes were needed to streamline FAA\u2019s air traffic  controller-training programs and to ensure the best applicants are hired,  especially as many current controllers begin to retire. In June 2008, we  reported on FAA\u2019s efforts to hire and train new controllers, in light of the  expected departure, mostly due to retirements, of much of the current air  traffic controller workforce of over 15,000 controllers between 2008 and  2017. We also found FAA needed to ensure that technician- and  controller-training programs were designed to prepare FAA\u2019s workforce to  use NextGen technologies. Regarding updating the air traffic controller\u2019s  handbook, a senior FAA official said that stakeholders do not appreciate  what changing the handbook involves, such as running safety scenarios  and testing new procedures to ensure any changes do not adversely  affect safety. More broadly, another senior FAA official said that shifting to  NextGen would require a cultural change in how air traffic controllers are  trained to respond to traffic.", "Improve Internal Collaboration. Twenty-four of the 64 stakeholders who  suggested a change suggested FAA needs to improve internal  collaboration within the organization. Stakeholders said different offices  within FAA do not communicate well with one another and that this  situation has resulted in difficulties and delays in the roll out of NextGen  technologies and procedures. Stakeholder suggestions included  improving how FAA\u2019s lines of business work together to implement  NextGen. In August 2013, we found that FAA is making progress in  ensuring communication on NextGen issues across lines of business, for  example, through the NextGen Management Board and biweekly  program review meetings. In the same report, we also discussed how  designating one leader, such as the Deputy Administrator\u2019s responsibility  over NextGen, can improve interagency collaboration and speed  decision-making. While external stakeholders raised internal  collaboration as an area in need of improvement, FAA senior  management said that there are good working relationships between the  lines of business responsible for ATC operations and NextGen  implementation, especially between the Assistant Administrator of  NextGen, the COO of the ATO, and the Associate Administrator of  Aviation Safety.", "Streamline Processes. Twenty-three of the 64 stakeholders suggesting  a change suggested that FAA needs to streamline some of its processes.  Stakeholder suggestions included streamlining the development and  implementation of flight navigation procedures, the certification of new  aircraft equipment, and the acquisition of new technology. For example,  to streamline its process for certifying new technology, one stakeholder  said that FAA should use an approach that recognizes that once a type of  equipment, such as an antenna, is found to be safe, every piece of that  equipment produced does not have to be personally inspected by FAA.  FAA officials said that they are making progress streamlining both the  certification of new technology and development of new procedures;  however, FAA must ensure that new procedures and technology are  evaluated for potential safety and environmental concerns and that  community outreach occurs. In April 2013, we found that FAA\u2019s  processes and requirements, while keeping the U.S. airspace safe, are  also complex and lengthy. This includes the processes for developing  PBN and other new flight navigation procedures. In the April 2013 report,  we also found that FAA had efforts under way to address some of these  issues, such as the Navigation Lean (NAV Lean) initiative, which is  focused on streamlining the implementation and amendment processes  for all flight procedures, but it will be several years before the impact is  known. In June 2014, the Department of Transportation Inspector  General\u2019s office found that aviation stakeholders are unlikely to see the  full benefits of the NAV Lean initiative, namely a reduction in the time it  takes to implement new procedures, until September 2015 or later. In  October 2010 and October 2013, we found inefficiencies in the  certification and approvals process and variations in FAA\u2019s interpretation  of certification standards, and recommended improvements FAA could  make to evaluate and track certification and approval processes. In  October 2013, we also found that while FAA had developed milestones  and deployed a tracking system to monitor each certification-related  initiative, FAA had not identified overall performance metrics for these  efforts to determine whether they would achieve their intended effects.  Ultimately, we concluded that having efficient and consistent certification  processes will allow FAA to better use its resources as its workload  increases with the implementation of NextGen.", "Improve Coordination with Industry Stakeholders. Stakeholders  acknowledged the improvements FAA has made in involving stakeholders  in the planning and implementation of NextGen initiatives, especially  through the NextGen Advisory Committee. However, 23 of the 64  stakeholders who suggested a change suggested FAA should do more to  encourage participation and communication with industry stakeholders.  For example, one stakeholder said that while FAA has improved its  collaboration with industry stakeholders, particularly by including a wider  range of stakeholders, FAA needs to ensure that stakeholders are  involved early in the planning process for NextGen initiatives. FAA  officials said that ensuring the appropriate stakeholders are involved in an  effort is a challenge, but noted that FAA has on-going efforts to ensure  the right stakeholders are involved to avoid some of the earlier difficulties  rolling out NextGen programs. Similarly, in April 2013, we found that FAA  is making progress in systematically involving industry stakeholders, air  traffic controllers, and other key subject matter experts in its initiatives,  such as the OAPM initiative. However, we have also recommended areas  for improvement, such as developing and implementing guidelines for  ensuring timely inclusion of appropriate stakeholders, including airport  representatives, in the planning and implementation of NextGen  improvement efforts. DOT concurred with these recommended areas for  improvement and is taking steps to implement the recommendations.", "Increase Accountability. Twenty-one of the 64 stakeholders who  suggested a change suggested FAA needs to increase accountability.  Stakeholder suggestions included that FAA should hold its employees  and management accountable for how well they accomplish program and  plan goals and for how funds are spent. For example, one stakeholder  suggested an annual operating plan could help hold FAA accountable to  its performance goals. The need for more accountability at FAA,  specifically regarding the implementation of NextGen, cuts across several  areas we have previously reported on. In February 2014, we found that  complex organizational transformations, such as NextGen, require  substantial leadership commitment over a sustained period and that  leaders must be empowered to make critical decisions and held  accountable for results. In April 2013, we also found that to address  accountability issues, FAA has taken steps, such as designating the  Deputy Administrator as the Chief NextGen Officer with responsibility for  all NextGen activities. In the same report, we also discussed that the use  of performance measures would allow stakeholders to hold FAA  accountable for results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Most Stakeholders Agreed That Separating ATC Operations from FAA Was an Option to Consider, They Identified Several Issues That Would Need to be Taken into Account", "paragraphs": ["In light of the ongoing discussion within the aviation industry on new  approaches for operating and modernizing the ATC system, we also  asked stakeholders about changing the provision of ATC services to  improve ATC efficiency and NextGen implementation. These potential  changes include moving the provision of ATC services out of FAA into a  separate unit or organization and commercializing ATC services as has  been done in Canada. Seventy percent of the stakeholders (53 of 76)  agreed that separating ATC operations out from FAA was an option, but  half of these stakeholders (26) voiced serious reservations or indicated  such a change was unlikely to occur. Stakeholders also cited potential  benefits of separating air traffic control operations from FAA, including a  more predictable funding source; potentially reduced political involvement  in ATC operational decisions; faster and less costly modernization of the  ATC system; and more efficient day-to-day operations. The remaining  stakeholders we interviewed were split between the opinion that a  separate ATC system was not a good idea (12) and either not providing  an opinion on this question or not answering it (11). See table 2 below for  stakeholder responses. Stakeholders also raised several issues that  would need to be taken into account before making changes to the  provision of ATC services.", "Further, no stakeholder category was unanimous in either supporting or  rejecting the option to change provision of ATC services. Airlines were  generally more supportive of separating the ATC system from FAA than  labor unions and professional associations. General aviation stakeholders  were open to the idea but had reservations about the funding scheme.  See table 2 for stakeholder responses to this question by industry  category. In addition, FAA officials said that they were not opposed to  privatization or commercialization of the ATC system, but they would  rather focus on what services FAA should provide and what is the best  way to pay for these services.", "Few stakeholders suggested a specific alternative structure for the  provision of ATC services, although some listed potential characteristics  of an alternative structure, such as user fees, public-private partnership,  and a board of directors composed of system users. One example of a  specific alternative structure suggested by a stakeholder was a Consumer  Service Corporation with no shareholders, so as to avoid vested interests.  Others suggested models similar to NAV CANADA, a non-profit trust with  a board of representatives made up of industry and government, financed  with user fees, and regulated by government.", "Both stakeholders and FAA officials said it was important to identify what  problem or problems separating ATC services out of FAA is intended to  solve, before proceeding with it as a solution. However, if a change were  to be made, 65 of the 76 stakeholders suggested actions to take or raised  issues or concerns to consider. These issues and concerns include the  following:", "Funding: Forty of these 65 stakeholders said the source of funding for  a separate air traffic control system is important to consider.  Stakeholders suggested different sources of revenue to support a  separated ATC system including user fees and a fuel tax. Several  stakeholders suggested the possibility of accessing funds through  capital markets as an advantage of a separated ATC system.  Because the expectation of a future revenue stream (through user  fees, for example) may enable a corporatized or privatized ATC  system to access private capital markets (to obtain, for example, a  bond issuance), a potential benefit of such a structure could be more  reliable financing for multiyear investment projects as well as for  operations.", "Lessons Learned: Thirty-eight of these 65 stakeholders suggested  studying what the separation of air traffic services from FAA would  look like. Stakeholders suggested looking at how air-navigation  service providers function in other countries and trying to learn from  their successes and mistakes. For example, one stakeholder said that  given the efficiency of the current system, before any changes are  made, there needs to be an analysis of how privatization would affect  passengers, airlines, the aviation industry, and what improvements,  including fewer delays and more capacity, it could offer. In a 2005  review of selected foreign air navigation service providers (ANSP), we  also found some lessons learned during commercialization, including  being prepared to mitigate the financial effects of an industry  downturn; the importance of involving industry stakeholders in efforts  to design, acquire, and deploy new technologies; balancing the  business needs of an ANSP with smaller communities\u2019 need for air  service; and the importance of maintaining appropriate level of staff to  carry out safety regulation.", "Congressional involvement: Twenty-nine of these 65 stakeholders  suggested that the extent of Congress\u2019s role in overseeing a separate  ATC system must be clarified. For example, stakeholders said  Congress\u2019s oversight responsibilities of a separate ATC system and  even whether Congress should have oversight of such a system  needs to be considered.", "Regulatory coordination: Twenty-seven of these 65 stakeholders  suggested that ensuring coordination between the safety regulator  and a separate ATC system should be considered. Stakeholders  noted, for example, that ensuring coordination might be more difficult  with a separated ATC system than under the current structure.", "Governance: Twenty-five of these 65 stakeholders suggested that  governance of a separated ATC system, such as including system  users on an oversight body, needs to be considered. For example,  one stakeholder asked who would be on a board of directors and how  those individuals would be chosen.", "Safety: Twenty-four of these 65 stakeholders raised concerns about  safety under a separate ATC system. Stakeholders were concerned  about several issues, including the effect of a non-governmental  operator\u2019s profit motive on safety and whether requiring users to pay a  fee to use air traffic control services may disincentivize use of the  system.", "Transition management: Twenty-one of these 65 stakeholders raised  concerns about how to transition from the current system to a  separate ATC system. Stakeholder concerns included the length and  difficulty of such a transition and included questions about what to do  with the infrastructure and personnel in the current system, and the  modernization efforts already under way. FAA senior management  also cited transition management as a potential impediment to moving  to a different air traffic control structure. Specifically, an FAA official  said there does not appear to be an understanding by those  advocating privatization of how to move from a government-operated  system to a privatized system given the need to operate the NAS at a  high level of safety and efficiency. FAA officials also raised concerns  about the length and difficulty of such a transition. For example, one  official mentioned that such a transition to a new organization would  have to include cultural and personnel changes and could take many  years to implement. Another official was concerned that a transition  occurring now to a privatized system could negatively affect the  implementation of NextGen. In November 2002, we found that  successful change management initiatives in large private and public  sector organizations can often take at least 5 to 7 years.", "Access: Nineteen of these 65 stakeholders also raised concerns  about access to the NAS under a separate ATC system. For example,  stakeholders were concerned about small communities losing access  to the ATC system and that the fees charged by a separate ATC  system might reduce general aviation\u2019s access to the ATC system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided DOT with a draft of this report for its review and comment.

This report examines stakeholder perspectives on: (1) the  performance of the current ATC system and its modernization through the  NextGen initiative, and any challenges the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) may face in managing these activities; and (2)  potential changes, if any, that could improve the performance of the ATC  system, including FAA\u2019s modernization initiative. We were also asked to  obtain stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on the safety of the National Airspace  System (NAS). However, since nearly all stakeholders we interviewed  agreed that the NAS is extremely or very safe, we did not focus on this  area in this report.", "To obtain aviation stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on these issues, we  interviewed a non-probability sample of 76 aviation stakeholders. We  created an initial list of stakeholders using internal knowledge of the  aviation industry. We then added more stakeholders based on  interviewee responses to our question on whom else they thought we  should speak with. Specifically, we wanted to obtain perspectives from  individuals and organizations with direct experience, as users, or  knowledge, through research or study, of the current ATC system,  modernization efforts, and FAA\u2019s management of the system. As such,  we limited our review to U.S.-based companies and airlines and sought  the views of individuals and organizations with a stake in the performance  of the NAS. We divided stakeholders into the following nine categories:  airlines, airports, aviation experts and other relevant organizations,  general aviation, labor unions and professional associations,  manufacturers and service providers, other federal government agencies  (Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA)), passenger and safety groups, and research and  development organizations. A list of the individuals and groups we  interviewed is in appendix II. We used a semi-structured interview format  with both closed- and open-ended questions to obtain aviation  stakeholder perspectives on the efficiency of the current ATC,  implementation of NextGen, and changes, if any, that could improve the  operation of the ATC and implementation of NextGen. Our interview  format contained four closed-ended questions with either a five-level  scale or a yes/no response. These closed-ended questions, the response  categories, and stakeholder responses are either included in the body of  the report or in appendix III, as appropriate.", "The intent of our open-ended questions was to engage the stakeholders  in a conversation about the issues they considered most important and  relevant. The results of our review are not generalizable to the industry as  a whole.", "Our discussion of the challenges FAA faces, potential changes to FAA,  and issues to consider if the ATC system were separated from FAA is  based on stakeholder responses to our open-ended questions. As such,  the numbers we reported with these items represent those stakeholders  that raised a challenge or issue to consider or suggested a change during  our interview. When we report that 43 stakeholders raised budget  uncertainty as a challenge, this does not necessarily mean that the  remaining 33 stakeholders we interviewed disagreed. Rather, it means  that those stakeholders did not raise it during the course of our interview.", "We analyzed the responses to these open-ended questions to identify the  main themes raised by stakeholders. To ensure the accuracy of our  content analysis, we internally reviewed our coding and reconciled any  discrepancies. In discussing stakeholder responses to our open-ended  questions, we aggregated their responses and reported on stakeholders\u2019  perspectives in general.", "Stakeholder responses to the yes-no question: Do you think that  separating the functions of safety regulator and ATC service provider into  separate units or organizations is an option for the United States?\u2014fell  into four general responses, which we describe in this report as yes;  maybe; no; and no opinion. Respondents who answered \u201cyes\u201d to this  question said that separating the ATC service provider from the safety  regulator (FAA) was not only an option, but also a good idea. While these  respondents still provided issues to consider, they said that this option  should be considered and were generally supportive of it. GAO classified  respondents\u2019 answers as \u201cMaybe\u201d for those who answered that this was  an option, but generally said either it was not a good idea, it was not  feasible in the United States, or that they had very strong reservations  about such a change.", "Respondents who answered \u201cno\u201d generally said that it was a bad idea or  would simply not work in the United States.
