Since its inception, NPOESS has experienced escalating costs, schedule delays, and technical difficulties. As the often-delayed launch of its demonstration satellite (called the NPOESS Preparatory Project--NPP) draws closer, these problems continue.

Costs are expected to grow by about $1 billion from the current $13.95 billion cost estimate, and the schedules for NPP and the first two NPOESS satellites are expected to be delayed by 7, 14, and 5 months, respectively. These delays endanger the continuity of weather and climate satellite data because there will not be a satellite available as a backup should a satellite fail on launch or in orbit--loss of a Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite, an NPOESS satellite, or NPP could result in a 3 to 5 year gap in data continuity. Program officials reported that they are assessing alternatives for mitigating risks, and that they plan to propose a new cost and schedule baseline by the end of June 2009. However, the Executive Committee does not have an estimate for when it will make critical decisions on cost, schedule, and risk mitigation. While the NPOESS Executive Committee has made improvements over the last several years in response to prior recommendations, it has not effectively fulfilled its responsibilities and does not have the membership and leadership it needs to effectively or efficiently oversee and direct the NPOESS program. Until its shortfalls are addressed, the Committee will be unable to effectively oversee the NPOESS program--and important issues involving cost growth, schedule delays, and satellite continuity will likely remain unresolved. The NPOESS program has conducted two successive studies of alternatives to using the existing system integrator for the last two NPOESS satellites, but neither identified a viable alternative to the current contractor. Program officials plan to conduct a final study prior to the June 2010 decision on whether to proceed with the existing prime contractor."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System  (NPOESS).

Since the 1960s, the  United States has operated two separate operational polar-orbiting  meteorological satellite systems: the Polar-orbiting Operational  Environmental Satellite (POES) series, which is managed by NOAA, and  the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), which is managed  by the Air Force. Currently, there is one operational POES satellite and  two operational DMSP satellites that are positioned so that they can  observe the earth in early morning, midmorning, and early afternoon polar  orbits. In addition, the government is also relying on a European satellite,  called Meteorological Operational, or MetOp, in the midmorning orbit.", "With the expectation that combining the POES and DMSP programs would  reduce duplication and result in sizable cost savings, a May 1994  Presidential Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the  two satellite programs into a single satellite program capable of satisfying  both civilian and military requirements. The converged program,  NPOESS, is considered critical to the United States\u2019 ability to maintain the  continuity of data required for weather forecasting and global climate  monitoring. To manage this program, DOD, NOAA, and NASA formed the  tri-agency Integrated Program Office, located within NOAA. Within the  program office, each agency has the lead on certain activities: NOAA has  overall program management responsibility for the converged system and  for satellite operations; the Air Force has the lead on the acquisition; and  NASA has primary responsibility for facilitating the development and  incorporation of new technologies into the converged system. NOAA and  DOD share the cost of funding NPOESS, while NASA funds specific  technology projects and studies. In addition, an Executive Committee\u2014 made up of the administrators of NOAA and NASA and the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics\u2014is  responsible for providing policy guidance, ensuring agency support and  funding, and exercising oversight authority. The Executive Committee  manages the program through a Program Executive Officer who oversees  the NPOESS program office.", "Since the program\u2019s inception, NPOESS costs have grown to $13.95 billion,  and launch schedules have been delayed by up to five years. In addition,  as a result of a 2006 restructuring of the program, the agencies reduced the  program\u2019s functionality by removing 2 of 6 originally planned satellites and  one of the orbits. The restructuring also decreased the number of  instruments from 13 (10 sensors and 3 subsystems) to 9 (7 sensors and 2  subsystems), with 4 of the sensors providing fewer capabilities. The  restructuring also led agency executives to mitigate potential data gaps by  deciding to use a planned demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS  Preparatory Project (NPP) satellite, as an operational satellite providing  climate and weather data. However, even after this restructuring, the  program is still encountering technical issues, schedule delays, and the  likelihood of further cost increases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress Made, but Continued Instrument Problems Are Driving Costs Upward, Forcing Launch Delays, and Endangering Satellite Continuity", "paragraphs": ["Over the past year, selected components of the NPOESS program have  made progress. Specifically, three of the five instruments slated for NPP  have been delivered and integrated on the spacecraft; the ground-based  satellite data processing system has been installed and tested at both of  the locations that are to receive NPP data; and the satellites\u2019 command,  control, and communications system has passed acceptance testing.  However, problems with two critical sensors continue to drive the  program\u2019s cost and schedule. Specifically, challenges with a key sensor\u2019s  (the Visible/infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS)) development,  design, and workmanship have led to additional cost overruns and delayed  the instrument\u2019s delivery to NPP. In addition, problems discovered during  environmental testing on another key sensor (called the Cross-track  infrared sounder (CrIS)) led the contractor to further delay its delivery to  NPP and added further unanticipated costs to the program. To address  these issues, the program office halted or delayed activities on other  components (including the development of a sensor planned for the first  NPOESS satellite, called C1) and redirected those funds to fixing VIIRS  and CrIS. As a result, those other activities now face cost increases and  schedule delays.", "Program officials acknowledge that NPOESS will cost more than the  $13.95 billion previously estimated, but they have not yet adopted a new  cost estimate. Program officials estimated that program costs will grow by  about $370 million due to recent technical issues experienced on the  sensors and the costs associated with halting and then restarting work on  other components of the program. In addition, the costs associated with  adding new information security requirements to the program could reach  $200 million. This estimate also does not include approximately $410  million for operations and support costs for the last two years of the  program\u2019s life cycle (2025 and 2026). Thus, we anticipate that the overall  cost of the program could grow by about $1 billion from the current $13.95  billion estimate\u2014especially given the fact that difficult integration and  testing of the sensors on the NPP and C1 spacecrafts has not yet  occurred. Program officials reported that they plan to revise the  program\u2019s cost estimate over the next few weeks and to submit it for  executive-level approval by the end of June 2009.", "As for the program\u2019s schedule, program officials estimate that the delivery  of VIIRS to the NPP contractor will be delayed, resulting in a further delay  in the launch of the NPP satellite to January 2011, a year later than the  date estimated during the program restructuring\u2014and seven months later  than the June 2010 date that was established last year. In addition,  program officials estimated that the first and second NPOESS satellites  would be delayed by 14 and 5 months, respectively, because selected  development activities were halted or slowed to address VIIRS and CrIS  problems. The program\u2019s current plans are to launch C1 in March 2014 and  the second NPOESS satellite, called C2, in May 2016. Program officials  notified the Executive Committee and DOD\u2019s acquisition authority of the  schedule delays, and under DOD acquisition rules, are required to submit a  new schedule baseline by June 2009.", "These launch delays have endangered our nation\u2019s ability to ensure the  continuity of polar-orbiting satellite data. The final POES satellite, called  NOAA-19, is in an afternoon orbit and is expected to have a 5-year lifespan.  Both NPP and C1 are planned to support the afternoon orbit. Should the  NOAA-19 satellite fail before NPP is launched, calibrated, and operational,  there would be a gap in satellite data in that orbit. Further, the delays in C1  mean that NPP will not be the research and risk reduction satellite it was  originally intended to be. Instead, it will have to function as an operational  satellite until C1 is in orbit and operational\u2014and if C1 fails on launch or in  early operations, NPP will be needed to function until C3 is available,  currently planned for 2018. The delay in the C2 satellite launch affects the  early morning orbit. There are three more DMSP satellites to be launched  in the early and midmorning orbits, and DOD is revisiting the launch  schedules for these satellites to try to extend them as long as possible.  However, an independent review team, established to assess key program  risks, recently reported that the constellation of satellites is extremely  fragile and that a single launch failure of a DMSP, NPOESS, or the NPP  satellite could result in a gap in satellite coverage from 3 to 5 years.", "Although the program\u2019s approved cost and schedule baseline is not  achievable and the polar satellite constellation is at risk, the Executive  Committee has not yet made a decision on how to proceed with the  program. Program officials plan to propose new cost and schedule  baselines in June 2009 and have reported that they are addressing  immediate funding constraints by deferring selected activities to later  fiscal years in order to pay for VIIRS and CrIS problems; delaying the  launches of NPP, C1, and C2; and assessing alternatives for mitigating the  risk that VIIRS will continue to experience problems. Without an  executive-level decision on how to proceed, the program is proceeding on  a course that is deferring cost growth, delaying launches, and risking its  underlying mission of providing operational weather continuity to the civil  and military communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Executive Committee Has Not Effectively Fulfilled Its Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["While the NPOESS Executive Committee has made improvements over the  last several years in response to prior recommendations, it has not  effectively fulfilled its responsibilities and does not have the membership  and leadership it needs to effectively or efficiently oversee and direct the  NPOESS program.

Nonetheless, by not rigorously documenting action items\u2014including  identifying the party responsible for the action, the desired outcome, and  the time frame for completion\u2014and then tracking the action items to  closure, the Executive Committee is not able to ensure that its actions  have achieved their intended results and to determine whether additional  changes or modifications are still needed.

Costs are  now expected to grow by as much as $1 billion over the prior life cycle  cost estimate of $13.95 billion, and problems in delivering key sensors  have led to delays in launching NPP and the first two NPOESS satellites\u2014 by a year or more for NPP and the first NPOESS satellite. These launch  delays have endangered our nation\u2019s ability to ensure the continuity of  polar-orbiting satellite data. Specifically, if any planned satellites fail on  launch or in orbit, there would be a gap in satellite data until the next  NPOESS satellite is launched and operational\u2014a gap that could last for 3  to 5 years. The NPOESS Executive Committee responsible for making cost  and schedule decisions and addressing the many and continuing risks  facing the program has not yet made important decisions on program  costs, schedules, and risks\u2014or identified when it will do so. In addition,  the Committee has not been effective or efficient in carrying out its  oversight responsibilities.
