The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was required to issue implementing regulations, which it did in September 2005, and to report semiannually to the Congress. OPM's regulations require that each participating agency develop an ITEP plan before proceeding with exchanges. Agencies' opportunity to begin exchanges ends in December 2007.

All participating agencies have drafted plans, but only three--Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and Department of Commerce--have finalized them. Further, only Homeland Security has attempted to negotiate an exchange, but it was unsuccessful. In its last two semiannual reports, OPM has reported on the status of agency plans, but has not reported that no exchanges have taken place to date. OPM, agencies, and others have identified key challenges that will confront agencies as they finish their plans and begin to implement ITEP programs. First, employees with desired skills are in short supply in both the federal government and the private sector, particularly in enterprise architecture, project management, and information security, according to industry representatives. Second, companies are concerned that employee exchanges could hinder future business, since a company with an employee at an agency might be seen as having an unfair advantage in bidding on agency procurements. Third, federal ethics requirements, especially financial disclosure, could discourage private-sector employees from participating. And lastly, Federal agencies' current marketing through a Web site has not been productive, according to participating agencies; suggested improvements include using the media and making personal contacts with companies. OPM and the participating agencies are aware of the challenges and acknowledge that they need to be addressed. However, given the short time remaining before authority to begin new exchanges ends (see figure), it will be essential to expeditiously address the challenges to enable a significant number of successful exchanges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recently, assessments of the federal information technology (IT)  workforce, as called for in the Clinger Cohen Act, have resulted in the  identification of skills gaps in key areas such as project management.

We also  conducted interviews with ITEP officials at the seven participating  agencies\u2014Department of Commerce, Department of Defense (DOD),  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of the Treasury,  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Health and Human  Services, and OPM\u2014and with the Industry Advisory Council (IAC), which  includes about 500 companies as members.

The act authorizes federal executive  agencies that volunteer to participate to temporarily detail IT staff to  private-sector companies and to accept individuals from the private sector.  Assignments can last up to a year and are extendable for another year.  Federal employees could be exposed to private industry best management  practices, while private-sector employees could gain a greater  understanding of federal information management practices and of how  the government does its work. The opportunity to begin exchanges is due  to end in December 2007.", "OPM was required to issue implementing regulations for ITEP and to report  semiannually to the Congress on the number of individuals assigned to and  from each agency, including a brief description of each assignment and  other information as appropriate.", "Between 2003 and 2005, OPM developed implementing regulations for the  program, including soliciting public comments. OMB reviewed and  approved OPM\u2019s draft regulations as part of its normal regulatory process.", "The final ITEP regulations were not issued until August 2005, and became  effective in September 2005, almost 3 years into the program. OPM  reported to the Congress that the delay in the issuance of the regulations  was due to the complexity of the issues involved, including various ethics  and standard of conduct issues that could complicate exchanges,  especially from private industry to the federal government. In addition to  OMB, OPM worked with the Department of Justice and the Office of  Government Ethics to finalize the regulations.", "In the ITEP regulations, OPM established a requirement that each  participating agency develop an ITEP plan. These plans are to be approved  by the head of each agency before beginning exchanges. Agencies,  companies, and individual participants are also required to sign a written  agreement before any exchanges can begin. Each participating agency has  primary responsibility for planning and directing its own ITEP program but  must adhere to the act and OPM regulations in implementing exchanges.", "In December 2005, 3 months after the ITEP regulations went into effect,  OPM issued additional guidance to assist agencies in implementing their  programs and in drafting plans. The guidance included an overview of the  program, templates for ITEP plans and written agreements, and answers to  frequently asked questions and is available to agencies through the  OPM.gov Web site.", "To help promote the program, OPM partnered with the Federal Chief  Information Officers Council and with the Industry Advisory Council and  conducted outreach with several other IT professional organizations to  reach private-sector companies. OPM assists the agencies in marketing  their ITEP programs through its USAJOBS Web site. To facilitate the  exchange of information, OPM has been conducting weekly  teleconferences with participating agencies and the IAC. Additionally, the  CIO of OPM co-chairs the CIO Council\u2019s Information Technology  Workforce Committee, which helps to promote the program and shares  status updates during monthly meetings.", "The E-Gov Act specifically addresses ethics and reimbursement issues. The  law states that private-sector employees assigned to a federal agency under  ITEP are deemed to be employees of the federal agency in terms of Title 5,  U.S.C., Chapter 73 (Suitability, Security, and Conduct) as well as various  other laws. For example, federal employees detailed to the private sector  would remain subject to all federal ethics rules and would continue to be  paid by their agencies. Private-sector employees detailed to a federal  agency would become subject to federal ethics rules, such as those  involving conflict of interest and financial disclosure, and would continue  to be paid by their companies. The act permits the federal government to  reimburse some expenses, such as travel and per diem and leaves open the  possibility that agencies might reimburse the company for some of its  employees\u2019 salaries, but it specifically prohibits companies from charging  the government for an employee\u2019s salary or benefits as a direct or indirect  cost under a federal contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seven Agencies Are Initiating Programs, but No Exchanges Have Taken Place", "paragraphs": ["With only 1 year to go before the opportunity to begin exchanges ends, the  seven agencies participating are still initiating their programs, and no  exchanges have taken place.

Officials from the agencies with draft  plans estimated that additional time required for review and approval of  these draft plans could range from a few days to an indefinite amount of  time.", "OPM requires that plans address how the program will be carried out (e.g.,  processes and procedures); how many exchanges the agency plans to have;  how employees are selected; which officials may approve exchanges; and  employee rights to return to the agency. Agencies are given the flexibility to  tailor their ITEP plans to meet their individual needs and the workforce  skills they want to reinforce.", "In addition, agencies have identified key skills they would like to  strengthen through ITEP exchanges.

According to the IAC, which represents about  500 companies, companies would be reluctant to give up the services of  staff members with these valuable skills.

According to the IAC, this is  a major issue with the program, because it is not easy to determine what  information is appropriate for private-sector employees. FBI program  officials also told us that this issue was a particular concern to them.

For  example, IAC said that OPM and the participating agencies should promote  the program repeatedly through the media. The director of a similar  employee exchange program at the Department of Energy told us that  personal contact with companies was essential to recruiting companies  into the program.
