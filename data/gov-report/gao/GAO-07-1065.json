However, the department did not satisfy the conditions that the plan include a comprehensive US-VISIT strategic plan and a complete schedule for biometric exit implementation. DHS partially implemented GAO's oldest open recommendations pertaining to US-VISIT. For example, while the department partially completed the recommendation that it develop and begin implementing a US-VISIT system security plan, the scope of the plan does not extend to all the systems that comprise US-VISIT. In addition, while the expenditure plan provides some information on US-VISIT's cost, schedule, and benefits associated with planned capabilities, the information provided is not sufficiently defined and detailed to address GAO's recommendation and provide a reasonable basis for measuring progress and holding the department accountable for results. GAO identified several additional observations. On the positive side, DHS data show that the US-VISIT prime contract is being executed according to cost and schedule expectations. However, DHS continues to propose disproportionately heavy investment in US-VISIT program management-related activities without adequate justification or full disclosure. Further, DHS continues to propose spending tens of millions of dollars on US-VISIT exit projects that are not well-defined, planned, or justified on the basis of costs, benefits, and risks. Overall, the US-VISIT fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan and other available program documentation do not provide a sufficient basis for effective program oversight and accountability. Both the legislative conditions and GAO's open recommendations are aimed at accomplishing both, and thus they need to be addressed quickly and completely. However, despite ample opportunity to do so, DHS has not done so and the reasons why are unclear. Until these recommendations are addressed, GAO does not believe that the program's disproportionate investment in management-related activities represents a prudent and warranted course of action or to expect that the newly launched exit endeavor will produce results different from past results--namely, no operational exit solution despite expenditure plans allocating about a quarter of a billion dollars to various exit activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submitted to Congress in  March 2007 its fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan for the U.S. Visitor and  Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program pursuant to  the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007.

DHS has yet to  define the operational context in which US-VISIT is to operate, such as  having a departmentally approved strategic plan or a well-defined  department enterprise architecture (EA). While the expenditure plan  includes a departmentally approved US-VISIT strategic plan, it does not  address key elements of relevant federal strategic planning guidance.  Moreover, we recently reported that the version of the department\u2019s EA  that DHS has been using for US-VISIT alignment purposes was missing  architecture content and was developed with limited stakeholder input.  Finally, although program officials have met with related programs to  coordinate their respective efforts, specific coordination efforts have not  been assigned to any DHS entity.

Since then,  the program office has developed business cases for two projects: Unique  Identity and U.S. Travel Documents-ePassports (formerly Increment 2A),  and we have ongoing work to address, among other things, these business  cases. Further, the program office has yet to develop a business case for  another project that it plans to begin implementing this year\u2014biometric  exit at air ports of entry (POE). Until the program office has reliable  business cases for each US-VISIT project in which alternative solutions for  meeting mission needs are evaluated on the basis of costs, benefits, and  risks, it will not be able to adequately inform its executive bodies and  Congress about its plans and will not provide the basis for prudent  investment decision making.", "Recommendation: Develop and implement a human capital strategy  that provides for staffing open positions with individuals who have the  requisite core competencies (knowledge, skills, and abilities).", "DHS has partially implemented this recommendation.

In 2006, program  management costs represented 135 percent of planned development. This  means that for every dollar spent on new capabilities, $1.35 was spent on  management. The fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan similarly proposed  investing $1.25 on management-related activities for every dollar invested  in new development. However, the plan does not explain the reasons for  the sizable investment in management-related activities or otherwise justify  it on the basis of measurable expected value. Without disclosing and  justifying its proposed investment and program management-related  efforts, it is unclear that such a large amount of funding for these activities  represents the best use of resources.", "Lack of a well-defined and justified exit solution introduces the risk of  repeating failed and costly past exit efforts.

In addition, there are no other exit program plans available  that define what will be done, by what entities, and at what cost in order  to define, acquire, deliver, deploy, and operate this capability. This  includes developing plans describing expected system capabilities,  identifying key stakeholder roles/responsibilities and buy-in,  coordinating and aligning with related programs, and allocating funding  to activities. Furthermore, DHS has not performed an analysis  comparing the life cycle costs of the air exit solution to its expected  benefits and risks. Since 2004, we have reported on a similar lack of  definition and justification of prior US-VISIT exit efforts, even though  prior expenditure plans have allocated funding of $250 million to  completing these efforts. As of today, these prior efforts have not  produced an operational exit solution.

Accordingly, we have already made a litany of  recommendations to correct each weakness, as well as follow-on  recommendations to increase DHS attention to and accountability for  doing so. Despite this, recurring legislative conditions associated with US- VISIT expenditure plans continue to be less than fully satisfied and  recommendations that we made 4 years ago have still not been fully  implemented.", "Exacerbating this situation is the fact that DHS did not satisfy two new  legislative conditions associated with the fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan,  and serious questions continue to exist about DHS\u2019 justification for and  readiness to invest current, and potentially future, fiscal year funding  relative to an exit solution and program management-related activities.", "DHS has had ample opportunity to address these many issues, but it has  not. As a result, there is no reason to expect that its newly launched exit  endeavor, for example, will produce results different from past  endeavors\u2014namely, DHS will not have an operational exit solution despite  expenditure plans allocating about a quarter of a billion dollars to various  exit activities. Similarly, on the basis of past efforts, there is no reason to  believe that the program\u2019s disproportionate investment in management- related activities represents a prudent and warranted course of action.

DHS also stated that the US-VISIT program  office would aggressively engage with us to address our open  recommendations, noting that it appreciates the guidance provided by our  reports. In this regard, DHS\u2019s comments described efforts completed,  underway, and planned to address our recommendations, most of which  were already reflected in the draft report. New information in DHS\u2019s  comments covered its intentions relative to the next US-VISIT expenditure  plan and the next US-VISIT strategic plan, both of which are to be issued in  fiscal year 2008. This new information is consistent with the intent of our  open recommendations. New information also included the US-VISIT  Director\u2019s intention to communicate high-priority risks to the Under  Secretary of the National Protection and Programs Directorate, which is  also in line with our open recommendations.", "However, DHS also stated that it disagreed with the \u201cpartially complete\u201d  status that we assigned to one of our open recommendations. It also stated  that our observation characterizing past US-VISIT exit efforts as failed and  costly implicitly devalued the experience and empirical data that the  department gained from these proof-of-concept efforts, and this  observation did not recognize relevant information about the program\u2019s use  of biographic exit procedures. We do not agree with either of these  comments, as discussed below.", "With the respect to the \u201cpartially complete\u201d status that our report  assigns to the open recommendation for the program to develop and  begin implementing a system security plan, and to perform a privacy  impact analysis and use the results of this analysis in near term and  subsequent system acquisition decision making, DHS stated that it  considers this recommendation satisfied. In this regard, the department  describes a number of actions that the program has taken with respect  to US-VISIT security and privacy. We do not take issue with the actions  that DHS described, and would note that our draft report already  recognizes them. Moreover, we too consider the privacy component of  our recommendation satisfied. However, we do not agree with the  department\u2019s position relative to the scope of US-VISIT\u2019s security  strategy in that it does not address known vulnerabilities associated  with a US-VISIT component system\u2014TECS. As we state in our report,  TECS is an integral component of US-VISIT and, according to federal  security standards, a system security plan, or in US-VISIT\u2019s case the  system security strategy, typically covers such component systems.  Therefore, we believe that the US-VISIT security risk assessment and  security strategy need to explicitly address such vulnerabilities, and  thus we do not consider the entire recommendation as being fully  satisfied.", "With respect to our characterization of past US-VISIT exit efforts, the  department stated that we incorrectly viewed these past efforts as \u201cends  in themselves\u201d and as \u201cfailed and costly\u201d because they did not  immediately conclude with operational systems. According to DHS, the  program never intended for these efforts to be more than proof-of- concept learning experiences that would form the basis for more  workable future system solutions. We do not agree with these  comments. As we state in our report, the program first committed to full  deployment of a biometric exit capability in 2003, and it has continued  to make similar deployment commitments in subsequent years. At the  same time, we have chronicled a pattern of inadequate analysis  surrounding the expected costs, benefits, and risks of these exit efforts  since 2004, and thus an absence of reliable information upon which to  view their expected value and base informed exit-related investment  decisions. Nevertheless, the program continued to invest each year in  these biometric exit efforts, thus far having allocated about $250 million  in funding to them. At no time, however, was any analysis produced to  justify investing a quarter of a billion dollars to gain \u201cexperiences and  empirical data\u201d for such a sizeable investment. Rather, commitments  were repeatedly made in expenditure plans for deploying an operational  exit solution. While we recognize the value and role of demonstration  and pilot efforts as a means for learning and informing future  development efforts, our point is that exit-related efforts have been  inadequately defined and justified over the last 4 years, despite being  allocated $250 million, and the fiscal year 2007 expenditure proposes  more of the same.", "With respect to not recognizing the program\u2019s use of biographic exit  procedures in the above described observation, the department is correct  that we describe these procedures in other sections of our report but not as  part of this observation. We do not include this information under this  observation because its focus is on the 4 years and $250 million that has  been devoted to biometric-based exit efforts, and the lack of definition and  justification in the fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan for these biometric  efforts going forward.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Members  of other Senate and House committees and subcommittees that have  authorization and oversight responsibilities for homeland security.

Further, the plan does not include  a comprehensive mission statement, describe the relationships between strategic  goals and annual performance goals, the external factors that could affect the  program, and the program evaluations used to establish or revise the goals.", "In addition, the US-VISIT strategic plan does not address management challenges  facing the program, such as those addressed in our past recommendations. And  although the strategic plan identifies the ability to communicate with external  stakeholders as a desired capability, the plan does not provide any evidence of  such past communication or explain the relationship between US-VISIT and other  organizations within the border and immigration management enterprise.

However, it  does not provide clear delineations of these organizations\u2019 respective tasks,  services, or efforts. Further, the strategic plan does not cite or describe any  coordination efforts to address this situation. Additionally, the Blueprint identifies  border and immigration management enterprise stakeholders and identifies, for  each stakeholder, needs and priorities, challenges, how the business outcomes will  benefit the stakeholder, and stakeholder constraints that will affect business  outcomes.", "This means that while some of the content of a US-VISIT strategic plan is captured  in a fragmented fashion across a range of documents, the full range of content  needed to define an authoritative strategic direction, focus, and roadmap for the  program that is approved by departmental leadership is missing. Without it, DHS  reduces the chances that the US-VISIT program will achieve desired results and  succeed in achieving the program\u2019s goals and objectives.", "Condition 8.

Instead, it states that DHS plans  to integrate US-VISIT\u2019s efforts with CBP\u2019s pre-departure Advance Passenger  Information Systemand TSA\u2019s Secure Flightfor purposes of partnering with the  airline industry. Further, the plan does not include any schedule of air exit  implementation activities, but rather, simply states that DHS plans to initiate efforts  on its air exit solution at an unspecified time during the third quarter of fiscal year  2007, and will fully deploy the air exit solution by an unspecified time during  calendar year 2008.", "On June 11, 2007, DHS provided us with a schedule for air exit, which the  department characterized as high-level.

However, program officials told  us that greater detail existed to support the schedule, but that because this had not  been approved by DHS, could not be provided. The schedule provided indicates  that the air exit solution will be fully deployed by June 2009, which is at least six  months after the deployment date provided in the expenditure plan.", "The plan states that DHS will initiate planning efforts on the sea exit deployment at  an unspecified time during fiscal year 2007, and that it will emulate the technology  and operational plans used for the air exit solution.

Because of  this, the plan concludes that land exit cannot be practically based on biometric  validation in the short term. In lieu of biometric-based exit at land POEs in the near  term, the plan states that DHS will initially seek to match entry and exit records  using biographic information in instances where departure information is not  collected from an individual who leaves the country, as in the case of an individual  who does not submit their Form I-94upon departure.", "However, the plan does not specify what this near-term focus entails and how,  when, and at what cost it will be accomplished.

At that time, program officials told us that they intended to  develop a US-VISIT security strategy that reflected the results of this risk  assessment.", "In December 2006, the program office developed a US-VISIT security strategy and  has since begun implementing it. For example, it has conducted security  evaluations of commercial off-the-shelf software products before adding them to  the program\u2019s technical baseline. However, the scope of this strategy does not  extend to all the systems that comprise US-VISIT. For example, the Treasury  Enforcement Communications System (TECS), an integral component of US- VISIT, is not under the US-VISIT inventory of systems because it is owned by  Customs and Border Protection.", "The fact that the US-VISIT security strategy\u2019s scope is limited to only systems that  the program office owns is not consistent with our recommendation.

However, we also reported that  system documentation only partially addressed privacy. Since then, program  officials told us that they have taken steps to ensure that the impact assessment\u2019s  results are used in deciding and documenting the content of US-VISIT projects. For  example, they said that privacy office representatives are included in key project  definition, design, and development meetings to ensure that privacy issues are  addressed and that key system documentation now reflects privacy-based needs.", "Furthermore, US-VISIT privacy officials recently conducted an audit of system  documentation to ensure that privacy is being addressed. They found only a single  instance where privacy should have been addressed in system documentation but  was not. Finally, our review of recently issued system documentation shows  privacy concerns are being addressed.", "Recommendation 2: Develop and implement a plan for satisfying key acquisition  management controls, including acquisition planning, solicitation, requirements  management, project management, contract tracking and oversight, evaluation,  and transition to support, and implement the controls in accordance with Software  Engineering Institute (SEI) guidance.", "Effective acquisition management controls are important contributors to the  success of programs like US-VISIT.

Further, while the plan does  provide information on some acquisition activities, it does not adequately describe  how the program is being managed in a number of areas and does not disclose the  management challenges that it continues to face. Without such information, the  expenditure plan does not provide Congress with enough information to exercise  effective oversight and hold the department accountable.", "The fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan provides time commitments for some  capabilities; however, these are not specific. For example, the plan states the  following:  Deployment of 10-print pilot to 10 air locations to begin in late 2007.", "Initial Operating Capability functionality targeted for September 2008.", "Air exit solution deployment will begin in third quarter 2007 and continue  through 2008.", "Begin work in fiscal year 2007 on sea exit deployment that will emulate  technology and operational plans adopted for commercial aviation environment.", "Moreover, no schedule commitments are made for the development and  deployment of PKD validation capabilities.", "The fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan identifies each project\u2019s funding. In some  cases, this information is provided with meaningful detail that allows for  understanding of how the funds will be used. For example   Unique Identity shows the following activities and costs:  Acquisition and Procurement ($21.2 million)\u2014purchase and initial  deployment of 10-print capture devices and upgrades in network  capabilities (bandwidth and technology refreshes) at 119 airports, 9  seaports, and 155 land ports.", "Update DHS Border and Process Technology ($2.0 million)\u2014update  device to client biometric interfaces and further 10-print prototype testing  and evaluation.", "However, in other cases, costs are not described at a level that would permit such  understanding. For example:   Contractor Services (Project Assigned) ($12.1 million) - contractor services  and support for the project-related resource planning and management  (including the areas of configuration, acquisition, and risk), as well as project  performance metrics and reporting in the areas of cost, schedule, scope, and  quality management.  This exact wording is also used for this category in two  other projects with different costs.", "In addition, unlike prior expenditure plans, carryover funds from prior years that are  planned for use in 2007 are not allocated to 2007 activities.  For example:   Exit - A total of $7.3 million in fiscal year 2007 funds, plus fiscal year 2006  carryover funds of $20 million are mentioned as being allocated to begin the  process of deploying DHS\u2019 integrated air exit strategy and initial planning for  sea exit. However, only the $7.3 million is allocated among the activities listed.  No information is presented regarding the allocation of the $20 million in  carryover funds to these activities or any others.", "The fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan cites benefits associated with the projects.  However, the benefits are broadly stated.

In  September 2003, we reportedthat the program office lacked adequate human  capital and financial resources. In August 2004, the program office, in conjunction  with OPM developed a draft human capital plan. Agency officials stated that, at one  point in 2006, all of the 115 government positions were filled. In addition, the  program has received about $1.4 billion in funding, and we recently reported that it  has devoted an increasing proportion of its annual appropriation to program office  and related management activities.", "Since then, however, 21 of the government positions have become vacant.  According to program officials, they have taken interim steps to address this void in  leadership by temporarily assigning other staff to cover them. They added that they  plan to fill all the positions through aggressive recruitment and that they do not  consider the vacancies to present a risk to the program. However, without  adequate human capital, particularly in key positions and for extended periods,  program risks will invariably increase.", "Recommendation 5: Clarify the operational context within which US-VISIT must  operate.", "As we have previously reported, all programs exist within a larger operational (and  technological) context or frame of reference that is captured in such strategically  focused instruments as strategic plans and an EA. Additionally, having a strategic  plan and an EA are recognized best practices and provided for in federal guidance.", "In 2003, we reportedthat DHS had yet to define the operational context in which  US-VISIT is to operate, such as a well-defined department EA or a departmentally  approved strategic plan. In the absence of this operational context, we stated that  program officials could make assumptions and decisions that, if they proved  inconsistent with subsequent departmental policy decisions, would require US- VISIT rework to make it interoperable with related programs and systems, such as  the FBI\u2019s 10-print biometric identity system known as IAFIS. Moreover, we stated  that US-VISIT could be defined and implemented in a way that made it duplicative  of other programs and systems, such as the Secure Border Initiative or the  Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.", "Since then, we have continued to report on the absence of this context. Most  recently, we reportedin February 2006 that this operational context was still a  work in process. Specifically, we found that although a strategic plan was drafted  that program officials said showed how US-VISIT was aligned with DHS\u2019s  organizational mission and defined an overall vision for immigration and border  management across multiple departments and external stakeholders with common  objectives, strategies, processes, and infrastructures, this plan had been awaiting  departmental approval at that time for more than 11 months.", "Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), which is to implement the  provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004requiring citizens of the United States, Canada, Bermuda, and Mexico to have  a designated document for entry or re-entry into the United States that  establishes the bearer\u2019s identity and citizenship.", "US-VISIT continues to lack a well-defined operational context.", "As discussed earlier in this briefing, the fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan  includes an appendix titled \u201cComprehensive Strategic Plan for US-VISIT,\u201d  which the Program Director told us is the department\u2019s officially approved US- VISIT strategic plan. However, as we discussed in the legislative conditions  section of the briefing, key elements of relevant federal guidance for a strategic  plan are not addressed in this plan. For example, no specific outcome-related  goals for major functions and operations of US-VISIT or specific objectives to  meet those goals are provided, nor does it address external factors that could  affect achievement of program goals. Finally, this strategic plan does not  address the explicit relationships between US-VISIT and either the SBI or  WHTI programs.", "We recently reportedthat DHS\u2019s EA has evolved beyond prior versions.", "However, the DHS EA 2006was not complete for several reasons. For  example, it was missing architecture content, such as a transition plan and  evidence of a gap analysis between the \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d architectures, and it  was developed with limited stakeholder input: support contractors and  organizational stakeholders provided a range of comments on completeness,  internal consistency, and understandability of a draft of the EA, but the majority  of comments were not addressed. Because the EA was not complete, internally consistent and understandable, we concluded that its usefulness was  limited, in turn limiting DHS\u2019s ability to guide and constrain IT investments in a  way that promotes interoperability and reduces overlap and duplication.", "Program officials told us that they have met with related programs to coordinate  their respective efforts. They stated that DHS\u2019s Office of Screening Coordination  and Operations (SCO) has been trying to coordinate and unify the departmental  components\u2019 initiatives by bringing border management stakeholders together.  However, specific coordination efforts have not been assigned to the SCO or any  other DHS entity.", "The absence of a well-defined operational context within which to define and  pursue US-VISIT has been long-standing.

Moreover, according to relevant guidance,  incremental investments in major systems should be individually supported by  such analyses of benefits, costs, and risks. Without such analyses, an  organization cannot adequately know that a proposed investment is a prudent  and justified use of limited resources.", "In June and September 2003, and in February 2005, we reportedthat proposed  investments in the then entry/exit system, US-VISIT Increment 1, and US-VISIT  Increment 2B, respectively, were not justified by reliable business cases.", "Further, in February 2006 we reportedthat while a business case was prepared  for Increment 1B, the analysis performed met only four of the eight criteria in  OMB guidance. For example, it did not include a complete uncertainty analysis  for the alternatives evaluated.", "More recently, the program office has developed business cases for two projects:  Unique Identity and U.S. Travel Documents-ePassports (formerly Increment  2A).However, the program office has not developed a business case for  another project that it plans to begin implementing this year\u2014biometric exit at air  POEs. As discussed later in the observations section of this briefing, the program  office has defined very little about its proposed solution to meeting its exit needs  at air POEs, including an analysis of alternative solutions to meeting this need on  the basis of their relative costs, benefits, and risks.", "Until the program office has reliable business cases for each US-VISIT project in  which alternative solutions for meeting mission needs are evaluated on the basis  of costs, benefits, and risks, it will not be able to adequately inform its executive  bodies and the Congress about its plans and will not provide the basis for prudent  investment decision making.", "Recommendation 7: Develop and implement a human capital strategy that provides  for staffing open positions with individuals who have the requisite core  competencies (knowledge, skills, and abilities).", "Strategic management of human capital involves proactive efforts to understand an  entity\u2019s future workforce needs, existing workforce capabilities, and the gap  between the two and to chart a course of action defining how this gap will be  continuously addressed. Such an approach to human capital management is both  a best practice and provision in federal guidance.", "In September 2003, we reportedthat US-VISIT did not have a human capital  strategy. In February 2006, we reportedthat the program office issued a human  capital plan and began implementing it. However, it stopped doing so during 2006  pending a departmental approval of a DHS-wide human capital initiative, known as  MAXHR, and because all program office positions were filled. However, as noted  earlier, the program office now reports that it has 21 government positions,  including critical leadership positions, vacant.", "According to program officials, US-VISIT recently developed a new human capital  plan as part of their Organizational Improvement Initiative and this plan is now  being reviewed by the department.

We concluded that these risks, if not effectively managed, would  likely cause program cost, schedule, and performance problems.", "Since then, US-VISIT approved a risk management plan and began to put into  place a risk management process that included, among other things, subprocesses for identifying, analyzing, managing, and monitoring risk. It also defined and began  implementing a governance structure to oversee and manage the process, and it  maintains a risk database that is available to program management and staff.", "In February 2006,we reported that the risk management process detailed in the  risk management plan was not being consistently applied across the program. In  addition, we reported that thresholds for elevating risks to department executives  were not being applied and risk elevation was being left to the discretion of the  Program Director. Since then, the program has provided training to its employees  to ensure that they understood how to apply the risk management process.", "However, program officials told us that they have eliminated the thresholds for  elevating risks beyond the US-VISIT Program Office. Further, no risks have been  elevated to department executives since December 2005, and no specific guidance  on when risks should be elevated beyond the US-VISIT Program Director is  provided in the current risk management plan.", "Until the program office ensures that high risks are appropriately elevated,  department executives will not have the information they need to make informed  investment decisions.", "Recommendation 9: Define performance standards for US-VISIT that are  measurable and reflect the limitations imposed on US-VISIT capabilities by relying  on existing systems.", "The operational performance of US-VISIT depends largely on the performance of  the existing systems that have been integrated to form it. This means that, for  example, the availability of US-VISIT is constrained by the downtime of existing  systems.", "In February 2006, we reportedthat the program office had defined technical  performance standards for several increments (e.g., Increments 1, 2B, and 2C),  but these standards did not contain sufficient information to determine whether or  not they reflected the limitations imposed by reliance on existing systems. Since  then, program officials told us that they have not updated the performance  standards for Increments 1-3 to reflect limitations imposed by relying on existing  systems. As a result, the ability of these increments to meet performance  requirements remains uncertain.", "Recently, the program office has developed requirements-related documentation  on Unique Identity elements, including the iDSM.  While this documentation  specifies a requirement that the model be able to exchange information with  external systems, and refers to this as a system constraint, it does not assess the  quantitative impact that these changes would impose on the system. In order to  determine such impacts, it is necessary to assess such factors as the response  time and throughput of US-VISIT feeder systems on US-VISIT.", "Until the program defines performance standards that reflect the limitations of the  existing systems upon which US-VISIT relies, the program lacks the ability to  identify and effectively address performance shortfalls.", "Observation 1: Earned value management data on ongoing prime contract task  orders show that cost and schedule baselines are being met.", "Earned value management (EVM) is a program management tool for measuring  progress by comparing, during a given period of time, the value of work  accomplished with the amount of work expected to be accomplished.

Our recommendations to DHS aimed at strengthening US- VISIT program management are grounded in our research, OMB requirements,  and recognized best practices relative to the importance of strong program  management capabilities. The importance of this area, however, does not in and  of itself justify the level of investment in such activities. Rather, investment in  program management-related activities, similar to investment in any program  capability, should be based on full disclosure of the scope, nature, size, and value  of the program and such investments should be justified in relation to the size and  significance of the acquisition activities being performed.", "Earlier this year, we reported,that the program\u2019s investment in program  management had risen significantly over the past 4 years, particularly in relation  to the program\u2019s declining level of new system development.

They added that future expenditure  plans would provide greater clarity into funds used for management  versus development.", "The fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan proposed investing a comparable  percentage of funding on management-related activities vis-\u00e0-vis new  development.

In addition, the exit schedule  provided by the program office indicates that the air exit solution is to be fully  implemented by June 2009, which is at least 6 months after the full deployment  date provided in the expenditure plan.", "Further, available documentation (e.g., the expenditure plan)   does not define what key terms mean, such as \u201cfull implementation\u201d and  \u201cintegrated;\u201d does not specify what the $20 million in fiscal year 2006 carryover funding  will be spent on, and only allocates the $7.3 million in fiscal year 2007  funding to such broad categories of activities as project management,  contractor services, and planning and design; and  does not describe what has been done and what is planned to engage with  commercial airlines, even though the recently-provided air exit schedule  states that the department plans to issue a proposed federal regulation  requiring airlines to participate in this effort by end of calendar year 2007.", "Moreover, no analysis comparing the life cycle costs of the air exit solution to its  expected benefits and risks is available. In particular, neither the 2007  expenditure plan nor any other program documentation describe measurable  outcomes (benefits and results) that will result from an air exit solution.", "According to the expenditure plan, significant air exit planning and testing has  been conducted over the past 3 years and the air exit solution is based in part on  these efforts. However, during this time we have continued to report on  fundamental limitations in the definition and justification of those efforts. For  example, In September 2003,we reported that DHS had not economically justified  the initial US-VISIT increment (which was to include an exit capability at air  and sea POEs) on the basis of benefits, costs, and risks. As result, we  recommended that DHS determine whether proposed incremental  capabilities will produce value commensurate with program costs and risks.", "In May 2004,we reported that an exit capability (including biometric  capture) was not deployed to the 80 air and 14 sea POEs as part of  Increment 1 deployment in December 2003, as originally intended. Instead, a  pilot exit capability was deployed to only one air and one sea POE on  January 5, 2004. At that time, program officials told us that it was being  piloted at only two locations because they decided to evaluate other exit  alternatives and planned to select an alternative for full deployment by  December 31, 2004.", "In February 2005,we reported that DHS had not adequately planned for  evaluating the air and sea exit alternatives because the scope and timeline of  the pilot evaluations were compressed. We recommended that the program  office reassess its plans for deploying an exit capability to ensure that the  scope of the pilot provided an adequate evaluation of alternatives.", "In February 2006,we reported that DHS had analyzed the cost, benefits,  and risks for its air and sea exit capability, but the analyses did not  demonstrate that the program was producing or would produce mission value  commensurate with expected costs and benefits, and the costs upon which  the analyses were based were not reliable. We also raised questions about  the adequacy of the program\u2019s air exit pilot evaluation, noting that the results  showed an average compliance of only 24 percent across the three alternatives. We concluded that until exit alternatives were adequately  evaluated, the program office would not be in a position to select the best  solution. We further noted that without an effective exit capability, the  benefits and the mission value of US-VISIT would be greatly diminished. We  did not make a recommendation to address this because we had already  addressed the situation through a prior recommendation.", "In December 2006,we reported that US-VISIT officials had concluded that  a biometric US-VISIT land exit capability could not be implemented without  incurring a major impact on land POE facilities. We also reported that the  land exit pilots had surfaced several performance problems, such as RFID  devices not reading a majority of travelers\u2019 tags during testing and multiple  RFID devices installed on poles or structures over roads reading information  from the same traveler tag. We recommended that DHS report to Congress  information on the costs, benefits, and feasibility of deploying biometric and  nonbiometric exit capabilities at land POEs.", "In February 2007,we reported that DHS had not adequately defined and  justified its past investment in exit pilots and demonstration projects. We  noted that the program had devoted considerable time and resources to exit  but still did not have either an operational exit capability or a viable exit  solution to deploy. Further, exit-related program documentation did not  adequately define what work was to be done or what these efforts would  accomplish and did not describe measurable outcomes from the pilot or  demonstration efforts, or related cost, schedule, and capability commitments  that would be met. We recommended that planned expenditures be limited  for exit pilots and demonstration projects until such investments are  economically justified and until each investment has a well-defined  evaluation plan.", "Notwithstanding these long-standing limitations in planning for and justifying its  exit efforts, and notwithstanding that funding for exit-related efforts in US-VISIT  expenditure plans for fiscal years 2003 through 2006totals about $250 million,  no operational exit capability exists. Unless the department better plans and  justifies its new exit efforts, it runs the serious risk of repeating this past failure.", "US-VISIT\u2019s prime contract cost and schedule metrics show that expectations are  being met, according to available data, although their earned value management  system that the metrics are based on has yet to be independently certified.  Nothwithstanding this, such performance is a positive sign.", "However, the vast majority of the many management weaknesses raised in this  briefing have been the subject of our prior US-VISIT reports and testimonies, and  thus are not new. Accordingly, we have already made a litany of recommendations  to correct each weakness, as well as follow-on recommendations to increase DHS  attention to and accountability for doing so. Despite this, recurring legislative  conditions associated with US-VISIT expenditure plans continue to be less than  fully satisfied, and recommendations that we made 4 years ago are still not fully  implemented.", "Exacerbating this situation is the fact that the DHS did not satisfy two new  legislative conditions associated with the fiscal year 2007 expenditure plan, and  serious questions continue to exist about DHS\u2019s justification for and readiness to  invest current, and potentially future, fiscal year funding relative to an exit solution  and program management-related activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS has had ample opportunity to address these many issues, but it has not.
