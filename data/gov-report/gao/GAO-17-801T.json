EPA had not yet implemented the remaining 127 recommendations. The figure below shows the status of the 318 recommendations. The recommendations fall into six broad categories that relate to EPA programs and operations: (1) management and operations; (2) water issues; (3) environmental contamination and cleanup; (4) toxics, chemical safety, and pesticides; (5) public health and environmental justice; and (6) air quality, climate change, and energy efficiency. Almost three-fourths of the recommendations fall into the first three categories and include actions for EPA to better manage grants, improve the regulation of drinking water contaminants, and better manage hazardous waste cleanup. Most of the recommendations that have not yet been implemented concern EPA management and operations and water issues. For example, regarding management and operations, EPA has not yet implemented GAO's recommendation to link its workforce plan with its strategic plan to help ensure EPA has an appropriately skilled workforce to achieve its mission. Similarly, for water issues, EPA has not fully implemented GAO's recommendation to provide guidance to regional offices on overseeing state water quality programs.", "GAO has identified many benefits\u2014that is, process and programmatic improvements and financial benefits\u2014based on EPA taking actions on GAO's recommendations and related work. For example, in October 2012, GAO recommended that EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develop guidelines to assist states in developing uniform environmental analyses to meet state and federal requirements for water and wastewater infrastructure projects. EPA and USDA issued a joint memorandum in February 2017 that, among other things, highlighted best practices to eliminate duplicative environmental reviews. In addition, GAO has identified financial benefits from the implementation of its recommendations and related work. For example, during the course of work related to a July 2008 report, GAO identified an error in EPA's calculation of recoverable indirect costs for hazardous waste cleanup. EPA acknowledged the error and published revised indirect costs rates. As a result, GAO estimated in 2010 that EPA had recovered or would recover $42.2 million."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the status of recommendations  GAO has made to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

To accomplish this mission, EPA develops and  enforces environmental regulations; awards grants to state environmental  programs, non-profits, educational institutions, and others; studies  environmental issues; and sponsors partnerships, among other things.  We have conducted reviews focused on various aspects of EPA\u2019s  operations and programs. For example, we have conducted reviews  focused on aspects of EPA\u2019s operations, such as managing grants,  workforce planning, and processes for developing and enforcing  regulations. We have also conducted reviews on EPA\u2019s programs to  manage toxic chemicals, improve water infrastructure, and clean up  hazardous waste sites. Through these reviews, we have made numerous  recommendations to improve EPA\u2019s performance and the efficiency and  effectiveness of its operations and programs.

To  determine the number and status of recommendations we made to EPA  during this period, we reviewed data from our internal database that  maintains information on the status of recommendations we have made  to all agencies. To determine how these recommendations relate to EPA  operations and programs, we developed categories based on areas of  EPA\u2019s work and its organizational structure. Two analysts then  independently categorized each of the recommendations and resolved  any differences. To identify benefits realized by EPA in implementing our  recommendations, we also relied on our internal database for information  on financial and non-financial benefits. In addition, we asked EPA to  review the information provided in this statement for completeness and  accuracy. Detailed information about the scope and methodology used to  conduct our prior work can be found in each of our issued reports.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Implemented recommendations can result in financial or  nonfinancial benefits for the federal government. An estimated financial  benefit is based on agency actions taken in response to our  recommendations; such benefits can result in reduced government  expenditures, increased revenues, or a reallocation of funds to other  areas. For example, in fiscal year 2016, our work across the federal  government resulted in $63.4 billion in financial benefits. Other benefits  that result from our work cannot be measured in dollar terms, and we  refer to them as nonfinancial or other benefits. During fiscal year 2016,  we recorded a total of 1,234 other benefits from our work that cannot be  measured in dollars, but that led to program and operational  improvements to the federal government. These benefits are linked to  specific recommendations or other work that we completed over several  years and could include improvements to agency programs, processes,  and policies. In some cases, benefits are realized based on the actions of  Congress. For example, since 1994, we have found that EPA faces  challenges in its ability to assess and control toxic chemicals under the  Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976\u2014largely due to issues of statutory  choice, regulatory control, data, confidentiality, workload, and resources.  In response to our work and the work of others, Congress passed the  Lautenberg Act in 2016, giving EPA greater authority to implement  several of our outstanding recommendations related to these six areas  and positioning the agency to better protect public health and the  environment from the risks posed by toxic chemicals.", "As part of our responsibilities under generally accepted government  auditing standards, we periodically follow up on recommendations we  have made to agencies and report their status to Congress. Agencies  also have a responsibility to monitor and maintain accurate records on  their progress made toward addressing our recommendations. After  issuing a report, we follow up with audited agencies at least once a year  to determine the extent to which they have implemented our  recommendations and the benefits that they have realized. During these  follow-up contacts, we identify for agencies what additional actions, if any,  they would need to take to address our recommendations. A  recommendation is considered implemented when agencies have taken  actions that, consistent with our recommendation, address the issue or  deficiency we identified and upon which the recommendation is based.  Experience has shown that it takes time for agencies to implement some  recommendations. For this reason, we actively track unaddressed (i.e.,  open) recommendations for 4 years and review them to determine  whether implementation can be reasonably expected. The review  includes consideration of alternative strategies an agency may have for  implementing recommendations. Our experience has shown that  recommendations remaining open after 4 years are generally not  implemented in subsequent years. We will close a recommendation as  not implemented if an agency has indicated that it was not planning to  take action or if we have determined that it is unlikely that the agency will  take action to address the recommendation.

The database allows searches  by agency, congressional committee, or key words and is available at  http://www.gao.gov/openrecs.html.", "In addition to our process for monitoring and reporting on  recommendations, we use other mechanisms to encourage agencies to  implement our recommendations in a timely manner. For example, we  initiated an effort in fiscal year 2015 to call attention to unimplemented  recommendations that we believe warrant priority attention by the  Secretary or agency heads at key departments and agencies. We sent  letters to the heads of key executive branch agencies, including EPA, in  fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 identifying these high-priority  recommendations and urging the agency head to continue to provide  attention to these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Implemented 191 of 318 GAO Recommendations, Which Relate to a Variety of EPA Operations and Programs", "paragraphs": ["As of August 23, 2017, EPA had implemented 191 of the 318  recommendations we made since fiscal year 2007, and the  recommendations fall into six broad categories that relate to EPA  operations and programs.

These six broad categories are:  (1) management and operations; (2) water issues, which includes water  infrastructure, drinking water, water quality, and ecosystem restoration;  (3) environmental contamination and cleanup, which includes  environmental cleanup, pollution prevention, hazardous and other waste  programs, and emergency management; (4) toxics, chemical safety, and  pesticides; (5) public health and environmental justice; and (6) air quality,  climate change, and energy efficiency. The percentage of  recommendations implemented within each category ranged from 80  percent for the environmental contamination and cleanup category to 48  percent in the management and operations category. Figure 3 shows  the number of recommendations we identified in each of these categories and the percentage of recommendations within each category that had  been implemented and not implemented.", "Almost three-fourths of the recommendations we made since fiscal year  2007 fall into three categories: management and operations, water  issues, and environmental contamination and cleanup. The  recommendations to EPA relating to management and operations  included actions for better managing its grants, better coordinating  management of its laboratories, and improving the agency\u2019s information  security. Recommendations on water issues included actions targeted at  improving the regulation of contaminants in drinking water, improving  water quality and ecosystem health in regions such as the Great Lakes  and Chesapeake Bay, and better managing water pollution from both  point and nonpoint sources. Recommendations related to environmental  contamination and cleanup included: taking actions for better managing  cleanup at hazardous waste sites; enhancing responses to disasters,  such as the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001,  and Hurricane Katrina in August 2005; and promoting proper disposal and  recycling of electronic waste. The remaining quarter of the  recommendations fell into the other three categories of toxics, chemical  safety, and pesticides; air quality, climate change, and energy efficiency;  and public health and environmental justice.

In 2015, EPA awarded roughly $3.9 billion,  about 49 percent of its budget, in grants to states, local governments,  tribes, and other recipients. These grants supported activities such as  repairing aging water infrastructure, cleaning up hazardous waste sites,  improving air quality, and preventing pollution. In our January 2017 report,  we concluded that EPA\u2019s ability to manage this portfolio depended  primarily on grant specialists and project officers, but the agency did not  have the information it needed to allocate grants management resources  in an effective and efficient manner. In addition, EPA had not identified  project officer critical skills and competencies or monitored its recruitment  and retention efforts for grant specialists. We recommended that EPA,  among other things, develop documented processes that could be  consistently applied by EPA offices to collect and analyze data about  grants management workloads and use these data to inform staff  allocation. We also recommended that EPA review project officer critical  skills and competencies and determine training needs to address gaps  and develop recruitment and retention performance measures and collect  performance data for these measures. According to a May 2017 letter,  EPA agreed with the five recommendations we made in the report and  identified steps it was initiating to address them. We will continue to  monitor EPA\u2019s actions to implement these recommendations.", "In August 2014, we made recommendations to EPA related to information  security. Federal agencies rely on contractors to operate computer  systems and process information on their behalf. Federal law and policy  require that agencies ensure that contractors adequately protect these  systems and information. In our August 2014 report, we evaluated how  six agencies, including EPA, oversaw contractor-operated systems. With  regard to EPA, we found that the agency generally established security  and privacy requirements for contractors to follow and prepared for  assessments to determine the effectiveness of contractors\u2019  implementation of controls but was inconsistent in overseeing the  execution and review of those assessments. We recommended that EPA  develop, document, and implement oversight procedures for ensuring  that, for each contractor-operated system: (1) a system test is fully  executed and (2) plans of action and milestones with estimated  completion dates and resources assigned for resolution are maintained.  In comments on the report, EPA generally agreed with our  recommendations and has recently told us that it has taken steps to  implement these recommendations. We will evaluate whether these steps  meet the intent of the recommendations.", "In March 2010, we made recommendations to EPA related to workforce  planning. The ability of federal agencies to achieve their mission and  carry out their responsibilities depends in large part on whether they can  sustain a workforce that possesses the necessary education, knowledge,  skills, and other competencies. We and others have shown that  successful organizations use strategic workforce planning to help meet  present and future mission requirements. In our March 2010 report on  workforce planning at EPA and other agencies, we found that EPA\u2019s  workforce plan was not clearly aligned with its strategic plan or budget  formulation, consistent with leading workforce planning principles. For  example, EPA\u2019s workforce plan did not show how full-time equivalent  employees, skills, and locations would be aligned with the strategic plan  or budget. Without alignment to the strategic plan, we concluded that EPA  was at risk of not having the appropriately skilled workforce it needs to  effectively achieve its mission. We recommended, among other things,  that EPA incorporate into its workforce plan clear and explicit links  between the workforce plan and the strategic plan, and describe how the  workforce plan will help the agency achieve its strategic goals.

We found that EPA\u2019s regional offices had  varied widely in the extent of their oversight and the amount of influence  they had exerted over states\u2019 nonpoint source pollution management  programs. In addition, EPA\u2019s primary measures of effectiveness of states\u2019  management programs did not always demonstrate the achievement of  program goals, which are to eliminate remaining water quality problems  and prevent new threats from creating future water quality problems in  water bodies currently of high quality. To help protect water quality, we  recommended that EPA (1) provide guidance to its regional offices on overseeing state programs and, (2) in its revised reporting guidelines to  states, emphasize measures that more accurately reflect the overall  health of targeted water bodies and demonstrate states\u2019 focus on  protecting high-quality water bodies, where appropriate.

The Clean Water Act also  calls for EPA to revise the guidelines when appropriate. EPA has done  so, for example, to reflect advances in treatment technology or changes  in industries. EPA uses a two-phase process to identify industrial  categories needing new or revised effluent guidelines, including an initial  \u201cscreening\u201d phase in which EPA ranks industrial categories according to  the total toxicity of their wastewater. In September 2012, we concluded  that limitations in EPA\u2019s screening phase may have led the agency to  overlook some industrial categories that warrant further review for new or  revised effluent guidelines. For example, during the screening phase,  EPA had not considered the availability of advanced treatment  technologies for most industrial categories.
