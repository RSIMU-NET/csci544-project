Questions remain over the adequacy of steps taken by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure that claims paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) cover only those damages caused by flooding. GAO was asked to evaluate (1) issues that arise when multiple insurance policies provide coverage for losses from a single event, (2) state regulators' oversight of loss adjusters, and (3) information that NFIP collects to assess the accuracy of damage determinations and payments. GAO collected data from FEMA, reviewed reinspection reports and relevant policies and procedures, and interviewed state regulatory officials and others about adjuster oversight and NFIP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Insurance coverage gaps and claims uncertainties can arise when coverage for hurricane damage is divided among multiple insurance policies. Coverage for hurricanes generally requires more than one policy because private homeowners policies generally exclude flood damage. But the extent of coverage under each policy depends on the cause of the damages, as determined through the claims adjustment process and the policy terms that cover a particular type of damage. This process is further complicated when the damaged property is subjected to a combination of high winds and flooding and evidence at the damage scene is limited. Other claims concerns can arise on such properties when the same insurer serves as both NFIP's write-your-own (WYO) insurer and the property-casualty (wind) insurer. In such cases, the same company is responsible for determining damages and losses to itself and to NFIP, creating an inherent conflict of interest. Differences in licensing and training requirements for insurance claims adjusters among states also create uncertainties about adjusters' qualifications. Prior to the 2005 hurricane season, some coastal states had few or no requirements, while others had requirements for most types of adjusters. Further, states can waive their normal oversight requirements after a catastrophic event to help address demand, as they did after Hurricane Katrina. As a result, significant variations can exist in the qualifications of claims adjusters available after a catastrophic event. Strengthened and more uniform state requirements for adjusters could enhance the qualifications of the adjuster force in future catastrophes and improve the quality and consistency of claims adjustments. NFIP does not systematically collect and analyze both wind and flood damage claims data, limiting FEMA's ability to assess the accuracy of flood payments on hurricane-damaged properties. The claims data collected by NFIP through the WYO insurers--including those that sell and service both wind and flood policies on a property--do not include information on whether wind contributed to total damages or the extent of wind damage as determined by the WYO insurer. The lack of this data also limits the usefulness of FEMA's quality assurance reinspection program to reevaluate the accuracy of payments. In addition, the aggregate claims data that state insurance regulators collectively gathered after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were not intended to be used to assess wind and flood damage claims together on a property- or community-level basis. Further, FEMA program contractors do not have access to WYO insurers' policies, procedures, and instructions that describe to adjusters how wind and flood damages are to be determined when properties are subjected to both perils. FEMA officials stated that they did not have the authority to collect wind damage claims data from insurers. But without the ability to examine claims adjustment information for both the wind and flood damages, NFIP cannot always determine the extent to which each peril contributed to total property damages and the accuracy of the claims paid for losses caused by flooding."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Hurricanes pose unique challenges for insurers and property owners  Hurricanes pose unique challenges for insurers and property owners  because damages caused by these storms can result from multiple perils.  because damages caused by these storms can result from multiple perils.

About 96 percent of NFIP\u2019s policies are sold and  serviced by WYO insurers. For a given property, the WYO insurer writing  and administering the flood insurance policy on behalf of NFIP may also  provide coverage for wind-related risks on the same property.", "Through its program contractor, FEMA operates a reinspection program  to monitor and oversee claims adjustments and address concerns about  flood payments. The reinspection program\u2019s activities encompass  reevaluating the flood adjustments and claims payments made on  damaged property to determine whether NFIP paid the proper amount for  flood-related damages. The program conducts on-site reinspections and  reevaluations of a sample of flood claim adjustments.", "Determining the cause and extent of damages is primarily the job of  insurance adjusters, who are either employed or contracted by insurance  companies and generally licensed by the states. Adjusters assess damage;  estimate losses; and submit required reports, work sheets, and  photographs to the insurance company, which reviews the claims and  approves them for payment. In general, insurance adjusters are paid on a  percentage basis or fee schedule tied to the amount of damages. These  adjusters can fall into several categories:    Staff (or company) adjusters are employees of insurance companies who  determine the amount of damages payable on claims under a contract of  insurance.", "Independent adjusters and adjuster firms are contractors that insurance  companies hire to assess damages and determine claims losses.", "Emergency adjusters are sometimes allowed by states to operate on a  temporary basis to further augment the force of adjusters following a  catastrophe.", "Public adjusters are hired by and work on behalf of property owners to  assess damages and help prepare claims.", "Insurance adjusters are regulated by the states, which have been granted  authority by Congress to oversee insurance activities. The federal  government retains the authority to regulate insurance, giving primary  responsibility for insurance regulation to the states in accordance with the  McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. State insurance regulators\u2019 oversight  includes requirements pertaining to the licensing and training of insurance  adjusters. In addition, adjusters that have been licensed or allowed to  operate by a state can also be certified as flood adjusters by NFIP to  assess flood damages on properties.", "A property owner who has experienced hurricane damages can initiate a  flood insurance claim by contacting the insurance agent of the WYO  insurer that sold the NFIP flood policy. The agent relays the claim  information to the WYO insurer, which assigns a flood claims adjuster to  the case. The adjuster will then inspect the property to determine the  damage caused by flooding and the extent to which that damage is  covered under the flood policy. To help carry out this work, insurance  adjusters commonly use software that organizes the damage information  and estimates the repair or replacement costs for such damages. Factors  utilized in determining loss estimates include the square footage of the  building; the type of building materials; and the cost of materials and  repairs at the market rate, which is subject to change. Once the  assessment of a damaged property is complete, the adjuster files a report  with the WYO insurance company, which reviews the claim and approves  or denies it for payment to the policyholder (see fig. 1).", "Likewise, for wind-related damage claims on hurricane-damaged  properties, property owners can contact the insurance agent or company  that sold them their property-casualty policy to start the claims process.  For some property owners, their property-casualty insurer for wind- related risks is the same company that serves as NFIP\u2019s WYO insurer. In  such cases, both the wind and flood insurance policies will be processed  by the same insurer. In other cases, where the property-casualty insurer is  a different company than the WYO insurer, claims for wind and flood  damages will be processed separately by different insurers.", "Both the insurance industry and NFIP incurred unprecedented storm  losses from the 2005 hurricane season. State insurance regulators  estimated that property-casualty insurers had paid out approximately  $22.4 billion in claims tied to Hurricane Katrina (excluding flood) as of  December 31, 2006. However, industry observers estimate that insured  losses tied to Hurricane Katrina alone (other than flood) could total more  than $40 billion, depending on the outcome of outstanding claims and  ongoing litigation.

Further, because both homeowners and  NFIP policies can be serviced by a single WYO insurer, a conflict of  interest exists during the adjustment process. Since Hurricane Katrina,  legal disputes have been ongoing between property-casualty insurers and  policyholders over damage determinations and the interpretation of policy  language concerning coverage for damages that may have resulted from  both wind and flooding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Covering Hurricane Damages Often Requires Two or More Policies with Different Limits and Coverage", "paragraphs": ["Property owners cannot currently purchase a single insurance policy for  all hurricane-related damages because policies offered by property- casualty insurers generally exclude coverage for flood damage and  sometimes may exclude coverage for wind-related damage. Property  owners in flood-prone areas frequently have at least two insurance  policies\u2014for example, a homeowners policy from a private insurer and a  flood insurance policy backed by NFIP. Additionally, on certain properties  in coastal areas, private insurers sometimes exclude from homeowners  policies coverage for wind-related damage, requiring policyholders to  either pay an additional premium for wind-related risks on their primary  policy or to purchase a separate supplemental policy for wind-related  damages. In such cases, this supplemental coverage is typically provided  by a state-sponsored wind insurance pool that has been created to address  shortages in the availability of insurance for wind-related risks. Moreover,  some property owners may also have excess flood insurance if the value of  their home exceeds the coverage limits offered by NFIP.", "Private property-casualty insurance policies differ from the government- sponsored flood insurance policy in several ways. For example, key  differences exist between the level of coverage offered by NFIP and that  offered under common homeowners policies. Available coverage for  damages under an NFIP policy is limited by law to $250,000 for the  structure and $100,000 for contents, although the replacement cost value  of some homes exceeds such limits. Generally, private homeowners  policies can cover the replacement cost value of the house, and coverage  may be obtained to insure personal property, including outside property  and personal belongings (e.g., trees, plants, decks, and fences), in contrast  to an NFIP policy. Further, while homeowners policies often provide  coverage for additional living expenses if a house is rendered  uninhabitable, NFIP does not insure policyholders for such coverage,  although such expenses may be offset through other disaster assistance  provided by FEMA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurance Coverage Gaps, Claims Adjustment Uncertainties, and Conflicts of Interest Can Materialize When Two or More Policies Cover One Event", "paragraphs": ["Property owners do not know in advance whether their insurance policies  will cover all damages from a hurricane, because the payments ultimately  will depend on the extent to which each policy will cover the damages\u2014 that is, whether the damages are determined to be the result of hurricane  winds, flooding, or some combination of both. Even property owners that  purchase the maximum amount of flood insurance available through NFIP,  along with other private insurance for wind-related risks, do not know  whether they are completely covered until the insurers\u2019 claims adjusters  determine what caused the damage. Given the differences between the  coverage offered under flood insurance and the coverage offered by  private property-casualty insurance, the damage determinations can be  crucial. For example, a homeowner whose house is worth $450,000 may  have both a flood insurance policy and wind coverage, but flood insurance  covers only up to $250,000 in damages. If damages to the policyholder\u2019s  house are severe, and all of it is determined to be from flooding, the  property owner may not receive enough compensation to fully rebuild and  pay for temporary housing under the terms of the NFIP flood policy. But  if all of the damages are determined to have been caused by wind, the  homeowner may be able to fully recoup their losses and additional living  expenses. Hence, insurance coverage uncertainties can arise when  hurricane damages occur.", "Claims adjustment uncertainties include challenges that can arise in  assessing and adjusting damages due to wind and flooding when the  evidence of damage at the damage scene is limited or compromised. As a  result of the magnitude and severity of damage from Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita, evidence of the damaged structures was often limited or  compromised. In some cases, buildings were completely destroyed,  leaving little except the foundations. Insurance claims adjusters and  industry participants we spoke with acknowledged that assessing the  cause and extent of damages was more problematic when little evidence  of the structure was left. Exacerbating such difficulties was the fact that  adjusters commonly arrived on the damage site several weeks after  Hurricane Katrina occurred, given the scope of damage. During the time  between Hurricane Katrina and the arrival of the adjusters, the remaining  evidence at damage scenes may have been further compromised by  subsequent natural and man-made events (such as the clearing of debris  from streets and roadways).", "Finally, there is an inherent conflict of interest when the same insurer is  responsible for assessing damages for its own property-casualty policy, as  well as for the NFIP policy, each covering different perils on the same  property. As part of the WYO arrangement, private property-casualty  insurers are responsible for selling and servicing NFIP policies, including  performing the claims adjustment activities to assess the cause and extent  of damages. When the WYO insurer writes and services its own policy,  along with the NFIP policy for the same property, the insurer is  responsible for determining the cause of damages and, in turn, how much  of the damages it will pay for and how much NFIP will cover. In certain  damage scenarios, the WYO insurer that covers a policyholder for wind  losses can have a vested economic interest in the outcome of the damage  determination that it performs when the property is subjected to a  combination of high winds and flooding. In such cases, a conflict of  interest exists with the WYO insurer as it determines which damages were  caused by wind, to be paid by itself, and which damages were caused by  flooding, to be paid by NFIP. Moreover, the amount WYO insurers are  compensated for servicing a flood claim also increases as the amount of  flood damage on a claim increases\u2014an allowance of 3.3 percent of each  claim settlement amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Disputes Involving Policy Coverage Have Arisen Since the 2005 Hurricane Season", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the 2005 hurricane season, legal disputes emerged  between policyholders and insurers that centered largely on the extent to  which damages would be covered under a homeowners policy, as distinct  from an NFIP policy, when both high winds and flooding occurred. Such  disputes have been and continue to be argued and resolved though state  and federal courts, as well as through mediation programs.", "Many of these cases have concerned the interpretation and/or  enforceability of certain property-casualty policy language in the context  of challenging the cause of the damages or losses. For example, some  disputes have raised the question of whether a policy\u2019s flood exclusion  language clearly excluded the water-related event, such as storm surge,  that caused the damages at issue. Other cases have challenged the  enforceability of a property-casualty policy\u2019s anti-concurrent causation  clause. Such a clause generally provides that coverage is precluded for  damage caused directly or indirectly by an excluded cause of loss (for  example, flood), regardless of any other cause (for example, wind) that  contributes concurrently to or in any sequence with the loss. Many of  these cases are still working their way through the judicial trial and  appeals processes and will eventually be resolved based on the particular  language of the policy, the evidence presented by both the policyholders  and the insurers, and the governing state law.", "State mediation efforts have been initiated to help address the backlog of  unresolved claims between policyholders and insurance companies on  private homeowners policies.

For example, as we reported in 2005,  following Hurricane Isabel, one of the reasons that claims for additional  losses were not paid was because damage was not due to flooding, but  wind-driven rain.", "NFIP\u2019s normal claims processing activities were stressed during the 2005  hurricane season. For both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, FEMA estimates  that NFIP has paid approximately $16.2 billion in claims, with average  payments exceeding $95,000 and $47,000, respectively. As we reported in  December 2006, in an effort to assist policyholders, FEMA approved  expedited NFIP claims processing methods that were unique to  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some expedited methods included the use  of aerial and satellite photography and flood depth data in place of a site  visit by a claims adjuster for properties that likely had covered damages  exceeding policy limits. Under other expedited methods, FEMA also  authorized claims adjustments without site visits if only foundations were  left and the square-foot measurements of the dwellings were known. Such  expedited procedures facilitated the prompt processing of flood claims  payments to policyholders, but once these flood claims\u2014and others\u2014 were processed, NFIP did not systematically collect corresponding wind  damage claims data on an after-the-fact basis. Without information on both  wind and flood damages to certain properties subjected to both perils,  NFIP has reduced assurances that the amounts it paid for flood claims  were actually limited to flood damage.", "FEMA officials stated that they do not have access to wind damage claims  data from the WYO insurers. Accordingly, NFIP does not systematically  collect data on wind damage for properties for which a flood claim has  been received. Rather, FEMA officials maintain that they review the  quality of claims adjustments through their reinspection program and  periodic operational reviews of companies. FEMA officials that we  contacted expressed different opinions concerning the need for the  authority to obtain wind-related data. While some FEMA and NFIP  contract officials stated that having the authority to obtain and analyze  wind-related claims information would be helpful in reviewing claims,  other senior FEMA officials questioned the usefulness of such information,  maintaining that existing oversight activities are generally sufficient  without an additional review of wind-related claims data.", "Without analyzing wind-related claims information, however, FEMA\u2019s  oversight process is limited for determining whether the inherent conflict  of interest that exists when a WYO insurer services its own policy and the  flood insurance policy on the same property is adversely affecting claims  determinations. This concern has also been noted in a Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General\u2019s interim report, which  stated, \u201cNFIP oversight focused primarily on whether the flood claim was  correctly adjudicated with little or no consideration for wind damage as a  contributing factor.\u201d The work being performed by the Office of  Inspector General also includes subpoenaing wind claims information  from WYO insurers to reevaluate wind versus flood determinations. This  work was ongoing as of the time this report was being completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Reinspection Program Has Limited Ability to Validate the Accuracy of Payments on Certain Hurricane- Damaged Properties Given the Lack of Information Available on Wind-Related Damage Claims", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s reinspection program, which reevaluates the adjustment process  and flood payments made, does not collect information that could help  enable FEMA to validate the claims payments on certain hurricane- damaged properties. The reinspection program does not systematically  evaluate the apportionment of damages between wind and flooding, even  when a conflict of interest exists with a WYO insurer. For example, the  program does not have a means of identifying whether wind-related  damage contributed to losses on the properties it evaluates or the extent  of such losses. Without the ability to examine damages caused by both  wind and flooding in some cases, the reinspection program is limited in its  ability to assess whether NFIP paid only the portion of damages it was  obligated to pay under the flood policy.", "During our study, we reviewed 740 reinspection files for properties with  flood claims associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We found that  most of these files did not document a determination of whether or not  damages were caused by a combination of wind and flooding and did not  adequately document whether the claim paid actually reflected only the  damage covered by the flood insurance policy versus damage caused by  other uncovered damages, such as wind. Rather, the files contained  limited and inconsistent documentation concerning the presence or extent  of wind-related damage on properties and lacked the documentation that  would have enabled NFIP to verify that damages paid for under the flood  policy were caused only by the covered loss of flooding.", "Specifically, the reinspection activities focused on reevaluating the extent  to which building and content damages were caused by flooding in the  absence of information concerning wind-related damage. While some of  the files documented damages that had been caused by a combination of  wind and flooding, most did not. Around two-thirds of the 740 reinspection  files did not indicate whether the damages had been caused only by  flooding or by a combination of wind and flooding and did not include  enough documentation for a reviewer to make such a determination.  Approximately 26 percent of the files indicated that the damages were  caused only by flooding, and 8 percent indicated that the damages were  caused by a combination of wind and flooding. When NFIP program  contractors conducting the reinspections did indicate that damages were  caused by a combination of wind and flooding, insufficient documentation  existed to determine the extent to which the wind damage contributed to  total property damages and, hence, the accuracy of the flood damage  claim.", "Concerning the lack of wind damage claims data available to NFIP, we  found that hurricane claims data gathered separately by state insurance  regulators were of limited value for understanding how wind and flooding  contributed to property damages. In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita, state insurance regulators in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana,  Mississippi, and Texas jointly established a data call mechanism to collect  aggregate claims data associated with the storms reported by property- casualty insurers. But such data were of limited value for assessing how  wind and flooding contributed to damages because this information lacked  sufficient geographic detail to be matched with corresponding flood  claims data on a community-level (e.g., zip-code) or property-level basis.  Rather, claims data reported by property-casualty insurers were reported  on a statewide and county- or parish-level basis for different elements. As  a result, the hurricane claims data collectively gathered by state insurance  regulators would have been of limited benefit to NFIP to understand how  both wind and flooding contributed to property damages. State insurance  regulators, through NAIC, are currently developing specifications and  exploring the feasibility of collecting more geographically detailed  information for an updated disaster reporting system based on lessons  learned from recent hurricanes and comments from interested parties  about monitoring insurance claims following a natural disaster.", "In the aftermath of the 2005 hurricane season, the NFIP reinspection  process was also challenged by the severity and scope of the damages.  Many properties were completely destroyed, making damage  determinations and reevaluations of such determinations difficult. The on- site reinspections of properties with flood claims associated with  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were generally conducted several months  after the event\u2014delays that were to some extent understandable,  considering the magnitude of the devastation. But the delays further  limited FEMA\u2019s ability to reevaluate the quality and accuracy of the initial  damage determinations, given the ongoing natural and man-made events  that continued to alter the damage scenes.", "Additionally, we have previously reported that FEMA did not choose  statistically valid random samples of the universe of all closed claims for  its reinspection process. Therefore, the results of the reinspections could  not be projected to the universe of properties for which flood claims were  made. Accordingly, we have previously recommended that FEMA select a  statistically valid sample of reinspections for its reinspection program.  FEMA has agreed to implement this recommendation.", "Finally, NFIP program contractors responsible for administering the  reinspection program also mentioned that they do not have access to WYO  companies\u2019 adjusting policies, procedures, and instructions to assess the  guidance provided to their adjusters (company staff or contracted) for  discerning and quantifying the damages caused by wind versus flooding.  The lack of information on the specific methodologies and instructions  conveyed by WYO insurers to their force of adjusters diminishes the  transparency over how damages were discerned between wind and  flooding on hurricane-damaged properties and the extent to which these  instructions are consistent with or at odds with FEMA\u2019s instructions to  adjusters. Absent such information along with the wind-related claims  data, FEMA\u2019s oversight of the NFIP WYO insurers to assess the accuracy  of flood claims payments is limited, particularly in cases where the WYO  insurer is also the wind insurer on the same property."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Resolving the unique insurance issues posed by hurricanes requires  actions to address numerous uncertainties. The NFIP must balance  pressures to quickly pay claims to policyholders with ensuring that it is  enforcing the terms of the flood policy. Uncertainties involved in this  process begin with the extent of covered damages from multiple policies,  contingent on the damage scenario, and continue with the claims  adjustment and regulatory oversight activities that follow. As we have  seen, policyholders do not know in advance of a hurricane the extent to  which damages will be covered because the amount of insured losses  depends on whether it is a multiperil event, how much of the damages are  caused by wind and how much by flooding, and how policy language will  be interpreted in accordance with relevant state laws. Other concerns can  also materialize when the WYO insurer determines not only the damage  caused by flooding that is covered by the flood policy, but also the damage  caused by wind that is covered under its own property-casualty policy,  creating an inherent conflict of interest that must be managed or  mitigated. In the aftermath of Katrina, policyholders and insurance  companies were and continue to be uncertain as to how current language  on property-casualty insurance policies will be interpreted, and numerous  lawsuits continue to make their way through federal and state courts.", "Once an event has occurred, other uncertainties arise concerning the  qualifications and training of claims adjusters. State licensing and training  requirements vary considerably, and standards that do exist may be  relaxed or eliminated after a major catastrophe, depending on the scope of  damage. Additionally, uncertainties remain over the probability of  accurately discerning the extent to which damages were caused by wind  versus flooding on certain hurricane-damaged properties. The difficulty in  performing this task can increase when evidence remaining at the damage  scene is limited or compromised. Not surprisingly, the variations in  adjusters\u2019 qualifications, coupled with limited or compromised evidence at  damage scenes, foster debate and uncertainty over the way damage  determinations are made, the consistency of adjustments for similarly  damaged properties, and how losses are apportioned between flood and  wind insurers. In the absence of uniform state standards for claims  adjusters, state insurance regulators, as well as policyholders, cannot be  certain of the minimum qualifications or level of professional training of a  claims adjuster assigned to a particular property, increasing the possibility  of inconsistent claims adjustments and payments for similarly damaged  properties.", "Uncertainties are also present in the oversight of claims adjustment  processes, given the lack of information concerning both wind and flood  damage claims for certain hurricane-damaged properties. FEMA cannot be  certain of the quality of NFIP claims adjustments allocating damage to  flooding in cases where damages may have been caused by a combination  of wind and flooding because NFIP does not systematically collect and  analyze both types of damage claims data together on a property-level  basis. Although FEMA officials believe they can verify the accuracy of  flood claim payments without the wind data, there are situations where  additional information is warranted. Without information on the wind  damage claims adjustments prepared by WYO insurers at the time they  submit flood claims on hurricane-damaged properties, FEMA lacks  controls to independently assess whether or not the apportionments  between flood and wind damage appear reasonable. FEMA officials have  determined that they currently lack the authority to access the WYO  insurers\u2019 claims data and guidance to adjusters for wind-related claims to  evaluate the reasonableness of the flood claims for properties that were  also subject to damage from high winds. Hence, for a given property, NFIP  does not know how each peril contributed to the total property damages  or how adjusters working for the WYO insurers made such determinations.", "As a result, FEMA cannot be certain whether NFIP has paid only for  damage caused by flooding when insurers with a financial interest in  apportioning damages between wind and flooding are responsible for  making such apportionments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen and clarify FEMA\u2019s oversight of WYO insurers, particularly  those that service both wind and flood damage claims on the same  property, we recommend the Congress consider giving FEMA clear  statutory access to:    both wind and flood damage claims information available from NFIP\u2019s  WYO insurers in cases in which it is likely that both wind and flooding  contributed to any damage or loss to covered properties, enabling NFIP to  match and analyze the wind and flood damage apportionments made on  hurricane-damaged properties in a systematic fashion, as appropriate; and the policies, procedures, and instructions used by WYO insurers and their  adjusters for both flood and wind claims to assess and validate insurers\u2019  claims adjustment practices for identifying, apportioning, and quantifying  damages in cases where there are combined perils."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that state insurance commissioners, acting through NAIC,  enhance the quality and consistency of standards and oversight for all  types of claims adjusters among states through more stringent and  consistent licensing and training requirements for adjusters, including, in  those states where appropriate, training to assess and apportion damages  due to wind, flooding, or both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from FEMA and NAIC.  The Department of Homeland Security provided written comments on a  draft of this report, which have been reprinted in appendix II. FEMA  concurred with our recommendation to strengthen licensing requirements  for adjusters but disagreed with the matters for congressional  consideration to give FEMA clear statutory authority to obtain 1) wind  damage claims information available from WYO insurers and 2) the  policies, procedures, and instructions used for determining wind damage  versus flood damage when properties are subjected to both perils. In oral  comments, NAIC expressed general agreement with the draft\u2019s findings  and recommendations. In addition, both FEMA and NAIC provided  technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate.", "FEMA stated that it believed existing oversight measures for NFIP and  WYO insurers were sufficient and that statutory access to wind and flood  damage claims information from NFIP WYO insurers would place an  unneeded burden and cost on NFIP. FEMA also stated that it did not  believe NFIP needs the wind estimate or data to determine the amount of  flood damage that occurred. It also noted that additional unnecessary  costs would be incurred to access and analyze wind damage claims  information from WYO insurers. We disagree. Because of the inherent  conflict of interest that exists when WYO insurers are the property- casualty insurers for wind claims and are also responsible for servicing the  flood claims on the same properties, FEMA must ensure that its internal  controls are sufficient to minimize the potential adverse impacts of this  conflict on the accuracy of damage determinations and flood claims  payments. Accurately determining claims payments is particularly  important, given the likely eventuality that FEMA would need to draw on  the U.S. Treasury to pay flood losses that exceed the funds available from  premiums.", "We do not suggest that FEMA collect and analyze wind claims data for  each claim or even each flood event. Rather, we recommend that FEMA  have the ability to access wind damage claims information when it is  available from the WYO insurer\u2014that is, in circumstances when the WYO  insurer is responsible for servicing both the wind and flood policies on the  same property and when uncertainties exist, such as when the physical  evidence has been compromised or limited physical evidence remains.  Obtaining wind damage claims information that is already available from  WYO insurers establishes proper transparency over the adjustment  process when both wind and flooding contribute to damages without an  unreasonable or costly burden. As long as a conflict of interest exists with  a WYO insurer that services its own policy for wind-related risks along  with the NFIP flood policy on the same property, additional controls are  warranted. When properties are subjected to both wind and flood perils,  particularly in cases where uncertainties exist due to limited or  compromised evidence at the damage scene, collecting enough  information to understand whether or not the WYO insurer is also the  wind insurer for the same property and, if so, the extent of damage it  determined to be caused by wind versus flooding, is key to maintaining  transparency over the adjustment process. Furthermore, when the same  insurance company has already determined the amount of damage caused  by wind and flooding for a given property, obtaining and assessing this  available information should not be cost prohibitive for FEMA or WYO  insurers. The authority to access policies, procedures, and guidance used  for determining wind versus flood damage would enable FEMA to have a  more complete understanding about how concurrent damages are handled  by the WYO insurers. Such information would strengthen FEMA\u2019s  oversight and ability to identify abuses and better ensure the accuracy of  flood payments made.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
