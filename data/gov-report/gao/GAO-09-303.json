Two recent estimates project additional costs ranging from $2.4 billion to $7.4 billion and 1 to 3 more years to complete development. Despite cost and schedule troubles, DOD wants to accelerate JSF procurement by 169 aircraft from fiscal years 2010 through 2015; this could require up to $33.4 billion in additional procurement funding for those 6 years. DOD plans to procure hundreds of aircraft on cost-reimbursement contracts, magnifying the financial risk to the government. Ongoing manufacturing inefficiencies and parts problems have significantly delayed the delivery of test assets. The prime contractor has extended manufacturing schedules three times and delivered 2 of 13 test aircraft. The program is still recovering from earlier problems that resulted in design changes, late parts deliveries, and inefficient manufacturing. The contractor is taking positive steps to improve operations, the supplier base, and schedule management. Schedule risk analyses could further enhance management insight into problem areas and inform corrective actions. Officials expect to deliver all test aircraft and fix many problems by 2010. By then, DOD plans to have purchased 62 operational aircraft and will be ramping up procurement. Procuring large numbers of production jets while still working to deliver test jets and mature manufacturing processes does not seem prudent, and looming plans to accelerate procurement will be difficult to achieve cost effectively. DOD's revised test plan adds a year to the schedule, better aligns resources and availability dates, and lessens the overlap between development and operational testing, but it still allows little time for error discovery and rework. DOD's decision late in 2007 to reduce test aircraft and flight tests adds to risks while any additional delays in delivering test aircraft will further compress the schedule. The revised plan relies on state-of-the-art simulation labs, a flying test bed, and desk studies to verify nearly 83 percent of JSF capabilities. Only 17 percent is to be verified through flight testing. Despite advances, the ability to so extensively substitute for flight testing has not yet been demonstrated. Significant overlap of development, test, and procurement results in DOD making substantial investments before flight testing proves that the JSF will perform as expected. Under the accelerated procurement plan, DOD may procure 360 aircraft costing an estimated $57 billion before completing development flight testing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) most  complex and ambitious aircraft acquisition, seeking to simultaneously  produce and field three aircraft variants for the Air Force, Navy, Marine  Corps, and eight international partners.

The program  began in November 1996 with a 5-year competition between Lockheed  Martin and Boeing to determine the most capable and affordable  preliminary aircraft design. Lockheed Martin won the competition, and the  program entered system development and demonstration in October 2001.  Program goals are to develop and field an affordable, highly common  family of stealthy, next-generation strike fighter aircraft for the Navy, Air  Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. allies.", "The JSF is a single-seat, single-engine aircraft, designed to rapidly  transition between air-to-ground and air-to-air missions while still  airborne. To achieve its mission, the JSF will incorporate low-observable  (stealth) technologies, defensive avionics, advanced onboard and offboard  sensor fusion, internal and external weapons, and advanced prognostic  maintenance capability. The JSF family consists of three variants. The  conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant will primarily be an air- to-ground replacement for the Air Force\u2019s F-16 Falcon and the A-10  Warthog aircraft, and will complement the F-22A Raptor. The short takeoff  and vertical landing (STOVL) variant will be a multi-role strike fighter to  replace the Marine Corps\u2019 F/A-18C/D Hornet and AV-8B Harrier aircraft.  The carrier-suitable variant will provide the Navy a multi-role, stealthy  strike aircraft to complement the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. DOD is  planning to buy a total of 2,456 JSFs and allies are expected to procure a  minimum of 730 CTOL and STOVL aircraft.", "Because of the program\u2019s sheer size and the numbers of aircraft it will  replace, the JSF is the linchpin of DOD\u2019s long-term plan to modernize  tactical air forces. It is DOD\u2019s largest acquisition program, with total cost  currently estimated at $300 billion, and the longest in planned duration,  with procurement projected through 2034. In addition, the JSF remains  DOD\u2019s largest cooperative program. Our international partners are  providing about $4.8 billion toward development, and foreign firms are  part of the industrial base producing aircraft. DOD\u2019s funding requirements  for the JSF assume economic benefits from these foreign purchases in  reducing unit costs for U.S aircraft.", "Table 1 shows the evolution of DOD\u2019s official estimated cost, quantity, and  deliveries from the initiation of system development in October 2001 to the  current official program of record dated December 2007 and submitted to  the Congress in April 2008. It depicts quantities reduced in the last major  program restructure in 2004, the impacts of increased costs on unit prices,  and the slip in delivering initial operating capability to the warfighter.", "In our March 2008 report, we stated that JSF costs would likely grow  much higher than reported because the program of record at that time did  not include all acquisition costs (including the alternate engine program  directed by the Congress), made overoptimistic assumptions, and did not  fully reflect the mounting cost and schedule pressures from manufacturing  inefficiencies and compressed time frames for completing development.  We questioned the Mid-Course Risk Reduction Plan adopted by DOD in  September 2007 that cut two development test aircraft, reduced test  flights, and accelerated the reduction in the prime contractor\u2019s  development workforce in order to replenish management reserves  depleted by design changes and manufacturing problems. We  recommended that DOD accomplish a full and comprehensive estimate of  the total program verified by an independent third party and revisit the  Mid-Course Risk Reduction Plan with an intensive analysis of the causes  of management reserve depletion, progress against the baseline  manufacturing schedule, and correction of deficiencies in the contractor\u2019s  earned value management system.

Cost overruns on both the aircraft and  engine contracts, delays in manufacturing test aircraft, and a need for a  longer, more robust flight test program are the primary cost drivers. The  joint team\u2019s estimate is higher than the program office\u2019s because it  included costs for the alternate engine program directed by the Congress  and used more conservative assumptions based on current and legacy  aircraft experiences. Program officials contend that funding the program  to the higher cost estimate is premature and believe processes are in place  to substantially improve on the test experiences of past programs.  Regardless, both estimates agree that cost and time to complete  development have increased from the official program of record at the  time of our review. (See table 2.)", "The program office\u2019s revised development cost estimate projects an  additional $2.4 billion and a 1-year extension in the schedule compared to  the official program of record reported to the Congress. This would  increase the system development portion of the acquisition program to  $46.8 billion and delay its completion to October 2014. The cost increases  primarily resulted from the following factors.    $1.2 billion for aircraft development. Program officials declared a cost  overrun on the prime air system contract because of increased labor  hours, higher prices, and supply shortages. Included in this figure is  $200 million to be added to the contractor\u2019s management reserve. Last  year, we reported that mounting cost and schedule pressures depleted  reserves much faster than anticipated. By summer 2007, the program  had spent about two-thirds of budgeted funds but had accomplished  only half the work required. Since then, DOD\u2019s efforts to restore  reserves and fix manufacturing inefficiencies have not fully achieved  intended results, requiring another cash infusion.   $800 million for engine development. According to officials from the  Defense Contract Management Agency, the engine contractor  continued to face development problems, which resulted in a contract  cost overrun. Higher costs for labor and materials, supplier problems,  and the rework needed to correct deficiencies with the engine blade  design discovered during ground testing were major contributing  factors.   $300 million for flight test extension. The program extended system  development by 1 year to provide more time for development and  operational flight testing. In April 2008, an operational test review team  recommended extending the development contract by 1 year. The  review team considered but dismissed several other options to address  the schedule problem, including deferring requirements.", "On the other hand, the joint estimating team estimates that it will cost  $14.8 billion to complete JSF development, $7.4 billion more than the  official program of record at the time of our review. This would increase  the total development costs to $51.8 billion from the $44.4 billion reported  to the Congress last year\u2014a 17 percent increase. The joint team also  projected a 3-year program extension beyond the program of record in  order to complete system development, 2 years more than the new  program office estimate.", "The joint team\u2019s estimate was $5 billion more than the new program office  estimate. Several factors account for the difference between the two  estimates.", "Alternate engine. The joint estimating team included $1.4 billion to  complete development of an alternate engine for the JSF; the program  office estimate did not include alternate engine costs. The Congress  has directed DOD to develop a second source for the JSF engine to  induce competition and to ensure that one engine\u2019s failures would not  ground all JSFs, thereby reducing operational risks in the future. DOD  has not wanted to pursue this second engine source and twice removed  funding from the JSF program line.", "Engineering staffing. The joint estimating team projected a need for  the contractor to retain considerably more engineering staff and for  longer periods of time than the program office estimate to complete  development, evaluate test results, and correct deficiencies. Releasing  engineering staff prematurely risks not discovering problems until late  in development or during fielding, when they would be more expensive  to address.", "Software development. The joint estimating team believes that the  software productivity rate will be less than the program\u2019s calculation  and anticipates much more growth in software requirements. The JSF  aircraft is expected to require 7.5 million lines of computer code\u2014the  most by far of any aircraft. By comparison, the F/A-18E/F has only 1.1  million and the F-22A 2.2 million. Experiences on past acquisitions  have shown 30 to 100 percent growth in software requirements over  time, while the JSF Program Office estimate assumed no growth.", "Flight testing. The joint estimating team projects that flight testing will  require more time and effort than the program office has built into its  current schedule. Continuing delays in delivering test aircraft are  expected to hamper and further compress test schedules. In particular,  the joint team projects that the two aircraft dedicated to carrier  suitability tests will be late off the production line, thereby delaying  test activities. It also projected that the JSF will require about 2,700  hours of flight testing for mission systems, significantly more than the  1,700 hours that the program office currently estimates.", "Manufacturing production hours. The joint estimating team projects  that production span times for the JSF will be longer than the program  office estimates based on the program\u2019s performance to date and  experience of recent programs, such as the F/A-18 E/F and the F-22A.  The span time is an indicator of how long the manufacturing effort  takes and when flight testing can begin. The program office assumes  that span times will decrease over the course of the development  contract. We note that span times typically increase during  development, as was the case for both the B-2 bomber and F-22A  programs.", "Program officials believe that their estimate is more accurate and that  providing extra funding to address future risks is premature and does not  provide incentives for contractors to control costs. The program office  attributes its lower cost estimate to several factors. First, the quantity,  quality, and flexibility of the JSF laboratories should enable the program  to reduce more risks in a laboratory environment, rather than through  flight testing, which is considerably more expensive. In addition, the  program\u2019s efforts to develop the final software system infrastructure early  should reduce significant software problems later in the program,  according to the program office. The program office also believes that  costs will be lower because progress in several key development areas is  either matching plans or is ahead of where legacy programs were at  similar points of time in their development. For example, the program is  currently reducing engineering staff as planned. The program is also  producing software at a rate significantly higher than that of the F-22A  program and is at least 18 months ahead of where the F-22A program was  at a similar point in developing mission systems, according to program  officials. Officials told us that they intend to fund the fiscal year 2010  development budget based on the joint team\u2019s higher estimate.

Compared to last year, this  accelerated plan would procure an additional 169 aircraft during these 6  years, moving aircraft that had been scheduled for procurement beyond  2015 to earlier years. According to the two estimates, this plan would  require from $21.8 billion to $33.4 billion more funding than the official  program of record, as shown in table 3.", "The joint team\u2019s estimate is higher than the program office\u2019s, primarily for  these reasons:    The joint team projected slower gains in production efficiency than the  program office.

Cost contracts place most of the risk on the  buyer\u2014DOD in this case\u2014who is liable to pay more than budgeted should  labor, material, or other incurred costs be more than expected when the  contract was signed. JSF officials plan to procure at least the first four  low-rate production lots under cost reimbursement contracts and to  transition to fixed-price instruments when appropriate, possibly between  lots 5 and 7 (fiscal years 2011 to 2013). It is unclear exactly how and when  this will happen, but the expectation is to transition to fixed pricing once  the air vehicle has a mature design, has been demonstrated in flight tests,  and is producible at established cost targets. To date, DOD has procured  the first three lots for a total of 30 aircraft and $7.4 billion on cost  reimbursement terms. Under the accelerated procurement plan, DOD  could procure as many as 360 aircraft costing about $57 billion through  fiscal year 2013 on cost reimbursement contracts, as illustrated in figure 1.", "Cost reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred  costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. According to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, cost reimbursement contracts are suitable for use  only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit  costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed- price contract. Cost reimbursement contracts for weapon production are  considered appropriate when the program lacks sufficient knowledge  about system design, manufacturing processes, and testing results to  establish firm prices and delivery dates. In contrast, a fixed-price contract  provides for a pre-established price, places more of the risk and  responsibility for costs on the contractor, and provides more incentive for  efficient and economical performance.", "Procuring up to 360 production aircraft on cost reimbursement  contracts\u2014-nearly 15 percent of the total DOD program\u2014seems to be a  tacit acknowledgment by DOD and the contractor that knowledge on JSF  design, production processes, and costs for labor and material is not yet  sufficiently mature and that pricing information is not exact enough for  the contractor to assume the risk under a fixed-price contract. It also  seems to be a consequence of the substantial concurrency of development,  test, and production built into the JSF schedule. Significant overlap of  these activities means that DOD is procuring considerable quantities of  operational aircraft while development test aircraft are still on the  production line and much in advance of testing to prove aircraft  performance and suitability. Establishing a clear and accountable path to  ensure that the contractor assumes more of the risk is prudent.

As such, the program is likely to experience considerable  cost growth in the future as it steps up its flight testing, discovers new  problems, and makes the necessary technical and design corrections.", "While the program has been able to demonstrate basic aircraft flying  capabilities, it has recently experienced testing delays and has fallen  behind the flight test plan established in 2007. At the time of our review,  the program had flown about half of its planned 155 flight tests for 2008.  The test program currently has two development test aircraft and an  integrated airborne test bed, with the following experiences to date:    Sixty-five test flights on the original, non\u2013production representative  prototype contributed to discoveries in, among other things, landing  gear door fitting, aerial refueling operations, and weapons bay  functions. The prototype experienced a 3-month delay because of  engine bay nacelle vent fan malfunctions that were subsequently  resolved.", "Initial testing of the first of 12 production representative prototypes  began in June 2008\u2014a STOVL variant flown in conventional mode.

In the  same time frame, it also plans to begin flight testing 6 of its 12 production  representative prototype test aircraft (CTOL and STOVL aircraft),  including the first 2 aircraft dedicated to mission system testing. The first  carrier variant development test aircraft is expected to begin full flight  testing\u2014including ship suitability testing\u2014in 2010.

The new plan is still  aggressive, however, and has little room for error discovery, rework, and  recovery from downtime should test assets be grounded or otherwise  unavailable. The sheer complexity of the JSF program\u2014with 7.5 million  lines of software code, three variants, and multi-mission development\u2014 suggests that the aircraft will encounter many unforeseen problems during  flight testing requiring additional schedule to rework. Our past work has  shown that programs that do not allow sufficient time to address the  inevitable problems discovered in testing, run a greater risk of significant  cost increases and schedule delays when problems do arise. The joint  estimating team noted that the program\u2019s flight test plan assumed a higher  productivity than has been seen on recent flight test programs. As such,  the joint team believes that flight testing will require an additional 2 years  to complete beyond the 1 year already added to development and suggests  that more flight test hours will be necessary to test mission systems and  the carrier variant in particular.", "The Mid-Course Risk Recovery Plan, approved in late 2007, cut two  development test aircraft, reduced test flights, and relies more on ground  laboratories and simulations to verify performance, adding substantial risk  to the program. Our 2008 report discussed the objections from several  prominent DOD offices to the Mid-Course Risk Recovery Plan. The  Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, for example, identified risks  in the revised verification strategy and cited inadequate capacity to handle  the pace of mission testing and ship suitability and signature testing. This  increases the likelihood of not finding and resolving critical design  deficiencies until operational testing, when it is more costly and disruptive  to do so.", "The test plan relies heavily on a series of advanced and robust simulation  labs and a flying test bed to verify aircraft and subsystem performance.  Figure 6 shows that 83 percent of the aircraft\u2019s capabilities are to be  verified through labs, the flying test bed, and subject matter analysis, while  only 17 percent of test points are to be verified through flight testing. The  JSF program spent $5 billion on its system of simulation labs and models.  Program officials argue that their heavy investment in simulation labs will  allow early risk reduction, thereby reducing the need for additional flight  testing, controlling costs, and meeting the key milestones of the program\u2019s  aggressive test plan.", "The JSF program\u2019s simulation labs appear more prolific, integrated, and  capable than the labs used in past aircraft programs. The program utilizes  18 labs for development whereas only 9 were used for the F-22A, 7 for the  F-18, and 5 for the F-16. According to program officials, the greater  number of labs allows engineers to work simultaneously on different  development blocks, reducing bottlenecks that may occur in testing. In  contrast, engineers of the F-18 and F-22A programs had to interrupt or  shut down development on one development block while they were  making corrections to another. Also in contrast to past programs, key JSF  simulation labs are colocated at a Lockheed Martin plant in Fort Worth,  Texas. The F-22A program utilized three locations and two different  companies. According to the program office, the colocation of the key  testing labs facilitates more seamless integration of key aircraft  components. Program officials also noted that JSF labs use the actual  aircraft components to a greater extent than labs did in past programs and  also have greater software processing capacity. This allows for more  realistic data, which should reduce the need for additional flight testing.  Further, the JSF utilizes the first fully integrated airborne test bed for  mission system testing. According to program officials, the test bed\u2019s  design is geospatially proportionate to an actual F-35 aircraft, enhancing  its ability to accurately verify aircraft performance.", "While the labs appear more prolific, integrated, and complex than those  used in legacy programs, concerns about their extensive use in verifying  aircraft performance remain. The extent of the JSF program\u2019s planned lab  use is unprecedented, but the ability to substitute for flight testing has not  yet been demonstrated. In addition, the labs have yet to be fully  accredited. Accreditation is required to ensure the adequate capability of  labs and models to perform verification tasks. It is critical that the models  behave like aircraft to ensure that the system\u2019s performance requirements  are being verified accurately. The program office said that it is on track to  complete the accreditation of the labs in time to begin verifying system  performance. However, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation  reports that the progress of the accreditation support packages is behind  schedule and suggests that more flight testing may be needed as the  accreditation process reveals the limitations of the models. Some DOD  officials are also concerned that the labs will be understaffed. The Director  of Operational Test and Evaluation and DOD\u2019s joint estimating team both  reported that the program\u2019s current resource plans reduce engineering  staff too rapidly. Engineering and test personnel are critical to analyzing  the data generated from the labs.

While some of the  report\u2019s concerns are not specific requirements, some DOD officials  believe that the shortfalls may adversely affect the JSF\u2019s ability to meet  warfighter needs. For example:    The current F-35 power system may cause excessive damage to runway  surfaces which could limit its ability to operate in certain locations.  The program is still evaluating the problem and plans to gather data  and conduct further studies when full-scale models or actual aircraft  are available. According to a program official, changes to the aircraft\u2019s  design or to the current concept of operations may be needed. The  program has alerted the services and believes it will have a better  understanding of the problem sometime in 2009.", "Thermal management challenges hamper the ability to conduct  missions in hot and cold environments. The Director of Operational  Test and Evaluation reported that an alternative main engine fuel pump  to remedy this problem is under development but will not be available  before the low-rate initial production Lot 3, which is likely to affect  operational testing.

It is now in its  most challenging phase, at a crossroads of a sort. Challenges are many\u2014 continuing cost and schedule pressures; complex, extensive, and unproven  software requirements; and a nascent, very aggressive test program with  diminished flight test assets. Looking forward, the contractor plans to  complete work expeditiously to deliver the test assets, significantly step  up flight testing, begin verifying mission system capabilities, mature  manufacturing processes, and quickly ramp up production of operational  aircraft. As such, the credibility of the program\u2019s test plans, manufacturing  capacity, and subsequent cost and schedule estimates should become  more apparent.", "The program must move forward, but given all these challenges,  accelerating procurement in a cost-reimbursement contract  environment\u2014where uncertainties in contract performance do not permit  costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed- price contract\u2014places very significant financial risk on the government.  Accelerating plans also does not equate to an ability to deliver to those  plans. Because the program\u2019s manufacturing processes are still maturing  and flight testing is still in its infancy, incorporating an accelerated  production schedule introduces even more risk and uncertainty to the  program. Our past work has shown that programs that make production  decisions prior to fully proving a system\u2019s design through testing and  demonstration of mature manufacturing processes have an increased risk  of design and production changes and retrofits of completed aircraft.  Until the contractor demonstrates that it can produce aircraft in a timely  and efficient manner, DOD cannot fully grasp future funding requirements.  DOD needs tangible assurance from the prime contractor that it can meet  expected development and production expectations. By accelerating   low-rate production quantities before manufacturing and testing processes  are mature, DOD accepts most of the contractors\u2019 production and  manufacturing inefficiencies. At minimum, the contractor needs to  develop a detailed plan demonstrating how it can successfully meet  program development and production goals in the near future within cost  and schedule parameters.

More specifically, our research has identified nine  practices associated with effective schedule estimating. These practices  are (1) capturing all activities, (2) sequencing all activities, (3) assigning  resources to all activities, (4) establishing the duration of all activities,   (5) integrating schedule activities horizontally and vertically,   (6) establishing the critical path for all activities, (7) identifying float  between activities, (8) conducting a schedule risk analysis, and   (9) updating the schedule using logic and durations to determine dates.", "Of these nine practices, the JSF program either met or partially met eight  with only one not being met. The area that did not meet the practices  related to performing a schedule risk analysis. Specifically, the JSF  program has not conducted its own schedule risk analysis that would  determine the level of confidence it has in meeting completion dates.  Further, an assessment is also critical to identifying and apportioning  reserves for contingencies. Since the JSF program has not conducted its  own schedule risk analysis, it has limited insight into areas of risk and  uncertainty in the schedule. Naval Air Systems Command officials did  accomplish an independent schedule risk analysis that indicated that the  program could slip more than 2 years based on the productivity risks  associated with software development and assembly of the various  airframes as well as the time needed to complete all flight testing.", "In addition to a schedule risk analysis not being performed, we found  several other schedule management concerns that further reduce the  visibility of manufacturing risks. First, the use of best scheduling practices  at the subcontractor level is still being developed, potentially affecting the  integration of subcontractor schedules into the integrated master  schedule. Integrating prime and subcontractor schedules is critical to  meeting program schedules and cost expectations. The prime contractor is  working with subcontractors to increase their level of schedule maturity.  Another area of concern is that out-of-station work made it difficult to  identify specific span times for individual manufacturing tasks. As a  result, the detailed information related to the manufacturing work was not  visible in the master schedule. Furthermore, because of the program\u2019s  enormous size and complexity, the schedule has been difficult to maintain,  requiring manual validation processes to ensure its integrity and validity.  Ongoing JSF schedule validity will be an area that needs careful attention  as it represents a potential weak point in the overall implementation of the  integrated master schedule.", "Despite this shortcoming, it is also important to recognize the significant  progress that the JSF program team has made in the area of schedule  management. Since the previous Defense Contract Management Agency  schedule review, both the schedule and the processes to manage it have  greatly improved. For example, the schedule can track and verify activities  associated with over 600 projects.
