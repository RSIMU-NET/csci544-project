Such weaknesses in the CFS preparation process impair the U.S. government's ability to ensure that the CFS is consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements, properly balanced, and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The weaknesses GAO identified during the fiscal year 2005 CFS audit involved the following areas: (1) directly linking audited federal agency financial statements to the CFS, (2) comparability of financial statements, (3) audit assurance over certain federal agencies' closing packages, (4) internal control monitoring, (5) consolidated reporting guidance to federal agencies, (6) reconciling of intragovernmental activity and balances, and (7) various other internal control weaknesses that were identified in previous years' audits but remained in fiscal year 2005. Of the 154 recommendations GAO reported in May 2005 regarding the process for preparing the CFS, 131 remained open as of December 2, 2005, when GAO completed its fieldwork for the audit of the fiscal year 2005 CFS. However, 76 of these 131 recommendations relate to specific disclosures required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Treasury has submitted a proposal to the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) seeking to amend previously issued standards and eliminate or lessen the disclosure requirements for the consolidated financial statements so that U.S. generally accepted accounting principles would no longer require certain of the information Treasury has not been reporting.

Specifically, we have reported that  the federal government did not have adequate systems, controls, and  procedures to properly prepare its consolidated financial statements. Many  of these weaknesses in internal control that contributed to our continuing  disclaimers of opinion were identified by agency financial statement  auditors during their audits of federal agencies\u2019 financial statements and  were reported in detail with recommendations to the agencies in separate  reports.

In our disclaimer of opinion on  the fiscal year 2005 CFS, which is included in the fiscal year 2005 Financial  Report of the United States Government, we discussed material  deficiencies relating to Treasury\u2019s preparation of the CFS. These material  deficiencies contributed to our disclaimer of opinion on the CFS and also  constitute a material weakness in internal control, which contributed to  our adverse opinion on internal control. We performed sufficient audit  procedures to provide the disclaimer of opinion in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted government auditing standards.

The goal of GFRS is to be able to directly link information from  federal agencies\u2019 audited financial statements to amounts reported in the  consolidated financial statements and resolve many of the weaknesses we  previously identified in the process for preparing the consolidated financial  statements, a goal we strongly support. For both the fiscal year 2005 and  2004 reporting processes, GFRS was able to capture agency financial  information submitted to Treasury, but GFRS is still under development  and not at the stage that it could be used to fully compile the consolidated  financial statements from the information captured.", "As we have reported in the past, Treasury\u2019s process for compiling the CFS  does not yet fully ensure that financial information from federal agencies\u2019  audited financial statements and other financial data directly link to  amounts reported in the CFS. In our fiscal year 2005 audit report, we noted  that Treasury made progress in demonstrating amounts in the Balance  Sheet and the Statement of Net Cost were consistent with federal agencies\u2019  audited financial statements prior to eliminating intragovernmental activity  and balances. However, about 25 percent of the significant federal  agencies\u2019 auditors reported internal control weaknesses related to the  processes the agencies perform to provide financial statement information  to Treasury for preparing the consolidated financial statements.", "In our prior report, we recommended that as Treasury continues to design  and further implement its new process for compiling the CFS, the Secretary  of the Treasury should direct the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, in coordination  with the Controller of OMB, to modify Treasury\u2019s closing package to   (1) require federal agencies to directly link their audited financial  statement notes to the CFS notes and (2) provide the necessary  information to demonstrate that all of the five principal consolidated  financial statements are consistent with the underlying information in  federal agencies\u2019 audited financial statements and other financial data.", "Progress was made during fiscal year 2005. Treasury has been continuing to  design and further implement its new process for compiling the CFS with  the development of GFRS. We continue, though, to be concerned that the  disciplined processes necessary to reduce risks to acceptable levels have  not yet been effectively implemented. For example, Treasury moved  forward with the project before ensuring that certain key elements, such as  a concept of operations, were developed or even defining and documenting  the financial reporting weaknesses that were expected to be addressed by  the system. Not effectively implementing such disciplined processes  creates an unnecessary risk that the system will cost more and take longer  than expected to deploy, while not providing all of the intended system  functionality. The implementation of any major system, such as GFRS, is  not without risk; however, organizations that follow and effectively  implement accepted best practices in systems development and  implementation have been shown to reduce these risks to acceptable  levels.

Because comparative  financial statements are intended to furnish useful data about the  differences in activity and balances between the 2 years shown,  consistency in how amounts are reported for the 2 years is a major factor in  creating comparability. We found that Treasury lacked a process to ensure  that consolidated financial statements and notes for fiscal years 2005 and  2004 were consistently reported and therefore comparable. During fiscal  year 2005, Treasury requested that agencies resubmit fiscal year 2004  financial information along with their fiscal year 2005 financial  information. Some agencies resubmitted fiscal year 2004 amounts in fiscal  year 2005 that differed from what Treasury published in fiscal year 2004.  Also, certain information reported for fiscal 2004 may have required  reclassification to be comparable to the fiscal year 2005 amounts. Treasury  did not analyze the fiscal year 2004 information submitted in fiscal year  2005 or reclassify amounts within various financial statement line items  and notes to achieve comparability and chose to continue to report what  was published for fiscal year 2004. For example, the Reconciliations of Net  Operating Cost and Unified Budget Deficit showed $47.8 billion and $.2  billion for property, plant, and equipment disposals and revaluations for  fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. However, based on the audited  financial information provided by agencies to Treasury in GFRS in fiscal  year 2005, the fiscal year 2004 amount should be $25.4 billion, rather than  $.2 billion.

In addition, for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, OMB  waived the closing package audit requirement for the Tennessee Valley  Authority (TVA), which does have a September 30 fiscal year end. In these  four cases, Treasury and OMB did not develop any alternative solutions  that include the requirement for adequate audit procedures to be  performed over significant information included in the CFS. As a result,  unaudited September 30 information was included in the CFS for 4  agencies that Treasury and OMB consider to be significant.

While our planned  audit procedures were not to review the entire TFM to determine if its  guidance to agencies was clear, we found several areas where the TFM did  not give clear guidance to federal agencies about the information that they  were required to provide to Treasury, GAO, and OMB. Specifically, we  found that the TFM did not give clear guidance for (1) reporting note  disclosures for restricted cash, (2) reporting note disclosures for accounts  payable, (3) preparing summaries of unadjusted misstatements to be  included with federal agencies\u2019 closing package management  representation letters, and (4) certain information to be reported by OPM  to Treasury that is used to allocate costs on the Statement of Net Cost. For  example, the TFM defines restricted cash as \u201camounts of cash that an  entity holds and does not have authority to spend\u201d and cash that is not  restricted as \u201camounts of cash that an entity holds for which it has the  authority to spend.\u201d Although these definitions are accurate at the agency  level, these definitions are not accurate at the CFS level. For example, an  agency may hold cash that it does not have the authority to spend because  of a certain law or regulation, but when this cash is consolidated at the  governmentwide level, the federal government as a whole may have the  authority to spend the cash. Therefore, this cash would appropriately be  restricted at the agency level, but not at the governmentwide level.

According to Treasury,  confirmed reporting, the first category listed above, is intended to indicate  that the agency has verified that the amount it has reported is accurate. The  TFM requires a federal agency that selects the category \u201cconfirmed  reporting\u201d to provide a detailed explanation to support its response.", "However, we found that in many cases where a federal agency selected the  \u201cconfirmed reporting\u201d category, the agency did not provide detailed  explanations. We also found cases where both trading partners selected  \u201cconfirmed reporting\u201d for the same material difference and the agencies did  not provide detailed explanations for how both trading partners\u2019 amounts  could be accurate when the material difference remained. When this  situation occurs, we found that Treasury and OMB do not have an effective  process to obtain clarification for inconsistent explanations provided and  that agencies may be unclear as to when to select this category.
