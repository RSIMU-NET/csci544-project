General aviation covers all civil aircraft not flown by commercial airlines or the military. In 1994, concerned that general aviation was in decline, Congress passed the General Aviation Revitalization Act (GARA), which sought to boost the industry by placing limitations on product liability lawsuits against aircraft manufacturers. Trends show that there was a decline in most general aviation indicators prior to the 1994 enactment of GARA and that this decline reversed in the years after GARA--sharply in manufacturing indicators and to a lesser extent in flying activity indicators. Trends in general aviation since GARA was enacted suggest that the law has reduced manufacturers' liability concerns, leading to a rebound in the manufacturing industry. The amount of federal funding available for capital development at general aviation airports has consistently been below what has been requested by the airport officials to fund their airports' planned projects. In 2000, for example, the amount of federal funding available was almost $900 million short of what was requested to fund airports' eligible planned projects. The safety of general aviation has been improving. The total number of accidents declined from 3,233 in 1982 to 1,989 in 1998--a decrease of 41 percent--while the accident rate fell from about 10 to about 7 accidents for every 100,000 flight hours. More than two-thirds of general aviation's accidents, both fatal and nonfatal, are caused by pilot error, including mistakes related to procedure, skill, and judgment. Besides determining the requirements for pilot certification, the Federal Aviation Administration oversees the safety of general aviation by working with federal agencies and industry groups to identify safety improvements. Most initiatives seek to enhance safety in one of three areas: training, technology, and the procedures that are designed to govern such operations as takeoffs, landings, and flight patterns."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request to conduct a comprehensive overview of the  status of general aviation, especially since the passage the General Aviation  Revitalization Act (GARA), we addressed three research questions.", "What did key indicators in general aviation activity show in the years  leading up to GARA and what have they shown since then?", "What funding is available for general aviation airports and is it sufficient  to accommodate planned development?", "What are the trends in general aviation accident rates and the causes of  accidents, and how have the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) and  the industry attempted to improve safety?", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees and to the Secretary of Transportation; the Administrator of  FAA;  and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.

Kennedy, Jr.\u2019s, airplane.", "In fact, general aviation is an important component of the nation\u2019s air  transportation system and economy, accounting for 96 percent of all  civilian aircraft and three out of every four takeoffs and landings.  General  aviation airports provide a vast network of landing areas across the  country.  And while most general aviation pilots fly only for personal use,  others use their general aviation training as a base for moving into other  parts of civilian aviation such as piloting for commercial passenger and  cargo airlines."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Aviation Activities Are Diverse and Provide Important Benefits", "paragraphs": ["General aviation encompasses a wide variety of operations, including the  training of new pilots, crop dusting, and providing air tours for sightseers  and transportation for business executives.  In addition, general aviation  provides rapid transportation for medical and other civil emergencies.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) divides general aviation  activities into use categories.  About 85 percent of general aviation flying  falls into one of five categories, as described in table 1.  The largest of these  categories is personal flying, which is defined as flying for pleasure or  personal transportation and not for business purposes.  In 1999, personal  flying accounted for 36 percent of all general aviation hours flown, nearly  twice as much as the next largest segment\u2014instructional flying.  The  remaining categories include many diverse activities, such as medical  services, aerial advertising, aerial mapping and photography, and aerial  application of seeds or chemicals.", "General aviation benefits both the users of transportation services and the  economy at large.  For example, it increases the efficiency and productivity  of businesses by reducing the travel time that would be required to drive or  use more congested commercial airports; provides public health services,  such as transporting patients and medical equipment; provides public  safety services, such as monitoring floods or fires; alleviates congestion at  commercial airports and provides an important transportation link to small  communities not served by commercial air carriers; and provides training  for new pilots.", "General aviation\u2019s economic benefits are difficult to measure quantitatively,  and studies on this topic have had limitations that have reduced the  certainty of the studies\u2019 findings.  Nevertheless, according to a series of  nationwide studies done for FAA on the effects of general aviation on  economic activity, jobs, and earnings, general aviation\u2019s contribution to the  national economy has grown in the past decade.  A report issued for FAA in  2000 estimated that in 1998, general aviation generated about $64.5 billion  in total economic activity at the national level, an increase of $26.5 billion  from the 1988 level of $38 billion.  In 1998, general aviation accounted for  about 0.7 percent of the gross domestic product and 7 percent of the total  contribution of civil aviation.  State studies show that general aviation\u2019s  economic impact on the states\u2019 economies is generally less than 1 percent.   However, according to these estimates, general aviation makes important  contributions to the states in terms of economic output, jobs, and earnings  that are generated.

The general aviation fleet consists of  about 219,000 active aircraft.  While this fleet of general aviation aircraft is  diverse, certain activities are generally associated with certain types of  aircraft.  For example, corporate flying generally involves the use of  turboprop and turbojet aircraft; personal and instructional flying generally  involve the use of small propeller aircraft.  The largest category of aircraft  is single-engine propeller, which in 1999 made up 69 percent of the general  aviation fleet.  Additional types of general aviation aircraft and their uses  are described in figure 1.", "Although general aviation aircraft can take off and land at almost any  airport, including most of the nation\u2019s 538 commercial service airports,  there is an extensive system of general aviation airports.  Figure 2  illustrates the categories of airports in the United States.  There are  approximately 13,000 private-use general aviation airports and 4,800 public- use general aviation airports in the United States.  About 2,500 general  aviation airports are included in FAA\u2019s National Plan of Integrated Airport  Systems (NPIAS), which identifies airports that are significant to national  air transportation and to which FAA allocates funding for capital  development.  Reliever airports are a special category of general aviation  airports in the NPIAS.  Usually located near commercial airports, reliever  airports are intended to help relieve congestion at commercial airports by  diverting general aviation traffic away from commercial airports.  FAA has  designated 334 general aviation airports as reliever airports.", "The safety record of general aviation is sometimes brought to light when  high-profile accidents occur.  General aviation accidents, like commercial  aviation accidents, can result from pilot error, mechanical failure, or other  causes.  Although the number of accidents in general aviation has  decreased markedly during the past few years, its accident rate remains  much higher than that of commercial aviation.  Commercial aviation,  because it involves the flying public, is subject to greater oversight and  regulation than general aviation.  While FAA\u2019s primary effort to reduce  general aviation accidents is to ensure that all regulations and requirements  are met, FAA has also emphasized voluntary training and technology to  reduce the accident rate of general aviation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Aviation Manufacturing, Burdened by Liability Costs, Declined in the 1980s", "paragraphs": ["In the late 1960s and early 1970s, aviation manufacturers became more  frequent targets of product liability lawsuits that were brought by survivors  of airplane crashes or families of victims of airplane crashes.  This surge in  the number of lawsuits came on the tail of a 1963 California Supreme Court  ruling that adopted a rule of \u201cstrict liability,\u201d which maintained that  companies may be held liable for a product found to be defective or  dangerous without proof of negligence.  Other courts across the nation  soon followed suit, shifting a greater liability burden toward  manufacturers.", "As a result of the large number of lawsuits brought against aviation  manufacturers, insurers increased the premiums they charged for product  liability insurance.  Manufacturers, some of whom were self-insured, also  incurred costs from defending an increasing number of lawsuits.  The  escalating costs associated with product liability were reflected in rising  aircraft prices, and by the 1980s, new aircraft sales plummeted as more and  more prospective buyers chose to purchase used airplanes or to build their  own airplanes from kits.  The manufacturing industry began to suffer;  between 1978 and 1988, production fell 94 percent, and the number of  employees working in the industry fell 65 percent.  By the end of 1986, two  manufacturers, Beech and Cessna, had shut down most of their production  lines for single-engine piston aircraft; and Piper, another manufacturer, had  sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Plays a Role in Funding and Overseeing General Aviation", "paragraphs": ["The federal government manages the national airspace system, including  general aviation, with the goal of ensuring the adequate and safe operation  of the system.  The federal role includes allocating funds for airport  improvements, controlling air traffic, issuing training rules for aviation  personnel, and certifying the airworthiness of aircraft and other aviation  equipment.  A number of offices are responsible for related areas of the  industry.  These include the Office of Airport Planning and Programming,  which provides funding for airport construction and improvements; the  Aircraft Certification Service, which ensures that the types of aircraft in  use are safe and airworthy; and the General Aviation and Commercial  Division of the Flight Standards Service, which develops policies for the  certification of pilots and instructors.", "FAA supports the nation\u2019s airport infrastructure by providing funds for  airport development and maintenance through the Airport Improvement  Program (AIP).  Funds for this program, some of which are collected from  taxes on airport users, are authorized and appropriated by the Congress  and distributed among qualifying airports by FAA.  The federal government  provides more funding to general aviation airports than any other single  source.", "FAA is responsible for overseeing the safety of general aviation.  To do this,  FAA determines the requirements for pilot certification and develops  regulations and recommendations for pilot activities and training as well as  for the use of technologies and the procedures that govern the use of  airspace and airports.  FAA\u2019s pilot certification process establishes  increasingly stringent piloting and medical requirements for certificates  allowing pilots to fly in more advanced circumstances.  In addition to  certifications, pilots may also receive ratings, which allow them to perform  additional activities or to fly certain types of aircraft.  For example, pilots  may receive ratings for activities such as instrument flying or for flying  particular types of aircraft such as seaplanes or multiengine planes.  To  help ensure pilot proficiency, FAA also has requirements for recent flight  experience, including requiring pilots to perform three takeoffs and  landings within a 90-day period if they intend to carry passengers (or three  night-time takeoffs and landings if they intend to carry passengers at night),  requiring a flight review every 2 years, and requiring instrument-rated pilots  to fly in instrument conditions for 6 hours within every 6-month period in  order to maintain their instrument rating.", "Table 2 summarizes FAA\u2019s requirements for the different certificates, along  with the activities each certificate permits a pilot to perform.", "In addition to establishing certification requirements, FAA also oversees  flight schools that operate under Part 141 of the Federal Aviation  Regulations.  These schools are certified and monitored by FAA:  Students  are tested on a periodic basis and taught a curriculum that is approved by  FAA.  Other flight schools operate under Part 61 and do not have as high a  degree of FAA oversight.  Students at Part 61 schools are not required to be  tested periodically throughout their training and may receive all of their  training from one instructor rather than from multiple instructors.  At Part  61 schools, students are not required to be taught according to an FAA- approved curriculum unless they are using a Personal Computer-based  Aviation Training Device (PCATD).  However, many large Part 61 schools  use a  commercially developed curriculum that is based on FAA-approved  curricula. Part 141 students may be examined for their pilot\u2019s certificate  after 35 hours of flight time, and Part 61 students may be examined after 40  hours of flight time.  Finally, FAA requires all general aviation pilots to  undergo a biennial flight review, in which the pilot\u2019s skills are assessed.", "In 1994, the federal government became involved in two projects aimed at  revitalizing the industry.  First, the Congress enacted the General Aviation  Revitalization Act (GARA), which established an 18-year statute of repose  for lawsuits against manufacturers of general aviation aircraft, parts, and  components.  Under this provision, no civil actions can be brought against  a manufacturer for damages for death or injury arising out of an accident  more than 18 years after the aircraft, part, or component is delivered to a  purchaser.  Second, FAA and the National Aeronautical and Space  Administration (NASA), which plays a role in developing technology  related to general aviation, joined in the Advanced General Aviation  Transport Experiments (AGATE) initiative.  AGATE, a consortium of  industry, higher education, and government entities, was developed in  response to the fact that new aircraft being manufactured were not taking  full advantage of the most advanced technologies available.  AGATE was  intended to help revitalize the general aviation industry by advancing the  use of new technology in aircraft and developing new training methods for  pilots.", "Recently, NASA initiated the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS)  Program, a 5-year, $69 million program scheduled to run from fiscal year  2001 through fiscal year 2005.  SATS is designed to demonstrate the  viability of new technologies for enabling small aircraft to affordably  reduce many of the expected problems in the nation\u2019s transportation  system, such as increasing congestion on highways and at the major  airports serving commercial passenger airlines.  For example, SATS  envisions the development and use of easy-to-operate all-weather aircraft  that can fly into the more than 5,000 existing public use general aviation  airports with  minor modification to airports\u2019 landing and navigational  facilities.  NASA officials claim that a successful SATS program will be able  to double the number of communities with air transportation, alleviate the  gap between transportation demand and supply, and create new economic  growth for communities throughout the nation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on  Aviation, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, asked us  to provide a comprehensive overview of general aviation, especially since  the passage of GARA.

To respond to the  first question, we reviewed FAA\u2019s forecasts of the general aviation industry  through 2007; analyzed data from the industry and FAA on trends in general  aviation aircraft manufacturing, the supply of pilots, and the hours flown  from 1979 through 1999; and interviewed FAA and industry officials about  expected developments in the industry.  In addition, we sought the opinions  of six aviation experts: two from academia who had written extensively on  general aviation issues as identified through a computerized bibliographic  search of relevant publications; three industry association officials from  the Aircraft Pilots and Owners Association (AOPA), the General Aviation  and Manufacturers Association (GAMA), and the National Association of  State Aviation Officials (NASAO); and an FAA official.

A study commissioned by the General Aviation Manufacturers  Association (GAMA) in 1986 found that paid claims and out-of-pocket  defense expenses for the entire U.S. general aviation industry grew from  $24 million a year in 1976 to $210 million a year in 1986.  In 1987, the three  major U.S. manufacturers of single-engine piston aircraft, Beech, Cessna,  and Piper, said that their annual costs for product liability ranged from  $70,000 to $100,000 for each aircraft built.  The escalating costs associated  with product liability were reflected in rising aircraft prices.  Our experts  rated the price of purchasing a new aircraft as the factor having the  greatest impact on the decline of general aviation.  The average price of a  new, single-engine piston aircraft, which is a type of aircraft commonly  used for personal flying, rose from just over $25,000 in 1975 to nearly  $112,000 in 1990, an increase of over 105 percent in constant 1990 dollars.  The increasing cost of operating an aircraft\u2014including higher fuel prices  and maintenance expenses\u2014also served as a deterrent to some would-be  pilots, according to our panel.", "Despite the increase in the price of new aircraft, the manufacturers did not  offer important advances in safety features or technology, according to  aviation experts.  Moreover, there was a large supply of less-expensive used  aircraft as a result of the thousands of single-engine piston aircraft that had  been shipped each year during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Considering that  the useful life of these aircraft can be upwards of 30 years, consumers had  little incentive to buy new ones.  Amateur-built, or \u201ckit,\u201d airplanes were  another option for consumers not in a position to spend $100,000 or more  on a newly manufactured unit.  From 1989 to 1992, kit airplanes accounted  for more new single-engine aircraft registrations than aircraft built by the  traditional manufacturing sector.", "The experts that we consulted, as well as FAA and other general aviation  experts, also noted that the health of the industry has traditionally been  linked to the economy and that economic downturns played a role in the  pre-GARA slump in general aviation manufacturing and activity indicators.   Although the economy generally grew during the 1980s and early 1990s,  there was a deep recession from 1981 through 1982, and there were two  briefer recessions in 1980 and late 1990 through early 1991.  Industry  experts also said that other economic factors contributed to the decline in  general aviation sales.  For example, the investment tax credit, which had  made aircraft ownership more affordable for businesses, was repealed.", "Finally, our experts noted that changes in lifestyle seem to have  discouraged interest in general aviation flying.  These experts state that  many personal or recreational flyers had stopped flying out of concern that  they had not flown sufficient hours to maintain their flying skills. Our  experts also said that consumers who might have been candidates for  general aviation activities have increasingly turned to other recreational  pursuits, such as boating, skiing, or driving sports cars, which have the  advantage of considerably lower licensing and training requirements and  can have lower operating costs.

Shipments of new aircraft also increased, more than  tripling between 1994 and 2000, from 928 to 2,816.  The change was  especially marked in piston aircraft, which increased nearly fourfold during  that time period.  (See fig. 4 for information on the number of piston and  turbine aircraft shipped.) Much of this dramatic rise in piston aircraft  shipments was due to the reentry of Cessna into the single-engine piston  market, as well as the stepping-up of production by other manufacturers,  such as Beech, that had drastically reduced their production during the  height of their product liability problems.  Cessna alone has shipped 3,000  units since it reopened its single-engine piston production lines in 1996.", "Additionally, GAMA also reports that since the 1994 enactment of GARA,  manufacturers have increased their investment in research and  development by more than 150 percent and new companies have entered  the market.  However, the average price of new single-engine piston  aircraft\u2014the largest segment of the new fixed-wing aircraft market\u2014has  continued to increase, even when the price is adjusted for inflation.   Representatives of the general aviation manufacturing industry said that  manufacturers are producing more high-end, technologically advanced  aircraft than before GARA was enacted, which accounts, at least in part, for  the increased average price.

The agency established an advisory  rulemaking committee consisting of representatives of aircraft  manufacturers, fractional owners and managers, and trade associations,  among others.  The committee reviewed current Federal Aviation  Regulations regarding fractional ownership activity and developed a draft  proposal that would require fractional ownership aircraft to operate under  a new subpart of Part 91.  This subpart would hold fractional ownership  operators to higher standards of safety and accountability.

FAA data show general aviation pilots  flying for personal or recreational purposes, on the other hand, average  only 30 hours of flight time per year and are subject to few recurrent  training requirements.  In addition to differences in pilots\u2019 skills,  differences in aircraft, according to one expert, affect accident rates.  The  aircraft flown by commercial and corporate pilots generally have more  cockpit resources to compensate for events that may threaten safety.   According to experts, most flying in commercial aviation and the corporate  segment of general aviation involves cruising at high altitudes, a phase of  flight during which few accidents occur.  Some general aviation flying may  be inherently riskier than other general aviation flying; agricultural  spraying, for example, involves flying low to the ground and maneuvering  at slow speeds, actions that have been shown to be involved in a high  proportion of accidents.  Overall, FAA subjects scheduled commercial  aviation to more oversight and regulation than general aviation because of  its need to ensure the safety of consumers who cannot ensure their own  safety.

Training pilots to react to emergency  situations in simulators is the training approach used by the commercial  airlines.  Moreover, there is some evidence that the use of PCATDs can  decrease the time needed to acquire particular skills.  As we reported, as a  result of these studies, FAA approved the limited use of PCATD for private  license certification.", "In March 2000, the Weather Joint Safety Implementation Team of Safer  Skies released implementation plans for reducing weather-related  accidents in general aviation through changes in the training curriculum for  both initial and ongoing training.

The curriculum changes are based on scenario training  and assessment that will test not only how much a pilot knows about  current weather products but also how well the pilot applies that  knowledge.  A similar Safer Skies training effort will target accidents  caused by controlled flight into terrain, which occurs when a pilot flies an  airworthy aircraft into terrain or another obstacle without being aware of  the impending collision.  Table 4 shows key recommendations that have  recently been developed by groups working on improving safety through  improving training procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA and Others Also Seek to Improve Safety Through Researching and Developing Technology", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, NASA created through the Advanced General Aviation Transport  Experiment (AGATE), a consortium of industry, higher education, and  government entities, including FAA, to develop advanced technologies for  general aviation.  Some of AGATE\u2019s efforts have focused on increasing both  the accessibility and development of technological innovations that can  counter causes of accident and increase safety.  For example, advanced  cockpit displays permit pilots to visually fly predetermined courses without  depending on instruments to maintain direction and orientation.  Similarly,  graphical displays allow pilots to determine the location and severity of  weather hazards and make easily accessible the information needed to  control the aircraft.  These innovations should help pilots avoid several  types of accidents, including controlled flight into terrain and accidents  that are weather-related and/or involve loss of control of the aircraft.", "This initiative also works to develop equipment that will lower the risk of  injury or death in the event of an accident.  Some manufacturers have  already begun using these advanced technologies in their aircraft.  The  Cirrus S-20 aircraft, for example, has an attached parachute that can be  deployed to enhance passenger survivability in the event of a stall and  equipment malfunction.", "Safer Skies has also developed recommendations geared toward improving  safety through changes in the development and use of technology.  These  recommendations include promoting the development and use of a low- cost terrain clearance and/or look-ahead device; developing new mountain  and low-altitude airspace communications, navigation, and surveillance  (CNS) infrastructure; adapting global positioning satellites for general  aviation navigation; and removing regulatory impediments, such as  certification processes for new equipment, that slow the integration of new  technologies into aircraft.", "While technological advances have the potential to dramatically reduce  some types of accidents, there is often a significant lag time between the  research phase and the time when technological advances reduce the  overall accident rate.  First, the technology must be developed.  Then, after  the technology is available for use in aircraft, the current fleet of aviation  aircraft must be retrofitted with the technology.   Without regulations  requiring that aircraft be retrofitted, the cost of retrofitting equipment in  the current fleet or replacing older aircraft may also delay the deployment  of these new technologies.  Additionally, once new technology is widely  available, pilots will require additional training in its use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Efforts Also Seek to Improve Safety Through Procedural Measures", "paragraphs": ["Finally, Safer Skies also developed recommendations to enhance the safety  of general aviation through improvements in procedures governing flight  patterns, including landings and takeoffs.  These recommendations include  standardizing and expanding the use of markings for towers and wires;  using high-visibility paint and other visibility-enhancing features on  obstructions; providing better information to pilots on the location and  severity of weather hazard areas; and developing new procedures for  airspace communications, navigation, and surveillance."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
