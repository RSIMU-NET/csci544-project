The Department of Defense (DOD) established a requirement for the services to identify and track personnel with SFA-related training, education, and experience. Although the Army is able to identify and track soldiers with certain SFA-related training and education, it does not have a mechanism to identify and track SFA-related experience. Moreover, the Army has not developed a plan with goals and milestones on how it will capture this information. As a result, it is unclear how long it will take the Army to implement DOD's requirement and be able to readily identify the right personnel to serve in the SFA mission.

However, opinions differ regarding the effect the guidance has had on the manner in which individuals with SFA-related training, education, and experience are considered during the promotion process. Some officials said that serving in an SFA role could potentially negatively affect career progression. Others noted that the promotion process considers the entirety of an individual's career and not just the time spent as an SFA advisor. However, because the Army and Marine Corps do not yet have comprehensive information on SFA advisors, officials are unable to determine whether promotion rates differ for people who served on SFA advisor teams versus those who did not. Such differences could be a potential indicator that servicemembers with SFA-related experience were negatively affected during the promotion process.", "According to Army officials, the Army has taken a number of actions to ensure that units are prepared to perform their core mission when part of the unit is deployed in support of SFA activities. Officials stated that some actions taken to manage units that remain at the home station, also known as the rear detachment, when part of the unit deploys include consolidating units so that they can conduct training, ensuring the right personnel are left behind to lead the rear detachment, developing training plans for what the rear detachment would train to, and reporting on the availability of all personnel and equipment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Army develop and implement a plan, with goals and milestones, for how it will develop the means for systematically identifying and tracking personnel with SFA-related experience.

Advising is a primary type of SFA. Over the course of the military  conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as other locations, the Army and  Marine Corps have used company- and field-grade officers and senior  enlisted personnel to form advisor teams to support SFA missions  focused on advising and assisting partner-nation military forces.  Currently, to meet the requirements for SFA missions in Afghanistan, the  Army deploys SFA brigades, which include advisor teams that are  primarily created using personnel from the SFA brigade. The Marine  Corps creates advisor teams using nondeployed personnel from across  the Marine Expeditionary Forces who then deploy as formed teams.", "We have issued several reports about DOD\u2019s implementation of SFA. In  2013, we reported that the Army and Marine Corps have been able to fill  requests for SFA advisor teams using various approaches, such as  tasking nondeployed brigades to form advisor teams or creating teams  using personnel already deployed in Afghanistan. We also reported that  the Army\u2019s reliance on brigades to provide a portion of their personnel to  form advisor teams has enabled them to meet requirements but has  resulted in leaving large numbers of personnel at the brigades\u2019 home  stations, known as rear detachments. To manage these large rear  detachments, brigades have undertaken significant planning to ensure  that enough stay-behind leadership existed to maintain a sufficient  command structure and provide certain training. In 2012, we reported on  the actions needed to guide geographic combatant commands and  service efforts in regard to SFA. Specifically, we reported that DOD had  taken steps to establish its concept for conducting SFA, including broadly  defining the term and identifying actions needed to plan for and prepare  forces to execute it. We further reported that geographic combatant  commands face challenges that limit their ability to plan for and track SFA  as a distinct activity. In the 2012 report, we recommended that DOD  develop or modify existing guidance that further defines the department\u2019s  intent for SFA and what additional actions are required by the geographic  combatant commands to plan for and conduct SFA beyond their existing  security cooperation efforts. We also recommended that DOD take  actions to ensure that updates to the Global Theater Security Cooperation  Management Information System and the business rules being developed  provide a mechanism and guidance to stakeholders to specifically identify  and track SFA activities. DOD partially concurred with our  recommendations, noting that it believed that the department had taken  some steps to address some of the issues identified in our report.

Officials told us that since 2008,  they have been identifying and tracking soldiers who attend certain SFA  training with a Personnel Development Skill Identifier code. The Army  uses Personnel Development Skill Identifier codes in combination with an  area of concentration or MOS to identify unique skills, training, and  experience personnel may obtain during their careers. Normally, the  principal organizations or agency may request establishment of a  Personnel Development Skill Identifier code for tracking unique skills,  training, or experience where identification of qualified personnel would  be beneficial to the Army. Personnel Development Skill Identifier codes  identify skills, training, and experience that do not meet the minimum  standards for establishment of an additional skill identifier or have too few  individuals meeting the qualifications to warrant the creation of an  additional skill identifier. For example, the Army has created Personnel  Development Skill Identifier codes to identify and track soldiers who have  completed congressional fellowship training, completed training and 6- month deployment in support of United Nations peacekeeping operations,  and completed training for the maintenance of various weapons systems.  With regard to certain SFA-related training and education, the Army has  established Personnel Development Skill Identifier codes for the following  training activities:  successfully completing a resident advisor training course at Fort  Riley and Fort Polk; successfully completing an advisor training course at the Phoenix  Academy in Iraq; and successfully completing advisor training offered by the mobile  training team from Fort Polk.", "Army officials acknowledged that while these Personnel Development  Skill Identifier codes can be used to identify and track soldiers who attend  these SFA-related training courses, the codes do not identify and track  the actual experience that a soldier obtains from serving in an SFA- related role or any other SFA-related training and education that soldiers  might receive. For example, according to an Army official, one brigade  that is regionally aligned to Africa receives SFA-related training through a  course called Dagger University at Fort Riley that is not captured by any  of the existing Personnel Development Skill Identifier codes. Further,  Army officials noted that some personnel trained in these activities might  not have actually served in these roles.", "Army officials stated that the Army has been considering steps to take  toward identifying and tracking personnel with SFA experience, but has  not yet developed a mechanism with which to do so. Officials from  Department of the Army Headquarters Operations and Plans office stated  that they have ongoing efforts to identify the best approach, which may  include developing or expanding on existing Personnel Development Skill  Identifier codes, or creating an additional skill identifier or MOS to meet  the requirement in DODI 5000.68 to identify and track personnel with  SFA-related experience. Army officials told us that they could create new  SFA-related Personnel Development Skill Identifier codes or expand  existing ones to identify and track personnel with SFA-related experience.  The officials stated that they use a similar process to capture not only the  education and training, but also the experience of individuals who have  served in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands Program. For example,  Personnel Development Skill Identifier code T2A identifies soldiers who  completed language, counterinsurgency, and culture training as part of  that program. Personnel Development Skill Identifier code T2B identifies  the soldiers who successfully completed a 1-year deployment to  Afghanistan or Pakistan and utilized skills and training from the  Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands Program.

More specifically, for example, one  of the Army\u2019s Memoranda of Instruction that we reviewed states that it is  important that officers selected by board members for promotion possess  the right mix of field and headquarters experience, as well as the training  and education to meet current and future leadership requirements.", "Further, it states that all assignments are important to sustain a trained  and ready Army."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army and Marine Corps Have Taken a Number of Actions to Give Consideration to Those Serving in SFA-Related Positions during the Promotion Process", "paragraphs": ["The Army and the Marine Corps have taken a number of steps to ensure  that servicemembers with SFA-related experience receive consideration  for serving in these positions during the promotion process. Both services  have incorporated language into the guidance given to each promotion  board member every time a promotion board is held to ensure that  appropriate consideration is given to individuals who have served on  advisor teams. For example, both the Army\u2019s Memoranda of Instruction  and the Marine Corps\u2019 precepts for promotion boards state that, given the  current operational environment, promotion board members should pay  particular attention to servicemembers with unique key and  developmental positions, to include serving on an advisor team.", "Specifically, as it relates to SFA, one of the Army\u2019s Memoranda of  Instruction states that the absence of command, combat experience, or  support of deployed forces should not be a basis for nonselection for  promotion. With regard to service as an advisor, the memorandum cites  the important role that advisor teams play in enabling the United States to  hand over security responsibilities to host-nation security forces and  notes that advisor teams operate under very austere conditions and  coach, teach, and mentor host-nation security forces while simultaneously  conducting combat operations as they are embedded with host-nation  security forces. The memorandum instructs the promotion board to  appreciate the challenging nature of demands of advisor team jobs and to  provide appropriate consideration in the overall evaluation of the record of  each officer and enlisted servicemember who has served on these teams.", "Similarly, the Marine Corps\u2019 precepts direct each promotion board to be  especially diligent in weighing the qualifications of officers and enlisted  personnel serving in advisor teams. They further state that, in board  deliberations, service in these critical positions should be weighted  equally with traditional Marine Corps officer and enlisted positions in the  operational forces supporting overseas contingency operations because  assignments are made in the best interest of the Marine Corps. To  emphasize the importance of giving proper consideration to  servicemembers who have served in SFA positions, according to a  Marine Corps official, the Marine Corps is planning to draft additional  language that will be briefed to members of each promotion board prior to  their ranking of servicemembers for promotion.", "In addition, according to an Army headquarters official, in an effort to  ensure that servicemembers who serve on advisor teams are given credit  for SFA-related experience, the Army made changes to its MOS  publications. In 2008, the Army Chief of Staff stated that soldiers who  served on advisor teams were developing the skills and experience that  are vital for the Army to accomplish tasks from direct combat to stability  operations, recognizing that these skills will be a major part of military  operations in the future. To ensure that majors serving on advisor teams  receive recognition and credit for their service, the Army Chief of Staff  directed the Army to designate service on an advisor team as a key  assignment for infantry majors in Department of the Army Pamphlet 600- 3. For majors, serving on a brigade or battalion advisor team is therefore  comparable to being assigned as, among other things, a battalion  executive officer or brigade operations officer. According to an Army  personnel official, the Army Chief of Staff\u2019s statement also served as a  driver for the Army not only to change Department of the Army Pamphlet  600-3, but also to change Department of the Army Pamphlet 600-25, as  well as the Memorandum of Instruction provided to promotion board  members. The pamphlets have been updated to indicate that service in  an advisor role is a key developmental opportunity. For example, the  MOS of Army infantry majors and lieutenant colonels now reflect that  service on advisor teams can be considered part of their key  developmental assignments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opinions Differ Regarding the Effect of Serving in an SFA-Related Position on Career Progression", "paragraphs": ["We found differing opinions regarding the effect that Army and Marine  Corps guidance have on the manner in which individuals with SFA-related  training, education, and experience are considered during the promotion  process. Several officials from the SFA brigades as well as officials at the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, Army and Marine Corps headquarters,  Human Resources Command, and Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated  that serving as an SFA advisor could negatively affect career progression.  Specifically, in 14 of the 24 interviews we conducted at these  organizations, officials stated that serving in an SFA-related role could  potentially negatively affect career progression, or that their own careers  had been negatively affected as a result of serving in an SFA-related role.  According to officials, serving in an SFA-related position could cause a  servicemember to miss or be delayed in completing a key developmental  step outlined in the MOS publication, which could negatively affect the  member\u2019s career progression. For example:", "One servicemember stated that he was taken out of company  command to serve on an advisor team. This cut his company  commander time down, which he believed made him less competitive  compared to other servicemembers in his year group who had  completed company command in accordance with the professional  development outlined for his MOS.", "One soldier said that he wanted to apply for an opportunity that would  allow him to transfer from a combat arms position into the Foreign  Area Officer branch. According to the soldier, the time spent serving  on an advisor team shortened the amount of time he could spend  completing key developmental steps that were a prerequisite for him  to transfer. The soldier stated that as a result of not completing the  key developmental steps in his MOS, he did not qualify to apply for  the transfer.", "Conversely, some servicemembers with whom we spoke stated that they  felt their careers had not been negatively affected. For example, one  servicemember told us that he served on an advisor team and is now a  colonel. He stated that serving in an SFA-related role is viewed in a  positive manner and that soldiers seek these positions. Similarly, officials  from the Army\u2019s Operations and Plans office stated that some soldiers\u2019  careers could potentially be enhanced as a result of serving in an SFA- related position.", "In addition, officials from Army Human Resources Command and Marine  Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs, as well as officials from the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness,  Department of the Army Headquarters, and the Marine Corps Security  Cooperation Group, stated that other factors likely play into decisions not  to promote an individual. They noted that the promotion process  considers the entirety of an individual\u2019s career and not just the time spent  as an advisor. According to the Army\u2019s MOS manual, success does not  depend on the number or type of positions held, but rather on the quality  of duty performance in every assignment. As a result, officials stated that  serving as an advisor was unlikely to be the sole explanation for a failure  to be promoted. According to officials, if a soldier performs well, that  soldier will be promoted regardless of the role he or she was assigned.", "According to DOD officials, it is difficult if not impossible to determine why  a servicemember did not get promoted, because the promotion boards do  not maintain a record of or discuss the reasons why a person did not get  promoted. Officials from the Army Human Resources Command and the  Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs Department informed us  that they monitor where servicemembers are in their career to try to  ensure that servicemembers are able to obtain a key developmental step  that may be missed. Although some servicemembers stated that their  careers could potentially be negatively affected as a result of serving in  an SFA-related role, the Army and Marine Corps are currently unable to  assess this potential negative effect or to take any needed corrective  actions. Specifically, information about who has SFA-related experience  is necessary in order to isolate this population from those who have not  served in an SFA-related role. As noted above, while the Army has  developed a Personnel Development Skill Identifier to identify and track  soldiers with SFA-related training and education, the Army has not  developed a mechanism with which to identify and track personnel with  SFA-related experience, and the Marine Corps\u2019 mechanism will not be  available until October 2014. As a result, officials are not able to conduct  an assessment of personnel to determine whether there are different  promotion rates for people who served on advisor teams versus those  who did not, which could be a potential indicator that servicemembers  with SFA-related experience were negatively affected during the  promotion process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Army Continues to Manage the Large Rear Detachments That Result from Deploying Personnel to Support SFA Missions", "paragraphs": ["We recently reported that the Army\u2019s use of SFA brigades to form advisor  teams has enabled it to meet requirements, but this practice results in  those brigades leaving behind large numbers of personnel at the  brigades\u2019 home stations. Officials from each of the four SFA brigades with  whom we met confirmed that this continues to be the case and said that  they left behind a large rear detachment when they deployed. For  example, according to officials from one of the brigades we visited, the  brigade deployed approximately 500 people to create advisor teams,  leaving approximately 3,000 personnel behind at their home station.  Officials from another brigade that deployed as an SFA brigade stated  that approximately 1,900 personnel were deployed, leaving behind about  the same number in the rear detachment. In 2013, we reported that  because the advisor team requirement calls for high numbers of  company- and field-grade officers and senior noncommissioned officers,  staffing the teams requires the brigades to deploy a significant portion of  their leadership and expertise, including the brigade commanders and  many battalion, company, and platoon commanders, for the advisor  mission. Army Forces Command officials confirmed that this continues  to be the Army\u2019s process and that as a result, in providing these senior  servicemembers to the advisor teams, the brigades are forced to rely on  more junior officers and enlisted personnel at their home stations to  manage the rear detachment. For example, according to SFA brigade  officials we interviewed, in some cases they relied on captains, who  would typically be responsible for leading a company, to serve as rear- detachment battalion commanders.", "The rear-detachment commanders and other SFA brigade officials with  whom we spoke stated they faced numerous challenges with managing  personnel who were left at home stations. Officials from two of the SFA  brigades we spoke with stated that their biggest challenge stemmed from  effectively managing medical, legal, and other administrative issues while  concurrently maintaining readiness and responding to installation tasks.  These officials also stated that another challenge they faced was  ensuring that equipment was accounted for properly.", "During this review, officials from the SFA brigades we met with stated that  the brigades\u2019 predeployment planning efforts ensured that the brigades  left behind sufficient leadership to manage the rear detachments and  develop training plans to maintain readiness. A number of other actions  were also taken to maintain readiness that included the following:", "Consolidating Units: According to officials from two of the brigades we  spoke with, to ensure that leadership is available to conduct training,  some brigades consolidated units. For example, one rear-detachment  battalion commander told us that his battalion teamed up with another  battalion to ensure they could conduct training to maintain their  readiness.", "Leaving Key Leadership Personnel: Officials told us that leaving the  right personnel behind to manage the rear detachment is just as  important as deploying the right personnel. Officials from the four SFA  brigades we met with stated that brigade leadership had to undertake  significant planning to ensure that the right leadership remained at the  home station. One SFA brigade official with whom we spoke said that  rear-detachment leadership candidates were interviewed prior to  being assigned as rear-detachment commanders to ensure that they  had the personal and professional attributes needed to effectively  manage the rear detachment. Officials from two of the SFA brigades  we met with stated that the right leadership was needed to manage  the training, legal, medical, and other administrative issues of the  soldiers who remained at the home station.", "Conducting Training and Maintaining Readiness: Army Forces  Command issued guidance for the training and employment of rear  detachments during advisor team deployments, including missions the  force may be assigned to, training expectations, and equipment  maintenance responsibilities. According to Army Forces Command  officials, Army Forces Command allowed the brigade leadership to  determine the type and amount of training that could be conducted  based on the number of personnel remaining at the home station. For  example, officials from each of the four SFA brigades with whom we  met stated that they developed training plans for what the rear  detachment would train on while the rest of the brigade was deployed.", "Reporting Readiness: Prior to October 2013, brigades were required  to report only on the status of deployed forces and equipment. The  Department of the Army issued guidance in October 2013 to gain  better visibility over all available personnel and equipment. It required  units to report on personnel and equipment that were deployed and at  the rear detachment.

To ensure that the Army and Marine Corps have  the right people with the right skill sets to serve in an SFA mission, DOD  must be able to identify and track personnel with SFA-related training,  education, and experience. Without a systematic means to identify and  track personnel with SFA-related training, education, and experience, the  Army and Marine Corps (1) cannot monitor the career progression of  servicemembers with SFA-related experience; and (2) are limited in their  ability to evaluate the effectiveness of their guidance.
