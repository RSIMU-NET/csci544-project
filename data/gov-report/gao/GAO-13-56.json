Several of CAP's mission areas fit within the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) definition of homeland security, as found in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report (QHSR)--a strategic framework for homeland security. For example, CAP disaster assistance and air defense activities relate to the QHSR mission areas of ensuring resilience to disasters and preventing terrorism and enhancing security, respectively. CAP has performed some of these activities in support of DHS components, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Coast Guard, as well as state and local governments. For example, CAP has provided disaster imagery to FEMA, performed certain border reconnaissance for CBP, and assisted the Coast Guard in providing air support during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. CAP has also performed homeland security-related activities for other customers, such as the U.S. Air Force. For example, 9 of the 10 CAP wings GAO spoke with had participated in military readiness exercises where CAP aircraft provided mock targets for military interceptor aircraft or ground-based radar. CAP's participation in homeland security activities accounted for approximately 9 percent of its fiscal year 2011 flying hours, but the majority of its flying hours (approximately 63 percent) were devoted to training and flying orientation, with the remaining devoted to other activities such as counterdrug and maintenance.", "Several factors affect CAP's ability to support homeland security missions, and DHS and its components have not yet assessed how CAP could be used to perform certain homeland security missions. These factors--including legal parameters, mission funding, existing capabilities, and capacity--were issues cited by the DHS components and Air Force and CAP officials GAO contacted that could affect CAP's suitability for additional homeland security missions. For example, as an Air Force auxiliary, CAP is subject to laws and regulations governing the use of the military in support of law enforcement, which, among other things, allow CAP to conduct aerial surveillance in certain situations, but preclude its participation in the interdiction of vehicles, vessels, or aircraft. Similarly, while CAP's existing operational capabilities--aircraft and vehicles, personnel, and technology--position it well to support certain homeland security missions, they also limit its suitability for others. For example, FEMA officials cited the role of CAP imagery in providing useful situational awareness during the initial stages of some past natural disasters, while, in contrast, officials from CBP and the Coast Guard noted limitations such as inadequate imagery capabilities and insufficient detection technology. Although the components we contacted provided varying opinions regarding CAP's suitability for certain homeland security activities, DHS has not assessed CAP's capabilities and resources or determined the extent to which CAP could be used to support future homeland security activities. By assessing the ability of CAP to provide additional homeland security capabilities in a budget-constrained environment, DHS in coordination with the Air Force could position itself to better understand, and potentially utilize, another resource to accomplish its homeland security missions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS, in coordination with the Air Force, cost-effectively assess the extent to which CAP can further assist DHS with future homeland security missions.

CAP\u2019s financial plan is reviewed and adjusted by both the Air Education  and Training Command and Air Force headquarters. According to an Air  Force official involved with CAP\u2019s budget submission, the Air Force  attempts to ensure that CAP receives at least the same amount of  funding it had the previous year. However, CAP is competing against  other Air Force priorities in the normal Air Force budget development  process. Still, according to the Air Force official, CAP often receives  additional funding from Congress above the Air Force\u2019s request.

Per Air Force guidance,  CAP ordinarily conducts missions on a cost-reimbursable basis. Typically,  any federal agency requesting CAP assistance through the Air Force  must certify that its request complies with the Economy Act, which  requires that requesting agencies have available the monies necessary to  cover the expense of the service being requested, among other things.  CAP\u2019s reimbursement rate as of October 2012 was $160 per flying hour,  covering fuel and maintenance. According to CAP and Air Force  officials, formal agreements between CAP and requesting  organizations\u2014such as those that exist between some CAP wings and  state-level entities\u2014can expedite the approval process by identifying  funding mechanisms prior to CAP support.", "While CAP typically requires reimbursement for its support activities,  some of CAP\u2019s missions are financed through federally appropriated  funds. Some of these missions were identified by officials from CAP or  DHS components as areas in which CAP could provide further support.  For example, CAP has received since 2004 in its annual operations and  maintenance budget an allotment for counterdrug activities, and therefore  conducts many of its counterdrug missions at no expense to the  customer. Additionally, the Air Force funds through the CAP appropriation  a range of activities deemed to be of interest to the Air Force, including  inland search and rescue. According to CAP officials, CAP\u2019s current  funding levels are sufficient to support these activities. However, an  increase in such unreimbursed activities could affect CAP\u2019s ability to  respond to other missions supported by appropriated funds. For example,  CAP officials told us that, because of the counterdrug nexus, border  reconnaissance missions in support of CBP are also typically funded by  the CAP operations budget instead of reimbursed by the customer.  Consequently, an increase in such unreimbursed border reconnaissance  missions\u2014which relate to the homeland security area of securing and  managing our borders\u2014could diminish CAP\u2019s ability to support other  unreimbursed activities, such as counterdrug activities for the Drug  Enforcement Administration and others.", "According to CAP and DHS officials, CAP\u2019s existing operational  capabilities\u2014aircraft and vehicles, personnel, and technology\u2014have  been sufficient to support certain homeland security missions, yet they  may not be suitable for other types of missions. Recognizing this, officials  from CAP headquarters told us that if DHS identified additional homeland  security missions for CAP, it might be necessary to pursue additional  resources or technologies.", "According to CAP officials, the number and locations of CAP\u2019s assets\u2014 which include 550 aircraft and 960 vehicles across 52 wings\u2014could be  conducive to conducting additional homeland security missions, which  can originate at the local, state, and federal levels. CAP\u2019s aircraft,  primarily consisting of Cessna 172s and 182s, are capable of performing  aerial reconnaissance and damage assessment, search and rescue  missions, and air intercept exercises. FEMA officials told us that because  CAP\u2019s assets are geographically dispersed across the country, it has  proven to be a flexible and timely resource to capture imagery in the first  hours or days of an event. As an example, FEMA officials cited CAP\u2019s  support of the agency\u2019s operations in response to Hurricane Isaac in  2012, specifically stating that CAP\u2019s imagery helped to establish  situational awareness. CAP\u2019s vehicles are capable of light transport of  personnel and equipment, mobile communications, and ground damage  assessment. Many vehicles are also equipped with radios that are able to  communicate with CAP aircraft, which could enable a coordinated  approach to air and land missions.

For example,  CAP\u2019s single-engine aircraft have limited transport capacity. Additionally,  CAP guidance prohibits sustained flight at an altitude of less than 1,000  feet during the day or 2,000 feet at night. This limitation was also cited by  Coast Guard officials, who specifically stated that during the Deepwater  Horizon incident, CAP was unable to fly certain oil tracking missions  because of altitude restrictions. A Coast Guard official further noted that  the range of CAP\u2019s aircraft was limited over water\u2014with aircraft being  required to stay within gliding distance of shore. CAP officials told us,  however, that CAP aircraft are able to operate up to 50 nautical miles  from shore under normal conditions, and that this range can be extended  for special missions.", "CAP officials stated that, since CAP is a volunteer organization, its  membership\u2014consisting of 61,000 volunteers, including approximately  35,000 senior members and 11,000 crew members\u2014constitutes its most  critical asset. According to CAP officials, CAP has standards and  qualifications for its member pilots and maintains online systems that  train, test, and track all aspects of crew qualifications. For example,  CAP\u2019s mission pilots must possess a private pilot\u2019s license with 200 flight  hours, and are required to complete training courses specific to search  and rescue and disaster response. Those performing specialized  missions are also subject to more stringent requirements. For example,  counterdrug mission pilots must (1) be qualified for emergency services  flights; (2) be current in a skill that has application to the counterdrug  program; (3) complete a national counterdrug orientation course and,  biennially, a refresher course; and (4) maintain a minimum of 20 hours of  participation in the program yearly. Many of CAP\u2019s members have also  completed training in the National Incident Management System in order  to allow CAP personnel to integrate operationally with local, state, and  federal incident command structures. Officials from some of the  customer organizations we spoke with cited the professionalism of CAP\u2019s  personnel as a factor contributing to their success during past operations.  For example, the Coast Guard Director of Air Operations during the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill told us that CAP personnel conducting high  profile shoreline and oil boom patrols were well-organized.", "However, limitations in the quantity and expertise of mission pilots exist  that may hinder CAP\u2019s ability to support some activities. For example,  CAP\u2019s membership includes 3,000 mission pilots, representing  approximately 5 percent of total membership. Although CAP has in the  past demonstrated its ability to temporarily transfer pilots to support surge  missions\u2014such as during the Deepwater Horizon incident\u2014it could face  challenges in increasing its support to sustained, long-term homeland  security missions, particularly if those missions were to occur in areas  with few mission pilots. Officials from CAP headquarters pointed towards  their past successes in supporting surge missions, but they also  recognized that there could be challenges associated with frequently  moving pilots to meet mission demands since the pilots are volunteers.  Coast Guard officials we spoke with questioned whether CAP, because of  its volunteer status, would consistently have pilots available to respond  when needed and raised concerns that CAP pilots have limited expertise  in maritime situations and do not have water survival training\u2014both of  which could be important requirements for many Coast Guard missions.  According to CAP officials, however, 521 CAP crew members have  completed water survival training consisting of classroom instruction and  a swim test.", "CAP\u2019s current technological capabilities in terms of imagery and  communications may both enable and limit its ability to support additional  homeland security operations. CAP currently has a variety of imagery and  communications technologies that can be used during some homeland  security operations to provide ground and airborne communications relay  and to capture geographically identifiable still-frame aerial imagery, and,  in some cases, full-motion video. CAP\u2019s nationwide communications  capability includes high frequency and very high frequency AM and FM  fixed, mobile, and repeater systems capable of providing connectivity  during local, regional, and national events. CAP officials told us that these  capabilities have in the past proved essential in maintaining  communications during geographically dispersed operations. Table 2  depicts CAP\u2019s imagery platforms.", "According to officials at the DHS components with whom we spoke,  CAP\u2019s existing technologies are sufficient to support some of the  homeland security activities we have previously discussed, such as  disaster assessment. Additionally, officials from CBP told us that CAP  technologies could help further with detection and monitoring along the  borders, providing radio relay in remote areas, and gaining situational  awareness in areas not currently supported by other air platforms.  However, officials from CBP and the Coast Guard also commented on  CAP\u2019s limitations in the border and marine environments, citing  inadequate imagery capabilities, incompatible communications, and  insufficient detection technology. Specifically, officials from CBP  commented that CAP is incapable of providing a live video feed to its  customers, capturing nighttime imagery, providing a video downlink of  reconnaissance events, and transmitting information securely. These  same officials emphasized that other technologies not possessed by CAP  nationwide, including radar, forward-looking infrared cameras, and  change detection capabilities, are critical in the border environment.Coast Guard officials cited CAP\u2019s inability to relay imagery in near-real  time and stated that its systems are not compatible with the Coast  Guard\u2019s imagery or communications systems. As a result, the Coast  Guard has not coordinated with CAP regarding the expansion of CAP\u2019s  role. Air Force and CAP officials recognized that CAP\u2019s current  technology may not be suitable for certain missions and told us that if new  capabilities are needed to support additional homeland security missions,  requirements would be needed from DHS. CAP officials also noted that  1st Air Force has developed a requirement to modify or purchase 20  aircraft with capabilities including near-real time communications; video  and imagery transfer that is interoperable with federal, state, and local  responders; and sensors useful for locating distressed persons day or  night.", "CAP\u2019s daily operational tempo is the percentage of total possible missions being flown  based on the number of available aircraft and pilot availability. CAP\u2019s goal is to have five  mission pilots per each available aircraft. CAP has not determined what level constitutes  its maximum operating capacity. enabled cell phones and locator beacons\u2014to receive other assistance.  This shift has freed up additional time for CAP to conduct other missions.", "Officials we spoke with from the Coast Guard expressed some concern  over relying on a volunteer organization like CAP because it does not  have the same readiness posture and response standards as the Coast  Guard. However, our discussions with these officials and the CAP wings  identified no instances in which CAP was unable to respond to a request,  or in which CAP was delayed in responding to a request because of a  shortage of pilots or other personnel. According to CAP officials, CAP has  also demonstrated an ability to surge in support of other agencies and to  perform continuous operations for a sustained period of time. For  example, CAP provided continuous support over 118 days during the  Deepwater Horizon incident. A Coast Guard official involved in this  operation corroborated CAP\u2019s account of this operation, speaking highly  of its organization and ability to conduct missions. Also, while the Drug  Enforcement Administration is not a DHS component, officials from this  agency told us that they rely on CAP aerial communications and imagery  for approximately 2,500 counterdrug sorties per year and that they have  received positive feedback regarding CAP\u2019s ability to conduct these  operations from their field agents. CAP officials stated that large  operations such as Deepwater Horizon do not necessarily affect CAP\u2019s  ability to provide support in other areas throughout the year, but do  significantly reduce their operations and maintenance funds because  reimbursement does not cover these expenses. Further, while many of  CAP\u2019s missions are preplanned, CAP and Air Force officials stated that  wings are tested biennially in a no-notice exercise, such as the  Department of Defense\u2019s Ardent Sentry, to ensure that personnel can  assemble and deploy quickly to no-notice events."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Assessed CAP\u2019s Ability to Support Additional Homeland Security Missions", "paragraphs": ["DHS has not assessed CAP\u2019s capabilities and resources or determined  the extent to which CAP could be used to support future homeland  security activities. The DHS concept of homeland security, as articulated  in the QHSR, is that of a national enterprise, requiring the collective  efforts and shared responsibilities of federal, state, local,  nongovernmental, and private sector partners, among others. As we have  reported in the past, ensuring that capabilities are available for such  efforts requires effective planning and coordination in which capabilities  are realistically tested in order to identify and subsequently address  problems in partnership with relevant stakeholders. Additionally, we  have also reported that achieving results for the nation increasingly  requires collaboration among many different entities, and that because of  the nation\u2019s long-range fiscal challenges, the federal government must  identify ways to deliver results more efficiently and in a way that is  consistent with its multiple demands and limited resources. However,  according to an official in the DHS Office of Policy, DHS has not  conducted a review to determine how CAP might be used by DHS or its  components, and DHS does not have a position on the use of CAP for  homeland security operations. Additionally, of the three DHS components  we contacted, only FEMA had taken steps to consider CAP\u2019s suitability  for future homeland security activities and incorporate CAP in its  operational planning. Specifically, FEMA officials told us that they are  working with the DHS Science and Technology Directorate to develop  requirements for CAP imagery and that they have included CAP in  several of their disaster planning annexes. According to these officials,  simple technological upgrades could improve FEMA\u2019s ability to integrate  CAP\u2019s imagery into its operations. The other two components we  contacted\u2014CBP and the Coast Guard\u2014had not assessed CAP\u2019s ability  to support their operations, but expressed reservations about using CAP  for certain activities, as previously discussed.", "Officials we spoke with from CAP and the Air Force expressed support for  FEMA\u2019s efforts to develop imagery requirements for CAP. CAP officials  told us that they were optimistic that this effort would provide insight into  how CAP could better support its DHS customers. Similarly, Air Force  officials stated that, in order to determine whether CAP could support  additional DHS missions, DHS would first need to provide them with  requirements for missions and also obtain a good understanding of CAP\u2019s  limitations\u2014particularly in the area of support to law enforcement. To that  end, CAP and Air Force officials told us that they have performed  outreach to DHS, CBP, and FEMA in an effort to inform these potential  partners of their capabilities and establish formal agreements that would  define CAP\u2019s role in providing support to such entities. By establishing  such relationships and assessing the ability of CAP to provide additional  homeland security capabilities, DHS, in coordination with the Air Force,  could position itself to better understand, and potentially utilize, another  resource to accomplish its homeland security missions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DHS faces the difficult challenge of securing our homeland through a  wide range of missions from preventing terrorism, to securing our large  borders and shorelines, and planning for and responding to natural and  man-made disasters. Recognizing this challenge, DHS has emphasized  the importance of partnering with other federal, state, local, and private  entities to achieve its homeland security missions. Moreover, recent fiscal  constraints may compel federal agencies, such as DHS, to partner with  other organizations in order to accomplish their missions and achieve  their goals. CAP is one such potential partner, having performed various  missions since its inception in support of homeland security missions and  components. Several factors affect CAP\u2019s ability to conduct these and  additional homeland security missions, including legal parameters,  mission funding and reimbursement, existing capabilities, and capacity.
