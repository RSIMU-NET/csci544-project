Location-based services provide consumers access to applications such as real-time navigation aids, access to free or reduced-cost mobile applications, and faster response from emergency services, among other potential benefits. However, the collection and sharing of location data also pose privacy risks. Specifically, privacy advocates said that consumers: (1) are generally unaware of how their location data are shared with and used by third parties; (2) could be subject to increased surveillance when location data are shared with law enforcement; and (3) could be at higher risk of identity theft or threats to personal safety when companies retain location data for long periods or share data with third parties that do not adequately protect them.", "Industry associations and privacy advocates have developed recommended practices for companies to protect consumers' privacy while using mobile location data, but companies have not consistently implemented such practices. Recommended practices include clearly disclosing to consumers that a company is collecting location data and how it will use them, as well as identifying third parties that companies share location data with and the reasons for doing so. Companies GAO examined disclosed in their privacy policies that the companies were collecting consumers' location data, but did not clearly state how the companies were using these data or what third parties they may share them with. For example, some companies' policies stated they collected location data and listed uses for personal information, but did not state clearly whether companies considered location to be personal information. Furthermore, although policies stated that companies shared location data with third parties, they were sometimes vague about which types of companies these were and why they were sharing the data. Lacking clear information, consumers faced with making a decision about whether to allow companies to collect, use, and share data on their location would be unable to effectively judge whether the uses of their location data might violate their privacy.", "Federal agencies have held educational outreach events, developed reports with recommendations aimed at protecting consumer privacy, and developed some guidance on certain aspects of mobile privacy. The Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is implementing an administration-proposed effort to bring industry, advocacy, and government stakeholders together to develop codes of conduct for industry to address Internet consumer privacy issues generally. However, NTIA has not set specific goals, milestones, and performance measures for this effort. Consequently, it is unclear if or when the process would address mobile location privacy. Furthermore, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could enforce adherence to the codes if companies adopted them, but since adoption is voluntary, there is no guarantee companies would adopt the resulting codes. While FTC has issued some guidance to address mobile location privacy issues, it has not issued comprehensive guidance that could inform companies of the Commission's views on the appropriate actions companies should take to protect consumers' mobile location data privacy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NTIA work with stakeholders to outline specific goals, milestones, and performance measures for its process to develop industry codes of conduct and that FTC consider issuing guidance on mobile companies' appropriate actions to protect location data privacy.

The ranges of the individual cell towers divide the  service area into separate sectors. As the towers are in fixed positions,  determining a device\u2019s current cell tower sector tells the carrier the  device\u2019s approximate location. The precision of this method depends on  how much space a particular tower covers. In general, urban areas have  smaller sectors than rural areas because each sector can only manage a  certain amount of cell traffic at any one time. Because of increasing cell  traffic, the number of cell towers has proliferated to the point that there  are now over three times more than there were 10 years ago. As a result,  cell sector-based location data are increasingly accurate. Companies can  further improve accuracy by using triangulation methods, which determine  location through the mathematical comparison of a device\u2019s signals that  reach more than one cell tower. Cell tower triangulation can now yield  results within 50 meters of accuracy.", "Mobile carriers that provide Wi-Fi access points to their customers can  use these access points to determine location. Like cell towers, Wi-Fi  access points are fixed locations and send out signals over a limited  range. Specifically, Wi-Fi signals are radio waves that provide Internet  access to devices equipped with compatible wireless hardware. Each Wi- Fi access point is identified by a unique hardware address. Nearby  compatible devices are able to receive this information and use it to  request Internet access. Since a Wi-Fi access point\u2019s range is limited to a  few hundred meters, accurate location data can be determined if a device  communicates with the access point.", "Companies such as Google, Apple, and Skyhook use information  gathered from users\u2019 mobile devices about cell tower and Wi-Fi access  point signals, as well as the Wi-Fi signals of other companies and  households, to determine location. These companies compile the precise  locations of these signals into large databases, which the companies may  then license to other entities such as application developers. An  application installed on a mobile device can obtain location information by  querying one of these databases, which will use its knowledge about  those signals\u2019 locations to return the device\u2019s location. The database can  also use location information sent by the device to update its records. If  there are any new signals in the device\u2019s vicinity or any old signals that  are no longer broadcasting, the database can incorporate those changes  in its records. While the exact degree of accuracy ultimately depends on  how many signal points are near the device when it queries a database,  companies use crowd-sourced positioning because it provides accurate  location data quickly, and because it does not rely on GPS technology,  which is not available in all mobile devices.", "GPS is used by both carriers and non-carriers to determine a device\u2019s  location. GPS technology is based upon satellite signals, which are  picked up and interpreted by devices equipped with GPS receiver chips.  The device then measures the time it takes for it to receive various  satellite signals and triangulates its location. Triangulating GPS satellite  signals can yield data accurate to within 10 meters.", "A-GPS is a hybrid approach used to overcome certain limitations in GPS  technology: namely, that GPS usually only works outside buildings, may  take several minutes to determine location, and uses more battery power  than other location determination methods.

To provide these services, carriers and  developers need the ability to quickly and accurately determine location.  Location data can also be used to enhance the functionality of other  services that do not need to know the user\u2019s location to operate. Search  engines, for example, can use location data as a frame of reference to  return results that might be more relevant.

Most  of these companies indicated that users could control smartphones\u2019 use  of their location data from the phone; however, the ability to control this  varied by operating system, with some providing more options. While all  of the operating system developers we examined allowed a user to have  location access turned on or off for all applications, some gave users the  ability to control whether specific applications could have access to  location data. According to the literature we reviewed that examined  mobile applications, controls within applications, if available, were  sometimes difficult to find. Mobile carriers told us that they do not allow  users to control collection of location data for providing basic phone  service, since having location data is necessary to provide that service.", "All the companies we examined that collected data for providing location- based services indicated that users must first provide consent before  location-based services use their location; however, privacy policies we  examined did not always explain how users\u2019 consent is obtained.  Companies told us that a smartphone seeks permission from the user to  use location when the user installs an application that makes use of  location or the first time the user activates such an application. For  example, the iPhone iOS operating system displays a pop-up window the  first time a user activates a new application that includes location-based  services. The pop-up states that the application is seeking to use the  user\u2019s location and allows the user to accept or decline.

However, 7 of the 11 privacy policies we reviewed  did not include a statement about how long the company kept location  data. Officials from most companies told us they kept location data only  as long as needed for a specific purpose; however, in some cases, this  could mean keeping location data indefinitely. The carriers we interviewed  named specific time periods for location data retention, which they said  varied depending on the specific uses of the data, and reported a range  of time from a few days to 3 years after the duration of time a user is a  customer with the company. Three companies indicated they kept  location data indefinitely, and representatives from one company said  they had not established a retention time period. Privacy advocates  raised data retention as a particular concern, since the longer companies  retain location data, the more likely the potential for misuse.

Companies reported actions to safeguard  users\u2019 location data, but practices for how data are safeguarded varied.  All the companies we examined reported ways they safeguard users\u2019  personal information. For example, all of the privacy policies stated that  companies had general security measures in place to protect personal  information against loss, theft, or misuse. Specific practices reported by  some companies included data encryption, erecting firewalls, and  restricting employee access.whether these protections covered location data.

Five of the 11 privacy policies included general statements that  employees were accountable for following the company\u2019s policies as  outlined in the privacy policy. A few privacy policies also mentioned that  the company followed recommended practices; one carrier\u2019s policy stated  the company followed recommended practices developed by CTIA-The  Wireless Association (CTIA), a nonprofit organization representing mobile  carriers and other wireless companies, and 3 companies\u2019 policies stated  their privacy practices had been certified by TRUSTe, a company that  helps companies address privacy issues. Three of the carriers also told  us they use their contracts with third parties they share users\u2019 personal  data with to require those third parties to adhere to CTIA recommended  practices for location data. Operating system developers reported varying  steps to encourage or require developers of applications that run on their  systems to inform users and obtain consent before using their location  data. For example, in 2011, Apple stated that it would reject applications  from its on-line store that do not obtain consent from the user before  collecting, transmitting, or using a user\u2019s location data and that such use  must be directly relevant to the features and services provided by the  application.

Furthermore, because consumers are expected to rely on these  disclosures when judging whether they should give consent to a company  to access their location, consumers may be providing such consent  without complete knowledge of how their data will be used.

These  advocates said that companies are generally disclosing to users that they  will collect location data; however, they are not adequately informing  consumers about the uses of the data they collect, including with whom  they are sharing the data. These advocates also expressed concern  about companies retaining location data longer than necessary, which  puts the data at increased risk of inappropriate use.

However, in summarizing  views of participants in a 2011 panel discussion, the FCC report noted  that panelists found inconsistency in the privacy notices provided by  companies and incomplete disclosure of the ways location data are used.  Specifically, the report states that while consumers may have clear notice  that an application will collect and use data on their location, these data  may be subsequently used in ways that are not transparent to consumers  or shared with third parties without consumers\u2019 consent.

See table 3 below  for a list of the companies we examined.", "We reviewed and analyzed selected companies\u2019 privacy policies and  other publicly available documents. We also interviewed representatives  of these companies, except Motorola and Samsung, which provided  written answers to our questions, and Apple, which declined to answer  our questions.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed and analyzed relevant  literature to determine the various methods companies use to collect  location data, why they use and share these data, the benefits that are  provided to the consumer, and the associated privacy risks. In addition,  we interviewed representatives from mobile industry associations (CTIA \u2013  The Wireless Association and Mobile Marketing Association), privacy  advocacy groups (American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy  and Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Electronic Privacy  Information Center, and Future of Privacy Forum), and two privacy  researchers (Christopher Soghoian and Ashkan Soltani) who had either  testified on the subject before Congress or authored relevant literature on  the subject, to discuss the benefits and privacy risks associated with the  use of location data. We also interviewed officials from federal agencies  that interact with the mobile industry or have responsibilities for consumer  privacy protection, including the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Commerce\u2019s  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and  Department of Justice (Justice), to obtain their views.", "To address our second objective, in addition to examining the companies  as previously discussed, we identified practices recommended by mobile  industry associations and privacy advocacy groups to protect the privacy  of and secure users\u2019 personal information and assessed the extent to  which they are consistent with the Fair Information Practices. In addition,  we reviewed and analyzed the privacy policies of the selected mobile  industry companies to determine their specific practices to protect  consumer privacy and how their stated practices aligned with  recommended practices. We also reviewed relevant studies of mobile  application privacy to obtain further information on how mobile application  developers protect consumer privacy. We also interviewed  representatives of privacy advocacy groups to obtain their views about  how the private sector is protecting users\u2019 location privacy.", "To address our third objective, we identified and reviewed relevant laws  applicable to the mobile industry\u2019s use of personal information. To  evaluate how federal agencies have ensured compliance with relevant  laws and what additional efforts they could take to further protect  consumers, we analyzed information and interviewed officials from FCC,  FTC, NTIA, and Justice about their enforcement, regulatory, and  policymaking efforts to protect consumer privacy. We also interviewed  representatives from mobile industry associations and privacy advocacy  groups as well as privacy researchers to obtain their views about whether  more could be done to protect consumer privacy. In considering ways to  address location data privacy issues, we are reporting actions federal  agencies could take, rather than potential legislative options.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2011 to September  2012, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Federal Trade Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Michael Clements (Assistant  Director), John de Ferrari (Assistant Director), Russell Burnett, Mark  Canter, Marisol Cruz, Colin Fallon, Andrew Huddleston, Josh Ormond,  David Plocher, Meredith Raymond, and Crystal Wesco made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
