Although the Commission did not identify specific locations as severely distressed, it recommended that funds be made available to address distressed conditions and that these funds be added to the amounts traditionally appropriated for modernizing public housing.", "In response to the Commission\u2019s report, the Congress, through appropriations legislation, created the HOPE VI demonstration program to provide a more comprehensive and flexible approach to revitalizing distressed urban communities.

There have been no capital improvements at the five remaining sites. At several sites, deteriorated high-rise and mid-rise buildings are being demolished and replaced with lower-density structures. In addition, infrastructure improvements, such as new street patterns, are breaking down the physical barriers that isolated many HOPE VI sites from the neighboring communities. At some sites, mixed-income communities have replaced concentrations of poverty, and new community centers, together with plans for police stations, schools, and shopping districts, are helping to integrate the sites with neighboring areas.", "At 8 of the 10 sites we visited, both demolition and new construction or rehabilitation have begun.

However, some units were demolished at both sites to reconfigure the streets, not only to provide easier access for residents and public services but also to discourage gang-related drug traffic. Green spaces were substituted for concrete at both sites, and street lights and walkways were installed to match those of the surrounding neighborhoods. In addition, community centers were expanded. In El Paso, neighbors who had asked that the brick wall around the HOPE VI site be built higher to block out the public housing community agreed with the site plan, which proposed to demolish the wall and replace it with a see-through wrought iron fence.

The net effect of this change was to lower the total amount available for such services. HUD program officials said that they are not concerned about the reduction in funding for community and support services because neither the original nor the revised guidelines would provide enough support to maintain the services over the long term. Housing authority officials we spoke with also expressed little concern about the decrease because most housing authorities were not spending to the limit and were attempting to build self-sustaining programs.", "The HOPE VI sites we visited were aware of the need to sustain their community and support service programs after their HOPE VI funds run out. For example, Atlanta\u2019s Centennial Place has created a full-time position for a staff member to focus on fund-raising and collaborating with local agencies to sustain the programs developed under HOPE VI. Other sites, such as Orchard Park in Boston and Pico Aliso in Los Angeles, had service organizations in the neighborhood before the HOPE VI program started, and their HOPE VI money has provided these organizations with facilities and equipment to offer more comprehensive services. A March 1998 HUD Inspector General\u2019s report expressed concern that Kennedy Brothers Memorial in El Paso will not have enough funds to support its current plans for community and support services unless it leverages additional public and private support.

For example, New York\u2019s Far Rockaway neighborhood, containing both the Arverne and the Edgemere sites, has been a candidate for major urban renewal funding for over 20 years. However, the city has not committed funding to make major investments in such an isolated location, according to housing authority officials. The $25 million HOPE VI grant at Robert Taylor Homes B in Chicago is for demolishing the first 5 of 16 high-rise buildings and purchasing or building a limited number of replacement units in the surrounding neighborhood. The Chicago Housing Authority estimates that it will take 10 years to vacate the Robert Taylor development, where the unemployment rate is over 90 percent, and bring back an economically viable neighborhood. At Los Angeles\u2019 Pico Aliso site, relocation took longer than planned, since many residents could not be moved as anticipated because the areas were controlled by gangs.", "Despite the physical and social challenges they pose, many HOPE VI sites are located close to city centers, making them attractive to investors. At the same time, residents at some sites have viewed investors\u2019 interest with suspicion, fearing that they will lose their homes to upscale development. In some instances, housing authorities have been able to allay residents\u2019 concerns and proceed with capital improvements; in other instances, the residents\u2019 concerns have delayed redevelopment.", "Atlanta\u2019s Centennial Place, conveniently located within walking distance of downtown Atlanta, attracted funds from the city, private lenders, and community service providers, all of whom considered the site a desirable investment. However, residents fearing displacement initially opposed the housing authority\u2019s revitalization plan, which called for reducing the development\u2019s density and replacing only one in three public housing units. Eventually, the residents agreed to the plan when the executive director promised to allow those who remained in good standing (i.e., paid their rent and respected the housing authority\u2019s rules) to return to the site.", "Both Mission Main in Boston and Cabrini Homes Extension in Chicago are desirably situated near city centers and have attracted private development funds, but residents\u2019 concerns about the motives of the housing authorities and of the developers have, in both cases, delayed development. At Cabrini Homes Extension, where many residents see a leveraging plan as an attempted land grab by developers, the residents are suing the Chicago Housing Authority to ensure their right to return to the site after the capital improvements have been completed.", "HOPE VI sites also pose exceptional management challenges. Under the selection criteria that the Congress established for the program\u2019s first 3 years, the housing authorities applying for funding had to be (1) located in the 40 most populous U.S. cities, as defined on the basis of data from the 1990 census, or (2) included on HUD\u2019s list of troubled housing authorities as of March 31, 1992. Of the 24 housing authorities included on that list, 17 received at least one HOPE VI implementation grant during the program\u2019s first 3 years. In total, these 17 housing authorities received 21 (55 percent) of the grants awarded to 39 sites from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1995. Furthermore, at over half of these 39 sites, major changes in senior management occurred after the grant was awarded. Management turnover limits progress because time is needed to replace and reorganize staff and allow staff to learn their new duties and build relationships and trust with the community.", "At 16 of the HOPE VI sites, either HUD or the courts have intervened in the housing authority\u2019s management. According to HUD officials, the primary reason for intervention was the inability of housing authorities to manage and implement the program. Management problems were particularly acute at the Washington, D.C., and Chicago housing authorities. In Washington, D.C., the housing authority was so troubled that HUD made its grant award contingent upon the appointment of an alternative administrator. This appointment took about 6 months from the time the grant was awarded, and submitting a revised revitalization plan to HUD took another 5 months. In Chicago, where HUD took over the housing authority\u2019s operation after the housing board resigned, more than 2-1/2 years elapsed before the revitalization plan for Cabrini Homes Extension was revised and HUD\u2019s approval of the plan was obtained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program\u2019s Origin Has Created Legal Challenges and Encouraged Changes", "paragraphs": ["The HOPE VI program\u2019s origin has created legal challenges and encouraged legislative and administrative changes that have further delayed sites\u2019 progress.

Rather than develop implementing regulations that would be difficult to modify with each legislative change, HUD has incorporated the program\u2019s legislative requirements into periodic notices of funding availability and into the grant agreements that it signs with individual housing authorities. The evolution of the HOPE VI program\u2019s requirements is summarized in figure 7.", "The HOPE VI program\u2019s establishment through the appropriations process raised legal issues that had to be resolved before HUD could fully implement the program. In the absence of regulations, the grant agreements serve as contracts between HUD and the housing authorities overseeing the HOPE VI sites. According to a HUD official, HUD took 8 months after sending out the letters announcing the fiscal year 1993 awards to finalize the first grant agreements, primarily because it was creating regulatory documents, not merely specifying the grants\u2019 conditions. Other legal issues arose in 1995, when HUD began encouraging the housing authorities to use their federal grants to leverage private funds for redevelopment. HUD took 8 months to develop new regulations on the use of both public and private funds to finance public housing sites.", "Annual legislation has affected the HOPE VI program, and HUD has amended the grant agreements and the program\u2019s guidance to reflect its interpretation of these changes. For example, until the Rescissions Act was passed in July 1995, HOPE VI sites were subject to a rule requiring the replacement of every unit removed from service. Although demolition was an option, housing authorities rarely availed themselves of it when every unit that they tore down had to be replaced. After the Rescissions Act suspended the one-for-one replacement rule, HUD began encouraging housing authorities to consider demolition as a way of reducing a site\u2019s density. HUD also interpreted the 1996 appropriations legislation as adding demolition to HUD\u2019s funding criteria. HUD, therefore, required each housing authority to demolish at least one building. Eventually, HUD concluded that demolition was not always required.", "These legislative and administrative changes and HUD\u2019s interpretation of them affected progress at the sites we visited. For example, the Los Angeles housing authority welcomed the suspension of the one-for-one replacement rule and took advantage of it to revise its plan for the Pico Aliso site to include demolition and new construction. This revision, however, added about 15 months to the process, according to Los Angeles officials. In New York City, issues raised by HUD\u2019s interpretation of the 1996 appropriations legislation as requiring demolition added months to the planning phase at the Arverne and Edgemere sites, where residents opposed the housing authority\u2019s plan to satisfy the demolition requirement by removing the top four floors of three buildings at the site, thereby removing the equivalent of an entire building."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Capital Improvements Influence Progress", "paragraphs": ["The types of capital improvements selected have influenced the pace of development. Rehabilitation, which requires less change than demolition and new construction, has generally proved less controversial and taken less time.

For example, in Milwaukee, existing units were, for the most part, rehabilitated at Hillside Terrace. Although residents were required to move while the work was going on, most will be able to return when it is completed. Capital improvements at the site have encountered little opposition and are progressing on schedule. Conversely, Boston\u2019s Mission Main planned to exchange some of its land for adjacent land owned by a local university in order to build a portion of the rental and homeownership units on the new site, but it could not reach agreement with the university.

However, as discussed in the next section of this report, leveraging has many benefits.", "The steps involved in using one other funding source\u2014low-income housing tax credits\u2014illustrate the complexity of leveraged financing. To obtain tax credits, which attract private equity for development, a housing authority must submit an application to the state and compete with other developers for the credits. The application must identify all of the proposed sources and uses of funds and undergo a subsidy-layering review to ensure that no more federal assistance is being provided than is necessary to make the development financially feasible. If tax credits are awarded for the development, the housing authority must then recruit investors who are willing to provide equity in exchange for tax credits.

At 30 of the sites, the combined funds from public and/or private sources exceed the HOPE VI grant. Most of the 23 sites selected in the 1997 funding round reflect the program\u2019s new emphasis on forging partnerships and leveraging outside resources.", "The use of leveraged financing may enable sites to stretch limited federal dollars, create opportunities for mixed-income developments, and attract nonprofit and for-profit partners with experience in leveraged financing. For example, at Centennial Place in Atlanta, the housing authority combined low-income housing tax credits and private funding with the HOPE VI grant to create a mixed-income community. The grant funds provided public housing units for residents with very low incomes, the tax credits financed units for residents with low to moderate incomes, and the private funding paid for the development of market-rate units for residents with moderate to high incomes.", "At Kennedy Brothers Memorial in El Paso, the housing authority is combining private funds with the HOPE VI grant to produce both public housing units and identical or similar units that will be available to home buyers. At Ellen Wilson in Washington, D.C., the income mix will be completed by offering, at full market prices, fee simple units that are identical or similar to the neighboring limited-equity cooperative units. These units will be purchased using private mortgages, and the profits from their sale will establish an endowment for ongoing neighborhood community and support services. However, other sites, such as Arverne and Edgemere in New York and Robert Taylor Homes B in Chicago, are physically isolated or suffer from extreme economic distress, making them unattractive to outside investors. (Fig. 8 identifies the sources of funding for the 10 sites we visited.)", "Recent appropriations acts have encouraged leveraging by reducing the size of the HOPE VI grants. On average, the size of the grants has declined from about $45 million during fiscal years 1993 and 1994 to about $21.6 million in fiscal year 1997 (see fig. 9). To some extent, this decline is consistent with a change in the 1996 appropriations legislation that eased the program\u2019s eligibility requirements. As a result of this change, some of the more recently selected sites are smaller and have greater potential for leveraging than the original sites.", "HUD anticipates further increases in the use of leveraging after it implements a new total development cost (TDC) policy, expected to go into effect with the fiscal year 1998 grants. Under HUD\u2019s former TDC policy, the per-unit costs of development were capped. These costs\u2014including the costs of land acquisition, building acquisition or construction, builders\u2019 overhead and profit, and financing\u2014were not to exceed the housing industry\u2019s standards for multifamily properties in a given area. While HOPE VI sites have always been subject to TDC caps, they have typically received exceptions because of the extraordinary demolition, remediation, and other costs involved in urban revitalization. Under the new policy, applicable to developments financed with grants awarded in fiscal year 1998 and beyond, items paid for with HUD funds, including public housing, HOME, and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, will not be eligible for exceptions. However, items paid for with non-public-housing funds controlled by a locality, state, or private sector, including low-income housing tax credits, will not be subject to the TDC caps.

The housing authority then included demolition in the plans for Edgemere\u2019s redevelopment, even though New York City\u2019s political officials were against the concept. The housing authority determined that the best way to meet the demolition requirement would be to remove some top floors from each of three nine-story buildings, thereby eliminating about 100 units. Subsequently, the housing authority withdrew this plan and proposed to convert dwelling units on the first floor to create space for commercial and community services. This approach would also have removed about 100 units. The issue became moot when the Congress, in the fiscal year 1998 appropriations act for the departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and independent agencies, gave the New York City Housing Authority the option of not following any HOPE VI demolition requirements and the housing authority abandoned the plans for demolishing the 100 units. Subsequently, the housing authority proposed removing 32 units from 8 buildings to make room for interior stairwells in order to meet the city\u2019s fire code."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Status", "paragraphs": ["In June 1997, the housing authority submitted its revitalization plan to HUD.

We revised our report accordingly. 2. We revised our report to indicate that 11 positions are being restored. The HUD official quoted in our draft report told us that even if the Department hired highly experienced employees, it would take a number of months to train them in the details of underwriting HOPE VI sites. This official and others we spoke with emphasized that regardless of the experience and competency of the individuals hired, it takes time to learn the policies and procedures involved in structuring public/private financing. We removed the statement in the body of the draft report that gaining such expertise could take a year, but we continue to believe that it will take time. 3. We agree that the HOPE VI sites are unique and that the program should not be constrained in ways that would inhibit creativity. Yet even though the needs of the communities and residents vary by site, the types of community and support service programs offered at the sites we visited (e.g., day care, after-school care, equivalency degree, job training, and job placement programs) were consistent enough to allow the collection of national data on the outcomes of these programs. Accordingly, we have retained our recommendation to this effect. 4. No change required. 5. We revised our report to state that the more recently selected sites are smaller and have greater potential for leveraging than the original sites. We agree that the recently selected sites are suffering from structural and social distress and are likely to be among the most distressed sites in the chosen cities. But unlike some of the early sites, which have not been able to attract leveraging partners, the sites chosen since the criteria for participation in the program were expanded in 1996 typically have been smaller and have been located in areas where private interests are more willing to contribute funding. We revised our report to clarify this point. 6. We were aware of the study conducted by HUD\u2019s Office of Policy Development and Research and summarized the results of its first phase in our February 1997 report. We added information to this report on the results of the first phase of this study and noted that the second phase is expected to begin in the summer of 1998.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
