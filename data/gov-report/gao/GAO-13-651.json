The Navy used an open systems approach at the start of development for the air vehicle, ground control station, and payloads (i.e., cameras and radar sensors) for three of its four current and planned UAS and anticipates significant efficiencies. For example, Navy and contractor officials expect the Small Tactical UAS to be able to integrate at least 32 payloads developed by 24 manufacturers, some in a matter of days or months rather than years as previous programs experienced. Conversely, none of the Army or Air Force UAS programs initially implemented an open systems approach, relying instead on prime contractors to upgrade and modernize the UAS. The Army is now developing an open ground control station for each of its three legacy UAS programs. Only one of the Air Force's three UAS programs plans to implement an open systems approach on fielded aircraft.", "Policies and leadership can help drive DOD's acquisition community to use an open systems approach, but challenges exist. Although DOD and the services have policies that direct programs to use an open systems approach, the Navy is the only service that largely followed the policy when developing its UAS. In addition, while new open systems guidance, tools, and training are being developed, DOD is not tracking the extent to which programs are implementing this approach or if programs have the requisite expertise to implement the approach. Navy UAS program officials told us they relied on technical experts within Naval Air Systems Command to help develop an open systems approach for their programs.

Given the current fiscal environment, budgetary constraints are adding  pressure on DOD to look for ways to reduce life-cycle costs for its  capabilities. Traditionally, DOD has acquired proprietary systems that limit  opportunities for competition and cannot readily be upgraded because the  government is locked into the original suppliers. Acquisition of proprietary  systems is costly and can impede interoperability and the reuse of  components among systems. Conversely, an open system, such as a  personal computer, that incorporates modular design and open standards  for key interfaces, can readily accept upgrades from a variety of suppliers  without redesign of the entire system, providing numerous cost, schedule,  and performance benefits. We previously reported, in 2003, that DOD  was not giving due consideration to acquiring open systems, known as an  open systems approach, for its weapon acquisition programs and that  implementation was limited.

An open system allows system components to  be added, removed, modified, replaced, or sustained by consumers or  different manufacturers in addition to the manufacturer that developed the  system. It also allows independent suppliers to build components that can  plug into the existing system through the open connections. Fundamental  elements of an open systems approach include: designing a system with modular components that isolate  functionality. This makes the system easier to develop, maintain, and  modify because components can be changed without majorly  impacting the remainder of the system. developing and using open, publicly-available standards for the key  interfaces, or connections, between the components. Interface  standards specify the physical, power, data, and/or other connections  between components. All interfaces in a system do not need to use  open standards for a system to be considered \u201copen,\u201d and it can be  costly and impractical to manage hundreds or thousands of interfaces  within a system. Rather, open standards should be identified at key  interfaces between the modules that are likely to change, may  frequently fail or need to be replaced, or are needed for  interoperability. obtaining data rights to interfaces when open standards are not  available. DOD describes the acquisition of technical data, such as  design drawings, specifications, and standards, as critical to enabling  the department opportunities for competition for modification and  sustainment of weapon systems throughout their life cycles.", "Many consumer products, including U.S. appliances and smartphones,  are considered to be open systems because they use widely-available  hardware and software standards at key interfaces. For example, U.S.  appliances are designed to use a particular wall socket standard, so that  they can plug into any power outlet without consumers needing to worry  about which brand product is compatible in their homes. Similarly,  headphone jacks use a common, open standard, which enables  consumers to purchase headphones made by different manufacturers,  and plug them into many types of devices, including their MP3 players,  cell phones, and stereos, which may be built by other manufacturers. In  addition, the AndroidTM operating system, used on smartphones, allows  individual software applications introduced by third-party developers to  connect to the Android operating system through an open software  interface. This allows customers to have a lot of choices and helps keep  prices low.", "Incorporating an open systems approach prior to the start of development  increases the likelihood that open systems considerations are included in  program requirements and inform a program\u2019s future competitive strategy,  which can significantly reduce upgrade and maintenance costs later.  Introducing this approach later in a program\u2019s life cycle, such as a  planned modification or upgrade, is more difficult, complex, and costly to  do as it may require significant modifications to an already-developed  system. Legacy DOD programs that we have reported on in the past did  not implement an open systems approach early and are now facing  difficult and costly system modifications later in their respective service  lives. The B-2 bomber and the C-130 aircraft are two examples:", "The Air Force is spending over $2 billion to upgrade the B-2 bomber\u2019s  communications, networking, and defensive management capabilities.

However, the  individual cockpits had been modified throughout years of  maintenance and differed from one another to such an extent that the  upgrades required custom-built hardware and software; less  expensive commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software could not  be used. Because of the various configurations, C-130 modernization  cost estimates increased from $4 billion to over $6 billion and the Air  Force significantly reduced the number of planes it planned to  modernize from 519 to 221 between fiscal years 2001 and 2011. The  Air Force terminated the program in its fiscal year 2013 budget  submission because of its escalating costs.", "DOD understands the efficiencies of open systems and has taken steps  to incorporate an open systems approach into its policy over the past two  decades. As far back as 1994, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition and Technology directed the use of an open systems  approach in the acquisition of weapon system electronics. That same  year, DOD established an Open Systems Joint Task Force to oversee the  military services\u2019 transition to open systems and coordinate open  systems-related efforts, such as training and standards development. The  task force developed several tools to aid program managers with this  approach, but was later disbanded. In 1998, the Defense Science Board  cited pockets of success in leveraging open systems, but noted that DOD  lacked a unifying concept and required a reconfiguration of management  processes and aggressive leadership to facilitate open systems  implementation. This concern was addressed in DOD\u2019s 2000 acquisition  directive and in its most recent update in 2003, which states that \u201ca  modular, open systems approach shall be employed, where feasible.\u201dDOD\u2019s 2008 acquisition instruction also provides that \u201cprogram managers  shall employ a modular open systems approach to design for affordable  change, enable evolutionary acquisition, and rapidly field affordable  systems that are interoperable.\u201d", "Recently, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics has placed renewed emphasis on an open systems  approach as part of the 2010 and 2012 Better Buying Power initiatives to  increase efficiency in defense spending through effective competition.

To get the most from open systems, the approach is best  implemented at the start of product design because this is where initial  modularity, key interface, and data ownership decisions are made and  would result in costly redesign if implemented later. Open systems have  been successfully used by commercial companies, such as those in the  personal computer and software markets, and has helped customers  avoid sole source prices and manufacturers address obsolescence and  diminishing resource issues. DOD has also used open systems to some  extent and reports that open systems have resulted in cost and schedule  efficiencies in the development and upgrade of some of its acquisition  programs.", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  Memorandum: \u201cBetter Buying Power: Guidance for Obtaining Greater Efficiency and  Productivity in Defense Spending\u201d (Sept. 14, 2010).

In addition, the capability to accept  plug-in components results in reduced development time and costs for  manufacturers because parts are easier to integrate. Furthermore,  upgrades and repairs take less time and are less costly for consumers.  Finally, when different products adhere to the same standards, an open  system design enhances interoperability among products.", "An open systems approach can also spur industry growth and  entrepreneurial creativity, transforming an industry and offering benefits to  manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers. A prime example where this  has occurred is in the personal computer industry. In 1981, International  Business Machines (IBM) Corporation introduced its personal computer,  which was designed as an open system. IBM used already existing  components, including the monitor from another IBM computer, and  commercially-available off-the-shelf parts such as software, floppy drives,  and an Intel processor. Upon releasing the personal computer, IBM  openly published its hardware and software specifications, allowing other  manufacturers to develop compatible software and peripheral hardware,  such as the monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Figure 2 illustrates the  personal computer as an open system, made up of compatible  components that can be produced and integrated by different  manufacturers.", "Since the time IBM publicly released the specifications of its personal  computer, the market has grown exponentially in terms of manufacturers  developing computers and related devices such as printers and scanners,  third-party suppliers developing software applications that can be used on  the computers, and consumers purchasing computers, software, and  peripherals. Increased competition and technological innovation brought  on by the use of an open systems approach, among other things, has  helped make computers affordable to consumers. For example, according  to IBM, one of its predecessors to the personal computer sold for  $90,000; its first personal computer was sold in retail stores for $1,565.In the present marketplace, multiple computer manufacturers are  developing computers that have 500 times the processing power of IBM\u2019s  early personal computer and sell for as little as $400.", "The personal computer industry has evolved over the past three decades  to meet consumer demand and to leverage new technologies developed  by the large number of manufacturers and suppliers competing in the  marketplace. For example, in the mid-1990s, a group of companies,  including Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard, developed the Universal  Serial Bus (USB) interface standard to reduce the number of different  connectors, such as parallel and serial ports, that were required to allow  various components to work together. The USB standard is now widely  used in various devices beyond computer peripherals, including cell  phone chargers and music players. Other standards, such as the High- Definition Multimedia Interface have been developed to address the need  for standards for high-definition televisions and computer monitors.  Perhaps the biggest transformation in the computer industry has been the  Internet, with an estimated 2.7 billion users worldwide. communications technology is supported by open, non-proprietary  standards which allow consumers to have easy access to information on  a wide variety of topics, music, shopping opportunities, online banking,  friends, their workplace, and more.", "In 2013, the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency,  estimated that there are 2.7 billion worldwide Internet users. number of modernized submarines.

In 2010 the Navy reported $96 million in cost  avoidance since the upgrade program\u2019s inception in 2001.", "In addition, in 2008, Congress directed DOD to develop a strategy for  commonality and standardization in UAS ground control station  architecture. As part of a joint service/industry effort, the UAS Task  Force developed a common, open ground control station architecture,  called the UAS Control Segment (UCS), which can be integrated into any  UAS program\u2019s ground control station. The UCS architecture enables the  reuse of individual software applications across different types of ground  control stations, such as those for weather or vehicle status, thus  eliminating the need to redevelop the applications for each new ground  control station. The first version of the UCS architecture was released in  2010, and the ability to share software applications was first made  available to UAS programs in January 2013. OSD and service officials  point to several benefits from using UCS software. For example, one task  force official stated that a demonstration of the UCS architecture in 2010  showed that the average time to integrate 10 applications was less than 2  weeks; significantly shorter than the traditional integration time for a new  ground control station capability, which can be about 1 year. DOD also  estimates that competition for software applications can eliminate up to  90 percent of their cost.

Conversely, none of the Army or Air Force UAS programs  incorporated the approach from the start of development because,  according to Army and Air Force officials, legacy UAS programs tried to  take advantage of commercial off-the-shelf technology or began as  technology demonstration programs. Several of these programs (4 of 6)  are starting to incorporate the approach, primarily for the ground control  station of fielded aircraft during planned upgrades. For example, the Army  did not initially include an open systems approach for its three UAS  programs, but has since developed a universal ground control station with  open interfaces that each of its programs will use. None of the Air Force\u2019s  three UAS programs were initially developed as an open system, and  only one is being upgraded to include an open systems approach. Each  of the programs that have adopted an open systems approach expects to  achieve cost and schedule benefits, such as reduced upgrade costs and  quicker upgrade times.

The Fire  Scout program, which began in 2000, initially incorporated an open  systems approach for its ground control station and later included open  system elements in its air vehicle and payloads during an upgrade effort.  The Navy expects significant benefits in return, such as reduced  development and integration time and costs, as well as increased future  competition for new system payloads. Since these systems, for the most  part, either have not been fielded or have not begun development,  program officials were only able to provide us with estimates of potential  savings.", "The STUAS program, which started in 2010, made modularity a key  requirement for the system, as documented in its acquisition strategy and  systems engineering plan, and required the contractor to provide the  program office with rights to key interfaces in the development contract.  For example, the STUAS program owns the specifications for the data  link between the air vehicle and ground control station, as well as the  specifications for the payload interfaces. Officials noted that these  elements allow the program to compete contracts for both the air vehicle  and ground control station in the future for upgrades or to meet changing  requirements. In addition, program and contractor officials noted that by  having the rights and specifications to the payload interfaces, the program  will be able to integrate and test third-party designed payloads within a  matter of days or months, as opposed to years typically required to test  new system payloads. Program officials also anticipate that they will be  able to independently integrate at least 32 different payloads developed  by 24 different manufacturers.", "The Triton program, which started in 2008, developed an open systems  management plan and described in detail the steps it plans to take to  achieve an open system in its acquisition strategy and systems  engineering plan. The Triton includes both hardware and software  modularity, which gives the program the ability to integrate new payloads  and introduce software upgrades without affecting the rest of the system.  For example, officials noted that the system\u2019s camera is a separate  subsystem, which makes it easier to upgrade the capability individually,  and the flight control software is separated from the rest of the system\u2019s  software, resulting in less required testing when new capabilities are  added. Program officials estimated that software testing could be reduced  by as much as 66 percent compared to systems that do not have an open  system design, in part because the program does not have to test the  entire system when introducing new software or upgrades. In addition, the  program anticipates that the open system design will facilitate increased  competition among payload suppliers, which could result in lower prices  and better payload capabilities.", "The Navy is planning to use an open systems approach for its future  UCLASS program. The program has identified and designated key  system interfaces and according to program officials, it plans to require  contractors to use particular open standards, such as an open payload  interface for electro-optical/infrared sensors, which is expected to reduce  acquisition costs and simplify integration, as well as an open avionics  architecture. The Navy developed the architectures and provided them to  industry beginning in 2012. Officials developing the avionics architecture  estimated that development and integration costs for multiple platforms  using the avionics could be reduced significantly, as compared to using a  closed avionics architecture.", "The Fire Scout program included an open systems design for its original  ground control station when it began development in 2000, but the rest of  the system remained proprietary. However, when the program upgraded  from the MQ-8A to the MQ-8B air vehicle in 2004, it secured the data  rights to key system interfaces and introduced modularity into the air  vehicle and payloads. As a result of a new modular software design,  officials noted that payload data links are separated from the flight control  software and other mission systems, which is expected to cut the time  needed to test software and integrate a payload by about half.

Moreover, the Army\u2019s UAS ground  control stations limited interoperability and resulted in the Army paying for  ground control stations that provided similar capabilities. The Army  eventually developed a common ground control station for the three UAS;  however, the new station was still proprietary. All three of the Army\u2019s UAS  programs are now upgrading to a universal ground control station that  incorporates an open architecture to address obsolescence issues and  increase interoperability. According to Army program officials, ground  control stations require continuous hardware and software upgrades as  the technology becomes obsolete. Even though an open systems  approach is being incorporated later in the programs\u2019 life cycles, officials  believe the benefits\u2014reduced obsolescence issues, reduced upgrade  costs, and increased interoperability\u2014outweigh the costs.

For example, the Shadow program modified its air vehicle in  2008 to include a universal payload pod that allows any vendor that can  meet the standard power and data connections to design a payload to be  integrated onto the system. Program officials noted that, to date, four  third-party vendors have used the universal pod for their products.  Similarly, Gray Eagle program officials stated that the program owns the  data rights to all payload interface specifications, which allows third-party  vendors to develop a payload using these specifications.

However, as mentioned earlier, the Air Force  terminated the effort because of funding constraints, even though it plans  to use the aircraft through at least 2032 and the ground control station will  require upgrades and costly support during this time span. In addition, the  Air Force\u2019s Global Hawk and Predator and the Navy\u2019s STUAS do not plan  to adopt the recently developed UCS architecture at this time. The Global  Hawk had planned to incorporate UCS as part of its now cancelled  upgrade effort and Predator officials stated that the Air Force is not  investing in upgrades, including UCS.", "Further complicating the UCS architecture effort is the Air Force, which  developed a \u201ccomplementary\u201d ground control station architecture without  the involvement of the other services or OSD. The Air Force plans to use  both architectures on the Reaper system. Officials explained that they  developed the complementary architecture because the Air Force wanted  to be able to attain the capability faster. However, both architectures will  be fielded simultaneously on the Reaper and contractors developing UAS  ground control station software stated that adopting both architectures will  be more costly for DOD.", "To improve implementation of an open systems approach, DOD\u2019s 2010  Better Buying Power initiative now requires programs, at milestone B, to  outline an approach for using open systems architectures and acquiring  technical data rights to ensure sustained consideration of competition in  the acquisition of the weapon systems. The approach is to be based on a  business case analysis and engineering trade analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Leadership Lacks Visibility into Open Systems Implementation and Military Service Expertise", "paragraphs": ["DOD recognizes that it needs to increase its leadership efforts to  implement open systems for its weapon acquisition programs, but does  not know the extent to which programs are implementing this approach or  if the services have the requisite technical expertise. According to federal  internal control standards, agencies should monitor programs to ensure  that policies are being implemented, such as by establishing and tracking  program metrics, and also ensure that their workforce has the required  skills to implement policies. Thus, DOD should monitor open systems  implementation and also assess whether program offices have the  expertise to carry out the open systems policies. Various independent  standards experts, DOD contractors, and DOD systems engineering  officials identified DOD leadership as key to effective adoption of an open  systems approach. Several of these officials cautioned that prime  contractors may be resistant to providing open systems because they are  able to achieve greater financial benefits by selling DOD proprietary  products, which they alone can integrate, upgrade, and maintain.  Specifically, these officials believe that successful implementation of an  open systems approach requires that DOD provide clear and consistent  direction for its approach and that programs plan for an open systems  approach prior to the start of development. This includes defining the  open systems approach in a program\u2019s technology development and  acquisition strategies prior to initiating the technology development phase  at milestone A and the start of engineering and manufacturing  development at milestone B in DOD\u2019s acquisition process, respectively.  Further, they believe that contracts and requests for proposal should  include appropriate language that describes the open systems  architecture, defines open standards, and establishes requirements for  control documents to ensure the government retains rights for the  identified key interfaces.", "Acquiring a new weapon system using an open systems approach could  be more expensive at the beginning, particularly regarding ownership of  data rights. Yet, the potential benefits of obtaining the data rights, in terms  of greater competition and reduced upgrade and repair costs, are widely  believed to significantly outweigh the costs, especially if done from the  start of development. DOD could avoid purchasing data rights if it works  with industry to develop standards. However, in these cases, standards  organizations\u2019 officials we spoke with said that DOD would have to work  with standards organizations several years in advance to ensure that the  standards are available at the start of development.", "The Better Buying Power initiative for open systems is one of DOD\u2019s  efforts to increase competition and drive efficiency in acquisitions. While  competition is difficult to do at the system level because there are a  limited number of prime contractors that develop DOD weapon systems,  an open systems approach can boost opportunities for competition at the  subsystem level. As part of the Better Buying Power initiatives, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics formed an  Open Systems Architecture Data Rights Team co-led by the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (SE) and  the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development,  Test and Evaluation.", "The team is developing guidance, tools, and training in an effort to gain  more momentum for the use of an open systems approach and the  acquisition of appropriate data rights across DOD. This includes a  contract guidebook to be issued in the summer of 2013 intended to assist  program managers in incorporating open systems principles into their  acquisition programs. Officials from two of the UAS programs we  reviewed, UCLASS and Triton, told us they had used a draft version of  this guidebook to help inform their contracting strategies. The team also  updated the systems engineering guidance in the Defense Acquisition  Guidebook to recommend that program managers update their  technology development strategy, acquisition strategy, and systems  engineering plan throughout their program\u2019s life cycle to reflect their  respective open systems strategies. Finally, the team is leveraging other  resources previously developed by the Open Systems Joint Task Force,  such as an analytical tool for programs to monitor and evaluate their open  systems implementation and a program manager\u2019s guide intended to  assist program offices in integrating an open systems approach into their  acquisition strategies for new and legacy systems. According to officials  from the Open Systems Architecture Data Rights Team, the team is  required to report to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics on its progress in meeting initiatives related to  Better Buying Power by October 2013, but that reporting has not yet  begun.", "The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering  indicated that several new programs are incorporating an open systems  approach during early planning. For example, the Navy\u2019s Next Generation  Jammer included open systems language in its 2012 request for  proposal. Additionally, the Army\u2019s Ground Combat Vehicle program and  the Air Force\u2019s Space Fence program both considered open systems as  part of their future design prior to or during technology development.  However, it is unclear the extent to which programs are adopting an open  systems approach across the department because this information is not  being tracked.", "In addition, it is unclear whether the services have sufficient technical  expertise to implement an open systems approach and enable DOD to be  a savvy buyer of weapon systems. Program offices need open systems  expertise to conduct systems engineering activities, even before a  contract is awarded, to be able to determine how an open systems  strategy fits into program requirements; identify which system interfaces  are key to maintaining competitive opportunities; ensure sufficient data  rights are obtained to support the competitive strategy; translate open  system requirements into contracts; address any risks associated with the  open systems approach; and finally, validate that the contractor is  providing the open system that the program required. However, officials  from 11 offices/companies we spoke with, including a DOD contractor;  the UAS Task Force; 6 of 10 Air Force, Army, and Navy UAS programs;  the Naval Air Systems Command technical experts; the DOD Open  Systems Architecture Data Rights Team; and an open systems expert  who consulted with DOD on an open systems approach, stressed that  DOD does not have adequate expertise across the department to  effectively implement an open systems approach.", "The Defense Acquisition University (DAU), the organization responsible  for training the acquisition workforce DOD-wide, offers training on open  systems as part of its core acquisition curriculum required for both  engineers and program managers. However, officials from every program  we talked to who had taken this training told us that the training is only  sufficient to familiarize participants with the concept of open systems, but  not in-depth enough to allow participants to implement the approach.  DAU is developing additional training resources in support of open  systems to be rolled out beginning fall 2013. This new training, according  to a DAU official, will be geared toward providing program managers and  data management personnel information on data rights. Open systems  will be discussed, but primarily to give the participants awareness of the  approach. There are currently no plans for new in-depth training focused  on an open systems approach. Some of the material may be added to the  core acquisition curriculum, but officials said this transition can take  years.", "As required by the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering is  responsible for reviewing the systems engineering capabilities of the  military departments and identifying areas that require changes or  improvements. To meet this statutory requirement, SE requests that the  Air Force, Army, and Navy submit a self-assessment of their systems  engineering capabilities, which SE reviews to identify needed changes or  improvements to the services\u2019 capabilities. SE conducts this review  annually and publishes its findings in annual reports to Congress, most  recently in March 2013. However, the services have not provided an  analysis of their open systems capabilities as part of their self- assessments. Therefore, the Deputy Assistant Secretary cannot be sure  that program offices have adequate systems engineering resources to  effectively implement an open systems approach.", "The Naval Air Systems Command has a small group of open systems  technical experts that its acquisition programs can use when developing  their open systems approach. Officials from the UCLASS, STUAS, and  Triton programs said they relied on experts from this team to assist them  in planning and executing their open systems approach, including  developing a request for proposal, selecting open standards, and  responding to contractor bids.

Based on  projections from several Navy UAS programs, for example, the Navy  could avoid considerable repair and upgrade costs on individual  programs, as well as improve performance, by incorporating an open  systems approach on programs prior to the start of development. This is  because multiple suppliers can compete to quickly replace key  components on the UAS with more capable components. Traditionally,  DOD has acquired proprietary weapon systems that limit these  opportunities and make these systems more costly to develop, procure,  upgrade, and support. DOD has cited a preference for acquiring open  systems in its policy since 1994 and each of the services have since  issued open systems policies. Yet, we found the Army and Air Force have  been slow to make their UAS open systems, particularly from the start of  development. The Navy, on the other hand, has generally designed its  UAS to be open from the start of development where it can reap the most  benefits.", "To successfully change the services\u2019 inclination toward buying proprietary  systems and shift towards the acquisition of open systems, DOD needs to  address policy and leadership challenges. Moving to open systems  requires strong leadership to overcome preferences for acquiring  proprietary systems. While DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative requires  programs to outline an approach for using open systems architectures at  milestone B, OSD does not have adequate insight of the extent to which  an open systems approach is being used by individual weapon  acquisition programs. Further, OSD does not know if program offices  have the systems engineering expertise required for effective  implementation of an open systems approach or if additional expertise is  needed. Without adequate knowledge of policy implementation and  program office expertise, DOD cannot have reasonable assurance that an  open systems approach is being implemented effectively by the services.  Until DOD takes action to overcome these challenges, the department will  likely continue to invest in costly proprietary systems. These steps should  increase DOD\u2019s ability to promote more competition, save taxpayer  dollars, and more quickly field new capabilities to the warfighter,  particularly if an open systems approach is incorporated into program  strategies prior to the start of development at milestone B."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making four recommendations to improve the department\u2019s  implementation of an open systems approach for UAS and other weapon  acquisition programs, as well as its visibility of open systems  implementation and program office expertise.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretaries  of the Air Force and Army to implement their open systems policies by  including an open systems approach in their acquisition strategies.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to  define appropriate metrics to track programs\u2019 implementation of an  open systems approach.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretaries  of the Air Force, Army, and Navy to take the following actions:  require their acquisition programs to include open systems metrics  developed by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics in their systems engineering plans, track  progress in meeting these metrics, and report their progress to the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  at key acquisition milestones; and assess their respective service-level and program office capabilities  relating to an open systems approach and work with the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering to develop  short-term and long-term strategies to address any capability gaps  identified.

DOD  partially concurred with all four recommendations. DOD\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix II.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation, agreeing on the  value of implementing an open systems approach, but citing existing  department policies and guidance which it believes are sufficient for the  military departments to implement open systems architecture in  acquisition programs. DOD also noted in its comments that the decision  to implement an open systems approach in a particular program\u2019s  acquisition strategy is made on a case-by-case basis based on a number  of considerations to include mission, threat, vulnerability assessment,  operating environment, and business case. We agree that an open  systems approach should be informed by these considerations, and we  also cited both OSD and service-level policies and guidance governing an  open systems approach in our report. However, a number of Air Force  and Army unmanned aircraft programs missed opportunities to adopt an  open systems approach early in their life cycles, but did try to do so later  on when it becomes more costly and complex. Navy programs fared  better partly because they augmented policy by addressing the open  systems approach in individual acquisition strategies. We maintain that  the Air Force and Army would benefit by including an open systems  approach in their acquisition strategies before the start of system  development.", "DOD partially concurred with our second and third recommendations.  DOD noted that program implementation of an open systems approach  should be assessed through its existing milestone decision process. DOD  further noted that acquisition strategies and systems engineering plans,  which document a program\u2019s open systems strategy, are assessed at  multiple decision reviews and are considered by the milestone decision  authority in the overall context of the program. We agree that the  milestone decision process is the appropriate venue to review programs\u2019  open systems strategies. However, as discussed in our report, we found  that OSD does not have adequate insight of the extent to which an open  systems approach is being used by weapon acquisition programs and  thus cannot have reasonable assurance of the widespread use of an  open systems approach across the department. Based on our review of  unmanned aircraft programs, we found that the Navy had generally  embraced an open systems approach for its acquisition programs before  the start of development, whereas the Air Force and Army had not.  Further, it is unclear the extent to which the Air Force and Army will adopt  the approach for its programs as DOD\u2019s recent Better Buying Power  initiative requires. To provide clearer insight into whether the services are  planning for and implementing an open systems approach, we maintain  that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics should establish metrics and track weapon acquisition  programs\u2019 progress in meeting them at key milestones. For example, this  could include tracking whether programs are including open systems in  their acquisition strategy documents prior to milestone B and are following  through on those plans at subsequent acquisition milestones.", "DOD partially concurred with our fourth recommendation but did not  explain its position or what, if anything, it would do in response. DOD did  not comment on whether the military services and their program offices  have sufficient capabilities with respect to open systems. As we  discussed in our report, we found that OSD does not know if program  offices have the systems engineering expertise required for effective  implementation of an open systems approach or if additional expertise is  needed. To address this possible gap, we continue to believe that the Air  Force, Army, and Navy should assess their respective service-level and  program office capabilities relating to an open systems approach and  work with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems  Engineering to develop short-term and long-term strategies to address  any capability gaps identified.

We interviewed officials from four standards organizations  that we selected based on our literature search: the Aerospace Industries  Association, the Peripheral Component Interconnect Industrial Computer  Manufacturers Group, SAE International, and the Universal Serial Bus  Implementers Forum. These organizations have responsibility for  developing open standards for their respective industries, and their  experience is commensurate with the age of their industries. For  example, the Universal Serial Bus Implementers Forum has existed for  almost 20 years, and SAE International has existed for over 100 years.
