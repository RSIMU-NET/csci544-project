Retail alternatives offer service in more locations and for longer hours, enhancing convenience for many customers, but certain characteristics of these alternatives could be problematic for others. For example, services obtained from some alternatives cost more because of additional fees, which could deter use by price-sensitive customers. Furthermore, although about $5 billion of its $18 billion in fiscal year 2010 retail revenue came from alternatives, USPS officials said it is too early to realize related cost savings. USPS also lacks the performance measures and data needed to show how alternatives have affected its financial performance. A data-driven plan to guide its retail network restructuring could provide a clear path for achieving goals. Without such a plan, USPS may miss opportunities to achieve cost savings and identify which alternatives hold the most promise. USPS has sought to raise customers' awareness by developing media campaigns, enhancing its online tools for locating postal access points, and creating standard symbols for post offices and retail alternatives to show which products and services they offer. However, USPS has not assessed whether its message is reaching its customers, such as by using one of its existing customer surveys, and therefore does not know to what extent customers are aware of and willing to use its various retail alternatives. Although the public increasingly uses postal retail alternatives, more widespread adoption will be needed if USPS is to close thousands of post offices as planned in the next few years. USPS has projected that by 2020 alternatives to post offices will account for 60 percent of its retail revenue. USPS's oversight of its retail partners, which includes entering into written agreements with them and providing training and guidance, could be improved if USPS modified its approach to monitoring compliance with its procedures. Local USPS officials are supposed to conduct quarterly reviews of retail partners to make sure they are following mailing procedures, but according to retail partners and USPS officials in field and local offices, these reviews do not always occur as often as intended because of resource constraints. A risk-based monitoring approach would allow targeting limited USPS oversight resources to areas of concern and thus address issues that could otherwise discourage customers from adopting retail alternatives, such as inadequate service. USPS should develop a plan to guide its retail network restructuring that is supported by relevant performance measures and data and includes a method to assess the effectiveness of its public communication strategy. USPS should also implement a risk-based approach to monitoring retail partners. USPS reviewed a draft of this report and stated it is developing a plan to guide its retail network restructuring and agreed to review how it monitors retail partners."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is on the brink of financial insolvency as  it faces a continuing decline in the overall demand for its products and  services.

USPS stated that its effort to expand access  through retail alternatives supports two of its agencywide strategic goals:  (1) to improve service by offering its products and services in more  convenient places where customers already work, live, and shop; and (2)  to improve financial performance by growing revenue and offering  services through alternatives at a lower cost than at post offices.", "Because of its dire financial condition, USPS is on our list of high-risk  agencies and programs, and we continue to examine USPS\u2019s  management, operations, and business model to identify actions needed  to make USPS a sustainable enterprise.

However, USPS has not adopted a specific standard for  universal service and has declined to create one. This makes it difficult  to determine to what extent the differences in cost, access requirements,  and closure procedures previously discussed could affect USPS\u2019s ability  to meet its universal service mandate as it modernizes its retail network to  rely more on retail alternatives and less on post offices. Such ambiguity  will add to the challenge of defining an appropriate level of access under  a modernized network, such as determining the optimal mix of retail  alternatives and post offices USPS needs to effectively serve customers  from varying socioeconomic and population demographics.", "Other countries that have modernized their postal retail networks to  include more partner-owned and -operated facilities developed criteria for  providing a minimum level of service to guide their restructuring efforts.  Such standards can include different requirements for serving areas of  higher and lower population density.

Canada and Germany also set standards for determining appropriate  geographic coverage of retail access points. Having criteria for assessing  whether changes to its retail network conform with its requirements to  provide universal service could help USPS determine the most cost- effective placement of retail access points\u2014whether through post offices  or alternatives. Such criteria could change over time to adapt to changing  customer needs.

Specifically, using fiscal year 2008 data, USPS contractors estimated that  USPS incurred $0.23 to $0.39 in cost for each dollar in sales at post  offices, while for retail alternatives, USPS estimated its costs per dollar of  revenue ranged from $0.02 to $0.13. In assessing the success of retail  alternatives in providing cost savings, USPS officials repeatedly pointed  to the cost per revenue dollar estimates; however, these estimates do not  represent actual cost savings, and we identified several limitations with  these estimates as a measure of financial performance:", "The 2008 cost-per-revenue-dollar estimates are a snapshot of costs  and not a model that projects future costs as inputs or external  conditions change.

For example, as USPS adds more retail alternatives,  such as CPUs or Approved Shipper locations, the cost of providing  additional oversight may be comparatively less, since USPS has  already invested resources necessary for training postmasters or  managers to oversee the initial units. Moreover, the declining demand  for postal products and services could also significantly change the  cost per revenue dollar estimates. If revenue declines, as has been  the case for some retail alternatives, absent reductions in costs, the  cost per revenue dollar would increase.", "More recent expenses, such as for redesigning USPS\u2019s Web site or  reviewing the performance of Approved Shippers, were not factored  into the 2008 cost estimates and could conceivably change the  estimates.", "Consequently, the 2008 cost-per-revenue-dollar estimates do not provide  a complete picture of cost savings realized or expected from  implementing retail alternatives. According to USPS, the estimates are  being updated with fiscal year 2009 and 2010 data using a similar  methodology and include changes intended to improve their accuracy. As  of October 2011, USPS had not completed this update.", "USPS officials said they were unable to provide any details about actual  cost savings resulting from their efforts to expand retail alternatives  because wider adoption of retail alternatives is needed before USPS can  realize cost savings by reducing staff at specific post offices. Officials  responsible for oversight of retail partnerships told us that although they  track the cost of their programs, they have not determined metrics for  identifying cost savings, and need better cost data analysis to make  effective program decisions. Furthermore, USPS officials told us their cost  data systems were designed more for providing information in  determining pricing of postal products than for analyzing costs of specific  program areas. USPS did, however, estimate in 2003 that implementing  self-service kiosks would save an average of $110 million annually in  labor costs from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2009, but USPS has  not assessed whether such cost savings were achieved. USPS officials  in headquarters and field offices told us that they can track changes in  staffing at post offices that can result in cost savings, but cannot  determine whether such changes are the result of customer shifts to retail  alternatives or declines in demand for other reasons.", "USPS has stated that it will realize cost savings as it closes redundant  and underutilized post offices in response to decreased demand and  customers shifting to retail alternatives.

As part of  USPS\u2019s review begun in July 2011, USPS said that post offices that could  potentially close are those that have insufficient demand and available  alternative access. Also, in July 2011, USPS launched a new retail  partnership initiative, the Village Post Office, which directly ties retail  alternatives to USPS\u2019s ability to cut costs. USPS described the Village  Post Office as a replacement option for some communities where  underutilized yet costly post offices may close. With Village Post Office,  USPS intends to partner with existing small businesses to provide a  limited array of postal products and services to the local community,  including mail collection boxes, post office boxes, stamps, and flat-rate  shipping and mailing products. USPS launched its first Village Post Office  in the town of Malone, Washington, in the summer of 2011, and USPS  officials said they expect to open several thousand similar outlets by the  summer of 2012. Our past work has shown that replacing postal-owned  and -operated facilities with privately owned and operated facilities is a  strategy some foreign posts, such as those in Australia, Germany,  Finland, and Sweden, have used to restructure their retail networks in  order to contain facility and labor costs.

Without feedback from such  groups, the agency cannot know whether its communication strategies  are building the awareness and support needed to achieve its goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USPS Has Taken Steps to Increase Public Awareness of Retail Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["USPS has included actions to inform the public about retail alternatives in  its retail communications strategies and has recently launched  communications efforts aimed specifically at increasing awareness of  retail alternatives. In developing its public communications, USPS  conducted focus groups to identify messages that would resonate with  customers. USPS\u2019s actions under these strategies include the following:", "As previously discussed, in July 2011, USPS launched the Village  Post Office initiative to partner with small businesses to offer a limited  array of postal products and services in areas where USPS may close  underutilized post offices.", "In May 2011, USPS launched a communications campaign to  promote the availability of its services at post offices and retail  alternatives. This campaign uses the slogan \u201cwe\u2019re everywhere so  you can be anywhere\u201d to communicate the availability of USPS  products and services at locations other than post offices.", "Also in May 2011, USPS released an initial version of a new online  tool customers can use to find post offices and retail partners,  including Approved Shippers, which have generally received less  promotion from USPS than other alternatives. USPS planned to  release additional improvements to its online locator as part of the  usps.com redesign.", "In 2010, to improve the public\u2019s awareness of USPS services at  multiple retail points, USPS created a set of icons that post offices  and retail partners can display to show specific products and services  available at a particular location (see fig. 7). A full-service post office  would have most or all of these products and services, while retail  partners like CPUs and Approved Shippers, would have fewer, such  as only stamps, mailing, and shipping options.", "In May 2011, USPS developed its plan for communicating the redesign of  usps.com. This plan focuses on the benefits customers may expect from  the new features that will be deployed with each of the project\u2019s phases.  The plan called for USPS to use multiple methods to communicate with  external stakeholders, including the public, such as press releases, e-mail  to its business partners, and external publications. Key goals of the plan  were to ensure that the Web site\u2019s current customers were aware of the  launch of the new site and to help them understand the benefits of the  transition and work to build interest among other customers for the new  site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measures of Effectiveness Could Help Strengthen USPS\u2019s Communications Strategy", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, some customers may be more likely to obtain  postal services at post offices than through retail alternatives, because of  certain characteristics that may make alternatives problematic for them.  We have previously reported that USPS needs to clearly communicate to  the public how its plans to optimize its retail network will affect customers,  particularly those in rural areas. We continue to believe this is important,  especially in light of the changes that USPS is undertaking to close post  offices and replace some of them with retail partners, a process that  includes consideration of whether sufficient retail alternatives are  available. According to a senior USPS official responsible for  advertising, USPS used to measure changes in public awareness by  conducting surveys before and after major advertising campaigns, but is  no longer doing so. Although financial constraints may preclude USPS  from introducing new customer feedback tools, it could potentially use  existing tools to gauge public awareness of retail alternatives. USPS  currently surveys residential and business customers about their  experiences with USPS products and services, including their views on  the convenience and customer service of post offices. The household  diary study USPS conducts annually to assess customers\u2019 use of the mail  is another such tool. Either of these options could serve as a platform for  obtaining feedback on how aware customers are of retail alternatives and  whether they are meeting customers\u2019 needs.", "Feedback about customers\u2019 awareness and use of retail alternatives can  help USPS be sure its message is reaching its intended audience. For  USPS, as for the foreign posts we reviewed recently, having an effective  communications strategy is an important way to mitigate resistance to  modernizing a postal retail network. For example, Sweden\u2019s postal  service, Posten AB, developed a comprehensive public communications  campaign to inform its stakeholders of how it was transforming its retail  network, an effort begun in 2001. This campaign was intended to help  change the perception of \u201cthe post as a place\u201d to \u201cthe post as a service.\u201d  Posten AB officials told us they made efforts to show customers and other  stakeholders that although retail facilities owned and operated by the post  were closing, the new retail partnerships offered more access points and  made postal products and services more convenient to obtain. Swedish  postal officials told us that the public was initially resistant to the sweeping  changes to the nation\u2019s postal infrastructure, but ultimately accepted  them. As of 2009, Sweden has transformed its retail network to be 88  percent owned and operated by retail partners. According to the officials,  their public communications campaign was central to the post\u2019s  successful transformation of its retail network. Similarly, three of the five  other foreign posts we examined maintained a retail network with a  majority of partner-owned and -operated facilities rather than their own  traditional post offices. That about a third of USPS\u2019s retail revenue now  comes from alternatives to post offices shows the public has started to  accept and use retail alternatives. As previously discussed, USPS  announced this year it is studying several thousand post offices for  potential closure and intends to close up to 15,000 post offices by 2015. If  USPS closes these post offices as planned, it will be increasingly  important for it to effectively encourage widespread adoption of retail  alternatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USPS Takes Steps to Help Ensure Retail Partners Follow Procedures, but Could Improve Oversight", "paragraphs": ["As USPS has expanded its use of retail partners, it has taken steps to  help ensure that such third-party retailers offer products and services in  accordance with its procedures.

According to USPS guidance and officials,  USPS provides new CPU operators with initial classroom and on-the-job  training, which covers topics such as customer service, product  knowledge, and equipment use. USPS may provide additional training to  CPUs to cover changes in its products and services. Approved Shippers  do not generally receive in-person training from USPS, but do receive  training materials such as a guide to postal products, and Office Depot  employees receive employer-provided training on USPS services. USPS  provides additional updates to retail partners through its field offices, and  retail partners can call local USPS offices if they have questions. Most  CPU operators we met with during our site visits raised no concerns  about their training; however, operators at two CPUs told us they would  like refresher training. Additionally, one CPU operator in Northern Virginia  told us it would be useful to have more communication from USPS about  the CPU\u2019s performance. Furthermore, according to a national association  of CPUs, some CPUs have had trouble identifying an appropriate point of  contact at USPS because of staffing changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["USPS\u2019s guidance for overseeing CPUs states that local USPS officials  are required to monitor the performance of CPUs on a quarterly basis  through on-site reviews of their operations and compliance with policies.  According to USPS officials, similar reviews have also been required of  Approved Shippers since fiscal year 2009; however, we do not know what  these reviews cover since USPS did not provide us guidance for these  reviews that we requested.", "As we observed during our site visits, reviews of retail partner sites do not  always occur quarterly as USPS intends. CPU operators in two of the  four districts we visited told us that such reviews were happening either  less frequently than required or not at all. Furthermore, none of the  Approved Shippers we visited told us they had been visited by USPS staff  conducting a quarterly review. Cuts in USPS\u2019s management-level  staffing may contribute to lapses in oversight of retail partners. According  to USPS headquarters officials, no staff in field offices or post offices are  solely responsible for oversight of retail alternatives and personnel with  such responsibility must balance their oversight duties with other  responsibilities. Reductions in USPS staffing have led to the elimination  or consolidation of management roles that provide oversight of retail  partners, such as field managers who oversee USPS retail operations in  several districts. USPS officials in one district told us that, although they  were required to conduct such visits with Approved Shippers, they were  not doing so. According to these officials, the quality of monitoring of retail  partners had suffered because recent USPS staffing cuts had  consolidated administrative duties for responsible post office employees.", "We have previously reported that a risk-based approach to oversight can  help agencies effectively target constrained resources to better address  potential problem areas. Such an approach could help USPS identify  which retail partners should be monitored more closely and would give  managers flexibility to conduct reviews more or less frequently as  warranted by available resources and assessments of risks. USPS  already collects data on retailers\u2019 revenue, complaints from customers,  and results of monitoring reviews, which could be suitable for determining  a retailer\u2019s relative level of risk and an appropriate method and frequency  of monitoring. USPS could then make better use of its management  resources, particularly during a time when such resources are being cut  back. Effective monitoring of retail partners is important because it can  identify bad operators whose actions could potentially undermine USPS\u2019s  efforts to encourage the adoption of retail alternatives. Stakeholder  organizations representing USPS postmasters, a major postal union, and  consumers expressed concerns about the potential for retail partners to  be inadequately trained in how they provide postal services, which could  harm USPS\u2019s image, increase the potential for fraud, and frustrate  customers. If retailers offering USPS products and services provide  inadequate service, customers may be unwilling to adopt retail  alternatives for their postal needs, hampering USPS\u2019s efforts to increase  their use. For example, during our site visit to USPS\u2019s Houston district,  officials told us about a CPU that was poorly managed, leading to  customer complaints and decreased revenue. Eventually the CPU  improved after its management was replaced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USPS has acknowledged that to improve its financial condition, it needs  to make changes to its operations, including modernizing its retail network  to more cost-effectively serve customers through the use of retail  alternatives. USPS now offers mailing and shipping products through  thousands of retailers and stamps through tens of thousands of locations.  Further network restructuring must occur quickly if USPS is to address its  financial difficulties, and USPS has announced plans to study 15,000 post  offices for potential closure by 2015. Expanding access through retail  alternatives needs to be an integral part of this effort, but USPS has still  not developed a plan to clearly outline its vision for what a modern retail  network will look like, including how retail alternatives will help maximize  cost savings and preserve customer access to a degree sufficient for  meeting USPS\u2019s universal service mandate. A plan could facilitate  realizing the cost savings USPS expects to achieve by expanding retail  alternatives, but its costs could increase if it expands access without  concurrently making cost-saving cuts in its expensive network of 32,000  post offices. Furthermore, effective progress measures and the data to  support such measures would help USPS and key stakeholders  determine whether efforts to expand access are improving its service and  financial performance as intended.", "No amount of planning or oversight will ensure the success of providing  postal services through retail alternatives if the public does not use them.  Clear communication about USPS\u2019s plans for providing access to postal  services, even if it creates short-term resistance, will more likely create  long-term acceptance if the public knows why, where, and how it may  access postal services through alternatives, particularly as post offices  close. Although USPS has strategies for communicating with the public  about retail alternatives, it lacks methods of assessing whether its  message is both reaching its intended audience and having the intended  effect. USPS expects that, by 2020, retail alternatives will replace post  offices as the principal means of access for its retail products and  services\u2014an outcome dependent on the public\u2019s growing awareness,  acceptance, and use of the alternatives.", "Since USPS expects to continue expanding its use of third-party retailers  to provide postal services, it will need to have the resources necessary for  effective monitoring of those third parties to help ensure they follow USPS  procedures and provide quality service. On the basis of our site visits, we  found that quarterly reviews of such retail partners are not occurring as  required. And because the risk associated with any particular retailer may  vary, a risk-based oversight approach could help USPS direct its  resources toward those retailers that require more oversight. Factors that  inform risk could include volume of sales, incidence of customer  complaints, or prior performance history.

We reviewed internal control  standards and our prior reports to identify appropriate criteria for  assessing aspects of how USPS manages its efforts to provide access  through retail alternatives. We also visited four USPS districts to see how  retail alternatives are being implemented at the local level. Specifically,  we visited USPS district offices, post offices, contract postal units (CPU),  and Approved Shippers in Detroit Lakes and Richwood, Minnesota, and  Fargo, North Dakota (Dakotas District); Conroe and Katy, Texas (Houston  District); Arlington and Winchester, Virginia (Northern Virginia District);  and Miami and Stuart, Florida (South Florida District). We selected the  Dakotas, Houston, and South Florida districts because for fiscal years  2009 and 2010 their revenue from retail alternatives, growth in alternative  revenue, and percentage of retail revenue from alternatives were higher  than average. We chose the specific locations we visited to include a  more urban and a moral rural location in each district based on 2000  census data; locations where there were generally CPUs, Approved  Shippers, and self-service kiosks present; and locations with higher than  average revenue. We also interviewed USPS partners, contractors, and  representatives of key groups of affected by USPS retail efforts to obtain  their views on USPS\u2019s efforts to provide access through retail alternatives  (see table 1). We identified these stakeholders through reviews of USPS  regulatory proceedings and prior GAO and USPS Inspector General  reports and recommendations from other stakeholders and experts.", "To determine how USPS\u2019s efforts to expand retail access support its  strategic goals of improving service and financial performance, we  reviewed USPS\u2019s strategic planning documents to identify how efforts to  expand retail alternatives are linked to its strategic goals and what the  related performance measures are. We also reviewed USPS\u2019s  requirements under the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993 and prior GAO reports on strategic planning to achieve agency  goals. We identified differences in services provided through retail  alternatives and post offices using information obtained from USPS  officials, site visits, and our examination of usps.com. To assess USPS\u2019s  plans to redesign its retail Web site, we reviewed literature on best  practices for retail Web site design.", "We analyzed available USPS data on revenue from retail alternatives for  fiscal years 2006 through 2010 to identify trends and permit comparisons  with revenue from post offices. USPS data on revenue from retail  alternatives comes from various USPS sources that maintain the data in  different ways and are therefore not comparable. Specifically, the data we  provide about overall retail revenue, as well as revenue from post offices  and retail alternatives in general, come from USPS\u2019s audited accounting  database, which contains revenue data that have been adjusted to  account for factors such as customer returns, lost inventory, and how  USPS counts revenue for stamps sold but not yet used. Because of  these adjustments, USPS officials said this data source is more accurate  for reporting overall retail revenue. In contrast, data on revenue from  specific alternatives comes from a variety of USPS data sources,  including databases of gross sales data that have not been reconciled in  the same manner as the accounting database. Neither source could  provide revenue data both overall and for specific retail alternatives, since  the accounting database does not break out revenue for all of the types of  alternatives we examined, and the sales database does not include  revenue from post offices and CPUs that do not report revenue through  an electronic point-of-sale transaction system. Furthermore, there is some  overlap in the revenue data from specific retail alternatives. This occurs  because some retail partners obtain the stamps they sell from USPS\u2019s  Stamps on Consignment program, which is counted as revenue under  that program, and then the partners report all postal sales, including  stamp sales, to USPS, thus creating the potential to double-count some  revenue when using the gross sales data.", "Further affecting our ability to complete planned analyses were  substantial delays in receiving responses to our requests for data from  USPS. For example, delays of several months precluded planned  analyses of trends in the number of specific types of alternative retail  outlets in different geographic areas, differences in the types of products  and services sold through different retail outlets, and trends in revenue for  the specific locations and districts we visited. According to USPS officials,  major staff restructuring that occurred while we were conducting our audit  made it difficult for USPS to respond in a timely manner. Consequently,  we scaled back our data analysis to focus on trends in revenue and the  number of locations for retail outlets overall and for the specific types of  retail alternatives that were the focus of our review.", "We assessed the reliability of each of the data sources we used by  interviewing USPS officials responsible for them or sending USPS  questionnaires to obtain written answers about its procedures for  maintaining the data and verifying their accuracy. After reviewing this  information, we determined that the revenue data for post offices,  usps.com, self-service kiosks, CPUs, Approved Shippers, stamp retailers,  retail alternatives in general, and retail services overall were sufficiently  reliable for presenting rounded figures of USPS revenue.", "Additionally, we obtained data from USPS officials about the number of  outlets for each type of retail alternative. Although we did not verify the  accuracy of these data, we believe they are sufficiently reliable to provide  context for the relative number of alternative outlets offering access to  USPS products and services. We reviewed USPS\u2019s estimates of the cost  per revenue dollar earned from retail alternatives and discussed the  methodology used for the estimates with USPS officials. We compared  those estimates to estimates of post office costs prepared by USPS  contractors, although we did not review the post office estimates in depth  because it was beyond the scope of this review.", "To determine how USPS communicates with customers about the  availability of its products and services at retail alternatives, we reviewed  USPS documents such as communications strategies and presentations  and interviewed USPS officials responsible for developing and  implementing public communications and advertising strategies for retail  alternatives.
