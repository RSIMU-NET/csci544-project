The act, which took effect on February 6, 1997, requires air carriers, before making final hiring decisions, to obtain information for the past 5 years on a pilot applicant's performance, qualifications, and training from the Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), employers, and the National Driver Register (NDR). The act also includes provisions to protect pilots' rights. FAA oversees compliance with the act and has broad responsibility for overseeing aviation safety. According to GAO's analyses of FAA and NDR databases and carriers' responses to GAO's surveys, compliance with the act has generally increased since it went into effect, but compliance is not always complete or timely. The available data are not adequate to determine industrywide compliance. According to their responses to GAO's surveys, carriers are not always aware of the act's requirements for protecting pilots' rights. FAA has taken limited steps to oversee compliance with PRIA. Under the act and its broad responsibility for aviation safety, FAA can issue implementing regulations, develop guidance, conduct inspections to monitor carriers' compliance, and initiate enforcement actions when it finds evidence of noncompliance. FAA has not issued regulations because it regards the act as self-implementing and believes that its regulatory resources should be reserved for higher agency priorities. Although FAA provided guidance for carriers, it was slow to update the guidance after the act was amended. Although they generally found records useful in making hiring decisions, carriers were divided in their opinions on whether the records were worth the cost. However, both groups of carriers found information from other sources, such as the job interview, the carrier's flight evaluation of the pilot, and the results of the carrier's training program, more helpful."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request, this report discusses the implementation of the Pilot Records  Improvement Act of 1996.

The National  Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated these crashes,  found that each of the pilots involved had been hired despite a poor  performance history, prior safety violations, or both. In each case, NTSB  reported, the carrier had lacked access to, or had failed to obtain, the pilot\u2019s  records with previous employers before hiring. Accordingly, on four  separate occasions between September 1988 and October 1995, NTSB  recommended that carriers obtain information from the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) and previous employers on a pilot\u2019s training,  performance, and safety history before hiring. NTSB later also  recommended that information about the pilot\u2019s driving record be checked  with the National Driver Register (NDR). In June 1988, we likewise  recommended, after surveying carriers\u2019 pilot-hiring practices, that FAA  encourage carriers to review a pilot\u2019s safety history before making a hiring  decision.", "On October 9, 1996, Congress enacted the Pilot Records Improvement Act  (PRIA) to help ensure that fatal crashes would not again occur because, in  part, carriers had not investigated the backgrounds of the pilots they hired.  The act, which took effect on February 6, 1997, requires that air carriers  conduct background checks on all pilot applicants. The vast majority of  commercial carriers carrying paying passengers or transporting cargo are  classified as air carriers because these carriers meet specific statutory  requirements that are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. These  carriers are, therefore, subject to the act. Besides requiring that carriers  obtain key records from FAA, past or current employers for whom the  applicant worked as a pilot, and NDR, PRIA includes provisions to protect  pilots\u2019 rights and to protect those furnishing records from liability for  providing the information.", "PRIA also gives FAA responsibility for overseeing compliance with the act,  by stating that FAA may prescribe regulations as necessary to ensure  compliance with the requesting and receiving of pilot records, protect the  personal privacy of anyone whose records are requested as well as the  confidentiality of those records, and preclude further dissemination of  those records by the person requesting them. Furthermore, as the agency  responsible for aviation safety, FAA has a broader responsibility to promote  the safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations  and minimum standards for the aviation industry. To carry out this  responsibility, FAA issues regulations and develops guidance. FAA also  performs inspections to ensure compliance with federal statutes and  regulations and has the authority to take enforcement actions against  violators. Specifically, FAA regulates and monitors the safety of air  transportation and air commerce through its safety programs, which  provide the initial certification, periodic surveillance, and inspection of  airlines, airports, repair stations, and other aviation entities, including  pilots. These inspections are intended to primarily detect actual violations  of statutes or regulations. When safety inspectors identify violations, FAA  guidance requires that such violations be investigated, appropriately  addressed, and reported.", "The Chairman and Ranking Democratic Member of the Subcommittee on  Aviation, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, asked us  to review the status of PRIA since its enactment in October 1996.  Specifically, they asked us to determine the following:  whether (1) hiring air carriers have complied with the act by requesting  and receiving key documents about pilot applicants before making final  hiring decisions and (2) FAA, NDR, and other carriers have complied  with the act by providing these documents in a timely manner;  whether air carriers are aware of PRIA\u2019s requirements for protecting   what FAA has done to oversee compliance with the act; and  whether air carriers believe PRIA has been helpful to them in making  pilot-hiring decisions and is worth the cost.", "Until recently, pilot hiring was expected to keep pace over the next decade  with projected growth in air traffic and anticipated pilot retirements. With  the economic downturn in 2001 and the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks, however, the demand for air travel declined. As a result of the  September 11 attacks, concerns about aviation safety and security are  likely to remain central, and pilot background checks, such as those  required by PRIA, may assume even greater importance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PRIA Requires Air Carriers to Conduct Background Checks on Pilot Job Applicants", "paragraphs": ["PRIA requires that air carriers conduct background checks on a pilot job  applicant.

An air carrier  subject to PRIA   is operated by a U.S. citizen who directly or indirectly provides air   provides interstate air transportation\u2014that is, transports passengers or  property across state lines by aircraft as a common carrier for  compensation, or transports mail by aircraft; and  operates as a common carrier\u2014that is, advertises to the public to carry  persons, property, or mail for hire.", "To operate as an air carrier, a carrier must have an air carrier certificate  issued by FAA under Part 119 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR). FAA issues a number of operating certificates under various parts of  the CFR. FAA may require an aviation operator to have several of these  certificates, depending on the number of passengers carried, the weight of  the aircraft, and whether the aircraft is used to fly out of state or carry mail.  For example, Part 121 certificates are generally issued to major carriers  who operate turbojet-powered airplanes or airplanes with more than nine  passenger seats, excluding crew members\u2019 seats, or airplanes having a  payload capacity of more than 7,500 pounds. Part 135 certificates are  generally issued to small carriers operating other than turbojet-powered  airplanes having no more than nine passenger seats and a payload capacity  of 7,500 pounds or less. The criteria for issuing certificates under Parts 121  and 135 have changed since the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the seven  fatal accidents that led to PRIA\u2019s enactment occurred. At that time, all  seven carriers operated under Part 135 certificates; however, under the new criteria, all of these carriers would operate under Part 121  certificates.", "As of April 13, 2001, FAA had identified 3,059 operators with active  certificates to operate under Parts 121 and 135 or with dual certificates to  operate under both.

First, PRIA specifies that,  generally, only information covering a 5-year period preceding the date of  the employment application or the date of the request is to be forwarded to  the hiring air carrier. Second, to help ensure that a pilot\u2019s records are not  requested without permission, a carrier must obtain the pilot\u2019s written  consent before requesting the release of records from FAA, NDR, and  current or former employers. PRIA also includes provisions to protect air  carriers from liability for providing a pilot\u2019s records and requires that they  not provide records without first ensuring that the pilot\u2019s consent has been  obtained. Finally, PRIA limits access to a pilot\u2019s records to those individuals  directly involved in the hiring process and restricts the use of those records  to assessing the pilot\u2019s qualifications as part of making a hiring decision. To  further protect a pilot\u2019s privacy, a carrier must protect the confidentiality of  these records.", "PRIA also provides a pilot with access to his/her PRIA records. Whenever a  request is received, a carrier, employer, or agency has 20 days to notify the  pilot of the request and of the pilot\u2019s right to receive a copy of the PRIA file.  If requested in writing by a pilot, a copy of the PRIA file must be provided  within 30 days of the pilot\u2019s request. Under PRIA, a pilot has the right to  submit written comments to correct inaccuracies in the records before a  final hiring decision is made. To further protect the rights of pilots under  PRIA, FAA may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to protect  the personal privacy of any pilots whose records are requested, preclude  the further dissemination of records received, and ensure prompt  compliance with requests for PRIA records."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PRIA Requires FAA to Provide Periodic Reports and Three Studies", "paragraphs": ["PRIA required FAA to provide a written report to Congress on the act\u2019s  implementation 18 months after the act was passed and at least once every  3 years thereafter on proposed changes to FAA\u2019s records, carriers\u2019 records,  and other employers\u2019 records. If FAA does not recommend changes to  PRIA, the act also requires the agency to give reasons for its position. FAA  provided Congress with two reports that were issued in October 2000 and  April 2002. Neither report recommends any change to (1) the agency\u2019s  current system of collecting and maintaining certificate records on airmen  or on legal enforcement actions and (2) air carrier and other records  required to be furnished under PRIA.

The April 2000  amendment also directed FAA to carry out certain actions related to PRIA.  Table 3 summarizes the major changes resulting from these amendments.", "The December 1997 amendment made a key change that allows a carrier to  request and review a PRIA file after hiring an applicant as long as the  carrier completes the background check before allowing the pilot to fly an  aircraft with passengers or cargo. Initially, the act required all carriers to  request and review a pilot\u2019s records from FAA, NDR, and previous  employers before hiring the pilot. This requirement caused delays in hiring  decisions because, at the time of the amendment\u2019s enactment, FAA and  some carriers could not meet the 30-day deadline. As a result, Congress  amended the act to permit a carrier to perform these background checks  after the pilot was hired as long as they were completed before the carrier  used the pilot to fly passengers or cargo\u2014a step often referred to as the  final hiring decision. In essence, this amendment gives carriers the option  to use PRIA information not as part of a pilot\u2019s initial screening process but  as a last check before the pilot is put into the cockpit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet our objectives, we gathered quantitative and qualitative  information from a variety of sources for the period from PRIA\u2019s  implementation in February 1997 through July 2002. Our primary method  for addressing the four objectives was two nationwide, anonymous mail  surveys\u2014one for Part 121 carriers and one for Part 135 carriers. Carriers  with dual certificates, that is, authorized to operate under both Part 121 and  Part 135, received the Part 121 survey, and we include the responses of  these carriers with the Part 121 responses throughout this report. The  surveys, conducted from June through September 2001, provided data on  the carriers\u2019  compliance with the act, including the timeliness with which they  received records from FAA, NDR, and other carriers;  use of information to hire pilots;  costs incurred because of the act\u2019s requirements;  awareness of actions to protect pilots\u2019 rights;  views on PRIA\u2019s usefulness;  opinions on which aspects of PRIA require more clarification or   recommendations for improving PRIA.", "The survey population included the Part 121 and Part 135 air carriers that  had made at least one request to FAA for PRIA information from July 1998,  when FAA began tracking such requests electronically, through April 30,  2001. This population includes 124, or 86 percent, of the 144 carriers that  operate under Part 121 or have dual certificates to operate under both Parts  121 and 135. All 124 of these carriers received the survey. However, the  survey population covers only 1,144, or 39 percent, of the 2,915 Part 135  carriers. Of these 1,144 carriers, we randomly selected 350 to receive the  survey. Although we would have preferred to survey a representative  sample of all Part 135 carriers, we were unable to do so in a manner that  would produce reliable data because we were unable to identify and  pretest carriers that were out of compliance with the requirement to  request documents from FAA. Thus, we cannot discuss the opinions and  experiences of the 1,771 Part 135 carriers that did not submit requests to  FAA for PRIA information. The surveys requested historical data from  PRIA\u2019s implementation in February 1997 through December 2000 for those  questions to which carriers said during pretesting that they could provide  more complete information. Where this was not the case, we requested that  carriers provide data for calendar year 2000 to offer the most current and  reliable perspective on carriers\u2019 compliance with the act. We did not verify  the information provided in our surveys. (See app. II for a more detailed  discussion of our methodology.)", "Besides analyzing our survey responses, we used other methods to address  the first objective on the extent to which carriers have complied with the  act by obtaining key documents about pilot applicants before making final  hiring decisions and whether FAA, NDR, and carriers have provided these  documents in a timely manner. Specifically, we interviewed carrier officials  who were responsible for requesting and reviewing PRIA information as  part of their hiring decisions. We also analyzed FAA and NDR data on  carriers\u2019 PRIA requests. We performed limited internal testing of the  database that FAA uses to respond to PRIA requests, but we did not  independently review the validity of the data it derives from three other  FAA databases. We also did not independently review the validity of the  NDR database that states use to provide information to carriers about  pilots\u2019 driving records. To obtain further information on compliance with  PRIA by Part 135 carriers, FAA, at our request, asked its principal operations inspectors in April 2001 for information on which Part 135  carriers should have made requests to FAA for PRIA records in calendar  year 2000. Specifically, FAA asked these inspectors to determine how many  pilots each of these Part 135 carriers had hired that year and how many of  the carriers operated only intrastate and thus might be exempt from PRIA\u2019s  requirements. FAA received information on about 842 of the 2,915 Part 135  carriers in operation, 798 of which were interstate carriers subject to PRIA.  We analyzed the information about hiring and certification to operate  interstate operations and compared it with requests for PRIA information  made to FAA by these same carriers in 2000 to determine whether these 798  carriers had requested information from FAA for at least as many pilots as  they had hired.", "To help determine our second objective of whether FAA, NDR, and carriers  were aware of PRIA\u2019s requirements to protect pilots\u2019 rights, we also  interviewed officials from these two federal agencies, carrier hiring  officials, aviation associations, representatives of a major pilot union, and  private aviation attorneys to understand how well PRIA has been working,  including the effectiveness of measures to protect pilots\u2019 rights. To  understand pilots\u2019 views of PRIA, we interviewed a sample of 20 pilots at  hiring fairs and carriers. We also interviewed and reviewed the PRIA files of  27 pilots whom we identified as having reported experiencing problems  with their PRIA records because they had contacted FAA, congressional  staff, or our office.", "To determine our third objective of what FAA has done to oversee  compliance with PRIA, we reviewed the agency\u2019s policies, guidance, and  internal documents about implementation as well as the reports and  studies to Congress that FAA generated in response to the act. We also  interviewed program officials at the Department of Transportation (DOT),  FAA headquarters, and FAA field offices responsible for responding to  PRIA requests from carriers, generating the data needed for these  responses, and overseeing the program\u2019s implementation. We also reviewed  enforcement cases initiated by FAA against carriers that had violated  PRIA\u2019s requirements.", "To address our fourth objective on the extent to which carriers believe the  act has helped them make better pilot-hiring decisions, we surveyed Part  121 and Part 135 carriers, as previously stated. We also interviewed officials  from aviation associations, representatives from a major pilot union, and  private aviation attorneys to understand the impact of PRIA on making  better pilot-hiring decisions. In addition, to obtain information on the act\u2019s  costs to FAA, NDR, carriers, and pilots, we reviewed FAA\u2019s submissions on  costs to the Office of Management and Budget, which are required under  the Paperwork Reduction Act. We discussed the costs of PRIA with  officials from all of these organizations as well as with officials from state  motor vehicle agencies that process the vast majority of carriers\u2019 PRIA  requests for pilots\u2019 NDR information.", "We conducted our work from August 2000 through July 2002 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions to Comply with Background Check Requirements Are Increasing, but Compliance Is Not Always Complete or Timely", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to comply with PRIA have increased since the act took effect in  February 1997, but compliance is not always complete or timely.

However, our analyses also suggest greater  compliance with some PRIA requirements than with others. Both FAA and  NDR databases and carriers\u2019 responses to our surveys indicate that hiring  carriers requested the required records more often from FAA than from  NDR, even though the carriers are required to request records from both  organizations for all prospective pilots. The survey responses further  indicate that hiring carriers requested the required records still less  frequently from other carriers.

However, requests did fall in  2001, reflecting the downturn in air traffic resulting from the economic  recession and the terrorist attacks of September 11. Although this generally  steady growth in the number of requests suggests increasing compliance  with PRIA\u2019s requirements for requesting records, we could not assess  carriers\u2019 compliance because data are not available on how many and  which pilots were hired each year by each carrier that is subject to PRIA  and whether each subject carrier requested records from all three required  sources for each pilot hired. When we began our review, FAA did not know  which carriers were subject to PRIA, but following discussions with us,  FAA agreed to analyze its Operations Specification database to make this determination.  Information regarding carriers\u2019 requests for records  from the three required sources is not available because federal laws and  regulations do not require that carriers report it to FAA or that FAA  maintain it.

From  February 1997, when PRIA was implemented, through December 2001,  carriers requested background checks on 111,552 pilots from FAA. (See fig.  1.)  The required records include a pilot applicant\u2019s flight certificate,  medical certificate, and enforcement history.", "Although the number of requests to FAA for background checks increased,  not all carriers requested records.

First, NDR does not  track its data by carrier or by pilot, as FAA does. Therefore, the two  agencies\u2019 data cannot be matched to verify that a carrier has requested  background checks on a pilot from both federal agencies. Second, NDR  data are, to some extent, understated, partly because NDR cannot always  identify requests from pilots for NDR information as PRIA requests and  partly because NDR did not include known PRIA requests made by pilots  under the Privacy Act in its PRIA database until 1999. Although requests  from carriers for NDR information are readily identifiable as PRIA  requests, carriers sometimes delegate their responsibility for obtaining  NDR information to pilot applicants, even though PRIA requires that a  carrier receive the records directly from NDR or the state agency.

First, PRIA directs  carriers to obtain the NDR information on each pilot with the pilot\u2019s  consent. Although PRIA allows carriers to have a pilot applicant request  that either NDR or a state motor vehicle agency provide the NDR  information directly to the carrier, PRIA does not allow the pilot to obtain  the information and then provide it to the carrier. This practice, which gives  the pilot custody of the information, potentially compromises the reliability  of the information.

Second, as previously  explained, our survey covered only those carriers that had made at least  one request to FAA for pilot records. Some carriers might have requested  records from other carriers or NDR, but not from FAA. Finally, under PRIA,  as amended, carriers do not need to request records from the military, from  employers for whom pilot applicants worked in jobs unrelated to flying, or  from certain types of aviation operators. Eighty-eight percent of the Part  121 carriers and 46 percent of the Part 135 carriers we surveyed reported  hiring at least some pilots with military flight experience in 2000. In  addition, many smaller Part 135 carriers may hire pilots whose recent  experience includes working for an aviation operator that is not required to  maintain the kinds of information on training and performance included in  PRIA records, such as a private flight school or an operator that provides  agricultural crop dusting, banner towing, travel by corporate jet, or aerial  surveying. Furthermore, PRIA requires only that carriers make a \u201cgood- faith\u201d attempt to obtain records from foreign employers or bankrupt  carriers.", "Even though there are several reasons why carriers may have reported  receiving fewer requests than FAA and NDR received, carriers\u2019 survey  responses pointed to greater noncompliance with the requirement to  request records from other carriers or employers than with the  requirements to request records from FAA or NDR. For example, 57  percent of the Part 121 carriers reported requesting records from other  carriers for all or almost all pilots they hired in 2000, compared with 97  percent for FAA and 95 percent for NDR. Similar percentages of the Part  135 carriers we surveyed reported requesting records from each of the  three sources.

First, our  analysis of hiring data gathered by FAA inspectors showed that hundreds of  pilots were hired by Part 135 carriers that either had not requested PRIA  records from FAA or had requested records for fewer pilots than they had  hired. To better understand why many Part 135 carriers had not requested  records, we asked FAA to have its inspectors determine how many pilots  were hired in 2000 by Part 135 carriers that operate interstate and therefore  are subject to PRIA\u2019s requirements. Data generated by the inspectors raised  questions about the compliance of 227 (28 percent) of the 798 Part 135  carriers for which the inspectors obtained information. These 227 carriers  had requested records for 318 pilots but had hired 1,078. While the carriers  that hired some of the remaining 760 pilots might have complied with PRIA  if the pilots were not placed in service in 2000 or if the pilots\u2019 records were  requested at the end of 1999 or at the beginning of 2001, it is unlikely that  these circumstances applied to all 760 pilots. According to FAA, its Office  of Flight Standards Service has asked the regions responsible for  overseeing these 227 carriers to review their compliance with PRIA.", "Second, to obtain a snapshot of carriers\u2019 compliance with PRIA\u2019s  requirements for obtaining background information, we asked our survey  respondents about the records they requested for pilots hired in 2000. A  few carriers self-reported significant noncompliance with PRIA\u2019s  requirements for requesting records. Of the Part 121 carriers, 1 percent  reported requesting FAA records less than half the time for the pilots hired  in 2000, 3 percent reported requesting NDR information less than half the  time for the pilots hired, and 6 percent reported requesting other  employers\u2019 records for half or fewer of the pilots hired.

In the  summer of 1997, FAA transferred the responsibility for responding to PRIA  requests from its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute to its Aviation Data  Systems Branch in the Office of Flight Standards, which had more staff  available to respond to requests. In addition, in July 1998, FAA developed a  centralized database that is automatically updated each night with new  information from the three databases that contain FAA\u2019s flight, medical, and  enforcement records.

How widespread the inclusion of outdated records  in PRIA files may be is unknown; however, this practice raises concerns  because there is no mechanism for a pilot to have them deleted until after  the hiring carrier has seen them.", "Outdated driver information may also sometimes be included in pilot files.

The Vice President of the Aviation Services  Department at AOPA also noted that the inclusion of old driving  information has been a problem with PRIA files. One pilot who contacted  us complained that his driving record still showed a violation from about 20  years earlier for having unopened beer in his car when he was 18. NDR  officials explained that if a pilot requests driver information directly from  NDR or through a state motor vehicle agency without specifying that the  information is needed for PRIA, the information provided may include  information older than the 5 years required by this law.", "Although an amendment to PRIA in April 2000 limits the records to be  provided by a former employer to those directly related to a pilot\u2019s  performance as a pilot, we found limited evidence that at least three  carriers had forwarded unrelated records to hiring carriers. In reviewing  the PRIA files of the 27 pilots who contacted us, we found one file that  contained the pilot\u2019s personal bankruptcy papers. Another file contained  copies of documents from a dispute between the pilot and the carrier about  unemployment compensation. A third file included court records of a  carrier\u2019s suit against a pilot for failing to repay training funds but excluded  the judge\u2019s ruling that the pilot did not have to repay those funds. These  court documents were unrelated to the pilot\u2019s flying abilities. About 29  percent of the Part 121 carriers we surveyed indicated a great need for  clarification of which records are related to an individual\u2019s performance as  a pilot and thus should be included in the files forwarded to hiring carriers.  The Part 135 carriers we surveyed indicated a similar need for clarification.", "Information unrelated to a pilot\u2019s driving record is also sometimes included  in the files NDR and states send to hiring carriers, according to the Chief of  NDR\u2019s Driver Register and Traffic Records Division. For example, he said  that some states have included information on nonmoving violations, such  as parking tickets, as well as on tax liens, nonpayment of child support, and  unpaid library fines. Such information can appear in PRIA files because  NDR gives the states some flexibility in determining what information they  submit to its computerized registry. NDR requires the states to submit the  names of persons whose driver licenses have been denied, canceled,  revoked, or suspended for cause as well as of those who have been  convicted of certain serious traffic offenses, such as driving while impaired  by alcohol or other drugs. However, NDR also allows the states to submit  information on convictions and withdrawals of licenses for other offenses.  While NDR limits the information provided in response to a PRIA request to  the most recent 5 years, it does not otherwise screen the information  provided. In contrast, when FAA reviews a pilot\u2019s fitness to hold a medical  certificate to fly, it obtains driver information from NDR that is screened to  include only certain serious moving violations and drug- and alcohol- related convictions over a 3-year period. FAA must then obtain detailed  information about the pilot\u2019s driving record from any states where  violations occurred.", "Some of the PRIA files we reviewed included records of disciplinary  actions that were subsequently overturned. Although PRIA requires  carriers to include records of disciplinary actions that were not overturned,  carrier officials, aviation attorneys, and one pilot who contacted us raised  concerns about including records of overturned disciplinary actions. For  example, the file for one pilot showed he was suspended briefly for  departing late, but did not show that his suspension was later overturned  and he was paid in full after providing copies of air traffic control tapes  showing that he had departed on time. But because a copy of the final  ruling that cleared him was not included in his file, the prospective  employer did not hire him, according to the pilot. This example shows how  any reference in a pilot\u2019s file to a past problem, even a problem that has  been resolved in the pilot\u2019s favor, can be damaging to the pilot\u2019s chances of  being hired.", "In another case, one of the pilots who contacted us with concerns about  PRIA said that his current employer had provided inconsistent records to  carriers to which he had applied. Our review of his records sent to a major  carrier indicated that he had tested positive on a required drug or alcohol  test, while his records sent to a small Part 135 carrier indicated that he had  submitted to and passed all such tests. In such a case, inaccurate  information could potentially cause a carrier to unfairly reject a competent  pilot whose record is clean or to unknowingly hire a pilot who has tested  positive.

While PRIA  allows pilots to review their records at any time, it does not require that  they have an opportunity to submit written comments to correct their  records before a hiring carrier receives their file. Thus, corrections, if  submitted, may come too late to prevent the hiring carrier from seeing  inaccuracies; information that should not, under PRIA, have been included  in the files; or disputed information presented only from the carrier\u2019s  perspective.", "The timing of the opportunity to correct records can create problems for  both pilots and carriers. Several of the pilots we interviewed said that after  successfully completing interviews, simulator testing, or other screening  procedures, carriers declined to hire them because of incorrect records in  their PRIA records. Some of these pilots said they were unaware of the  incorrect information in their PRIA records and had no opportunity to  correct it before the hiring carrier turned them down. The potential costs to  both the pilot and the hiring carrier are even greater if the pilot has already  accepted a position with the carrier, begun training, and given up a  previous job before the PRIA records are reviewed. Eighty-two percent of  the Part 121 carriers and 73 percent of the Part 135 carriers we surveyed  reported that they do not have the PRIA records to review until after the  pilot has accepted a conditional job offer and/or begun training.", "In addition to the timing of the opportunity to correct records, PRIA does  not indicate, and FAA has provided no guidance on, how to submit  corrections to PRIA records. As a result, even when carrier officials concur  with a pilot and are willing to remove or correct a record, some said they  are unsure whether the act allows them to do so. Several carrier officials  said they were unsure how to remove records that they believed were  unfair. For example, the president, attorney, and chief pilot for one Part 121  carrier fully concurred with a pilot that the record of a failed check ride  should be removed from the pilot\u2019s file because the training manager who  had administered this and other check rides had subsequently been fired  for being sexist and racist. The carrier consulted with FAA and aviation  attorneys but could not determine whether it could remove the  questionable training record. Instead, the carrier said it included a cover  memorandum explaining why the training manager was fired, affirming the  pilot\u2019s skills, and describing an emergency evacuation in which the pilot  saved the lives of two other pilots.", "Moreover, PRIA does not establish any procedures for arbitrating  disagreements between a pilot and a current or former employer over PRIA  records. Several of the pilots who contacted us described problems they  had experienced in getting explanations or rebuttals to specific records  included in their files. Six of these pilots knew of the incorrect information  but said that they had little success in removing or rebutting disputed  records. PRIA establishes no remedy for wrong or unjust entries in a pilot\u2019s  records or for failing to provide an opportunity for record correction, if the  carrier obtained a release of liability.", "According to a law review article, several carrier officials and private  aviation attorneys we interviewed, and some of the pilots who contacted us  with concerns about the law, another unintended consequence of PRIA is  that it can be used in ways that can diminish safety. Specifically, the weight  that the act gives to records from current and former employers can be  used as leverage in disputes between pilots and carriers over safety issues.  According to the previously mentioned law review article, disagreements  over \u201chow much safety is enough against the background of economic  competition,\u201d can pit pilots against managers \u201cwho also happen to hold the  trump card of the pilot\u2019s job in their hands.\u201d  In these instances, the article  argues that pilots may feel compelled to subordinate their concerns about  safety to their employers\u2019 economic interests to avoid having negative  information placed in their PRIA files.", "In addition, we found some limited indication that PRIA could be used in  ways that could potentially reduce aviation safety, rather than enhance it as  intended. Several of the pilots who contacted us said they had been  threatened with having negative records placed in their PRIA files if they  did not take actions that violated FAA\u2019s safety regulations. Although we  could not corroborate them, largely because discussing them with the  carriers could have further jeopardized these pilots\u2019 careers, we raised  them with FAA because these allegations involve potentially serious safety  issues. For example, one pilot said he was pressured to fly an aircraft with  serious maintenance problems, including an inoperable radar and  autopilot, during bad weather. This pilot and another pilot who flew for the  same carrier also said they had been pressured to identify mechanical  problems informally on post-it notes instead of recording the problems in  the aircraft\u2019s maintenance log, as FAA requires. We provided FAA with  information about the carriers involved that were still in business, but FAA  was unable to substantiate the allegations, and the carriers denied them.", "Finally, according to the previously cited law review article, the inclusion  of negative information in a PRIA file effectively negates the pilot\u2019s ability  to quit and go elsewhere. Several of the pilots who contacted us said they  had been threatened with negative records in their PRIA files if they did not  repay the costs of their training before leaving. Some carriers require that  pilots sign training contracts and remain with the carriers for a prescribed  period of months or years, after which time the cost of training is  considered paid in full. According to the pilots, these contracts make it  difficult to leave a carrier, especially if the carrier does not prorate the cost  of training, because if a pilot departs early, he or she will owe all or a  disproportionate amount of the total cost. Contract disputes about training  costs were included in several PRIA files that we reviewed. For example,  one pilot earning an annual salary of $15,000 said he quit after being  pressured to commit safety violations. He offered in writing to repay a  prorated portion of the $4,000 remaining on his training contract, but the  carrier sued him. The judge ruled that the training costs did not have to be  repaid. Although the broken training contract was not related to the pilot\u2019s  professional competence and the carrier lost the case, the carrier included  a record of the lawsuit in the pilot\u2019s file without reference to the judge\u2019s  ruling in the pilot\u2019s favor. See chapter 4 for our analysis of how FAA could  help to improve carriers\u2019 awareness of PRIA\u2019s requirements for protecting  pilots\u2019 rights and better inform pilots of their options for obtaining,  reviewing, and correcting their records."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FAA Oversight of PRIA Implementation Has Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["FAA has taken limited steps to oversee PRIA implementation and to  monitor this program as part of its broader responsibility for aviation  safety.

A revised circular, which FAA  produced in September 2001, addressed some of the issues on which  carriers had sought clarification. FAA\u2019s guidance also includes a new form  for carriers that inappropriately (1) requires a pilot applicant to waive the  rights provided by PRIA to be notified about requests and (2) changes the  party PRIA makes responsible for notifying the pilot of a request for  records.

Shifting responsibility for notifying  the pilot does not follow the process outlined in the law, which requires the  current or former employer to provide this notification. Second, as we  learned in interviewing pilots and hiring officials, forms completed at the  time of application sometimes remain on file for months or years before  being activated and submitted to current and former employers,  particularly when the hiring carrier is a major carrier. Officials in FAA\u2019s  Aviation Data Systems Branch confirmed that the pilot often signs these  forms months or even years before the hiring carrier submits them. In such  cases, a pilot might not know whether and when the hiring carrier actually  submits the request to the current and former employer.

Second, FAA lacks the information needed to assess  compliance with PRIA\u2019s requirements for requesting records because PRIA  does not require that this information be reported (see ch. 2). Thus FAA  may lack evidence that carriers have obtained the required records before  making final hiring decisions because PRIA does not require carriers to  retain the records they have received.", "As of July 3, 2001, FAA\u2019s Air Transportation Oversight System (ATOS)  database, which tracks inspections of the nation\u2019s 10 major passenger  carriers, showed no entries related to PRIA. FAA\u2019s older Program Reporting  and Tracking Subsystem database, which tracks some limited information  on the 10 major carriers, as well as the results of inspections on all other  carriers, contained 76 inspection entries related to PRIA since the law\u2019s  implementation in 1997. Two of these entries identified possible  noncompliance with PRIA and led to the opening of enforcement cases,  while the remaining 74 noted that the inspectors had provided information  on PRIA to the carriers but did not identify any noncompliance. One  additional entry, dated June 15, 1999, identified noncompliance but did not  lead to the opening of an enforcement case. According to the entry, a  random inspection of the records of 169 pilots with a large Part 121 carrier  revealed noncompliance with PRIA, which the inspector reported to the  carrier\u2019s Vice President of Operations and to the responsible Principal  Operations Inspector at FAA.", "Since PRIA\u2019s implementation in February 1997, FAA has initiated 10  enforcement cases against six carriers. In the 3 most serious cases, which  resulted in fines ranging from $2,500 to $30,000, the carriers failed to  request PRIA background checks for 12 pilots they hired and, in 1 case, the  carrier falsified documents related to providing PRIA checks. The  remaining 7 cases resulted either in warning letters or were closed with no  action.", "Although the number of inspection findings and enforcement actions could  be indicative of widespread compliance with the act, our analyses of  carriers\u2019 requests for PRIA records and of carriers\u2019 awareness of PRIA\u2019s  requirements for protecting pilots\u2019 rights indicate that carriers are not  always requesting the required records, especially from other carriers, and  are not always sufficiently aware of the pilots\u2019 rights protections to comply  with them (see chs. 2 and 3). Alternatively, FAA inspectors may not be  regularly reviewing carriers\u2019 compliance. Without information on PRIA in  their inspection handbooks and training classes, these inspectors have no  reminders to check for compliance with PRIA. According to FAA\u2019s Deputy  Associate Administrator, Office of Regulation and Certification, FAA\u2019s  monitoring focuses on a carrier\u2019s processes and procedures for complying  with PRIA, not on checks of records for individual pilots. Although we  concur with the importance of checking carriers\u2019 processes and procedures  for complying with laws, FAA cannot determine whether a carrier actually  follows its processes and procedures without performing at least limited  spot checks. This system safety approach with compliance checks is the  basis for the new ATOS inspection system that FAA uses to oversee the  nation\u2019s 10 major air carriers.", "Regardless of whether FAA operations inspectors attempt to monitor  carriers\u2019 compliance with PRIA, they may not have sufficient evidence to  do so. Just as FAA lacks information needed to assess compliance with  PRIA\u2019s requirements for requesting records because PRIA does not require  that this information be reported (see ch. 2), FAA also may lack evidence  that carriers have obtained the required records before making final hiring  decisions because PRIA does not require carriers to retain the records they  have received. According to an attorney from FAA\u2019s Office of Chief  Counsel, nothing in the PRIA statute requires carriers to maintain the pilot  records they receive from FAA, NDR, or other carriers. The statute requires  carriers to maintain the records they generate on their pilot employees for  5 years, but it does not require them to store or maintain the PRIA records  they receive when they hire pilots. Without these records, he noted, it is  very difficult for FAA to determine a carrier\u2019s compliance with PRIA.  According to another official in FAA\u2019s Air Transportation Division, carriers  have an incentive to dispose of these records to avoid any liability resulting  from their hiring decisions. Nonetheless, he observed that some carriers  still keep these records, and he agreed that it would be almost impossible  to complete an enforcement action against a carrier without them.  Requiring carriers to maintain the PRIA records they receive could,  however, be costly, especially for smaller carriers, according to the Deputy  Associate Administrator, and these costs would not be warranted by the  safety benefits achieved. According to FAA, it has not identified pilot  performance during past training events as a high-risk area because of the  extensive training, testing, and checking required for pilots.", "We believe it is important for FAA to be able to enforce the law. As  previously discussed, FAA is responsible for overseeing PRIA\u2019s  implementation and has the authority to issue regulations or establish  procedures for carriers to maintain the records needed for FAA to monitor  and enforce compliance with the act. FAA has not issued regulations on  PRIA because it believes that carriers, not the government, are responsible  for collecting PRIA information. Furthermore, FAA believes that it should  focus its regulatory resources on higher aviation-safety priorities.

For example:  Unresolved procedural issues\u2014such as how to correct errors in pilot  records, especially before hiring carriers see inaccurate information;  how to remove inappropriate records; and how to handle disputes  between pilots and carriers\u2014effectively limit pilots\u2019 rights. As  individuals, pilots have less power than carriers, and without  procedures for resolving these issues, they cannot compel carriers to  correct or remove inaccurate records or settle disputes. Moreover, even  when carriers are willing to make changes, they may not know how to  do so. Inaccurate or inappropriate information may jeopardize a pilot\u2019s  chances of being hired.", "FAA has not taken advantage of its Web site to make information about  pilots\u2019 rights readily available. Because the act does not mandate when  pilots are to be given an opportunity to correct their records, except that  it come before the final hiring decision, many pilots do not seek to  correct their records until after the records have been sent to the hiring  carrier. It is critical that FAA do what it can to make pilots aware of their  rights to review and correct the records maintained by their current  employer at any time. With knowledge of their rights, pilots can take  responsibility for reviewing the accuracy of their records before the  records are sent to hiring carriers.", "The sample form that FAA designed for hiring carriers and included in  its revised guidance for carriers, though intended to streamline the  hiring process, weakens pilots\u2019 rights and inappropriately shifts the  responsibility for notifying pilots of requests for their records from  current or former employers to hiring carriers. If carriers follow the  procedures set forth in the sample form, they will not be in compliance  with PRIA\u2019s notification provision, and pilots may not know when  records are sent to hiring carriers.", "Although FAA has updated its information on PRIA for carriers, it has  not yet included this information in key guidance for its own staff. Until  the agency incorporates its guidance on the act into its inspector  handbooks and provides its inspectors with appropriate training, the  inspectors may not be sufficiently aware of PRIA\u2019s provisions to review  carriers\u2019 compliance. We do not know whether the limited number of  inspection findings related to PRIA is indicative of widespread  compliance, infrequent compliance reviews, or a lack of evidence to  determine compliance.

The Part 135 carriers  said they spent an average of $1,000 or less. The total costs for individual  Part 121 carriers ranged from $1,000 or less to $100,001 to $1 million. The  total costs for individual Part 135 carriers ranged from $1,000 or less to  $10,001 to $50,000. (For more detailed cost information, see app. VII.)", "Carrier officials told us that the costs for PRIA are difficult to distinguish  from other hiring costs, partly because most carriers do not have staff  dedicated to carrying out PRIA requirements and use the same staff to  perform both PRIA and other responsibilities. In addition, the fees that  background investigation companies charge to obtain PRIA information  may not be billed separately from their fees for performing other services  that are not required by PRIA, such as consumer credit or criminal records  checks.", "For 2000, FAA estimated that pilots whose PRIA files were requested  incurred total costs of nearly $436,000, or about 8 percent of the estimated  $5.3 million total cost. This estimate did not include the pilots\u2019 costs to  obtain copies of their employment and training records from carriers for  review and to obtain copies of their driving records.", "Complete data are not available on the costs to FAA, NDR, and state motor  vehicle agencies of implementing PRIA. For fiscal year 2000, when FAA  provided a more complete estimate of its PRIA costs than it had developed  in previous years, the agency estimated its own costs at about $312,000, or  about 6 percent of the $5.3 million total estimate. However, according to  staff in FAA\u2019s Aviation Data Systems Branch, this estimate did not include  about $40,000 that FAA spent in fiscal year 2000 for the initial development  and maintenance of its automated system for responding to PRIA requests.  NDR officials reported spending $318 to complete 17,000 requests from  carriers in 1999, but this figure did not include any portion of the $1 million  that NDR spends annually to maintain its computer system or of the costs  that NDR incurs to hand-process pilots\u2019 requests for driver information  under the Privacy Act. None of the six state motor vehicle agencies that  respond to most carriers\u2019 requests for NDR information could identify the  costs of providing the information, according to responsible state officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carriers Were Divided on Whether PRIA\u2019s Costs Were Justified", "paragraphs": ["Compared with the Part 135 carriers we surveyed, the Part 121 carriers  were more persuaded that the PRIA information they received was worth  the cost, but even the Part 121 carriers were split in their views.

In  responding to a PRIA request, however, FAA is precluded by the act from  releasing any records more than 5 years old. In addition, as a matter of law,  FAA provides information only on those accidents and incidents that have  resulted in a legal enforcement action. Under PRIA, FAA is not required to  provide other records that it maintains on aviation accidents and incidents  as well as on open, pending, and reopened enforcement cases. According  to FAA\u2019s analysis, nearly 20,000 more records were available in response to  FOIA requests than to PRIA requests as of January 10, 2002. (See table 6.)  These include 9,885 records of enforcement cases that have been closed  but from which the pilot\u2019s name has not been expunged as well as of open,  pending, or reopened enforcement cases.

The  analysis concluded that the majority of carriers are unaware that they are  receiving incomplete safety records from FAA under PRIA. Additionally,  the report noted that, under FOIA, there are no requirements to notify a  pilot of a request for records, to obtain the pilot\u2019s consent for the release of  those records, or to provide the pilot with a copy of the records that were  released.", "FAA does not support for a variety of reasons a change in the law that  would provide carriers with more complete safety information on pilot  applicants if it released its records of accidents; incidents; and open,  pending, or reopened enforcement cases. According to FAA\u2019s Office of  Chief Counsel, using the reports of accidents and incidents in FAA\u2019s data  system to evaluate pilots\u2019 performance could be unfair because these  reports may not involve pilot error. Moreover, even if they do, pilots  identified in accident and incident reports do not receive the same due  process protections that pilots receive when they are subject to legal  enforcement actions. Additionally, enforcement actions that have not been  closed have not been fully reviewed by FAA, NTSB, and perhaps a U.S.  Court of Appeals.
