In 1995, an estimated 25 percent of all foster children were living with their relatives. Many child welfare experts believe that placing foster children with relatives, a practice commonly known as kinship care, can be beneficial to many of the children. Research has shown, however, that foster children in kinship care may not always receive good quality care, remain in the system longer than other foster children, and are less likely to find a permanent home outside the foster care system when they cannot return to their parents. These findings are especially significant in light of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-89), which includes provisions to ensure foster children\u2019s safety and to speed up the process for finding permanent homes for them when they cannot return to their parents.", "In response to the request of the previous chairman of the subcommittee for information on how well kinship care is serving foster children, this report describes (1) the quality of care that children in kinship care receive compared with that received by other foster children, as measured by a caseworker\u2019s assessment of a caregiver\u2019s parenting skills, the extent to which a foster child is able to maintain contact with familiar people and surroundings, and a caregiver\u2019s willingness to enforce court-ordered restrictions on parental visits; (2) the frequency with which state child welfare agencies pursue various permanent living arrangements (that is, permanency planning goals) and the time children in kinship care have spent in the system compared with other foster children; and (3) recent state initiatives intended to help ensure that children in kinship care receive good quality foster care and are placed in permanent homes in a timely manner.", "In conducting this work, we reviewed recent research, federal statutes and regulations, and California and Illinois legislation and initiatives regarding kinship care. In addition, we surveyed samples of foster care cases in California and Illinois that were in their foster care systems on September 15, 1997, and had been there since at least March 1, 1997. We selected these two states because they have large kinship care populations, have different child welfare administration structures, and are located in different geographic areas. We asked the caseworker responsible for each case to respond to a questionnaire regarding several dimensions of the quality of foster care in that case and the permanency goals pursued as of September 15, 1997. Because this survey is limited to the foster care population in two states, the results cannot be generalized to the foster care population either nationwide or in any other individual state. However, results can be generalized to these two states, which account for about one-quarter of the nation\u2019s foster care population and almost half of the kinship care population nationwide. We conducted our fieldwork between April 1997 and December 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. A more detailed description of our scope and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for the administration and oversight of federal funding to states for services to foster children under title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The states are responsible for administering foster care programs, which are supported in part with federal funds. These funds reimburse the states for a portion of the cost of maintaining foster children whose parents meet federal eligibility criteria for the funds. The criteria are based in part on the income level of the parents. Federal expenditures for the administration and maintenance of foster care cases eligible for title IV-E were $3.2 billion in 1997. When foster children are not eligible for title IV-E funding, they may be eligible for child-only benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which are partially funded by the federal government. Otherwise, states and counties must bear the full cost of caring for foster children.", "Within the foster care system, children can be placed in any of a number of temporary settings, including kinship care, family foster care, private for-profit or nonprofit child care facilities, or public child care institutional care. In the kinship care setting, foster children are placed with their relatives. While the definition of \u201crelatives\u201d varies somewhat by state, relatives are typically adults who are related to a foster child by blood or marriage. They may also be family friends, neighbors, or other adults with whom the child is familiar. In this report, kinship care refers to the formal placement of children in the foster care system with their relatives. It does not include informal arrangements for relatives to care for children who are outside the child welfare system and the purview of the courts.", "Since at least the 1980s, some portion of foster children in this country have been placed with relatives. Some studies contend that the increase in the number of foster children being placed with relatives may have been, at least initially, the result of a shortage of traditional foster homes.Others suggest that kinship care increased as a result of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. This act required states to place children in the \u201cleast restrictive (most family like) setting available,\u201d a requirement that has been interpreted by many states as implying a preference for placing foster children with their relatives. The increase in kinship care may also stem in part from litigation (Matter of Eugene F. v. Gross, Sup. Ct., NY County, Index No. 1125/86) that resulted in New York City\u2019s bringing certain children being cared for by relatives into the formal foster care system and making them eligible for publicly funded services. Regardless of the historical impetus behind the growth in kinship care, section 505 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 amended federal law to require that the states consider giving priority to relatives when deciding with whom to place children while they are in the foster care system.", "Kinship care cases are eligible for federal title IV-E funding if, in addition to other criteria, the caregivers meet state licensing requirements for foster homes and the child\u2019s parents meet the income eligibility criteria.In 1996, in about 60 percent of the kinship care cases in California and about 50 percent of such cases in Illinois, the caregiver received title IV-E funding. In the remaining kinship care cases in these states, the caregiver may have received an Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) grant, which may have been a child-only grant.", "Thirty-nine states reported in a 1996 survey conducted by the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) that in 1995 they had a total of about 107,000 foster children in kinship care, or about one-quarter of all foster children in the United States. In 1995, the proportion of all foster children in each state who were in kinship care ranged from 0.4 to 52 percent. As time passes, states appear to be relying more on kinship care. CWLA has reported that between 1990 and 1995, the number of children in foster care increased by 21 percent (from 400,398 in 1990 to 483,629 in 1995), while the number of kinship care children increased by 29 percent.", "In 1995, the foster care population in California was 87,010, or about 27 percent larger than it had been in 1990, while the kinship care population was about 36 percent larger. According to our survey, as of September 15, 1997, 51 percent of the 74,133 foster children in California who had been in the system since at least March 1, 1997, were in kinship care.", "In 1997, the foster care population in Illinois was 50,721, or about 159 percent larger than it had been in 1990, while the kinship care population was about 250 percent larger. Up until July 1995, children whose parents were absent and who were living safely with a relative were considered \u201cneglected\u201d under Illinois state law, and the state generally assumed custody of such children. In these cases, the relative\u2019s home at the time was frequently converted into kinship care within the foster care system. This may have accounted for the growth of the kinship care population in Illinois up until that time. Illinois amended the definition of \u201cneglected child,\u201d effective July 1, 1995, and as a result, such children are no longer considered neglected and the state no longer assumes custody.According to our survey, as of September 15, 1997, 55 percent of the 48,745 foster children in Illinois who had been in the system since at least March 1, 1997, were in kinship care.", "Federal foster care statutes and regulations, which emphasize the importance of both reunifying families and achieving permanency for children in a timely manner, apply to all foster care cases, whether a child is in kinship care or another foster care setting. Outcomes in foster care cases include (1) family reunification, (2) adoption, (3) legal guardianship, and (4) independent living or aging out of the foster care system, usually at age 18. In emphasizing the goal of family reunification, for example, federal law requires that the states make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to reunify foster children with their parents. The law requires that the states develop case plans that among other things describe the services that are to be provided to help parents, children, and foster parents facilitate the children\u2019s return to their own safe home or their permanent placement elsewhere. The states are required to review foster care cases at least every 6 months and must hold permanency planning hearings at least every 12 months, during which a judge or a hearing officer determines whether a state should continue to pursue the current goal or begin to pursue some other permanency goal. When foster children cannot be safely returned to their parents in a timely manner, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (enacted after the period covered by our survey) includes a provision requiring the states to begin the process to file a petition to terminate parental rights if a child has been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, unless (1) required reasonable efforts and services to reunify the family have not been made in accordance with the case plan, (2) a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d is documented in the case plan indicating why it would not be in the best interest of the child to terminate parental rights at that time, or (3) at the option of the state, the child is being cared for by a relative. At the same time that the states are required to initiate termination procedures, they must also identify and recruit qualified families for adoption. Thus, if none of the exceptions apply, the law attempts to achieve permanency through adoption.", "Most research on the quality of kinship care has used the demographic characteristics of the caregivers as indirect indicators of the quality of foster care they provide. Although the studies\u2019 results have varied somewhat, many studies have found that kinship caregivers tend to be older, have less formal education and lower incomes, are less often married, and are less healthy than other foster caregivers. On the basis of these characteristics, child welfare researchers and practitioners have inferred that the quality of kinship care may be lower than the quality of care in other foster care settings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "For Most Measurements of Quality, Kinship Care and Other Foster Care Were Comparable but Some Safety and Quality Assurance Concerns Remain", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the caseworkers\u2019 responses to our survey of open foster care cases in California and Illinois showed that, overall, the quality of both kinship care and other foster care was good and that in most respects the experiences of children in kinship care and in other foster care settings were comparable. In both states, most caregivers in kinship as well as foster care settings received high scores from their caseworkers when it came to performing parenting tasks. We also found that, in general, children in kinship care in these states experienced significantly more continuity in their lives\u2014that is, continued contact with family, friends, and the neighborhood they lived in before entering foster care\u2014than other foster children. However, we also found that while the caseworker in most kinship as well as other foster care cases believed that the caregivers were likely to enforce court-ordered restrictions on parental visits, the proportion of cases in which this view was held was smaller for kinship care cases than other foster care cases.

We found no research that directly measured foster parents\u2019 ability to perform such tasks.", "For nearly all the parenting tasks we asked about, the caseworkers in more than 90 percent of kinship care and other foster care cases in the two states responded that the caregivers performed those tasks either adequately or very adequately. A smaller percentage\u2014about 80 percent\u2014of the children in kinship care in Illinois, however, were up-to-date on their routine vision and dental examinations, compared with 90 percent of other foster children. State officials in Illinois speculated that this was because kinship caregivers are more likely than other foster caregivers to seek vision and dental care for their foster children only as often as they do for themselves, which is less frequently than state standards and guidelines call for.

While many mental health professionals agree that continuity in relationships is good for children in general, there is less agreement about the merits of continuity in the lives of abused or neglected children. Experts do agree that contact with siblings, and especially living with siblings, is beneficial for a child and that parental visits with foster children are needed to achieve reunification when this is an appropriate goal. Experts also report that a child\u2019s familiarity with the caregiver lessens the trauma of separation from the family, at least in the short run. Advocates of kinship care further assert that placing a foster child with relatives or friends may help maintain continuity in the child\u2019s life by maintaining ties with the child\u2019s community, school, and church. Many believe, however, that parents who neglect or abuse their children learn this behavior from members of a dysfunctional immediate or extended family. So, living with relatives and continued contact with the community may not be in the best interest of the child because the child continues to live in the environment that may have led to the abuse or neglect.", "Our survey asked for information about three types of continuity in foster children\u2019s lives: (1) their previous familiarity with the person who became their foster parent; (2) their contact while in foster care with their parents, other relatives, and friends; and (3) their involvement, while in foster care, with the community they lived in before they entered the system. Our analysis showed that there was significantly more continuity in the lives of children in kinship care than in other foster care settings with respect to nearly all the indicators we used to measure these three categories of continuity. In general, our findings were consistent with the results of other research about the relationship of kinship care and continuity in foster children\u2019s lives.", "In measuring children\u2019s familiarity with the persons who became their foster parents, the results of our survey in both California and Illinois indicated that a significantly larger proportion of children in kinship care than other foster care knew their caregivers before entering the system.

(See fig. 1.)", "In measuring the extent to which foster children were in contact with their parents, other relatives, and friends in California and Illinois, in significantly more kinship care than other foster cases the caseworkers reported that the children were in contact with family and friends. For example, the caseworkers\u2019 responses to our survey showed that mothers with children in kinship care (24 percent in California, 39 percent in Illinois) visited their children more often than specified in their case plans than did mothers with children in other foster care settings (6 percent in California, 11 percent in Illinois). To put this into perspective, however, in both kinship care and other foster care settings, less than 50 percent of mothers visited their children as often as specified in their case plans. Other research has also shown that parents of children in kinship care are more likely to visit their children at least once a year, and visit them more often per year, than parents of other foster children. In both California and Illinois, in a significantly larger proportion of kinship than other foster care cases the caseworkers noted that one or more of a child\u2019s siblings were living in the same foster home. According to our survey, children in kinship care also had more contact with their friends and relatives other than parents, foster parents, or siblings. (See fig. 2.)

The large number of children in kinship care with the goal of long-term foster care is not surprising given that according to California officials, the state had only recently begun to offer adoption and guardianship options specifically designed for a foster child\u2019s relatives. Survey responses confirmed this belief. In 74 percent of kinship care cases with a goal of long-term foster care, the caseworkers responded that the primary reason why the children did not have adoption as the goal was that they were being cared for by relatives who did not want to adopt and that moving the children to another home would be detrimental to them.", "State officials in California pointed out several disincentives for adoption and guardianship in kinship care cases. Certain benefits for foster children in California, such as special priority for assistance in schools and financial assistance for college, are no longer available when they have been adopted.

Guardians who are related to a child could receive a TANF child-only grant on behalf of the child instead of title IV-E payments, but this grant is much lower than the title IV-E maintenance payments. In addition, to qualify for a TANF child-only grant, the guardian would have to provide proof that the child attends school and receives medical examinations. According to our survey, more than half of the open kinship care cases in California with the goal of guardianship had a guardian appointed but remained in the foster care system.
