Similarly, a Navy analysis shows that the average age of shipyard capital equipment now exceeds its expected useful life.", "Partly as a result of their poor condition, the shipyards have not been fully meeting the Navy's operational needs. In fiscal years 2000 through 2016, inadequate facilities and equipment led to maintenance delays that contributed in part to more than 1,300 lost operational days\u2014days when ships were unavailable for operations\u2014for aircraft carriers and 12,500 lost operational days for submarines (see figure).

Missing elements include analytically-based goals and metrics, a full identification of the shipyards' resource needs, regular management reviews of progress, and reporting on progress to key decision makers and Congress. For example, the Navy estimates that it will need at least $9.0 billion in capital investment over the next 12 fiscal years, but this estimate does not account for all expected costs, such as those for planning and modernizing the shipyards' utility infrastructure.

We recommended  that the Navy develop guidance to standardize shipyard strategic  planning, improve processes for developing restoration and  modernization requirements, and document the resolution of quality-of-life  issues that have been identified. The Department of Defense (DOD)  concurred with our recommendations and addressed them by, for  example, providing guidance to the shipyards that required them to  develop strategic plans to address their future restoration and  modernization needs and improving its collection of facility data to support  restoration and modernization requirements. In 2013, in response to  congressional direction, the Navy developed a plan to improve most of its  shipyard facilities and estimated it would take 17 years (until 2030) to fully  clear the backlog of maintenance and infrastructure repair that existed at  the time. The Navy\u2019s improvement plan sought to improve the condition  of critical shipyard facilities and utilities, mitigate seismic risks to the  drydocks, and centralize different maintenance operations in specific  areas of the naval shipyards to reduce time spent in transit between  support facilities and the waterfront where maintenance occurs on the  ship.

This rating measures the facility\u2019s suitability to  function as intended or required for its mission. However, we did not  assess the average configuration of the shipyard facilities, because the  Navy had not resolved an issue concerning the reliability of the  configuration data that we identified in 2011.

As we previously described, this use of a default  rating creates a false result that suggests these facilities are perfectly  configured, when in reality their status has not been assessed or  recorded in the Navy\u2019s database. This false result also has the effect of  underestimating shipyard restoration and modernization costs, since the  configuration ratings are used to inform these estimates.

The  shipyards rely on 18 aged drydocks to perform maintenance on the  Navy\u2019s current fleet of aircraft carriers and submarines. Our analysis of  Navy data shows that the average age of Navy drydocks is about 89  years. The oldest drydock in current use was completed in 1891 and the  newest was completed in 1962. Aging drydocks pose risks to the  shipyards\u2019 ability to perform their depot repair mission uninterrupted and  ultimately to the Navy\u2019s ability to provide required aircraft carrier and  submarine presence to combatant commanders. These risks result from  flooding and seismic vulnerabilities and the potential for aging drydocks to  deteriorate, among other things. Examples of key drydock shortcomings  identified by the Navy include obsolescence, flooding vulnerabilities, and  seismic vulnerabilities.", "Workarounds for Drydock Obsolescence   Three of Puget Sound\u2019s six drydocks and one  of Norfolk\u2019s five drydocks require the use of  superflooding as a workaround to service the  Navy\u2019s current fleet of submarines.  Superflooding forces water into the drydock to  raise the water level higher than the tides to  obtain the necessary clearance for the  submarine to move into the dock. According  to shipyard officials at Puget Sound,  superflooding can result in the flooding of  drydocks\u2019 electrical and service galleries  (shown below), which were not designed to be  flooded and therefore have to be repaired  because of rust and seawater corrosion.", "Drydock obsolescence. Several of the shipyards\u2019 drydocks are not able  to support existing submarine classes, including the Los Angeles-class  attack submarine. Other drydocks can support vessels only when  assisted by particular equipment or environmental conditions such as tidal  schedules (see sidebar). Our analysis shows that as the Navy retires  existing aircraft carriers and submarines and replaces them with newer  classes, the shipyards will become increasingly constrained in scheduling  and performing maintenance using their existing drydocks. Only 11 of the  18 drydocks in use are configured to perform maintenance on the newer  ship and submarine classes being procured by the Navy, such as the  larger Ford-class aircraft carrier and the Virginia-class submarine (see  figure 5). According to a June 2017 draft drydock study from the Navy,  without making new investments in drydocks, the shipyards will  increasingly encounter scheduling delays waiting for access to the 11  drydocks that are configured for the newer classes.", "Additionally, Drydock 1 at Portsmouth Naval  Shipyard and Drydock 3 at Pearl Harbor  require buoyancy assistance equipment to  provide additional lift to reduce the  submarine\u2019s waterborne draft to move it into  the drydock. In its 2017 draft drydock study,  the Navy reports that, without the use of  buoyancy assistance equipment, these two  drydocks could no longer dock any of the  Navy\u2019s current submarines. While this  workaround allows the shipyards to repair  some current classes of submarines, the  Navy\u2019s study says it will not be sufficient in the  future for newer classes. Additionally,  shipyard officials said that Drydock 3 at Puget  Sound can move Los Angeles class  submarines in or out only after they have had  several tons of weight removed and only  during a high tide. This drydock is primarily  used for submarine reactor compartment  disposal.", "Flooding vulnerabilities. Four of Norfolk\u2019s 5 drydocks face flooding  threats from extreme high tides and storm swells and average one major  flooding event per year. According to officials, drydock flooding during  certain delicate depot maintenance tasks risks personnel safety,  catastrophic damage to the ships being repaired, and potential  environmental impacts. For example, the Navy reported in 2009 that a  drydock at Norfolk required emergency repairs to prevent flooding while  the USS Tennessee (SSBN-734) was undergoing maintenance.  According to a 2009 Navy incident report, several days of high tides and  winds, coupled with multiple leaks in the drydock\u2019s granite block joints,  resulted in the drydock flooding at an estimated rate of 3,000 gallons per  minute before workers could repair it.", "Seismic vulnerabilities. The Navy\u2019s drydocks were not designed to  accommodate the risks posed by seismic events. For example, at Puget  Sound Naval Shipyard\u2014located in an area identified by the U. S.  Geological Survey as a \u201cHigh Seismic Hazard Zone\u201d\u2014a 7.0 magnitude or  greater earthquake could damage or ruin the only drydock on the west  coast that is capable of performing maintenance on aircraft carriers.

In September 2016, an internal NAVSEA  analysis showed that the average age of capital equipment at the four  shipyards had risen to 22 years, which is beyond the 15-year average  expected useful life that the Navy has calculated for capital equipment.  We also observed aging equipment at all four shipyards, including  submarine shaft lathes at Puget Sound that had entered service in the  1930s and a plate roller at Portsmouth that was built in the 1950s.

This indicates that the shipyards may be incurring costs\u2014 such as additional labor hours and repair materials\u2014associated with  aging equipment. Moreover, the actual need for repairs may be greater  than the number of repair requests indicates, according to shipyard  officials, because shop level employees are reluctant to submit repair  requests when there is little hope of obtaining funding for a repair.  Unreliable equipment can also result in increased costs and re-work. For  example, after it was discovered in 2015 that the analog controls on a  furnace used to heat-treat submarine parts to withstand deep sea  pressure were reading inaccurately, Norfolk officials were required to re- inspect 10 years\u2019 worth of parts made in that furnace to ensure that they  met stringent submarine safety requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Shipyard Capital Facilities and Equipment Are Not Fully Meeting the Navy\u2019s Operational Needs and Will Likely Not Support Projected Operational Needs", "paragraphs": ["The shipyards\u2019 capital facilities and equipment are not fully meeting the  Navy\u2019s operational needs, in part due to their condition.

Navy shipyard officials noted that there  are numerous reasons why the maintenance on ships may be delayed\u2014 factors such as parts shortages, labor difficulties, changes in the planned  maintenance work, and weather\u2014but agreed that the condition of  facilities and equipment is one of those reasons.", "Our analysis of Navy data shows that, in fiscal years 2000 through 2016,  the shipyards completed maintenance periods on schedule only 47  percent of the time for aircraft carriers and 24 percent of the time for  submarines (see figure 7). These overruns in maintenance periods  resulted in at least 1,300 lost operational days\u2014days that a ship is not  available for operations\u2014for aircraft carriers and about 12,500 days for  submarines during fiscal years 2000 through 2016 (see figure 7). Our  analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that delays in maintenance  periods that began in fiscal year 2015 caused more than a year\u2019s worth of  lost operational days for aircraft carriers\u2014the equivalent of losing the use  of an aircraft carrier for more than a year.", "In addition to hindering efficient ship repair, inadequate facilities cost the  Navy in other ways. The Navy reports that it has purchased or rented a  large number of temporary facilities at every shipyard to provide them  enough space to complete their mission, and the need for such temporary  facilities is growing, according to shipyard officials. In its 2013 facilities  improvement plan, the Navy identified 650 temporary shipyard structures  across the four shipyards, comprising 561,466 square feet. As recently  as February of 2017, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard alone reported that it  had over 224,000 square feet of relocatable facilities onsite, including  approximately 300 temporary trailers. Some \u201ctemporary\u201d facilities at the  shipyards have been used for decades, and others are double stacked  because of a lack of space (see figure 8 for an example).", "We observed at Pearl Harbor and Puget Sound that the piers used for  repair work can also be crowded, and personnel told us that they leave  equipment outside because there is no covered storage space available.  For example, shipyard officials at Puget Sound told us they currently have  a storage space deficit of approximately 400,000 square feet. They  reported that, as a result, they store millions of dollars\u2019 worth of  equipment and material outside around the shipyard, sometimes  uncovered and exposed to the elements. Shipyard officials said this can  reduce the lifespan of the equipment, particularly when it is exposed to  the saltwater air, which increases the rate of corrosion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Estimates That the Shipyards\u2019 Drydocks Will Not Support Projected Operational Needs", "paragraphs": ["According to a 2017 draft Navy study, the current capacity and capability  of the shipyards\u2019 drydocks will not support future operational needs.

However, this estimate identifies only maintenance periods  missed as a result of drydock capacity and capability issues for the  planned fleet of 11 carriers and 70 submarines through fiscal year 2040.  NAVSEA officials said that other factors that contribute to missed  maintenance periods, such as shipyard workload, workforce, or  requirements growth, were not accounted for in this estimate.", "In its 2017 draft drydock study, the Navy reports that it currently has very  little drydock capacity to surge depot-level work or deal with national  security contingencies or unanticipated accidents, such as the USS  Greeneville\u2019s (SSN-772) collision with a Japanese fishing ship. This is  because of the high demand for drydock space, which leaves the Navy  with little time between scheduled maintenance periods to do other work.  In its 2016 Force Structure Assessment, the Navy released a new force  structure goal that called for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355  ships\u2014up from the previous goal of 308 ships in its 2015 assessment and  the current inventory of 276. This assessment calls for increasing the  number of planned aircraft carriers from 11 to 12 and the number of  attack submarines from 48 to 66 (a 38 percent increase). This proposed  increase in fleet size will aggravate shortfalls in drydock capacity, since  an increase in the number of ships will lead to an increase in the volume  of maintenance the shipyards must perform.", "In its 2017 draft drydock study, the Navy identified several key drydock  shortfalls that hinder the shipyards\u2019 ability to support future operational  needs, as previously discussed. For example, none of the existing  drydocks can support repairs for the new Ford-class aircraft carrier as the  drydocks are currently configured. Specifically, Drydock 8 at Norfolk  Naval Shipyard and Drydock 6 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard\u2014the two  drydocks currently capable of supporting existing Nimitz-class aircraft  carriers\u2014require upgrades in salt water cooling utilities to support  maintenance on the new Ford-class aircraft carriers, because the Ford- class carriers are larger and have different equipment. The Navy has  plans to begin addressing this issue at Norfolk in fiscal year 2022 and at  Puget Sound in fiscal year 2023. Navy officials told us that the Navy has  not yet defined its needs for drydocks capable of supporting Ford-class  aircraft carriers, but it will need at least one on each coast.", "Newer versions of the Virginia-class submarines will limit the number of  drydocks able to perform maintenance in the future, thereby reducing the  capacity available to the fleet. According to the 2017 draft Navy analysis,  17 of the shipyards\u2019 18 existing drydocks can support maintenance on the  current Los Angeles-class attack submarine, and 14 of the 18 can  accommodate the current versions of the Virginia-class attack submarine.  However, only 11 of the 18 drydocks, in their current state, will be able to  accommodate future versions of the Virginia-class submarine with the  Virginia Payload Module because of its increased length and loading  size. This drydock shortfall caused by the addition of this module is  exacerbated at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, where there is a drydock  that can be divided in two to support simultaneous maintenance of either  two Los Angeles-class or two current Virginia-class submarines. Future  Virginia-class submarines with the module are so long that they require  the full length of the drydock, thereby reducing the space available for  maintenance at Pearl Harbor.

In a results-oriented management  approach, identifying a specific analytically-based goal or end state is  essential for accurately determining the costs of achieving that goal,  because different end-states could require different shipyard  configurations\u2014which in turn would require different facilities and  equipment.

Identifying the  necessary resources is essential in order to acquire and prioritize the use  of those resources. Without identifying the full resources required to  address the shipyard\u2019s relevant needs and reach analytically-based  goals, decision makers will lack the information needed to support  deliberations and determine an appropriate level of resources to allocate  to the naval shipyards.", "The Navy has estimated $3.6 billion in funding needs, or an average  of $304 million per year, to address shipyard facility needs and bring  shipyard facilities up to an average condition rating of 75, which is still  considered \u201cpoor.\u201d This amount exceeds the shipyards\u2019 average  yearly allotment for facilities of about $260 million by $44 million (a 17  percent increase).", "The Navy also estimates that it will need $2.0 billion over the next 12  years (or an average of $167 million per year) for capital equipment.

The Navy projects  that the planning costs associated with its drydock improvements will  be at least $284 million over the 12 years\u2014roughly 8 percent of the  total project costs\u2014although shipyard officials have noted that  planning costs can easily exceed 10 percent of a project\u2019s total cost.  This suggests that the planning costs for the $3.6 billion in facilities  projects identified by the Navy could increase the total cost of these  projects by several hundred million dollars.", "Utilities modernization costs have not been not fully identified:  NAVFAC has identified about $190 million in additional utilities  projects through fiscal year 2023 that are not already in one of the  other Navy plans, but it has not identified the improvements needed  beyond fiscal year 2023. The Navy\u2019s 2013 plan did not include the  cost of modernizing utilities, though it noted that efforts were under  way to develop cost estimates for their recapitalization. The Navy  previously reported in its 2013 facilities plan that shipyards  experienced unscheduled utility outages that can disrupt maintenance  schedules and lead to increased fuel and labor costs. Navy officials  acknowledge the ongoing need to modernize utilities and other wired  systems at the shipyards. For example, the fire alarm systems at the  shipyards continue to rely on the same bare-wire telegraph  technology that was used in the 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s, which is  easily damaged and regularly elicits false alarms. However, according  to officials, they have not determined the full amount of investment  that would be required to modernize utilities at the shipyards to  provide a stable electrical supply at the proper voltages with fewer  unplanned outages.", "Regulatory compliance costs may be under stated: Shipyard  facilities are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements, stemming  from both DOD and statutory sources. Like other military installations,  shipyards must comply with anti-terrorism, force protection, seismic,  and building code requirements. However, given the limited resources  devoted to planning, current plans to improve shipyard facilities,  equipment, and drydocks do not address the effect of some of these  statutory and regulatory requirements. Anti-terror and force protection,  seismic, building codes, and other requirements to improve the health  and safety of shipyard personnel can increase the amount of funding  required to complete capital investment projects, particularly when  compliance efforts overlap. For example, DOD regulations require that  when the cost of a project reaches 30 percent of the replacement  value of the facility, seismic assessments must be conducted, and if a  project\u2019s cost exceeds 50 percent of the facility\u2019s replacement value,  anti-terror and force protection measures must be included in the  project. According to shipyard officials, the DOD requirements that  must be met after a project exceeds the 30 percent threshold are  sometimes costly enough to make it exceed the 50 percent threshold,  and the results of overlapping requirements can be difficult to predict.  This can result in the cost of relatively simple projects increasing  significantly, as indicated by the example in figure 10, illustrating an  actual project at Norfolk Naval Shipyard developed between fiscal  years 2010 and 2015.", "Building 30 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard is used for engineering, and is over  120 years old. The costs to bring it up to modern building code were  significant. This example may not be representative of the potential  growth of project costs, but the age of shipyard facilities, the extent of  historic designations, and the Navy\u2019s acknowledged history of under  investment at the shipyards highlight the potential for other shipyard  facilities to encounter similar issues. This suggests that the Navy\u2019s  estimated restoration and modernization backlog of $4.86 billion may  actually be under stated.", "Historic preservation costs may be under stated: Our analysis and  Navy documents show that dealing with historic facilities also adds  cost and complexity to planning for their restoration. The preservation,  restoration, or demolition of historic buildings requires additional time  and cost to plan, gain necessary approvals, and execute. In its 2013  facility plan, the Navy reported that approximately 70 percent of the  shipyard infrastructure was designated as historic; all four shipyards  have historic facilities, some because of the age of the facilities and  some because of events that took place there. For example, the  attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II has resulted in the  designation of approximately 3 million square feet of its facilities as  historic; this means that the footprint of the historic part of the  shipyard exceeds that of its non-historic facilities. Shipyard officials  told us that there are several facilities that might be used to more  effectively support shipyard operations but that either they cannot be  altered because they have been designated as historic or that  alterations would require lengthy negotiations over the facilities\u2019  historic designation. For example, officials at Pearl Harbor Naval  Shipyard discussed a number of modernization efforts that might be  undertaken to improve Navy capabilities in the Pacific but that cannot  be completed because the facilities have been designated as historic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy\u2019s Approach Lacks Metrics to Gauge the Effectiveness of Its Capital Investment Plans", "paragraphs": ["The Navy lacks metrics that would help determine the effectiveness of its  capital investment plans to help guide long-term planning.

Our work  shows that the Navy tracks the performance of its shipyards in completing  ship maintenance on budget and on time but not how facilities and  equipment are supporting the shipyards\u2019 performance. Specifically, we  found that the shipyards\u2019 primary performance metrics are tied to ship  maintenance\u2014for example, how quickly a ship is repaired, how much  overtime is used, and cost and schedule overruns\u2014and do not provide a  sufficient basis for measuring the effect of capital investments on shipyard  performance. The Navy also collects data on its facilities, including the  aforementioned configuration and condition assessments, along with data  on repairs, utilities outages, and maintenance response times. However,  this information is not used to assess the efficacy of the capital  investment program. For example, according to NAVSEA officials, the  Navy does not monitor when facility or equipment issues contribute to  schedule delays or increase maintenance costs (such as when equipment  failures prevent work) or the costs associated with deferring investment  (e.g., foregone efficiencies, costs to repair obsolete equipment, costs of  workarounds, or temporary facility costs). However, we found that  deferring investment can lead to decreased efficiency in other areas. For  example, our analysis of equipment repair data found that equipment  repair requests have been increasing and that this increase could reflect  the effect of deferred maintenance.

The shipyards, which provided depot-level maintenance, were  managed through a working capital fund. The working capital fund relied  on payments from Navy forces\u2014such as a ship\u2014for services at a  shipyard. This funding approach was intended to (1) generate sufficient  resources to cover the full costs of the shipyards\u2019 operations and (2)  operate on a break-even basis over time\u2014that is, neither make a gain nor  incur a loss. The Department of Defense (DOD) directed Navy funds to  the Navy forces seeking the repairs, and those forces acted as customers  and paid for the maintenance they received from the shipyards (see figure  12). The Navy\u2019s intermediate maintenance facilities, which provided  intermediate-level maintenance, were funded via direct funding. Under  the direct funding mechanism, the Navy allotted a portion of the money  appropriated to it by Congress to fund the shipyards (see figure 12).", "In 1997, the Navy began to integrate its intermediate maintenance  facilities with its shipyards in an attempt to improve workforce flexibility  and reduce maintenance infrastructure. To achieve this, the Navy decided  to standardize the funding mechanism. The Navy moved the shipyards to  a direct funding mechanism, in part because the shipyard\u2019s largest  customer\u2014the Pacific Fleet\u2014was already funded in that manner and  Navy officials believed that adopting a direct funding approach for  shipyard maintenance would be simpler than changing the Fleet\u2019s funding  mechanism. Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard shifted from working capital  funding to direct funding on October 1, 1998 as a pilot program. The Navy  conducted this pilot for two years and concluded that shipyard metrics  generally either improved or stayed the same over that time. As a result,  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard followed and changed funding mechanisms  on October 1, 2003. Congress briefly paused the funding transition  process for the East Coast shipyards in order to have the Navy provide a  report on the effectiveness of the transition at Puget Sound. After the  Navy submitted its report, the transition continued, and Portsmouth Naval  Shipyard and Norfolk Naval Shipyard transitioned to the direct funding  mechanism on October 1, 2006, the earliest transition date that Congress  had allowed.", "In previous reports, both we and the Congressional Budget Office noted  that there were potential advantages and disadvantages to both funding  mechanisms. However, we did not suggest that the Navy should prefer  one method over the other; rather, we recommended that the Navy take  steps to ensure financial transparency at the shipyards after the transition  to direct funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shipyards after the Transition to Direct Funding", "paragraphs": ["Since the two remaining shipyards transitioned to a direct funding  mechanism at the beginning of fiscal year 2007, capital investment at the  shipyards has been higher than the 6 percent minimum mandated by  Congress and has increased at about the same pace as overall shipyard  funding. Shipyard officials have not identified any persistent problems as  a result of the funding transition and were generally unable to identify any  potential benefits of returning to a working capital fund mechanism."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Shipyard Spending and Capital Investment since Fiscal Year 2007", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal year 2007\u2014the first year that all shipyards were  completely supported by direct funding\u2014and fiscal year 2017, total  shipyard spending has increased by about 34 percent, in fiscal year 2016  constant dollars (see figure 13).", "Over that same time period, capital investment at the shipyards, in fiscal  year 2016 constant dollars, has increased at about the same rate\u201435  percent\u2014and has remained over the 6 percent minimum mandated by  Congress (see figure 14).", "Navy officials at all four shipyards stated that they had not identified any  significant concerns about the change from working capital to direct  funding. For example, although the CBO report suggested that financial  accountability might decrease under a direct funding mechanism, officials  stated that working within the annual allotment of appropriated funds\u2014as  opposed to a constantly replenishing working capital fund\u2014has forced  shipyard officials to pay greater attention to costs than they had  previously. In addition, officials at all four shipyards stated that after the  initial transition was complete, the change in funding mechanisms had  little effect on either the quality or the cost of the work being performed.", "Officials also noted that, under each funding mechanism, there are  reasons that capital investment may remain relatively low. Shipyard  capital investment (not including military construction) under the working  capital mechanism was previously re-captured by the shipyards in the  form of increased labor costs. They stated that, as a result, there was an  incentive to keep capital investment low, so that the fleet would not defer  maintenance and repair work in response to higher daily rates for labor.  Under the direct funding mechanism, shipyard capital investment must  compete with other projects Navy wide, which may also result in  restraining investment."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Condition and Performance of the Individual Naval Shipyards", "paragraphs": ["There are four Navy-operated shipyards: Norfolk Naval Shipyard,  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and  Intermediate Maintenance Facility, and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and  Intermediate Maintenance Facility.
