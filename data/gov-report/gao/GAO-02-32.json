In our testimony, which is reprinted in  appendix I, we reported that the two Navy units we reviewed had a  significant breakdown in internal controls over the $68 million in fiscal year  2000 purchase card transactions that we tested, leaving the Space and  Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) Systems Center and the Navy  Public Works Center vulnerable to fraudulent, improper, and abusive  purchases and theft and misuse of government property.  This report  summarizes the results of our review and makes specific recommendations  for corrective action.", "Overview of Testimony In our testimony, we stated that a weak internal control environment at the  SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego and the Navy Public Works Center San  Diego contributed to internal control weaknesses, fraud, and abuse.  Our  specific findings included the following.", "Neither SPAWAR nor the Navy Public Works Center had effective  policies for issuance of purchase cards, establishing credit limits, and  minimizing the federal government\u2019s financial exposure.  Any employee  having supervisory approval could get a card.  These units did not  perform credit checks on prospective cardholders.", "Nearly half of SPAWAR\u2019s fiscal year 2000 purchase card transactions and  over half of the Navy Public Works Center\u2019s transactions were made by  employees who did not have documented evidence of timely training.", "Policies for rebate management were deficient, including a lack of  procedures to maximize rebates and ensure that bank calculations of  rebates were correct.", "Management was not effectively utilizing internal reviews and audits to  determine whether purchase card internal controls were being  effectively implemented.", "Three basic internal controls that we tested\u2014 (1) independent,  documented receipt and acceptance of goods and services,  (2) independent, documented certification of monthly purchase card  statements, and (3) proper accounting for purchase card transactions\u2014 were ineffective.  In addition, we found that easily pilferable or sensitive  items included in statistical samples of transactions that we tested were  not recorded in the units\u2019 accountable property records, as required, to  help prevent theft, loss, and misuse of government assets.  The two units  did not record a total of 46 of the 65 accountable items included in our  sampled transactions in their property records, and they were unable to  provide conclusive evidence that 31 of the 65 items, including laptop  computers, personal digital assistants (PDA) such as Palm Pilots, and  digital cameras, were in the possession of the government.", "Weak internal controls contributed to five recent Naval Audit Service cases  of alleged purchase card fraud related to Navy units in the San Diego area,  including two involving Navy Public Works Center employees.  One case  has been successfully prosecuted, while the remaining four cases are still  under investigation.  According to Naval Criminal Investigative Service  investigators, one of the ongoing cases involved as many as 2,600  compromised Navy San Diego purchase card accounts, including 684  accounts for which specific account number information was obtained.  As  of May 21, 2001, we identified 22 compromised SPAWAR accounts that  were still open.  The financial exposure related to credit limits associated  with these 22 accounts is $900,000.", "The specific internal control weaknesses that we identified at the two units  we reviewed contributed to additional purchases that we believe are  potentially fraudulent, improper, or abusive.", "We found records of unauthorized, potentially fraudulent purchases of  personal items, including cosmetics, gift certificates, and clothing at  both units.  We referred these transactions to our Office of Special  Investigations for further investigation.", "The abusive purchases we identified relate primarily to SPAWAR San  Diego and include items purchased at excessive cost, or items of  questionable government need, or both.  For example, we found  purchases for flat panel computer monitors costing from about $800 to  $2,500 each, compared to standard General Services Administration  (GSA) schedule monitors costing about $300 each.", "We also found routine purchases without documented government need  at SPAWAR, including personal digital assistants, such as Palm Pilots, as  well as purchases of $100 designer Palm Pilot carrying cases and two  $400 designer briefcases.  The Navy Public Works Center San Diego also  had numerous purchases of personal digital assistants.  It appears that  these items and the flat panel monitors were purchased to satisfy the  personal preferences of purchase cardholders.", "Improper transactions involved SPAWAR\u2019s use of federal funds for  personal items, such as flowers for Secretary\u2019s Day and food for  employees, and the purchase of a $1,500 file cabinet from Macy\u2019s.   Although purchases of file cabinets are subject to rules prescribed in  Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations, we found no documented  evidence that SPAWAR followed these rules.", "We also identified a number of purchases made on the same day from  the same vendor, which appeared to circumvent cardholder single  transaction limits and the more stringent $2,500 micropurchase  threshold.

DOD and Navy witnesses stated that they would examine these  issues.", "When we brought the control failures and other issues we identified to the  attention of the Executive Officer at the Navy Public Works Center San  Diego, he demonstrated a proactive position to identifying and correcting  the weaknesses.

DOD maintained that in accordance with  DOD policy, the Navy's decentralized execution of the purchase card  program allows individual commands to issue purchase cards to employees  as mission requirements warrant.  DOD noted that the Naval Supply  Systems Command\u2019s recently released policy implementing DOD \u201cSpan of  Control Goals\u201d will result in approving officials being responsible for  review and payment certification of a reasonable number of cardholder  statements. DOD's \"Span of Control Goals\" states that as a general rule,  billing officials should have no more than five to seven cardholders  assigned to them for oversight.", "We agree with DOD that our recommendation is intended, in part, to ensure  a manageable span of control between approving, or billing, officials and  cardholders. At SPAWAR, we found only one approving official responsible  for reviewing and certifying payment of 1,526 cardholders' monthly  purchase card statements, creating a substantial span of control issue.   Providing several hundred approving officials to create a reasonable span  of control over SPAWAR's 1,526 cardholders would not be a practical or  economical course of action for SPAWAR.  We found no valid justification  for 1,526, 36 percent, of SPAWAR's employees to have purchase cards.   Further, the intent of our recommendation is broader than the span of  control issue.  We are also concerned about the financial exposure  associated with the excessive number of cardholders.  As stated in our  testimony, the two Navy units had given purchase cards to over 1,700  employees, most of whom had credit limits of $20,000 or more and the  authority to make their own purchase decisions.  For example, most of  SPAWAR's 1,526 cardholders had a $25,000 credit limit and most of the  Navy Public Works Center's 254 cardholders had a $20,000 credit limit.  The  proliferation of cardholders, particularly at SPAWAR San Diego,  significantly increased the government's financial exposure and created a  situation where it was virtually impossible to maintain a positive control  environment.  To reduce the financial exposure associated with the large  number of cardholders, we continue to recommend that the two Navy  commands establish specific policies and strategies governing the number  of purchase cards to be issued with a focus on minimizing the number of  cardholders.   In addition, the Naval Supply Systems Command guidance  implementing the Department's \"Span of Control Goals\" merely restates  DOD\u2019s guideline that approving officials should have no more than five to  seven cardholders under their purview\u2014it does not provide specific  guidance for reducing the number of cardholders.", "DOD also stated that the criteria for employees being issued purchase  cards should be a function of mission requirements and the level of trust  between the cardholder and supervisor.  Further, DOD stated that the Navy  believes the supervisor's judgment is sufficient as to the trustworthiness of  the employee to obligate on the part of the government.  We continue to  believe that DOD should assess the feasibility and cost benefit of  performing credit checks on employees prior to issuing a purchase card.   Individuals who have a history of personal credit problems are more likely  to improperly use their government purchase cards if their access to  personal credit has been limited.  In fact, our review of the Navy purchase  card fraud cases discussed in our testimony shows this to be true for at  least one of the cases.  Further, as discussed in our testimony, we identified  several cases of potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive transactions  at both the SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego and the Navy Public Works  Center San Diego that had been certified as proper for payment.  We are  continuing to investigate several of these cases as part of our follow-up  work and plan to assess the correlation between fraudulent, abusive, and  improper use of the government purchase card and cardholders who have  personal credit problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criteria on the Types of Items That Can Be Acquired Using a Purchase Card", "paragraphs": ["DOD stated that it is the responsibility of the local Navy commands to  establish written policies and procedures and ensure that purchases are  made for official use, meet mission requirements, and are made at a fair  and reasonable price.  DOD also stated that due to differing and unique  mission requirements throughout the Navy, it is difficult to develop a  general listing of what items can be purchased with or without special  justification.  For example, DOD stated that ticket purchases to Disneyland  may be an appropriate purchase not requiring special justification within a  \u201cNon-Appropriated Funded activity,\u201d but may require such documentation  for an \u201cAppropriated Funded activity.\u201d", "We continue to believe there is a need for Navy-wide guidance in the form  of written policies and criteria requiring documented justifications and  procurement management approval for types of items can be acquired with  a government purchase card.  For example, we found some instances  where employees were buying flat panel monitors costing from $800 to  $2,500 each while others were buying traditional monitors costing about  $300 each.  In addition, at SPAWAR, we found that employees made abusive  purchases of high-cost personal items, including two designer brief cases  costing about $400 each and several designer palm pilot cases costing  about $100 each.  In these instances, the decision of what to buy and the  quality of the items purchased often appeared to be a matter of cardholder  preference.  Further, the fact that such purchases were not questioned  supports our recommendation that specific written guidelines be  established for purchases of these types of items.  DOD\u2019s example of the  purchase of tickets for Disneyland is another example of the type of  purchase card use that should be specifically addressed in the NAVSUP  Instruction 4200.94 to avoid misuse of the card and abusive purchases.

The  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. 13.301(a), states that the  Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card \"may be used only for  purchases that are otherwise authorized by law or regulations.\"   Therefore,  a procurement using the purchase card is lawful only if it would be lawful  using conventional procurement methods.  Further, the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) requires agencies to establish guidance on approved  uses of the government purchase card and limitations on types of  transactions permitted.  The NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94 policy statement  does not address these specific purchase card requirements of the FAR or  the TFM.", "As stated in our testimony, without statutory authority, appropriated funds  may not be used to furnish meals or refreshments to employees within their  normal duty stations.  Free food and other refreshments normally cannot  be justified as a necessary expense of an agency's appropriation because  these items are considered personal expenses that federal employees  should pay for from their own salaries.  Likewise, appropriated funds may  not be used to purchase gifts for employees or others unless an agency can  demonstrate that the items further the purposes for which the  appropriation was enacted.  The purchase of the flowers and food were  both personal rather than official in nature and, therefore, may not be paid  for with appropriated funds.

We are concerned that DOD\u2019s support of the current process  whereby Agency Program Coordinators report the results of their purchase  card internal reviews to their unit\u2019s contracting activity or their local  commanding officer will not ensure that the results of purchase card  internal reviews are fully communicated to central Navy management to  support oversight and corrective actions on systemic control weaknesses.   During our review, we found documented evidence that SPAWAR  management ignored written reports on results of Agency Program  Coordinator internal reviews, which identified problems that are consistent  with the control weaknesses discussed in our testimony and summarized in  this report.  For example, SPAWAR Agency Program Coordinator reviews  identified the lack of independent documentation that the Navy had  received items ordered by purchase card, accountable items that were not  recorded in the property records, inadequate documentation for  transactions, split purchases, and transactions that did not appear to be  related to government business purposes.  SPAWAR San Diego  management ignored the internal review results, primarily due to  complaints from cardholders and their supervisors regarding the  administrative burden associated with procedural changes that would be  needed to address the review findings.  Further, although the Naval Audit  Service reviewed Navy Public Works Center San Diego purchase card  activity and the SPAWAR San Diego Command Inspector General reviewed  SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego purchase card activities, reports were  not issued on the results of either of these reviews. Therefore, we continue  to recommend that Agency Program Coordinators report any internal  control weaknesses identified during semiannual reviews to the  Commander of the Naval Supply Systems Command in addition to their  unit commanders.", "Comment 3. While DOD stated that using a single object class for all micro- purchases streamlines the accounting process and reduces the numbers of  problem disbursements resulting from manual keystrokes when entering  such data, this practice results in unreliable expense data.  As we stated in  our testimony, aggregating all micro-purchases under one object class does  not show the nature and type of expenditures made using purchase cards.", "Because SPAWAR San Diego and the Navy Public Works Center San Diego  did not ensure that their detail transaction records reflected the proper  classification of expense, 100 percent of the SPAWAR and Navy Public  Works Center transactions in our samples were recorded to the wrong  object class.  For example, although the majority of the SPAWAR purchase  card transactions in our sample\u201476 transactions totaling over $73,000\u2014 were for equipment purchases, none of these transactions were properly  classified and recorded.  Further, SPAWAR did not maintain sufficient  documentation to determine the correct object class for 15 of the  transactions in our sample totaling $12,000.  Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget  Estimates, requires federal agencies to report obligations and  expenditures by object class, such as salaries, benefits, travel, supplies,  services, and equipment, to indicate the nature of expenditures of federal  funds.  Accurate object classification data are critical to the reliability of  information reported in the President's budget submission and budget  projections and other analyses that are based on these data.  In addition,  because the Congress has asked for and is using object class information  for its oversight activities, it is important that these data be properly  recorded.  Therefore, we continue to recommend that detail purchase card  transaction records reflect the proper object classification of expense.   Further, an appropriate procedure for summarizing detail purchase card  transactions would be to record a separate summary record for each  classification of expense--such as services, supplies, and equipment.", "Comment 4. The steps outlined in DOD's response do not ensure that  cardholders will obtain reasonable prices or the best value.  For example,  we found numerous examples of individual purchases of computers and  property items, and purchases of services, such as the installation of  upgraded computer software, that were not made as part of a negotiated  contract or a bulk purchase.  Because these purchases did not appear to be  cost-effective, we continue to recommend that the Navy determine  whether the purchase card is (1) the right vehicle for acquiring certain  items and services and (2) if items, such as computers, should be procured  individually or through bulk purchases.
