DOD generally assumed that identified providers were of sufficient quality. GAO found that DOD considered the quality of nearby civilian providers for one of 11 selected MTFs. In this instance, information from the MTF about the variable quality of nearby civilian health care led to DOD's determination that such care was not yet adequate to support MTF restructuring. Officials GAO interviewed from other MTFs discussed concerns about quality of care from nearby civilian providers.", "Civilian health care assessments did not account for access to an accurate and adequate number of providers near MTFs. DOD may have included in its assessments providers who do not meet DOD's access-to-care standards for certain beneficiaries. For 11 selected MTFs, GAO found that about 56 percent of civilian primary care providers and 42 percent of civilian specialty providers that DOD identified as being nearby exceeded DOD's drive-time standards. Including such providers in its assessments means that DOD could have overestimated the adequacy of civilian health care providers in proximity to some MTFs.", "Cost-effectiveness assessments were based on a single set of assumptions. DOD concluded that civilian health care was more cost-effective than care in its MTFs without considering other assumptions that could affect its conclusions. For example, DOD applied assumptions about the cost of military personnel salaries, MTF workloads, and reimbursement rates for TRICARE that likely underestimated the cost-effectiveness of MTFs.", "GAO also found that DOD conducted limited assessments of MTFs' support to the readiness of military primary care and nonphysician medical providers\u2014an issue DOD officials stated they will address during MTF transitions. Until DOD resolves methodology gaps by using more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality, access, and cost-effectiveness, DOD leaders may not fully understand risks to their objectives in restructuring future MTFs.", "DOD's Plan identified actions needed to facilitate MTF restructuring, but the department is not well positioned to execute the transitions. DOD's Plan poses challenges for the military departments and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) related to MTF providers' readiness. Yet, DOD plans to move forward with restructuring without a process to monitor progress and challenges. By establishing roles and responsibilities for executing and monitoring MTF restructuring transitions, DOD can be better positioned to navigate organizational boundaries between the DHA that manages the MTFs and the military departments that provide staff. Additionally, by defining measurable objectives and progress thresholds, DOD can better ensure it is meeting objectives and facilitating timely adjustments to MTF restructuring transitions, as needed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that future MTF assessments use more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality, access, and cost-effectiveness; and that DOD establish roles, responsibilities, and progress thresholds for MTF transitions.

We also obtained the fiscal years 2017 and 2018  data DOD used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of MTF-provided direct  care relative to civilian-provided purchased care. Using these data, we performed a sensitivity analysis by recalculating the unit-level cost of care  under different assumptions, such as omitting military personnel salaries  given that DOD has characterized these as a fixed cost. We assessed  the reliability of each data source for DOD\u2019s and our calculations of cost- effectiveness by administering questionnaires about the data to those  who have quality control responsibilities, interviewing responsible DOD  officials, reviewing the data for outliers and missing values, and reviewing  our prior reports about the data.

According to Work Group officials,  these assessments supplemented the criteria on readiness and civilian  health care adequacy by lending a resource-informed perspective to the  overall methodology. A determination that an MTF\u2019s unit costs exceeded  those of nearby purchased care would confirm to the Work Group that it  should consider replacing health care services from that MTF with  purchased care, provided that the group had first determined that the  corresponding capabilities (1) were not needed to support readiness, and  (2) could be adequately replaced with purchased care from civilian health  care providers nearby.", "Table 2 below illustrates an example of the 703 Work Group\u2019s calculation  of cost-effectiveness at one MTF it evaluated\u2014the 2nd Medical Group  outpatient clinic at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

Unlike a clinical readiness metric, a productivity goal does not account for  the types of workload needed for readiness.

A certain portion of the providers listed for each of the  11 selected MTFs were outside the drive-time standards, based on our  analysis. In addition, for each of the 11 selected MTFs, there was one or  more inaccuracies in the provider listing, such as providers that were no  longer in practice, duplicate providers, or those that were  mischaracterized as a medical provider. MTF officials we interviewed also  expressed concerns that the assessments did not account for traffic,  including bridges and tunnels that create traffic chokepoints.

On the basis of our analysis of the assumptions  and related data elements, and interviews with DOD officials, we found  that the assumptions do not account for uncertainties that could affect  conclusions about an MTF\u2019s cost-effectiveness. Specifically, DOD made  assumptions about the costs of military personnel salaries, the workload  performed at MTFs, and the reimbursement rates for TRICARE that  individually and collectively likely result in the underestimation of the cost- effectiveness of MTFs, as described in more detail below.", "Including the full cost of military medical personnel does not  account for their value outside of MTFs in support of military  operations. DOD included the full cost of active-duty medical  personnel salaries when calculating the unit-level cost of MTF health  care. This approach assumed that military personnel spend all their  time in MTFs. However, military personnel who staff MTFs sometimes  spend half or more of their time contributing to other military work  activities, according to MHS officials. These personnel are essential  for military operations outside the MTFs. Accordingly, DOD referred to  its medical personnel as a \u201cfixed cost\u201d in the Modernization Study. In  its interim report to Congress for section 721 of the NDAA for Fiscal  Year 2017, DOD determined that about 111,000 active-duty personnel  are essential to support its war plans as part of the operational  medical force. By including the full cost of military personnel salaries  in calculations of the unit-level cost of MTF-provided care, DOD has  likely underestimated the cost-effectiveness of MTFs given the dual  purpose of active-duty medical personnel who staff MTFs but spend  time on other military duties and deploy to support operations.  According to MTF officials, some portion of the cost of military  personnel salaries could be considered an approximation of the \u201ccost  of medical force readiness\u201d for the wartime mission, though an  imperfect one.", "Units of health care may underreport workload performed at  MTFs. DOD calculated the cost of delivering a single unit (e.g.,  wRVU), of care at its MTFs. Doing so likely underestimates the cost- effectiveness of MTFs given concerns that wRVUs may be  underreported. MTF officials at all 11 locations and 703 Work Group  members agreed that wRVUs are likely underreported within MTFs for  various reasons. For example, some MTF services are not recorded  in wRVUs, such as telehealth consultations, which comprise a  growing share of patient encounters, according to MTF officials. In  addition, in February 2019 we reported that source data for DOD\u2019s  clinical readiness metric for physicians\u2014the same data MTFs use to  record wRVUs\u2014had not passed DOD audits for at least 3 years.  Likewise, in April 2016, we reported concerns that providers\u2019 workload  at MTFs was not being accurately recorded.", "TRICARE reimbursement rates for purchased care will likely  need to increase. In comparing the cost-effectiveness of direct care  at MTFs to purchased care from civilian providers in the TRICARE  networks, DOD applied current TRICARE reimbursement rates in its  calculations. MTF and 703 Work Group officials, along with senior  MHS leaders, agreed that DOD may need to pay higher  reimbursement rates in the future to attract new, quality network  providers as its reliance on purchased care for beneficiaries increases  in proportion to the decrease in access to health care services at  many MTFs. In addition, MTF officials and MHS leaders stated that  utilization of some purchased-care services from civilian providers  may be higher than utilization of like services at MTFs because  civilian providers are not incentivized to manage health services and  costs the way the MHS does. This means that the cost of purchased  care could increase by more than expected if utilization rates  increase. For example, a research study completed in 2017 found that  an estimated 21 percent of purchased medical care in the United  States is attributed to unnecessary costs associated with  overtreatment. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine reported that  unnecessary services are the largest contributor to waste in the U.S.  health care system, and could have accounted for about $210 billion  in excess spending in 2009.", "By applying a single set of assumptions as described above, DOD\u2019s  assessment of the cost-effectiveness of MTFs was not consistent with a  key practice in economic analysis. Our assessment methodology for  economic analysis states that a sensitivity analysis is an essential  element of a high-quality analysis of cost-effectiveness. Likewise, a  DOD instruction on economic analysis states that analyses of investment  alternatives should include, among other things, a sensitivity analysis,  accounting for uncertainties by testing the sensitivity of the economic  analysis results against various factors. A sensitivity analysis examines  the effects that changes to key assumptions have on the analytic  outcome and are helpful to understanding risk.", "To demonstrate the effect of a single set of assumptions versus an  analytical approach that explored other assumptions, we adjusted some  of the assumptions for illustrative purposes. Our analysis found that for  two of seven MTFs we evaluated in detail, changing DOD\u2019s assumptions  in only one respect\u2014by subtracting military personnel salaries\u2014would  have materially affected DOD\u2019s assessment about whether direct care at  the MTF was more cost-effective than purchased care. Further, if military  personnel salaries are excluded from the assessments and TRICARE  reimbursement rates increase by 5 percent, three of the seven MTFs  would be more cost-effective than purchased care. For illustrative  purposes, figure 2 shows how alternative assumptions could change both  the data (i.e., costs and wRVUs) and the results of the assessments as to  whether an MTF is more or less cost effective than purchased care.", "According to officials from the 703 Work Group, they did not apply  alternative assumptions to analyze cost-effectiveness because readiness  and the adequacy of civilian health care were more important in their  methodology, and they generally assumed that purchased care is less  costly. However, DOD could still maintain its prioritization sequence while  augmenting its cost-effectiveness analyses with a sensitivity analysis to  help provide more complete information for decision-making and, in the  future, for executing MTF transitions.

The officials also  stated that another mitigation plan will be to allow MTFs that become  active-duty clinics to diversify the patient population available to providers  by treating some family members and retirees. MTF officials we spoke  with were encouraged that continuing to treat some family members and  retirees could help address the provider readiness shortfalls they believe  are inherent to becoming an active-duty clinic. However, they and senior  MHS leaders were concerned about the prospect of differentiating among  such beneficiaries in terms of who may be eligible for MTF care at an  active-duty clinic. To that end, officials stated that having the DHA clarify  its roles and responsibilities in executing this flexibility will be a helpful  step.", "To address challenges in maintaining the clinical readiness of medical  providers assigned to MTFs that restructure, 703 Work Group officials  stated that existing MHS partnerships with civilian hospitals and the  Department of Veterans Affairs should be sufficient for MTF providers  along with other available mechanisms, such as temporary duty at other  MTFs. However, MHS leaders stated that existing civilian partnerships, in  particular, may not have sufficient capacity to take on additional military  medical personnel.

In doing so, DOD could also be better positioned to address challenges in  executing transitions, such as those that arise with mitigating providers\u2019  clinical readiness challenges and MTF staffing gaps during transitions.  Then, by defining measurable objectives, goals, and thresholds for  tracking the progress of MTF transitions\u2014such as the clinical readiness  of providers, quality and accessibility of quality health care, and cost- effectiveness\u2014DOD could better ensure its objectives are being met and  help facilitate timely adjustments to the transitions, as needed."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As MHS leaders have acknowledged, correctly aligning MTF  infrastructure to the size of the armed forces, the medical forces, and their  desired readiness levels is essential to balancing mission requirements  within available resources.

Notwithstanding the work DOD has  undertaken in making a series of analytically-based determinations for  restructuring in its Plan, our review highlighted several gaps in DOD\u2019s  methodology. Until DOD takes action to address these gaps by using  more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality,  access, and cost-effectiveness, DOD leaders may not fully understand  risks to the achievement of their objectives in restructuring future MTFs.", "DOD officials agree that some MTF restructuring actions may be more  challenging than others. These challenges could be exacerbated by  concurrent MHS reform efforts, including the transition of MTF  administration and management to the DHA.

(Recommendation 1)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the Surgeons General of  the military departments and the Director of the DHA, consistently collect  complete and accurate information about the extent to which current  health care providers within the TRICARE networks meet access-to-care  standards, and assess that information to inform recommendations on  future MTF restructuring decisions. (Recommendation 2)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the Surgeons General of  the military departments and the Director of the DHA, consistently collect  complete and accurate information about the extent to which non-network  civilian health care providers that could be incorporated into the TRICARE  network meet access-to-care standards in terms of drive time, and assess  that information to inform recommendations on future MTF restructuring  decisions. (Recommendation 3)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs, in coordination with the Surgeons General of  the military departments and the Director of the DHA, conducts a  sensitivity analysis of the relative cost-effectiveness of MTF-provided care  compared to civilian-provided care under varying assumptions, and  document that information for decision makers to inform  recommendations on future MTF restructuring decisions. Varying  conditions could include different types of health care services, reducing  the cost of military personnel salaries, and increasing estimated MTF  wRVUs and civilian reimbursement rates.

In its response, the department  described actions it is taking and plans to take to implement both  recommendations.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation\u2014to collect  complete and accurate information about the quality of available civilian  health care in proximity to its MTFs and assess that information to inform  recommendations for future MTF restructuring. DOD stated that complete  and accurate information on the quality of available care would require  substantial resources to accomplish on a routine basis. To that end, DOD  stated that until standardized quality data becomes readily available, it  intends to collect this level of information as needed to support actions at  a particular MTF. As noted in our report, we have previously reported that  standardized information about hospital and outpatient care quality is  available through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and has  been widely adopted by major private insurers. As the restructuring of the  MTFs continues and DOD relies to a greater extent on civilian-provided  care, it will be important for the department to monitor the quality of care it  purchases on behalf of beneficiaries. Thus, we continue to believe that  DOD should make it a priority to collect and assess such information.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation\u2014to  consistently collect complete and accurate information about the extent to  which current health care providers within the TRICARE networks meet  access-to-care standards, and assess that information to inform  recommendations on future MTF restructuring decisions. In its response,  DOD stated that each month, TRICARE contractors report, by specialty,  average wait times from referral placement to patient appointment.  Further, DOD stated that it is piloting centralized booking of MTF and  network appointments, which, if successful, will result in more complete,  accurate, and timely network access information. In cases where access  standards are not being met, DOD explained that it works to mitigate the  access shortfall either through MTF or expanded network resources.", "We agree that TRICARE\u2019s monthly reports on patient wait times for  appointments are a helpful tool for DOD in monitoring access to care, and  that the pilot for centralized appointment booking is also a promising step.  As we noted in our report, however, DOD\u2019s analyses of the adequacy of  civilian health care in proximity to MTFs were based on network provider  directories that are of questionable accuracy and can overstate the  number of available providers. MTF officials we interviewed stated that  TRICARE directories in their area overstated the number of providers  accepting new TRICARE patients.", "Even if the provider directory issues have not led to access-to-care  challenges in the past in terms of patients\u2019 wait times to appointments,  such issues could cause challenges in the future with increasing numbers  of DOD patients needing TRICARE network care. Accordingly, we  continue to believe that it will be important for DOD to collect complete  and accurate information about the extent to which current health care  providers within the TRICARE networks meet access-to-care standards  as DOD moves forward with its restructuring plans.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation\u2014to consistently  collect complete and accurate information about the extent to which non- network civilian health care providers that could be incorporated into the  TRICARE network meet access-to-care standards in terms of drive time,  and assess that information to inform recommendations on future MTF  restructuring decisions. DOD stated that drive times for non-network  providers were assessed in the development of the recommendations for  its Plan. DOD added that the approach used in the Plan included  assessing drive times and distances from the beneficiaries\u2019 homes, rather  than the MTF, yielding a more accurate assessment of access,  availability, and convenience.", "However, our review of DOD\u2019s methodology workpapers showed that its  analyses measured the distance between providers and a single location  point that corresponds with the center of the zip code boundary in which a  majority of beneficiaries reside. While a perfect methodology and  information for projecting actual drive times may not be possible to  achieve, the alternative method in our report illustrates that a portion of  the providers DOD identified for potential network expansion would  exceed access-to-care standards for some of its beneficiaries\u2014especially  those who live or work near an MTF (such as those who live on a military  installation). According to DOD\u2019s comments on the report, future  restructuring efforts will be informed by the section 703 approach, and  DOD will adjust the approach as needed by future analysis and  conditions. As DOD moves forward with restructuring efforts in the future,  we continue to believe that more accurately measuring the distance  between providers\u2019 locations and beneficiaries\u2019 residences would improve  the quality of DOD\u2019s information about access-to-care. Accordingly, we  continue to believe that DOD should fully implement our recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with our fourth recommendation\u2014to conduct a  sensitivity analysis of the relative cost-effectiveness of MTF-provided care  compared to civilian-provided care under varying assumptions, and to  document that information for decision makers to inform  recommendations on future MTF restructuring decisions. In response,  DOD stated that there is value in the use of sensitivity or scenario  analysis to inform decisions where a range of possibilities exist and a  clear analytical question can be formed as a guide to both the analysts  and decision-makers. However, DOD stated that it does not support the  generic use of this analysis suggested by the recommendation.", "We disagree that our recommendation suggests the \u201cgeneric use\u201d of a  sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis is appropriate for evaluating  restructuring opportunities for MTFs for two reasons. First, the evaluation  of each MTF presents decision makers with a range of possibilities\u2014from  reducing or expanding the capabilities of an MTF, to closing it entirely or  maintaining the status quo. Second, a sensitivity analysis would address  uncertainties in DOD\u2019s analytic assumptions about costs and workload for  each MTF, which our report identified.  As our own sensitivity analysis\u2014 conducted using minimal resources and available DOD data\u2014 demonstrated, changing the assumptions also changes the resulting  conclusions about whether MTF or civilian care is less expensive.  Therefore, we continue to believe that analyzing the relative cost- effectiveness of MTF-provided care compared to civilian-provided care  under varying assumptions would provide more complete information for  decision-making and executing MTF transitions.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health Affairs, the Director of the Defense Health Agency, and the  Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.

These elements include the (1) support  an MTF provides to servicemembers\u2019 medical readiness and the  readiness of medical personnel, (2) adequacy of civilian health care  facilities and providers in the proximity of the MTF to support the health  care needs of servicemembers and other beneficiaries through purchased  care, and (3) cost-effectiveness of direct care services at MTFs versus  purchased care in the nearby civilian provider networks.", "We discussed the methodological approaches for assessing MTFs for  possible restructuring actions, including assumptions, data sources, and  any limitations, with representatives from relevant organizations across  DOD, including the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs; DOD\u2019s Section 703 Work Group; Defense Health Agency; Office  of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs;  U.S. Army Medical Command; Navy Bureau of Medicine; Air Force  Medical Readiness Agency; and officials from 11 selected MTFs and from  their host installations.", "Specifically, in analyzing DOD\u2019s methodology for assessing MTFs\u2019  support to readiness, we reviewed information DOD used to estimate  MTFs\u2019 readiness value in terms of support to servicemembers\u2019 medical  readiness and to medical force readiness. We compared this information  with findings from our prior work regarding DOD\u2019s methodology for  assessing clinical readiness. We also reviewed records of interviews that  DOD officials held with MTF, installation, and command officials during  their visits to MTFs, noting the readiness-related effects and concerns  that were documented.", "For DOD\u2019s methodology for assessing available civilian health care  services in proximity to each MTF, we reviewed reports on the results of  DOD\u2019s assessments to identify their findings, recommendations, and  assumptions. For the civilian health care providers that DOD identified in  proximity to each of 11 MTFs we selected, we verified the address of  each listed provider by searching for each provider\u2019s website and making  phone calls to verify addresses and specialty types, and whether the  practice was open or closed. We then used R software and data from  openstreetmap.org to calculate to calculate the driving distance between  the provider and the MTF, comparing the distance with DOD\u2019s access-to- care standards. We evaluated the extent to which the assessment  reports considered information about quality of health care services and  access-to-care standards, comparing the information with DOD guidance  for patients\u2019 access to quality and timely health care services, and with  federal internal control standards on the use of quality information to  inform decision-making.", "Regarding DOD\u2019s methodology for evaluating cost-effectiveness, we  reviewed DOD\u2019s work papers and interviewed officials about the  calculations and source data they used. We compared DOD\u2019s  methodology with our assessment methodology for economic analysis  and with DOD guidance for economic analysis. We also obtained the  fiscal years 2017 and 2018 data DOD used to calculate the cost- effectiveness of MTF-provided direct care relative to civilian-provided  purchased care. Using these data, we performed a sensitivity analysis by  recalculating relative cost-effectiveness under different assumptions.  Specifically, for seven of our 11 case study MTFs, we recalculated their  cost-effectiveness relative to purchased care by (1) omitting military  personnel salaries, given that DOD has characterized these as a fixed  cost, (2) increasing the work Relative Value Units to adjust for potential  underreporting of those data, and (3) increasing the reimbursement rate  of purchased care to account for future increases that are likely  necessary, according to DOD officials. We also assessed the reliability of  each data source for DOD\u2019s and our calculations of cost-effectiveness by  administering questionnaires about the data to those who have quality  control responsibilities, interviewing responsible DOD officials, reviewing  the data for outliers and missing values, and reviewing our prior reports  about the data. We determined that DOD\u2019s data on the costs of MTF  care and civilian health care were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  calculating the total costs of health care services. However, DOD\u2019s data  on units of health care delivered in fiscal year 2018 were of undetermined  reliability for the purpose of calculating a unit-level health care cost.", "To provide additional information on DOD\u2019s methodology and supplement  our understanding of available data, we conducted a literature review of  research articles. We conducted a search of the literature on military  health system clinical readiness, trends in physician supply and demand  across the United States, and cost analyses of military health care  published from 2014 through 2019 to identify articles on key challenges  and methodological alternatives. To identify relevant articles, we  searched a variety of databases with the assistance of a research  librarian, limiting our review to papers that were included in peer-reviewed  publications, as well as government reports, trade and industry articles,  and publications by associations, nonprofits, or think tanks. We then  reviewed the results and excluded any that were technical in nature or did  not have wide applicability across MTFs or to health care analyses.", "For objective two, we reviewed DOD\u2019s draft and final Plan, including  detailed appendices on the MTFs within the scope of the plan, noting any  aspects of transition planning described or recommended, and the  agencies and organizations that would be responsible for managing those  transition aspects. We also interviewed MTF officials from the selected  case study locations regarding steps they had begun taking and actions  they believed would be needed to facilitate a restructuring of the facility.
