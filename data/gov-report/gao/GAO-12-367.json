GAO\u0092s objectives were to determine: (1) the statutory provisions that authorize DOD\u0092s fellowship and training-with-industry programs for military officers, (2) the extent of the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u0092s (OSD) visibility over these programs, and (3) the extent to which the services are able to determine that they derive benefits from these programs.

For two specific types of fellowships\u0097Legislative and Interagency\u0097the underlying authorities are less explicit than they are for the others.", "OSD has limited visibility over its fellowship and training-with-industry programs for several reasons. First, OSD has not developed a mission statement that would clearly define the respective key purposes for these programs. Having a clear mission statement is critical because it defines an organization\u0092s purpose in language that states desired outcomes. Additionally, OSD has not consistently enforced its requirement for the military departments to provide an annual report on fellowship and training-with-industry programs. Further, not all fellowship and training-with-industry programs have a designated office within each department for preparing the annual report. OSD\u0092s visibility is also limited by not having a reliable inventory of these various programs, and by not having a clear and commonly shared definition of a fellowship. Without improved oversight, OSD\u0092s visibility over the military departments\u0092 compliance with its requirements governing these programs will remain limited. Additionally, visibility is limited over the legislative fellowship program in particular because oversight responsibilities are not clearly delineated, and because OSD does not have documented criteria for the placement of DOD fellows with the offices of congressional committees and members. OSD officials agree that such criteria would be helpful since it does not have enough available fellows to meet the full congressional demand.", "The military services are not well positioned to determine the extent of the benefits they are deriving from their participation in these programs for four principal reasons. First, not all of the services conduct periodic program reviews, as are required for some programs. In addition, the reviews that are conducted are not comprehensive in that they do not assess the program against program goals using quantifiable performance measures, review the needs that prompted the program, incorporate feedback from fellows into the review, or document the results of the review. Second, they do not have clear guidance as to what qualifies as a postfellowship assignment\u0097an assignment that uses the skills and knowledge developed during the fellowship program\u0097or criteria for when such assignments can be postponed or waived, thus limiting the extent the services\u0092 are able to determine they are deriving benefits from these programs. Third, the services do not know their overall program costs, so it is difficult to know whether these programs are cost-effective. Finally, some of the services do not have memoranda of understanding with the non-DOD host organizations, such as think tanks, so they cannot be assured that expectations are clearly understood and the intended benefits are obtained. Without better management controls, the services\u0092 ability to determine the benefits of these programs will remain limited.

For our  second objective, we collected and analyzed available service data on the  numbers and types of fellowships and training-with-industry programs  offered from fiscal years 2007 through 2011; interviewed officials in OSD,  particularly with the offices of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness (USD P&R), and the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Legislative Affairs; and collected and reviewed DOD-required  service annual reports. For the third objective, we interviewed officials  within the four military services and reviewed DOD and service guidance  related to these programs. Most of our interviews centered on obtaining  information about roles and responsibilities related to overseeing and  managing fellowship and training-with-industry programs, and  particularly on activities that provide means of ensuring that DOD  received benefits from these programs. More specifically, we collected  information on service program goals, program reviews, costs of the  programs, and memoranda of understanding between the services and  host organizations. We found the fellowship and training-with-industry  data provided to us by the services on the number of participants in these  programs to be sufficiently reliable regarding contextual information on  the minimum number of participants; however, these data do not allow us  to provide actual totals. We conducted this performance review from  March 2011 through April 2012 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

Army officials, on the other hand, said that  their interagency fellowships\u2014similar to those of the Air Force\u2014are  called fellowships, but are not counted as fellowships for reporting  purposes. USD P&R officials did not know about the Air Force change  and stated that they disagreed with it. They observed that the instruction\u2019s  definition of a fellowship could be made more descriptive to avoid  ambiguities such as this. In another example, the Navy included the  Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program in its annual report for  2010\u2014a program that is governed by a different instruction, overseen by  the Deputy Chief Management Officer, and managed in coordination with  the National Defense University director. In this same report, however,  the Navy did not include its Medical Professional Fellowship Programs,  which are governed by a separate instruction and managed through the  Navy Medicine Professional Development Center.", "Air Force officials said that they viewed the internship as being  USD P&R officials said that inconsistent views as to which fellowships  should be counted\u2014views that reflect the absence of a clear and  commonly shared definition of what constitutes a fellowship\u2014could hinder  the development of an accurate inventory. Officials agreed that a more  specific, DOD-wide definition of a fellowship, which would explain which  opportunities warrant using the word \u201cfellowship\u201d in the program title,  could be helpful. They said they anticipate conducting a review of each  service\u2019s policies or regulations that focus on fellowships and training- with-industry programs, to better ensure that all have the same definitions  and are counting the programs and participants comparably, and that the  services\u2019 policies or regulations are in line with DOD Instruction 1322.06.

Service officials said that they would benefit from having more detailed  reporting guidelines to help determine what information would be most  useful for USD P&R. USD P&R officials said that when they update their  Instruction in late 2012, they anticipate providing specifics to facilitate  collection of more consistent information on the number of fellows, on  their assignments during and after the fellowships, and on the timing of  their returns to their official duty stations. Detailed guidelines could better  position USD P&R to fulfill its oversight responsibility for fellowship and  training-with-industry policy, and to help ensure service adherence to  policies.

We have previously  reported that having clearly defined roles and responsibilities can be  beneficial to address management challenges. The absence of defined  oversight roles and responsibilities for the Legislative Fellowship Program  has created some conflicting perspectives for two separate offices within  OSD.

However, officials within USD P&R said that they have  responsibility for all reporting requirements for this program, but that  otherwise the legislative affairs office manages the program. Our  questions about roles and responsibilities concerning the Legislative  Fellowship Program elicited contradictory information from the two offices,  with each asserting that the other had policy oversight responsibility.  Although officials within USD P&R have subsequently revised their  position and said that they do have oversight responsibility, we note that  this important role is not clearly delineated in the DOD instruction.

These officials said that placing DOD  fellows with congressional offices involves balancing a number of factors,  such as (1) the fellows\u2019 educational and career needs; (2) the availability  of fellows each year to a bipartisan and bicameral assembly of  congressional offices and members; and (3) any specified interests of  individual congressional members regarding a requested fellow\u2019s military  service, educational background, and particular field of specialization. While these considerations help inform placement decisions, they do not  enable DOD to systematically decide and explain its rationale for  decisions on which congressional offices will receive DOD fellows.

They further stated that these decisions can be difficult to  defend to a congressional member who is denied a request for a DOD  fellow, and that it is always difficult to turn down congressional requests.  Without documented placement criteria, OSD\u2019s legislative affairs office  will continue to have difficulty in ensuring consistency in the department\u2019s  dealings with interested committees and members of Congress  requesting DOD fellows.

For  example, they do not ensure that the needs that prompted the program  and the goals of the program are being met. Second, the services do not  have clear guidance as to what qualifies as a follow-on utilization tour, or  criteria for when such a tour can be postponed or waived, and this limits  their ability to know the extent they are deriving a return on their  educational investment. Third, the services do not know their overall  program costs, including both direct and indirect costs, and therefore it is  difficult to know whether these programs are cost-effective. Fourth, some  of the services do not have written agreements or memoranda of  understanding with the non-DOD host organizations providing the  educational opportunity that spell out both parties\u2019 roles and  responsibilities\u2014thus contributing to unclear expectations about the DOD  benefit to be derived from these programs.

A comprehensive review, as we have previously reported, may include  the following four elements: quantifiably measuring the extent to which  the program is meeting program goals; validating that fellowships and  training-with-industry programs meet current and emerging requirements;  incorporating feedback from program participants and host organizations  to improve the program; and documenting the results of the review to  enable the service to modify its programs, as needed. However, we found  that not all services are including these four elements in their reviews, as  described below:", "Using quantifiable performance measures for meeting their stated  goals for their programs. The services have not measured the extent  to which their programs are meeting their goals,  because they have  not developed quantifiable performance measures for most of their  program goals. We have previously reported on the importance of  agencies developing and using performance measures to ensure  accountability and assess progress toward achieving results aligned  with goals. The services vary in the extent to which they review their  programs to measure against program goals. For example, an Army  official said that the Army has not assessed the program using  quantifiable performance measures for its legislative fellowship  program, but the official believed that a measure that tracks the  completion of utilization tours could be used to assess the extent to  which they are meeting the goal of having a pool of officers from  which some may be selected for future utilization in the field of  congressional liaison. Similarly, a Navy official with the Cyber Federal  Executive Fellowship Program said that the utilization tour could be  used as a performance measure for meeting the program\u2019s goals,   but they plan to use it as a qualitative, not quantifiable, performance  measure. The Marine Corps Legislative and Commandant of the  Marine Corps Fellowship Programs have not created quantifiable  performance measures either, although officials said they use  qualitative measures, such as discussions with fellows and senior  leaders, to assess the programs. The Army and Air Force have taken  some steps to develop quantifiable measures for some programs.   For example, in 2011 the Army surveyed fellows in the Senior Service  College Fellowship Program to assess the extent to which these  fellowships met their objectives. The Air Force Fellowship Program  surveys its host organizations on the percentage of time the fellows  spend on the Air Force\u2019s service-specific competencies\u2014used by Air  Force officials as indicators that the program is meeting its goals and  objectives. However, the Air Force has not developed quantifiable  goals with which these survey results can be compared.

We have reported that successful organizations match training  and development programs to their specific needs and capabilities.While the Navy and the Marine Corps have periodically reviewed their  programs to ensure that they meet current and emerging needs, the  Army and the Air Force have not. The Marine Corps has informally  validated its programs through a process that looks at the costs of the  program, updates the list of fellowship host organizations, and  determines which fellowships are available for the upcoming year.  Although the Army\u2019s instruction for nonlegislative fellowships requires  that each fellowship program be reviewed for continued relevancy and  to determine that it meets stated criteria and objectives, the Army has  not conducted this review regularly. We note that Army officials stated  that in their current review of a portion of the Senior Service College  fellowships that they plan to revalidate the need for each or the  uniqueness of each host organization. While the Air Force has not  revalidated that its fellowships meet current or emerging needs  through periodic program reviews, it stated in its December 2011  report to USD P&R on nonlegislative fellowships that program  oversight and management ensure validation that the programs fulfill  a present need, anticipated requirement, or future capability.", "Incorporating feedback.

The Army and the  Air Force have conducted postfellowship surveys for some fellowships  to gather information on the fellows\u2019 experiences. While these surveys  provide information on the experience of the fellowship, they do not  provide information on how the fellowship experience has been of  benefit to the fellows\u2019 careers from a perspective of several years  later. We note that the Marine Corps has conducted surveys to collect  feedback from both recent and earlier fellows. In addition, some of the  services gather feedback from fellows on their experiences through  periodic reports to the program office. All of the services monitor their  fellows and collect feedback through intermittent meetings with them.  The Air Force also collects feedback from host organizations through  surveys and periodic site visits, and the Army has recently conducted  site visits to some of its host organizations.

Army officials said  they plan to use their ongoing review of a portion of the Senior  Service College fellowships to refine the Army\u2019s portfolio of senior- level fellowships. Prior to the review, the Army had identified problems  with the fellowship programs primarily by incident, either with the  fellow or with the host organization. Marine Corps officials stated they  have used feedback from the fellows to decide upon which host  organizations to keep or to discontinue in their portfolio. Air Force  officials said they have analyzed feedback from fellows and host  organizations to make decisions on which host organizations to  discontinue when overall education funding was reduced.  Documentation of these results would enable the services to  demonstrate that they have conducted the review and what steps,   if any, they may take to improve the program.", "Some of the services informed us that they intend to do more to review  their programs.

For example, within the  same Air Force fellowship program, some fellows have a mandatory  utilization tour, while for others it is a recommendation. According to Air  Force officials, the decision as to whether a utilization tour is mandatory  or recommended is made by the Air Force office responsible for  fellowship policy on a case-by-case basis at the time it initiates the  fellowship. Air Force officials said they do not have established criteria for  determining whether a utilization tour is mandatory or recommended.  Similarly, the Army requires utilization tours for some of its fellowship  programs, such as the legislative fellowship, but not for others. In  contrast, the Navy and the Marine Corps generally require utilization tours  for all of their fellowship programs, and all of the services generally  require utilization tours for their training-with-industry programs.", "Service officials said that inconsistency across the services is attributable,  in part, to the absence of a clear definition as to what constitutes a follow- on utilization tour in the DOD instruction. A Navy official said that the  differences in how the services implement utilization tours are a result of  not having a clear definition of the requirement. Similarly, Marine Corps  officials described fulfilling utilization tours as a judgment call, and one  Marine Corps official said there has been an internal debate as to what  assignments should count as utilization tours, and within what time frame  such tours should be assigned.", "Also, the services\u2019 postponement or waivers of the requirement to  perform utilization tours occur inconsistently, because the services do not  have criteria to determine when it is appropriate to postpone or waive this  requirement. As a result, the services have different implementation  practices for postponing or waiving the utilization tour requirement.  Generally, the services postpone or waive the utilization tour requirement  on a case-by-case basis. For example, according to officials the Army  postpones or waives the requirement for most, but not all, of its  fellowships. For one Army fellowship program\u2014the Senior Service  College Fellowship Program\u2014the former Army Chief of Staff provided  written guidance in 2010 indicating that specific requirements for  utilization tours upon completion of fellowships should not be imposed.  Army officials stated that the utilization tour requirement was viewed as  adding more stress and burdens to the officers during a period of high  operational tempo and frequent deployments, and that utilization tours for  these fellows were viewed simply as a recommendation for postfellowship  assignments. In the case of one Navy fellowship program, on the other  hand, Navy guidance generally requires a utilization tour, and that a  high-level Navy Personnel Command official must approve any  exceptions; the regulation does not provide any criteria for such  exceptions. Service officials from all of the services stated that they  postpone assigning a utilization tour if the tour would interfere with  another career-advancing assignment, such as being selected for a  command position.", "Some service officials said that improving the consistency of their  implementation of the utilization tour requirement could increase  assurances that they derive benefits from fellowship and training-with- industry programs, even though their reasons for not requiring utilization  tours vary. Army officials informed us that they are examining steps to  better strategically link utilization tours with the specific research focus of  the fellow, and might begin to require utilization tours for their Senior  Service College fellows now that they expect fewer Army officers to be  deploying overseas. Navy officials said they are hoping to develop a  capability to better track utilization tour completion to better ensure that  they are getting a good return on investment. Marine Corps officials said  they also plan to improve their process for tracking legislative fellowship  utilization tours in 2012.

In addition, some officials said that for their programs indirect  costs may include the salary and benefits of the officer while participating  in the fellowship or training-with-industry program. Service officials said  that the indirect costs of the fellowship are not easily identified. For  example, an Army official said the Army does not have a financial  management system that would allow it to distinguish the administrative  and faculty costs directed toward Army War College students from those  directed toward fellows.

For  example, officials said these programs provide officers with a career- broadening developmental experience; enable them to conduct research  on topics that are important to the military; help them develop critical and  strategic thinking skills; help them gain perspectives from the civilian  sector; build civilian-military relationships; and develop more responsive  leaders during times of significant change in the global security  environment. Officials also believe that the use of fellowship and training- with-industry programs affords DOD flexibility in meeting new or emerging  educational and training needs that sometimes cannot be met within the  military educational structure\u2014for example, in the rapidly developing new  approaches and techniques of the cyber security area. Service officials  said they use several program management practices to enhance the  benefits derived from fellowship and training-with-industry programs,  including the following:", "Competitive selection: Service officials said that having a highly  competitive selection process that rank-orders officers who are  eligible to compete for many fellowship and training-with-industry  opportunities helps to produce a selection of highly qualified officers  for these opportunities. Officials said the process better ensures that  the right officer is selected for a given fellowship or training-with- industry program, which ultimately benefits the officer\u2019s career as well  as accomplishes DOD\u2019s mission though the experience gained. In our  review of the selection process, we found that the preferences of  career field managers, senior leaders, and the officers themselves  were considered, for many of the services, in the selection of officers  for fellowship or training-with-industry programs.", "Orientation and ethics counseling: Service officials said that  conducting orientation before the start of a fellowship helps to prepare  fellows for their program by introducing them to key contacts, program  requirements, and expectations for the year. In addition, officials  stated, the ethics briefings given at orientation and availability of  subsequent counseling provide assurance that fellows understand  what is expected of them and are informed as to how to handle  potential conflicts of interest. We reviewed seven ethics briefings and  found them to contain essential elements, such as guidance on  accepting gifts and information on contacting DOD legal officials with  questions about ethics issues. (See app. IV for our review of these  briefings.)", "Research: Service officials said they have assurances that they  receive a benefit by requiring many of the fellows to conduct research  and write papers on topics that are important to each respective  service, as identified by senior leaders. At orientation, some of the  services have senior leaders speak about emerging topics that could  be better researched to benefit the service. For academic year   2010-2011, for example, DOD fellows researched enhancing DOD\u2019s  acquisition and logistics processes, as well as countering irregular  threats such as piracy.", "Service obligations: Service officials informed us that they had general  procedures to provide some measure of benefits obtained when  officers complete their additional service obligation as required by  statute or DOD guidance for participating in certain fellowships or  training-with-industry programs\u2014that is, that the fellow will serve in  the military for a period at least three times the length of the period of  the fellowship education or training-with-industry opportunity.", "We found that all of the services generally have (1) policies on the  requirement; (2) special coding capabilities for personnel record- keeping and monitoring; (3) a formalized waiver process to better  ensure that servicemembers do not retire or separate without fulfilling  service obligations; and (4) the potential ability to recoup certain  educational costs.

Different organizations within each service identify present and  emerging needs of the service that the officers should be educated in  and trained on. For example, a service identifies an emerging need for  more cyber security based on recent events.  2.  The service policy or program offices establish the fellowship  opportunity that provides the training and skills to meet the identified  need. For example, once the cyber security emerging need was  identified, the Navy policy office established a fellowship program with  leading organizations in that field outside of DOD.  3.  Generally, the personnel command or center selects officers to  participate in the fellowships through a competitive selection process  that ranks eligible officers for selection.  4.  The fellows start their fellowship with a university, think tank,  corporation, federal agency, or congressional committee or member  office, generally with DOD or the service providing orientation and  ethics counseling.  5.  During the fellowship, the program office with primary responsibility for  the fellowship monitors the fellows\u2019 progress, assisting them, when  applicable, with research associated with the fellowship.  6.
