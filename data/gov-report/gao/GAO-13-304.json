The Authority is responsible for implementing the project and federal funding is being provided from the FRA\u0092s High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail program.

By not following all best practices, there is increased risk of such things as cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unmet performance targets. The Authority substantially met the criteria for the accurate characteristic by, for example, the cost estimate's reflecting the current scope of the project. However, the Authority partially met the criteria for the other three characteristics since the operating costs were not sufficiently detailed ( comprehensive ), the development of some cost elements were not sufficiently explained ( well documented ), and because no systematic assessment of risk was performed ( credible ). The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued limited guidance for preparing cost estimates, and this guidance did not reflect best practices in the Cost Guide . The Authority plans to improve its cost estimates.", "GAO found the Authority's ridership and revenue forecasts to be reasonable; however, additional updates are necessary to refine the ridership and revenue model for the 2014 business plan. GAO also found the travel-demand-modeling process used to generate these forecasts followed generally accepted travel- demand-modeling practices. For example, the Authority revised several assumptions, such as gasoline price forecasts, to reflect changes in current and anticipated future conditions. However, additional updates, such as the development of a new travel survey, will be necessary to further refine these forecasts and improve the model's utility to make future decisions. External peer review groups have also recommended additional updates.", "The project's funding, which relies on both public and private sources, faces uncertainty, especially in a tight federal and state budget environment. Obtaining $38.7 billion in federal funding over the construction period is one of the biggest challenges to completing this project. In the latter stages, the Authority will also rely on $13.1 billion in private-sector financing, but will require more reliable operating cost estimates and revenue forecasts to determine whether, or the extent to which, the system will be profitable. The Authority's plan recognizes the uncertainty of the current funding environment and is building the project in phases. The Authority has also identified an alternative funding source. However, that funding source is also uncertain.", "The Authority did a comprehensive job in identifying the potential economic impacts of the high-speed rail project. This includes identification of user impacts, such as effects on travel time reliability, and non-user impacts, such as effects on highway congestion. However, the nature of specific economic impacts will depend on a number of factors, including future project decisions. GAO also found limitations in the Authority's benefit-cost analysis of the project that could limit its usefulness to decision makers. Finally, GAO found that construction of the high-speed rail project will not eliminate the need for additional improvements to meet future statewide-travel demand, but current statewide- transportation assessments and planning have given little consideration to this issue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To produce reliable cost estimates, FRA should improve its guidance so it is in line with the best practices in GAO's Cost Guide .

At  an estimated cost of $68.4 billion (in year-of-expenditure dollars), it is  expected to be one of most expensive transportation projects undertaken  in the United States. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has  obligated nearly $3.5 billion in grants to begin construction later this year.  To complete the project, the state of California expects to rely on  significant public-sector funding, in addition to private funding, through the  project\u2019s anticipated completion date in 2028.", "Over the past two decades, there has been interest in developing high- speed rail between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Rail proponents  argue that California faces significant transportation congestion and that  high-speed rail can help alleviate the need to expand highway and air  infrastructure. Proponents also argue that the corridor has characteristics  that make high-speed rail viable: it connects highly populated  metropolitan centers along a corridor that is currently highly traveled by  air, rail, and automobile passengers. Opponents of the project argue that  it is too expensive, especially with tight federal and state budgets, and  has not sufficiently demonstrated that the project will be financially viable.  As we reported in 2009, completing a high-speed rail project requires  significant and sustained political, public, and financial support given the  high costs and multiple stakeholders involved. In recent years, legislation  has been enacted at the state and federal level that has allowed  California\u2019s project to move forward by appropriating funding for high- speed rail. In 2008, California\u2019s voters approved a $9.95-billion bond  measure, and in 2012, the state legislature appropriated over $4 billion  from this bond to the project and connecting transit upgrades. At the  federal level, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of  2008 (PRIIA) authorized development of high-speed intercity passenger- rail corridors and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Recovery Act) appropriated $8 billion to fund development of these  corridors and intercity passenger-rail projects. In June 2009, the FRA  established the High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail (HSIPR) program  that provides discretionary grants for high-speed or intercity passenger  rail projects. In December 2009, the Fiscal Year 2010 Department of  Transportation (DOT) appropriations act appropriated $2.5 billion for the  HSIPR program ($400 million of which was later rescinded).", "The California High-Speed Rail Authority (Authority)\u2014a state agency  formed in 1996\u2014has been tasked with implementing the project and has  published four successive business plans detailing the project\u2019s cost  estimates, financing plan, ridership projections, and anticipated economic  impacts. Since 2009, the scope of the project has changed along with the  project\u2019s estimated costs. In addition, questions have been raised about  how the project will be funded beyond the current $11.5 billion in state  and federal funding commitments, as well as the project\u2019s ability to attract  sufficient ridership and bring economic benefits to the cities and  communities along the corridor. This report assesses: (1) the reliability of  the Authority\u2019s estimates of the project\u2019s costs, (2) the reasonableness of  the Authority\u2019s passenger rail ridership and revenue forecasts, (3) the  risks attendant with the Authority\u2019s funding plan for the project, and (4) the  comprehensiveness with which the Authority identified potential economic  impacts of the project.

We  used the Cost Guide to conduct an in-depth evaluation of the methods  and assumptions used by the Authority to develop cost estimates of  Phase 1 of the project; our goal was to determine whether best practices  were employed that would help ensure that the cost estimates are well- documented, comprehensive, accurate, and credible. The Cost Guide  was developed for cost estimators to assist them in preparing reliable  estimates of capital program costs. While GAO\u2019s Cost Guide provides  criteria to evaluate the Authority\u2019s methods for developing its cost  estimates, we cannot use it to determine whether or not the Authority\u2019s  cost estimate is precise. Nor can we use the Cost Guide to evaluate the  benefits of this project in comparison to other transportation  improvements. Such an evaluation would require a cost-benefit and other  analyses, which we did not conduct as part of this work. To assess the  reasonableness of the ridership and revenue estimates, we analyzed the  extent to which the Authority\u2019s ridership model methodology adhered to  FRA guidance and generally accepted practices and reviewed peer  review reports assessing the model\u2019s methodology. We also interviewed  Authority officials, their contractor, and peer review panel members. To  assess the Authority\u2019s financing plan, we reviewed the plan, conducted  interviews with Authority and other state and federal officials, and  reviewed literature and other information on financing for high-speed rail  projects in other countries as well as large transportation projects in the  United States. To assess the comprehensiveness with which the  Authority identified potential economic impacts of the project, we  compared the impacts identified in the April 2012 revised business plan  and related economic analyses prepared by the Authority with criteria for  such assessments contained in DOT\u2019s program-funding notices,  applicable legislation, and best practices found in academic literature and  federal guidelines. For purposes of this report, potential economic  impacts include those impacts on users of a transportation system such  as travel time savings and those impacts to non-users of a system such  as highway congestion or noise levels.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, California voters approved Proposition 1A, which authorized  $9.95 billion in state bond funding for construction of the California high- speed rail system and connection improvements to existing passenger  rail systems. Proposition 1A established several requirements for this  high-speed rail system, such as that the rail system must be capable of  sustained operating speeds of no less than 200 miles per hour, and once  built, must operate without a public subsidy. The planned 520-mile high- speed rail system will operate between San Francisco and Los Angeles at  speeds up to 220 miles per hour (see fig.1). The Authority is the state  entity charged with planning, designing, and constructing the California  high-speed rail system. The Authority has a nine-member policy board  appointed by the California legislature and Governor, and a staff of  approximately 55 state employees who oversee, among other things,  contracts for environmental review, preliminary engineering design,  preliminary right-of-way acquisition tasks, contractor oversight and other  activities.", "Construction of the California high-speed rail project is expected to occur  in phases beginning with a 130-mile section from just north of Fresno,  California, to just north of Bakersfield, California. Construction will begin  in the Central Valley and proceed to other portions of the corridor as  funding is available. The Central Valley is the furthest advanced in terms  of design and engineering work, as well as environmental reviews. For  example, FRA approved a preferred route alignment for the Merced to  Fresno, California, portion of the corridor in September 2012. According  to FRA, the federally funded portion of the project in the Central Valley  has more complete cost estimates than subsequent segments given that  has more complete cost estimates than subsequent segments given that  preliminary engineering and environmental reviews are complete or  nearly complete. Other project segments, however, are in different stages  of development and have different levels of information from which to  develop cost estimates. In July 2012, the California legislature  appropriated $4.7 billion of the $9.95 billion in state bond funds, including  $2.6 billion for construction of the high-speed rail project and $1.1 billion  for upgrades in the San Francisco peninsula and in the Los Angeles basin  (commonly referred to as the \u201cbookends\u201d). The process of acquiring  property for the right-of-way and construction has begun. Requests for  proposals to select construction contractors and right-of-way acquisition  were issued in March and September 2012, respectively. In addition, in  January 2013, the Authority awarded a project and construction  management contract for the initial phase of California\u2019s high-speed rail  project. According to the Authority, a design-build contract for the first  construction (covering approximately 30 miles) is expected to be awarded  in June 2013 with construction planned to commence in summer 2013.  (See fig. 2).", "The federal government has committed funding to the project. The FRA  awarded the state approximately $3.3 billion in capital construction funds  and $231 million for environmental review and preliminary engineering  work under the HSIPR program for a total of approximately $3.5 billion.The California high-speed rail project is the largest recipient of HSIPR  funds, with about 35 percent of program funds obligated.

While the funds remain available  until expended under FRA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 appropriation, the governing  grant agreements specify the schedule for expenditure of funds.", "In addition, approximately $945  Even though some funding has been committed, additional funding will be  needed to complete the project. For example, according to the Authority\u2019s  finance plan, over $38 billion in federal funds and over $4 billion from  Proposition 1A proceeds will be needed to complete Phase 1 of the  project. In addition, the Authority is also planning to obtain another $13.1  billion in private-sector capital to help defray the cost of construction after  the initial operating segment is completed in 2028.", "As the federal agency responsible for awarding and overseeing grants to  HSIPR applicants, the FRA established guidance outlining requirements  and procedures and developed an oversight program to ensure that the  project\u2019s goals, objectives, performance requirements, budgets, and other  related program criteria are being met. Thus far, FRA\u2019s guidance to  HSIPR grant applicants has been limited with respect to developing cost  estimates and ridership and revenue forecasts. The Department of  Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General (DOT OIG) noted that the  lack of clear, detailed guidance allows for analyses of widely varying  quality, making it difficult to accurately assess whether projects will be  viable or require substantial financial support and has recommended FRA  improve its guidance. In addition, we have previously reported that a  clear definition of the federal role, goals, and objectives in conjunction  with a robust grant oversight program, is critical to FRA making sound  federal investments in high-speed rail projects.", "The Authority is required to prepare and periodically submit to the state  legislature a business plan, which must identify, among other things,  ridership estimates, operating and maintenance costs, and the source of   The Authority\u2019s next business plan is expected to be  project funding. released in 2014. Several groups have been established to review and  comment on the estimates presented in the Authority\u2019s business plans. For  example, an independent peer review group (PRG) was established in  accordance with California law to evaluate the Authority\u2019s funding plans and  report its judgment as to the feasibility and the reasonableness of the plans,  appropriateness of assumptions, analyses and estimates, and any  observations or evaluations it deems necessary. In addition, the Authority  convened a Ridership and Revenue Peer Review Panel (Panel) to review  the Authority\u2019s ridership and revenue-forecasting process and outcomes and  conduct an in-depth review of the models used to estimate ridership and  revenue and the forecasts derived from them. The California state auditor is  required to periodically audit the Authority\u2019s use of bond proceeds.", "In response to the initial high estimated cost of building the San Francisco  to Los Angeles route\u2014about $98 billion\u2014and other criticisms of the  Authority\u2019s November 2011 draft business plan, the project underwent  substantial revision for the April 2012 revised business plan. Most  significantly, the Authority scaled back its plans to build dedicated high- speed rail lines over the project\u2019s entire length. Instead, the April 2012  revised business plan adopted a \u201cblended\u201d system in which high-speed rail  service would be provided over a mix of dedicated high-speed lines and  existing and upgraded local rail infrastructure (entirely at the bookends of  the system on the San Francisco peninsula and in the Los Angeles basin).  The estimated cost in the April 2012 revised business plan is $68.4 billion.", "The ridership and revenue forecasts in the April 2012 revised business  plan also changed from the November 2011 plan. For example, in the  November 2011 draft business plan, the Authority provided low and high  estimates of ridership in 2030 of 14.4 million and 21.3 million passengers.  In the April 2012 revised business plan, these estimates increased by 12  and 26 percent, respectively, to 16.1 million and 26.8 million. Revenues  similarly increased between the two plans from a low and high estimate of  $1.05 billion and $1.56 billion in the November 2011 plan to $1.06 billion  and $1.81 billion in April 2012. The ridership and revenue estimates  increased because among other things, a \u201cone-seat\u201d service from San  Francisco to Los Angeles would begin sooner under the blended  approach than the original solely dedicated lines approach. However, by  2040 ridership forecasts under the blended approach are less than the  original full build approach. The range between the high and low  estimates also increased between the November and April plans  reflecting a greater degree of uncertainty in the estimates. We have  previously reported that forecasting ridership and revenue is a complex  and iterative process and that early stage estimates should be based on  the best available data and what is initially known about the proposed  project. As additional information becomes available, the Authority\u2019s  model used to produce the forecasts is intended to be updated.", "Development of the high-speed rail system has been controversial with  many strongly held beliefs among the numerous supporters and opponents  of the project. Supporters have cited the need for high-speed rail to  address growing congestion concerns, particularly in the metropolitan  areas, and to address future transportation demands. Supporters have  noted that California\u2019s expected population growth\u2014which is expected to  increase from 38 million in 2012 to an estimated 51 million Californians in  2050\u2014and economic growth will continue to place more demands on  California\u2019s transportation infrastructure requiring that significant new  capacity be added to its transportation network. Further, supporters argue  that the cost of expanding the current network of highways and airports to  meet current and future transportation needs is cost prohibitive and would  be detrimental to air quality and that high-speed rail will increase economic  development in local communities to be served by high-speed rail and  generate new jobs. In addition, supporters also note that several critical  airport and highway expansions are infeasible due to land constraints,  particularly at key airports and urban segments of highways. Opponents of  the plan have argued, among other things, that the cost of the high-speed  rail system is too great and that future funding for the system is too  uncertain given the current fiscal environment. Opponents have also raised  concerns about the credibility of the ridership and revenue forecasts  presented in the Authority\u2019s business plans and specifically, the system\u2019s  ability to attract the ridership levels needed to avoid public operating  subsidies. Local communities and property owners in California\u2019s Central  Valley have also raised concerns about the project and its potential impact  to the agriculture sector in the region. As we reported in our December  2012 testimony, the Authority will face several challenges with acquiring  rights-of-way in a timely manner, including potential construction delays as  well as additional project costs. Timely right-of-way acquisition will be  critical since some properties are in priority construction zones. Property to  be acquired will include homes, businesses, and farmland. Not having the  needed right-of-way could cause delays and add to project costs. There  are a total of approximately 1,100 parcels to be acquired for the first  construction segment; all of which are in California\u2019s Central Valley.  According to Authority officials, although the Authority may face challenges  in acquiring right-of-way, they have built contingencies for time and cost  into their acquisition plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authority Substantially or Partially Met GAO\u2019s Best Practices for Producing Reliable Cost Estimates, but Can Make Improvements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reliable Cost Estimates Are Critical to Successful Project Planning, Funding, and Oversight, but Little FRA Guidance Is Available", "paragraphs": ["The Authority estimates that Phase 1 of the high-speed rail project in  California will cost $68.4 billion to construct and hundreds of millions of  dollars to operate and maintain annually. Since the project\u2019s financing  plan, as articulated in the April 2012 revised business plan, will depend  on an additional estimated nearly $38.7 billion in federal funds, it is vital  that the Authority, FRA, and Congress be able to rely on these cost  estimates for project planning, funding, and oversight. In addition,  because the value of potential private investment depends on the cost of  operating the system, it is vital that the Authority and the private sector be  able to rely on the operating cost estimate. Given that our past work on  high-speed rail projects around the world has shown that projects\u2019 cost  estimates tend to be underestimated, ensuring the reliability of the  estimates is critical to the success of this project.", "FRA provided limited guidance to grant applicants, including the  Authority, about preparing cost estimates. FRA grant applicants were  required to submit detailed capital cost estimates and high-level operating  cost estimates, but FRA did not provide guidance on how applicants  should produce these cost estimates to help ensure reliability. Moreover,  the limited guidance that was provided did not reflect best practices  included in our Cost Guide. FRA officials acknowledged that they  specified the categories and types of costs to be estimated, not how  applicants should prepare these cost estimates. FRA officials told us that  they did not provide prescriptive guidance to grantees in preparing cost  estimates because of the Recovery Act requirement to begin funding  activities quickly following the enactment of the act in February 2009. In  addition, FRA noted that the first two rounds of the HSIPR program were  open to a wide range of project types and the level of detail necessary for  an individual station is different from the level of detail necessary for a  large, long-term corridor program like California.", "According to FRA officials, the Authority\u2019s application complied with the  HSIPR grant application requirements. FRA found the cost estimates to be  reasonable based on their comparison of the Authority\u2019s cost estimates (on  a unit cost basis) to other rail projects in the United States and abroad. The  Authority and its contractor told us that, in the absence of specific guidance  on preparing cost estimates, they relied on their professional experience  supplemented by available cost-estimating guidance from the Federal  Transit Administration (FTA) which they thought was the most applicable  guidance available. For example, since FRA\u2019s guidance did not require the  Authority to perform an independent cost estimate (this involves a  comparison of the Authority\u2019s original cost estimates to those performed by  an independent entity), the Authority turned to FTA guidance to provide  direction on how and when to conduct an independent cost estimate.", "We evaluated the Authority\u2019s cost estimates against GAO\u2019s Cost Guide,  which details best practices for generating high-quality cost estimates at  all levels of government.

The Cost Guide also provides criteria for evaluating  cost estimates to determine whether they exhibit these characteristics.  We have previously applied the Cost Guide in reviewing several  transportation and infrastructure projects and we applied it in our review  of the Authority\u2019s cost estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authority Substantially or Partially Met Best Practices in our Cost Guide for Producing Reliable Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["The Authority substantially met best practices in our Cost Guide for  producing accurate cost estimates, but only partially met our best  practices for producing comprehensive, well documented, and credible  estimates.

Our assessment is discussed in more detail in appendix 2.", "We found that the Authority substantially met best practices for  developing accurate cost estimates. Consistent with best practices, the  estimates reflect the new \u201cblended\u201d system, which will rely, in part, on  existing rail infrastructure; they contained few, if any, mathematical errors;  and they have been adjusted for inflation. Furthermore, the Authority\u2019s  contractor used a construction industry database of project costs  supplemented with actual bid-price data from other transportation  infrastructure projects. While the Authority generally complied with best  practices for producing accurate cost estimates, we could not determine  whether the estimates were unbiased. This was the only best practice  related to accuracy where the Authority fell short. To help ensure an  unbiased estimate, the Cost Guide recommends conducting a systematic  analysis of the potential risks to the project and their likelihood of  occurring\u2014called a risk and uncertainty analysis. A risk and uncertainty  analysis is also a best practice for developing a credible cost estimate as  discussed below.", "We found that the Authority partially met best practices for producing  comprehensive cost estimates. For example, the Authority met the best  practice for including in the cost estimates the major components of the  project\u2019s construction and operating costs. The construction cost estimate  is based on detailed construction unit costs that are, in certain cases,  more detailed than the cost categories required by FRA in its HSIPR  grant application. However, the operating cost estimate was not as  detailed as its construction cost estimate, as over half of the operating  costs are captured in a single category called Train Operations and  Maintenance. Authority officials told us that they developed their cost  estimates consistent with FRA\u2019s guidance which emphasized greater  detail on the construction cost estimate and less detail on the operating  cost estimate. FRA officials confirmed that they emphasize construction  cost estimates because HSIPR grants are required by federal law to only  fund the capital costs of a project, not its operating costs. However,  sufficiently comprehensive operating cost estimates are necessary to  determine the potential profitability of California\u2019s project, a key  consideration to attracting private-sector investment in the project that the  Authority is counting on to help complete construction of the project. In  addition, the Authority did not follow the best practice that calls for clearly  describing certain assumptions underlying the construction and operating  cost estimates. For example, Authority officials told us that the California  project will rely on proven high-speed rail technology from systems in  foreign countries, but it is not clear how the cost estimates were adjusted  for applying the foreign technology in California and how these  adjustments are reflected in the complete project cost estimates.  California requirements on the technology may differ in terms of speed or  safety requirements from that of other systems. Authority officials said  that they produced a thorough description of the technical requirements  for high-speed rail, but we were unable to see how this document was  linked to the cost estimates, that is, a description of how these technical  requirements will impact the project cost estimates. Without  comprehensive cost estimates, it is not possible to independently assure  that all cost-influencing factors and assumptions were considered.", "We found that the Authority partially met best practices for producing well- documented cost estimates. In many cases, the methodologies used to  derive the construction cost estimate were well documented, but in other  cases, were more limited. For example, while track infrastructure costs  ($23.6 billion in 2011 dollars) were thoroughly documented, costs for  other elements, such as building new stations and acquiring trains ($3.2  billion in 2011 dollars), were not supported with sufficient documentation  to identify how these costs were developed and what costs were included  or excluded. Authority officials told us that since station locations and train  technology are not yet finalized, they used a higher-level cost estimate.  Additionally, we were unable to trace the estimates back to their source  data and recreate the estimates using the stated methodology. For  example, we were unable to identify the basis for how the operating costs  from analogous foreign high-speed rail projects were adjusted for use in  California. Authority officials said that the operating cost estimate was  used at a high level to determine whether or not the California system will  operate with an operating surplus. Authority officials plan to refine the  operating cost estimate as the project progresses. However, without more  detailed documentation, the Authority\u2019s cost estimates are more difficult to  support and it may be harder to make changes to the estimates as they  are revised since the basis of the original estimate may not be  documented. In addition, without more thorough documentation, FRA and  other oversight officials cannot replicate and evaluate what the Authority  did to prepare its estimates and potentially exposes the project to  possible cost overruns because the basis for costs are not known.", "Estimates that lack documentation are not useful for updates or  information sharing and can hinder understanding and proper use.", "We found that the Authority partially met best practices to help ensure the  credibility of its cost estimates. Those practices include:  testing such estimates with a sensitivity analysis, such as assessing  the effect of changes in key cost inputs; obtaining an independent cost estimate conducted by an unaffiliated  party to see how outside estimates compare to the original estimates;  and  conducting risk and uncertainty analysis.", "In regard to the construction cost estimates, the Authority performed a  sensitivity analysis for the approximately first 30 miles of construction and  obtained an independent cost estimate for the first 185 miles of  construction in the Central Valley but neither covered the entire Los  Angeles to San Francisco project. And, as noted under the accuracy  discussion, the Authority did not conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis  on the cost estimates for any construction segment. Authority officials told  us that in the absence of relevant FRA guidance, they followed FTA  guidance for these types of evaluations. They noted that FTA guidance  recommends conducting sensitivity tests once route alignments are  selected and that, thus far, only 30 miles of the project meet those  criteria. Similarly, Authority officials told us that they interpreted FTA  guidance to require an independent cost estimate for those segments that  have passed the 15 percent design milestone, which includes the first two  construction segments from Merced to Fresno and Fresno to Bakersfield.  Because the Authority\u2019s cost estimates cover both construction of the full  system\u2014from San Francisco to Los Angeles\u2014and include operating  costs, sensitivity analyses and independent cost estimates are more  beneficial when they cover the entire project to help ensure greater  credibility. The methodology of these tests can be altered to reflect the  level of design, so a segment that has met a certain level of design can  still be evaluated for credibility. Finally, as noted above, the Authority did  not perform a risk and uncertainty analysis, which would improve the  estimates\u2019 credibility by identifying a range of potential costs and  indicating the degree of confidence decision-makers can place on the  cost estimates. For example, the Authority faces the potential challenge  of acquiring rights-of-way in a timely manner. Authority officials told us  there about 400 parcels in the first construction package, about 100  parcels of which are considered to be potentially at-risk for timely delivery  for construction. However, without a risk and uncertainty analysis it is not  possible to determine how the cost estimates might be affected by such  things as delays in acquiring necessary rights-of-way or having to pay  more for property to keep the project on schedule.", "Authority officials said that they did not conduct a risk and uncertainty  analysis yet because FRA did not require one, and the FTA guidance to  which they turned, recommends such an analysis after a final route  alignment is selected. In addition, Authority officials told us that they  added contingencies to the cost estimates to account for the risk of cost  overruns. However, according to our Cost Guide, risk and uncertainty  analysis\u2014as with sensitivity analysis and independent cost estimates\u2014 should cover the entire cost estimate and can be performed at varying  levels of detail commensurate to the level of design. And, while  contingencies are designed to cover potential cost overruns, based on  our review, the Authority\u2019s contingencies, which range from 10 to 25  percent for various cost elements, were not calculated based on the  results of a risk and uncertainty analysis (since this was not performed)  but rather were based on professional judgment. Without a risk and  uncertainty analysis, we cannot be assured that the contingencies are  accurately calculated, and more importantly, what level of confidence we  can have in the cost estimates.", "For the operating cost estimate, the Authority conducted sensitivity tests  under various ridership scenarios as recommended by the Panel;  however, these tests were designed to measure the ability of the initial  operating section to cover operating costs with ticket revenues and not to  determine the potential risk factors that may affect the operating cost  estimate itself. The Authority also did not compare its operating cost  estimate to an independent cost estimate or conduct a risk and  uncertainty analysis. The Authority told us that it views the sensitivity test  already conducted as well as a forthcoming evaluation of operating costs  by the International Union of Railways (UIC) as sufficient to meet these  requirements. To make its operating cost estimate more comprehensive  and better documented, the Authority has contracted with the UIC to  evaluate the existing methodology and data and help refine the  Authority\u2019s estimates.expert review of the Authority\u2019s operating cost estimates, it may not  address some of the key practices that ensure credibility.

However, the Authority will  need to complete several updates to improve these forecasts for the 2014  business plan. In its April 2012 revised business plan, the Authority  forecasts between 16.1 million and 26.8 million passengers per year and  annual revenues of $1.06 billion to $1.81 billion in 2030. These forecasts  were derived from a statewide ridership and revenue model, developed  under contract to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC).  Developing travel demand and revenue forecasts is difficult in almost  every circumstance, across every mode and for a variety of reasons. As  we have previously reported, limited data and information, especially  early in a project before specific service characteristics are known, make  developing reliable ridership and revenue forecasts difficult. To the  extent early stage data and information are available they need to be  updated to reflect changes in the economy, project scope, and consumer  preferences. In addition, risks of inaccurate forecasts are a recurring  challenge for project sponsors. Research on ridership and revenue  forecasts for rail infrastructure projects around the world have shown that  ridership forecasts are often overestimated. Although forecasting is  inherently risky, reliable ridership and revenue forecasts are critical to  accurately estimate the financial viability of a high-speed rail project and  determine what project modifications, if any, may be needed. Such  forecasts enable policymakers and private entities to make informed  decisions about the proposed project and to determine the associated  risks when making investment decisions. In addition, ridership forecasts  are critical because they serve as the basis for revenue forecasts. If the  California high-speed rail project is unable to generate the necessary  ridership and revenue to cover the system\u2019s operating costs, the project  may not be able to operate without a subsidy\u2014as required by Proposition  1A. Conversely, if forecasts are overly conservative, it could lead to the  state capturing less value from private investment than warranted. As  such it is critical that the Authority\u2019s process for developing these  forecasts is reliable and provides some assurance that the resulting  forecasts provide a reasonable estimate of future demand for the system.", "Unlike our cost estimating criteria discussed earlier, there is no industry  standard or established criteria for developing or evaluating intercity  passenger high-speed rail ridership forecasts. FRA has not established  guidance on acceptable approaches to the development of reliable  ridership and revenue forecasts and has established only minimal  requirements and guidance related to information HSIPR grant applicants  must provide regarding forecasts. We previously reported that developing  guidelines, methods, and analytical tools to develop credible and reliable  ridership forecasts is necessary to ensure equitable consideration of high- speed rail as a potential option to address demands on the nation\u2019s  transportation system. We recommended that the Secretary of  Transportation develop guidance and methods for ensuring the reliability  of ridership and other forecasts used to determine the viability of high- speed rail projects and support the need for federal grant assistance.  The DOT OIG has also recommended that FRA develop specific and  detailed guidance for the preparation of HSIPR ridership and revenue  forecasts. According to FRA officials, they are in the process of  developing an oversight plan that will include criteria for evaluating  ridership forecasts. FRA officials indicated that they intend to use the  DOT OIG\u2019s HSIPR Best Practices: Ridership and Revenue Forecasting  guide as a starting point for developing this guidance.", "For the purposes of our assessment, we identified generally accepted  travel-demand-modeling practices for high-speed rail projects from a  variety of sources and developed criteria based on these practices to  assess the reasonableness of the approach used to create the ridership  and revenue models for the California high-speed rail project. In  developing our criteria, we relied primarily on a 2011 report, prepared for  the DOT OIG\u2019s office by the firm Steer Davies Gleave, on best practices  related to travel demand modeling. In addition, we also examined other  literature on developing rail ridership and revenue forecasts to  supplement information in the Steer Davies Gleave report. Specifically,  we reviewed, among other sources, our prior GAO reports, Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA) and FRA guidance, and academic  literature. (See app. I for a list of guidance and reports we reviewed.)  From our review of these reports and other sources, we identified  common approaches to developing ridership and revenue forecast  models and elements affecting the validity of those models. We identified  seven key steps of the ridership-and-revenue forecasting process and  then compared the Authority\u2019s process for completing these tasks to  generally accepted travel-demand-modeling practices. We found that the  Authority followed generally accepted travel-demand-modeling practices  for each of the seven key steps: (1) developing trip tables, (2) determining  and applying service characteristics, (3) developing mode choice models,  (4) estimating induced travel, (5) estimating expected fare revenue,   (6) conducting sensitivity analysis, and (7) conducting validation testing.  (For a detailed description of generally accepted travel-demand-modeling  practices and the Authority\u2019s process for completing each of these steps,  see app.III).", "The Authority\u2019s process for developing trip tables and collecting and  compiling data on current travel patterns followed generally accepted  practices. A central task of the ridership forecasting process involves  collecting and compiling data on current travel patterns along the  proposed high-speed rail route into trip tables. We found that the  Authority followed generally accepted practices for developing trip tables.  For example, trips were distinguished by mode of travel (auto, air, rail),  trip purpose (commute, business, recreation, and other), and trip length  (over and under 100 miles) as is general practice. Various data sources  were used to develop the base year trip tables, including, among other  sources, 2000 Census Bureau data, survey data from a 2005 travel  survey and a 2011 long-distance travel survey conducted by Harris  Interactive, and existing regional models used by metropolitan planning  organizations (MPOs). Overall, the data sources used for developing  the trip tables were consistent with generally accepted standards. One  potential limitation, however, is that the 2011 survey sample was not  selected at random from among California residents but rather was  limited to individuals who had opted to join an online survey panel. The  American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR)recommended against the use of such panels, often called \u201copt-in\u201d survey  panels, when accurate population estimates are needed, due to concerns  about data quality and the possibility that a panel may differ from the  intended target population in unknown ways. Data were weighted to  adjust for differences between the survey sample and the California  population on four characteristics\u2014geographic location, age, wealth, and  employment status\u2014but, the data may still not be representative of the  California population in other characteristics related to travel behavior.", "The Authority\u2019s process for determining and applying service  characteristics followed generally accepted practices; however, as  detailed service plans are finalized or scenarios are changed, the model  will need to be updated to reflect revised service characteristics.  Ridership forecasts require information on the service characteristics  (such as travel time and fares) of competing modes of travel, such as  automobile and air travel along the proposed route. We found that the  Authority collected and considered relevant service characteristics and  used appropriate data sources. These included information on service  characteristics of the interregional transportation modes in the area  including information on time, cost, and other service characteristics for  each mode\u2014auto, conventional rail, and air\u2014based on the most currently  available published or observed data. High-speed rail service  characteristics were defined based on the initial service plans and fare  structure because published or observed data do not exist. Some or all of  the high-speed rail characteristics will likely change as service plans are  finalized and engineering decisions are made, and those changes can  significantly affect ridership and revenue forecasts. This was illustrated in  a 2012 sensitivity analysis completed by the Authority in which service  characteristics for the proposed high-speed rail system were adjusted to  reflect reduced service on the San Francisco Peninsula, which is likely  under the current \u201cblended\u201d approach whereby the high-speed rail system  will share tracks with Caltrain.ridership and revenue forecasts by 11 percent and 13 percent,  respectively, compared with forecasts in the April 2012 revised business  plan. Updated representations of the base and forecast year level of  service characteristics will be important for producing realistic ridership  forecasts in the future.", "Academic experts from the University of California Berkeley\u2019s ITS conducted a review of  ridership and revenue forecast models used to develop forecasts in June 2010 and  produced a report summarizing their findings. See D. Brownstone, M. Hansen, and S.  Madanat, Review of Bay Area/California High-Speed Rail Ridership and Revenue  Forecasting Study, University of California Berkeley\u2019s Institute of Transportation Studies,  UCB-ITS-RR-2010-1, June 2010. survey (revealed preference data), or on hypothetical situations presented  to travelers in a survey (stated preference), or both.", "There are advantages and disadvantages to using revealed preference  and stated preference data. Revealed preference data provides  information on travelers\u2019 actual choices made in a specific market.  However, according to the Steer Davies Gleave report, when collected  from travel surveys, biases may exist in the respondents\u2019 responses due  to a desire of respondents to justify their chosen mode. In addition, since  true high-speed rail does not exist in the U.S., it is not possible to use  revealed preference alone to determine how American travelers would  actually use high-speed rail. To address this problem, stated preference  data have been used in high-speed rail studies to asses likely traveler  responses to a new service. According to the Steer Davies Gleave report,  while stated preference data can provide detailed information about a  traveler\u2019s likely responses to different modes or services that do not  currently exist, this type of data may also exhibit bias; specifically, survey  respondents may respond favorably to a hypothetical new mode, when in  reality it may be more difficult to change habitual behavior. According to  the Steer Davies Gleave report, limitations with each of these types of  data can be mitigated by taking various steps such as by combining both  revealed preference and stated preference data. The primary source of  data for the Authority\u2019s mode choice model was a revealed preference  and stated preference survey, of air, rail, and auto trip passengers,  conducted at airports, rail stations, and by telephone from August to  November 2005. However, in its July 2011 and May 2012 reports to the  Authority, the Panel reported that the Authority\u2019s main mode choice model  was based solely on stated preference responses, and recommended in  its May 2012 report that the Authority collect new survey data and use  both revealed and stated preference data in developing a new mode  choice model. Authority officials stated that they are currently developing  a new revealed preference and stated preference survey, which they plan  to begin administering in early 2013. We discuss this survey in further  detail in the next section.", "In addition, academic experts from the University of California Berkeley\u2019s  ITS have previously reviewed the ridership and revenue model and  have also identified limitations in the Authority\u2019s method of applying a  statistical model to the survey data. These data came from a choice- based sample, meaning that survey respondents were selected for having  already chosen a mode of transport (air, rail, or auto). The Authority used  a conventional method of applying a statistical model to such data, but a  newer method has been identified in a recent research paper. According  to some academic experts, the use of the latest method could be an  improvement. The Panel also reviewed this issue in its May 2012 report  and stated that while they do not see the non-use of this new method in  the Version 1 model as an important defect, it is worth investigating this  issue as the Authority continues to refine the travel demand model.", "The Authority followed generally accepted practices when producing  induced travel estimates. Induced travel refers to trips that occur as a  result of the high-speed rail project and that might not otherwise have  been made using existing modes. In general, these are new trips that are  generated because a new travel mode exists. The Authority estimated  induced travel for the California high-speed rail project to be on average 2  percent of total high-speed rail trips. According to the Steer Davies  Gleave report, based on its review of forecasts of proposed U.S. high- speed rail systems, an upper limit on induced travel of approximately 10  percent of total high-speed rail trips is widely accepted for proposed U.S.  high-speed rail systems. Steer Davies Gleave also reviewed actual  induced travel for high-speed rail systems outside the United States and  found that it ranged from 6 to 27 percent. The Authority forecasted  induced travel to be on average 2 percent. This estimate appears to be  conservative and reasonable when compared to proposed U.S. high- speed rail systems and actual induced travel for high-speed rail systems  outside the United States.", "The Authority followed generally accepted practices when estimating  expected fare revenue for the California high-speed rail project. Expected  fare revenue is a product of forecast ridership and average fares. High- speed rail fares are based on a boarding fare and a per mile fare for  interregional trips. For example, travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco  would mean an average, one-way, high-speed rail fare of $81 in 2010  dollars or 83 percent of average 2009 airfares from Los Angeles to San  Francisco. Forecast ridership is impacted by high-speed rail fares and  revenue is an output of the ridership and revenue model. According to the  Authority, the annual number of riders needed to breakeven when the  Phase 1 blended system is opened in 2029 is 6.1 million or 23 percent of  the high forecast. Authority officials stated that they did not produce a  revenue optimization forecast\u2014that is, a ridership forecast that would  maximize revenue\u2014to produce these high-speed-rail fare estimates and  acknowledged that they will need to do so in the future when meeting with  potential private high-speed rail operators, which will establish their own  revenue-maximizing fares for the system. According to the  Authority, the  Authority will not operate the high-speed rail system and a private  operator is expected to serve as a contract operator of the system. As  such, the private operator will be expected to assume all revenue risks of  the project (including setting fares). The Authority\u2019s process for  calculating expected fare revenue adheres to generally accepted  practices; however, as other factors and inputs change, total expected  fare revenue will likely also change. For example, over time, it will be  important for the Authority to monitor changes in airfares, gasoline prices,  and other key assumptions and incorporate these changes, as necessary,  into future revenue forecasts.", "The Authority followed generally accepted practices when conducting  sensitivity analysis of key model assumptions for the California high- speed rail project. A sensitivity analysis is typically conducted by varying  key model assumptions such as socioeconomic data, type of trips taken,  gasoline and auto fleet efficiency, and airfares, or parameter values to  determine how the model behaves in response to changes to these  assumptions. The Authority conducted several sensitivity analyses on its  ridership and revenue model, most in 2011. For example, the Authority  conducted sensitivity analyses that tested key factors, such as changes in  fuel economy, air and auto travel time, air and auto travel costs, and high- speed rail travel time assumptions. In one analysis, the Authority tested  the overall effect of a higher auto fuel economy and found that this  change reduced ridership and revenue forecasts by 16 and 19 percent,  respectively, from the Phase 1 high ridership and revenue forecasts  presented in the November 2011 draft business plan. According to the  Panel that reviewed these analyses, the results of the various sensitivity  analyses that the Authority has conducted show that the model is  appropriately sensitive across the range of variables tested.", "In addition, the Authority performed a sensitivity analysis of an extreme  downside scenario to test the ridership and revenue implications of a  series of downside events, such as increased average rail travel time  from Merced to the San Fernando Valley (140 minutes instead of 126  minutes), decreased train frequency (3 trains per hour instead of 4 trains  per hour during peak times), lower auto-operating costs, and lower air  fares (10 percent below actual 2009 average air fares). Based on this  analysis, the Authority determined that an extreme downside scenario  would be expected to reduce ridership and revenue forecasts by 27  percent and 28 percent, respectively, below that shown for the low IOS  forecasts in the April 2012 revised business plan. According to the  Authority, they tested these events using the IOS phase because the  financial viability will be the most fragile during the early stages of  ridership. According to the Authority, these forecasts are still sufficient to  cover the Authority\u2019s estimated operating costs and not require a public  operating subsidy. Authority officials stated that they intend to conduct  additional sensitivity analyses going forward.", "The Authority mostly followed generally accepted practices to validate the  ridership and revenue model. Model validation generally involves verifying  that the model reflects observed traveler behavior including total travel,  region-to-region travel flows, and observed market shares by mode. In  the United States, without another high-speed rail system to use for  comparison, model validation is a difficult task. Furthermore, validating  the proposed California project with foreign high-speed rail systems is  difficult because some of the travel market characteristics in other  countries with high-speed rail, such as the cost of driving, may not be  comparable. The Authority has taken some steps to validate the model  through tests performed using data on Amtrak\u2019s premium Acela service in  the Northeast Corridor (NEC) as input to the California high-speed rail  model and compared the output with 2008 actual ridership and 2030 NEC  forecasts. The results of the Authority\u2019s comparison of the California  high-speed rail model with NEC input to actual 2008 ridership data  showed that ridership in the California high-speed rail model with NEC- like conditions in 2008 is 79 percent of actual 2008 NEC ridership.  Similarly, the Authority\u2019s comparison of the California high-speed rail  system ridership forecasts from the model run with \u201cNEC-like\u201d service is  about the same as projected 2030 ridership on the Acela service.  Authority officials told us they believe the results from these tests  demonstrate that the ridership and revenue model is reasonably sensitive  to speed, frequency, and fares. While the NEC corridor has some  comparable characteristics to the proposed California high-speed rail  corridor\u2014such that it is capable of reaching top speeds up to 150 miles  per hour and covers a distance of over 400 miles\u2014the proposed  California high-speed rail corridor and the NEC differ in important ways.  For example, population density, congestion, and travel behavior in the  two corridors differ, and as such, forecast comparisons should be  interpreted with caution.", "In developing the forecasts for the April 2012 revised business plan, the  Authority also revised several model assumptions used in the initial  ridership and revenue forecasts presented in the November 2011 draft  business plan. Specifically, the Authority revised model assumptions to  reflect changes in current and anticipated future conditions for airfares  and airline service frequencies, decreases in gasoline price forecasts,  and anticipated declines in the growth rates for population, number of  households, and employment. Some of the initial assumptions were  largely based on pre-2007 data and did not reflect potential effects of the  2007 to 2009 recession. (See table 2 for a summary of updates that have  thus far been completed.) According to Authority officials, this was done  to build in additional conservatism in the ridership forecasts.", "Updating model assumptions can help mitigate of the risks of  overestimating ridership and revenue forecasts\u2014referred to as optimism  bias. Biased ridership forecasts are a recurring problem with rail  infrastructure projects and we have previously reported that forecasting  ridership and revenue is a complex and uncertain process and ridership  forecasts of high-speed rail projects are often overestimated. Other  research on ridership and revenue forecasts for rail infrastructure projects  have confirmed that actual ridership is likely to be lower than forecasted  unless steps are taken to incorporate more conservative assumptions into  the model. For example, a recent study examined a sample of 62 rail  projects and found the ridership forecasts of 53 of them were overstated;  actual ridership was, on average, 41 percent lower than forecasted.  Updates to model inputs, such as fuel prices and other projections, are  important for updating ridership forecasts for any project; in this instance,  updates to model inputs resulted in more conservative ridership forecasts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Next Business Plan Will Not Reflect All Planned Improvements to Ridership Forecasts", "paragraphs": ["The Authority has plans to complete future improvements to its ridership  and revenue forecasts, including completing a new travel preference  survey and developing a second generation travel demand model.

According to Authority  officials, the 2014 plan is expected to include, among other updates,  updated ridership and revenue forecasts. Two critical updates to the  ridership forecasts that peer reviewers and academic experts have  recommended are the development of a new 2013 revealed and stated  preference travel survey and a second generation travel demand model\u2014 which will make use of the new survey.

According to the Panel, development of a new survey is critical as it will  address several long-term issues that can only be overcome with the  collection and analysis of new survey data.", "The Authority also has plans to develop a second-generation travel  demand model; however, the second generation model will not be  completed in time for the 2014 business plan. According to Authority  officials, work on the second-generation model will not begin until the  ridership and revenue analysis for the 2014 business plan is completed.  According to the Authority, the second generation model will use data  from the new 2013 revealed and stated preference survey to supplement  data from the 2005 survey. In addition, the Authority plans to replace the  2011 Harris Interactive long-distance travel survey data with data from the  2012 California Household Travel Survey being conducted by the  California Department of Transportation. According to Authority officials,  both surveys will be needed for developing its second-generation travel  demand model. The Panel, which has released five reports assessing the  Authority\u2019s ridership and revenue forecasts, has reported that the  Authority\u2019s ridership and forecasts to date are reasonable for planning  purposes but has also stated that additional updates and enhancements,  particularly the development of a new model, will be critical for future  project decision making.

Peer reviewers and other groups that  have examined the Authority\u2019s ridership and revenue forecasts have  reported the need for greater transparency in the Authority\u2019s analyses.  For example, in its January 2012 report, the California State Auditor  reported that the Authority\u2019s November 2011 draft business plan lacked  detail in its presentation of some of the revenue forecasts. Similarly, in its  October 2012 report, the Panel advised the Authority to provide  summaries on the Authority\u2019s website, describing, among other things,  recent forecasts, key input assumptions used to develop the forecasts  (e.g., fuel price trends, socioeconomic growth rates, and changes in  household size and structure), and updated service characteristic  information. According to Authority officials, documentation supporting  analysis in its 2014 draft business plan will be available on the Authority\u2019s  website when the plan is made public.

In addition,  according to DOT, the city of Denver, Colorado, raised nearly $100 million  from private sources to help finance a $2 billion expansion to its transit  and commuter rail project. While the private-sector can provide needed  funding and management expertise to a transportation project, this  approach is not risk-free.

For example, Japan  sold certain high-speed rail lines to private operators and does not  provide operating subsidies to these firms. And, in 2010, Britain sold an  operating concession for its High-Speed 1 line to a consortium of private  investors for approximately \u00a32 billion (approximately $3.2 billion).  Private firms have also expressed interest in operating high-speed rail  projects in the United States. For example, according to FRA, several  private consortia were preparing to submit bids on a HSIPR-funded  project between Tampa and Orlando, Florida. However, public-sector  support was withdrawn when the governor canceled the project which  precluded private-sector investment. And, in Texas, a privately-financed  high-speed rail project failed when the investors encountered financial  difficulties. Authority officials told us that they have met with a number of  private firms and high-speed rail operators that have expressed interest in  California\u2019s project but have not entered into any agreements since the  project has not yet been built. Attracting private investment may not only  require up-front public investment but may also require the use of  revenue guarantees, or public guarantees of a minimal level of income to  the project regardless of ridership levels. Such guarantees will reduce the  risk for private operators, and therefore their cost of raising capital, but  according to the Authority, a revenue guarantee is considered to be a  type of operating subsidy that is barred by the legislation that authorized  the state high-speed rail bonds (Proposition 1A bonds).", "Private-sector investment in the California high-speed rail project, if any,  will ultimately be determined by the profitability of the system\u2014that is, the  extent to which operating revenues exceed operating costs.

The Authority\u2019s current operating cost  estimates will also need to be improved in the future.

A public return on investment includes a project\u2019s potential  to deliver transportation, economic recovery, and other benefits. To assist  in project evaluation, FRA encouraged HSIPR applicants to provide an  economic analysis that quantified the monetary value of user benefits  and, if available, public benefits.

In addition to the business plan, the  Authority prepared a BCA that provided a more detailed analysis of both  user and non-user impacts included in the revised business plan. The  Authority also prepared an EIA that focused on those other economic  impacts of the system that do not fall into the BCA framework. According  to the Authority, the EIA presented longer-term impacts on California\u2019s  economy from building the high-speed rail system.", "Although the Authority comprehensively identified the primary potential  economic impacts, it is too early to determine specific economic impacts  since these will depend on a number of factors. These include the  following:", "Future project decisions. The California high-speed rail project is in its  early stages of development, and a number of project decisions have  yet to be made, including final alignment of train routes, some station  locations, and the type and frequency of service. Decisions such as  these can be expected to have a bearing on potential economic  impacts. For example, route alignments and station locations can  affect economic development. While acknowledging that the extent to  which high-speed rail would change California\u2019s economic landscape  was not fully understood, the EIA suggested that based on studies in  other countries, the main economic impacts from high-speed rail in  California will likely occur in areas within 2 hours of major economic  centers, such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles.  However, the EIA also concluded that the greatest volume of  redevelopment attributable to high-speed rail will likely occur in major  metropolitan areas and that the Central Valley could see moderate  clustering of development around stations. Although economic  development around stations offers the potential for economic  impacts, achieving such development may be subject to a number of  factors, and certain impacts may not be easy to identify. In July 2012,  we reported on the potential for economic development associated  with bus rapid transit projects. We found that in the five case study  locations we examined, although the bus rapid-transit project was  having some positive effect on economic development, individuals  associated with these projects were unsure about how much  economic activity could be attributed to the presence of bus rapid  transit compared with other factors or circumstances. In addition, the  project sponsors and experts we spoke with told us that transit- supportive policies and development incentives can play a crucial role  in helping to attract and spur economic development associated with  bus rapid transit. In September 2009 we reported the characteristics  of transit-oriented development around stations can increase nearby  land and housing values, but we also found that determining transit- oriented effects on the availability of affordable housing in these  developments are complicated by lack of direct research and data.", "Economic conditions over the life of the project. As we reported in  March 2012, the closer the economy is to full employment, the smaller  net effect a project will have on total economic activity. The speed  with which the nation and California recover from the 2007 to 2009  recession, which cannot be known in advance, will affect the net  employment from any new infrastructure projects. If the economy  achieves full employment, such projects would affect the composition  of employment but not its level or rate of growth. The high-speed rail  project will be constructed and operated over a period of many  decades and likely over many economic cycles. The Authority\u2019s April  2012 BCA used a 67-year period (from 2013 to 2080) to estimate  potential economic benefits and costs of the project, and, for purposes  of analyzing potential operating and maintenance costs, the April  2012 revised business plan assumed a 38-year operating period  (2022 to 2060). Over such an extended period, economic conditions  can be expected to change, as will potential economic impacts. The  Authority\u2019s April 2012 EIA recognizes that the project\u2019s economic  impacts will be affected by California\u2019s economy and unemployment  rates. According to the Authority\u2019s EIA, as of February 2012  California\u2019s 10.9 percent unemployment rate was the nation\u2019s third  highest. It goes on to estimate that the high-speed rail project has  the potential to create about 1 million direct and indirect job-years  through construction of the Phase 1 blended system, based on the  assumption that 20,000 job-years would be created for each $1 billion  in capital investment.the economic conditions and unemployment rates at the time the jobs  are created. The EIA acknowledged this uncertainty when it stated  that multipliers used to estimate indirect and induced jobs are  snapshots in time of an economy and represent only current or recent  economic relationships and technologies. They do not capture  structural changes in the economy, new technologies, or changes in  wages that occurred since the multiplier data were produced or that  might occur in the future.", "The accuracy of this estimate will depend on", "Uncertainty about some impacts. Uncertainty may particularly affect  non-user impacts, some of which are difficult to measure or quantify.  The Authority\u2019s April 2012 EIA discusses the potential for wider  economic impacts from high-speed rail such as the benefits of  bringing California\u2019s economic activities and markets closer together  by reducing travel times. The EIA states, by improving transportation  connectivity and reducing congestion, the high-speed rail system  could make California\u2019s economy more efficient, productive, and  competitive by such things as bringing businesses closer to labor and  other markets and providing workers with greater access to jobs.  However, the best practices report prepared for the DOT OIG found  that additional data on things like the relationship between economic  density and productivity, labor supply elasticity, and price-cost  margins were needed to assess wider economic impacts of high  speed rail projects. The study went on to note that no research was currently available regarding wider economic impacts of U.S. high- speed rail projects since such projects do not yet exist. The  Authority\u2019s April 2012 EIA recognized this difficulty and states that the  extent to which the high-speed rail project will affect the economic  landscape of California is not well understood, though transportation  infrastructure investments have historically created fundamental shifts  in the spatial relationship between places. These limitations do not  imply deficiencies in Authority or DOT performance but rather the  inherent analytical complexities of large infrastructure investments.", "Uncertainty regarding local or regional impacts. The April 2012 EIA  discusses the potential for economic impacts along the high-speed rail  line, including direct and indirect employment opportunities, increased  efficiencies and productivity from bringing labor and other markets  closer together, and transit-oriented development around stations.  The specific impacts to regions or localities will depend on a number  of factors, including project-related factors and factors associated with  local policies and decisions. Among the project-related factors are  both the rate of project spending over time as well as where project  funds are spent. The high-speed rail project is expected to be  constructed over a long period of time and in phases when funding  becomes available. The rate of spending and its timing will influence  when and to what extent regions and localities may experience  economic impacts associated with the project. Which specific regions  or localities may experience economic impacts will be influenced by  such project decisions as route alignments and station locations.", "Local policies and decisions will also affect regional and local  economic impacts. Studies conducted for the Authority by the  University of California at Berkeley suggested there are opportunities  for economic development from the high-speed rail system in a variety  of locations, including Fresno and Bakersfield in California\u2019s Central  Valley. However, the studies cautioned that the extent of economic  development will depend on cities establishing a framework of  planning and development policies that encourage development.  Some cities have begun taking actions to promote economic  development related to the high-speed rail system. For example, in  June 2012 Fresno issued a solicitation for consultants to prepare a  master plan for its planned downtown rail station that would enable  the city to maximize local economic benefits from the high-speed rail  system. Other cities have not yet acted. The Authority\u2019s April 2012  EIA found that of the 13 potential stations on the Phase I blended  corridor, 7 (53.8 percent) did not have station-specific development  plans.", "We also found some limitations in the specific economic analyses  prepared by the Authority. In particular, the April 2012 BCA has  shortcomings that could limit its usefulness to decision makers.", "Identification of negative impacts of the project and their effects on the  BCA analysis. The BCA lacked detail regarding the handling of  negative impacts associated with the high-speed rail project. DOT  guidance on benefit-cost analysis suggests that negative (or adverse)  impacts, such as non-user (or highway) delays associated with rail  construction, be included in BCA analyses to facilitate consistent  project comparisons. The guidance recommends that negative  impacts, such as highway delays associated with rail construction, be  shown as a negative benefit and not included in project investment  costs to better facilitate comparisons between projects. The April 2012  BCA recognized that during the period of project construction there  would be roadway delays in urban areas that would offset some travel  time savings. However, the BCA excluded such impacts from the  analysis since the impacts were expected to be (1) localized, (2)  minimal since the high-speed rail project minimizes urban grade  crossings, and (3) negligible in proportion to overall travel time  savings once the project is complete.", "Aside from roadway delays, the Authority acknowledged there were  additional categories of economic impacts that may be negative. For  example, the April 2012 revised business plan discusses how the  high-speed rail system could limit access to parts of farmland in the  Central Valley potentially reducing the output of affected farmlands.  The BCA contained little discussion of such impacts and states that  the BCA did not incorporate or monetize land use and land value  impacts the high-speed rail project may cause (positive or negative).  The Authority said negative impacts were assumed to be part of the  mitigation measures that would be conducted as part of the  environmental review process and right-of-way acquisition and that  the costs of these measures were included in the cost side of the  benefit-cost calculation. According to the Authority, including negative  impacts as a negative benefit would lead to double counting them as  both a negative benefit as well as a cost in the benefit-cost  calculation. We agree that negative impacts of the high-speed rail  project should not be double counted, but the BCA should include  discussion of potential negative impacts and how they are treated in  the analysis. Such information would better inform decision makers  about the existence of negative impacts and their potential effect on  project benefits or costs.", "Identification of the risks and uncertainties associated with the BCA  analysis. The BCA did not discuss the potential risks and uncertainties  associated with either the benefits or costs used in the analysis.  Forecasts are inherently uncertain, including those for ridership and  economic projections. Recognition and analysis of risks is an  important part of project evaluation. As we reported in February 2011,  Executive Order 12893 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Circulars Nos. A-94 and A-4 indicate that benefit and cost information  shall be used in agency decision making and that the level of  uncertainty in estimates of benefits and costs shall be disclosed. In  particular, Executive Order 12893 requires that uncertainties about  the amount and timing of important benefits and costs associated with  an infrastructure investment be recognized and addressed through  appropriate quantitative and qualitative assessments.", "Similarly, DOT\u2019s TIGER guidance, which the Authority used to  prepare its BCA, requires applicants to assess the reliability of any  forecasts used to generate benefit estimates but does not specifically  require a discussion of risks and uncertainties in a BCA. We reported  in February 2011 that the majority of the applications to the TIGER  and HSIPR programs we reviewed did not provide information related  to uncertainties in projections, data limitations, or the assumptions  underlying their models. Even when such information was provided,  we found that it was not always comprehensive. We recommended  that DOT require, among other things, grant applicants to clearly  communicate the level of uncertainty in estimates of project benefits  and costs. The Authority did not conduct a risk analysis beyond  examining the potential effects of high and low cost scenarios. While  the Authority may have used credible sources for variables in its  analysis (e.g., fuel prices), this does not eliminate all forecasting risks,  and those risks should be identified. In addition, as we have noted,  decisions on route alignments and other aspects of the project have  yet to be made; decisions that could add to project risk.", "GAO-11-290."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High-Speed Rail\u2019s Impact on Meeting State Travel Demand Has Not Been Fully Assessed", "paragraphs": ["Although the Authority comprehensively identified the project\u2019s potential  economic impacts, additional analysis is needed at the state level of how  high-speed rail will affect other transportation modes and their ability to  meet future travel demand. This includes the potential cost of additional  improvements that may be needed or conversely planned projects that  may not be needed. An important aspect of non-user impacts is a  project\u2019s potential effect on other transportation modes, including  highways, aviation, and local transit systems. This is an important issue  since the Authority has estimated that, as a result of population growth  and other factors, overall interregional trips in California will increase from  about 500 million in 2000 to about 900 million in 2030. In addition, under  the blended approach adopted by the Authority, success of the high- speed rail system will depend in part on local transit improvements.", "As part of the planning process, the Authority considered high-speed rail\u2019s  impact on the capacity of other transport modes. For example, in April  2012 the Authority issued an analysis of the highway and airport  improvements that would be needed to provide an equivalent capacity to  the high-speed rail system envisioned in the April 2012 revised business  plan. The analysis found the total cost (in 2011 dollars) of equivalent  capacity investment in highways and airports would range between $123  billion and $138 billion to build up to 4,600 highway lane-miles, 115  airport gates, and 4 airport runways. However, the analysis did not  focus on potential additional highway or other transportation  improvements that may be required even with construction of the high- speed rail system. Rather, the analysis identified the potential highway  and airport improvements that would be required to provide an equivalent  capacity to that of the high-speed rail, not an assessment of additional  improvements required to meet future intercity travel demand. Identifying  such improvements was not the task of the Authority since its task is to  develop a high-speed rail system. Rather, this task would fall to the state  as part of its overall planning responsibilities under federal transportation- planning requirements.", "Constructing a high-speed rail system is not expected to meet all of  California\u2019s future intercity travel demand. Among other things,  development of the phase I blended approach will affect the need for  additional improvements to local transportation systems to support high- speed rail. For example, officials with the Orange County Transportation  Authority told us they have bus projects and a street car project in the  planning phases that will be linked to both local commuter rail and the  high-speed rail system. Similarly, officials from the Southern California  Association of Governments told us the cost of integrating high-speed rail  with local transit was still being developed and that the cost of an initial  list of prioritized projects to facilitate this integration exceeded $3 billion.  Of this $3 billion in projects, about $1 billion in projects were categorized  as high priority. The officials said that although they have got agreement  from the Authority to help fund some of the high priority projects and  some funding is expected to come from Proposition 1A, a funding source  for the list of potential projects had not been determined.", "Even though high-speed rail is not expected to meet all of California\u2019s  future intercity travel demand, statewide transportation planning has not  yet fully assessed the impact of the high-speed rail system in meeting this  demand. In November 2011, the California Transportation Commission  (CTC) issued a Statewide Transportation System Needs Assessmentthat identified the preservation, management, and expansion projects  required over the 2011 to 2020 period. The assessment identified a total  cost for the projects of about $540 billion and a nearly $300 billion funding  gap in meeting the project needs identified. According to CTC officials,  the needs assessment included information about high-speed rail  that  was readily available from Authority documents. However, high-speed rail  was not assessed in terms of project needs, costs, or the funding gap  because, according to CTC officials, Regional Transportation Plans that  formed the basis of the assessment did not include high-speed rail in  identifying project needs and costs. Similarly, California Department of  Transportation officials told us current highway transportation planning  has not looked at this issue, and the department\u2019s long range  transportation plans have not included consideration of high-speed rail.  According to the officials, the department did not see an immediate need  to do an assessment since the high-speed rail system is not expected to  be operational for another 10 years or more.

Therefore, concerns about potential cost  escalations and optimistic ridership forecasts, as well as the potential  burden this could place on public budgets are well placed. Cost and  revenue estimates for large projects are, by their nature, imprecise; these  estimates endeavor to predict many years into the future within the  confines of what is known today. According to our past work reviewing  high-speed rail projects in other countries, cost and ridership estimates  tend to be overly optimistic. However, experts agree that taking steps to  anticipate project risks and improve the credibility of such estimates will  lower the risk of cost overruns and missed revenue forecasts. Improving  the reliability of cost and revenue forecasts is critical to providing project  sponsors, FRA, the Congress, and ultimately, the public with greater  confidence that this project can be viable. This confidence is of particular  importance as the Authority will seek significant and sustained funding  from federal, state, and private sources.", "We found that the Authority did not fully employ best practices for  producing reliable cost estimates as expressed in GAO\u2019s Cost Guide,  which are recommended practices but not required. The cost estimates  can be improved as the project progresses from design to construction,  and ultimately, to operation. The Authority was not required to follow the  Cost Guide; instead, it was required to follow FRA\u2019s guidance which we  found to be limited. That guidance identified the cost categories that  applicants should include in its cost analyses, but did not specify how cost  estimates should be generated. The Authority told us that it looked to  FTA\u2019s cost-estimating guidance to help inform the Authority\u2019s cost- estimating methodology. The Authority can be commended for  supplementing its analyses using FTA\u2019s guidance, but this does not  necessarily ensure a fully reliable cost estimate. Our past work, as well as  that of the DOT OIG, has shown that FRA has yet to develop sufficient  program guidance for project evaluation and oversight under its additional  grant-making responsibilities under the HSIPR program. Developing  guidance for HSIPR applicants and grantees that incorporates best  practices from the Cost Guide would allow cost estimators to improve the  reliability of cost estimates for expensive projects like high-speed rail.  Such guidance would help ensure project costs reflect the four  characteristics required for developing reliable cost estimates and  minimize the risk of cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unmet  performance targets.", "The Authority is in the process of updating its ridership and revenue  model in response to recommendations provided by experts and peer  review groups, such as the Ridership and Revenue Peer Review Panel.  We believe that these steps will have the potential to improve the  Authority\u2019s ridership forecasts, and we encourage continued refinement,  as more information becomes available and continued review by peer  review groups. Improved forecasts will be particularly important as the  Authority seeks to secure private investment in the project. The potential  project revenues\u2014which are primarily dependent on ridership\u2014will help  determine how much the Authority may be able to obtain from private  sources. Similar to the cost estimates, FRA has developed minimal  guidance for applicants to develop reliable ridership and revenue  forecasts. We, along with the DOT OIG, have previously made  recommendations that FRA improve this guidance to ensure reliability of  ridership and revenue forecasts that are used to determine the viability of  high-speed rail projects. According to FRA officials, the agency is  currently in the process of implementing these recommendations.

However, DOT noted (1) that the currently funded project has sound cost  estimates while future, currently unfunded phases will continue to be  refined as the project progresses and data improves, (2) that FRA\u2019s cost- estimating guidance was the best available at the time, and (3) that  GAO\u2019s Cost Guide focuses on federally managed acquisitions. DOT\u2019s  response noted that the project is a multi-decade effort consisting of  many segments and phases, each in a different stage of development.   DOT\u2019s response also noted that the Cost Guide was issued in March  2009, one month after passage of the Recovery Act and a few months  before deadlines for the HSIPR guidance, and, therefore, it was not  feasible for FRA to incorporate Cost Guide best practices into guidance.  Finally, DOT said applying the Cost Guide principles to future FRA capital  cost guidance, while feasible, would require analysis and adaptation to  accommodate unique aspects of long-term grantee-managed  transportation projects. DOT noted that the Cost Guide is focused  primarily on federally managed acquisitions and programs, not  infrastructure projects that non-federal parties will develop and build. DOT  also provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "We recognize DOT\u2019 concerns; however, our charge was to assess the  reliability of the cost estimates and not just whether they complied with  FRA\u2019s guidance, which we found to be less than best practices.  While  the Cost Guide was released in 2009, it is a culmination of cost- estimating best practices that have previously been published and have  been available to federal agencies for many years. Therefore, these  practices could have been considered when preparing HSIPR program  guidance. Finally, the best practices contained in the guide are applicable  to developing cost estimates for a wide variety of programs and projects,  whether federally managed or not.", "The Authority provided a letter summarizing its comments about the  report (see app. IV). In general, the Authority believes that the report  highlights its efforts to produce cost estimates that reflect the scope of the  project, that methods and models used to develop ridership and revenue  forecasts adhered to applicable best practices, and that comprehensively  identifying potential economic impacts demonstrates a strong economic  case for the project. However, the Authority noted that different  components of its program (such as implementation phases and  construction packages) are at different stages of development and that it  would not be practicable to apply the full complement of tools in the Cost  Guide at the program level at this time. This is because the environmental  review is under way on a number of sections and alignments and other  choices are still to be made. The Authority also stated it plans to improve  its cost estimates and ridership forecasts. For example, the Authority  stated that the updated ridership model being developed for the 2014  business plan will incorporate many of the changes we suggested and  that the Authority will improve the quantification of project risks.", "We commend the Authority for planning to improve its cost estimates and  forecasts. Regarding not applying the Cost Guide at the program level,  we note that a program does not need to be in an advanced stage of  planning in order to complete a sensitivity or cost risk and uncertainty  analysis. In fact, such analyses are most valuable when performed early  in a program\u2019s life cycle. Single point estimates are more uncertain at the  beginning of a program because less is known about its detailed  requirements and the opportunity for change is greater. For example,  undefined or unknown technical information, uncertain economic  conditions, and political issues are often encountered during a program\u2019s  acquisition. For management to make good decisions, the program  estimate must reflect the degree of uncertainty, so that a level of  confidence can be given about the estimate. Therefore, it is important to  conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis at all stages of a project so cost  estimates reflect the risk and uncertainty that exist.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30  days from the report date.

GAO designed the Cost Guide to be used by federal agencies to assist  them in developing reliable cost estimates and also as an evaluation tool  for existing cost estimates. To develop the Cost Guide, GAO cost experts  assessed measures applied by cost-estimating organizations throughout  the federal government and industry and considered best-practices for the  development of reliable cost-estimates. We analyzed the cost estimating  practices used by the Authority against these best practices. For our  reporting needs, we collapsed these best practices into four general  categories representing practices that help ensure that a cost estimate is  (1) accurate, (2) well documented, (3) comprehensive, and (4) credible.", "After a review of all source data, including but not limited to electronic  cost models for both capital investment and operating and maintenance  phases, all supporting documentation, personal interviews, and  independent research, we assessed the extent to which the Authority met  these best practices on a five-point scale:", "Not Met\u2014Authority provided no evidence that satisfies any of the  criteria.", "Minimally Met\u2014Authority provided evidence that satisfies a small  portion of the criterion.", "Partially Met\u2014Authority provided evidence that satisfies about half of  the criterion.", "Substantially Met\u2014Authority provided evidence that satisfies a large  portion of the criterion.", "Fully Met\u2014Authority provided complete evidence that satisfies the  entire criterion.", "We determined the overall assessment rating by assigning each  individual rating a number: Not Met = 1; Minimally Met = 2; Partially   Met = 3; Substantially Met = 4; and Fully Met = 5.

The  resulting average becomes the Overall Assessment as follows: Not Met =  0 to 1.4; Minimally Met = 1.5 to 2.4; Partially Met = 2.5 to 3.4;  Substantially Met = 3.5 to 4.4; and Fully Met = 4.5 to 5.0.", "To assess the reasonableness of the Authority\u2019s ridership and revenue  forecasts, we analyzed the extent to which the Authority\u2019s methods for  developing the ridership model and resulting ridership and revenue  forecast adhered to federal guidance and generally accepted travel  demand modeling practices for high-speed rail projects. Unlike with  GAO\u2019s cost-estimating criteria discussed earlier, there is no single  industry standard for developing or evaluating intercity passenger high- speed rail ridership forecasts. As such, for the purposes of our  assessment, we reviewed a variety of sources that identify generally  accepted travel demand modeling practices and developed criteria based  on these practices to assess the reasonableness of the approach used to  create the ridership and revenue models for the California high-speed rail  project. In developing our criteria, we relied primarily on a 2011 report  prepared for the DOT OIG\u2019s office by the firm Steer Davies Gleave, on  best practices related to developing high-speed rail ridership and revenue  forecasts. The report provides a description of current standard practices  in high-speed rail ridership and revenue forecasting, key steps typically  involved in completing these forecasts, and a description on the range of  data and methods used in the forecasting process. The intent of this  guidance is to provide information that will assist reviewers to understand  and evaluate forecasting studies. In addition, we also examined other  literature on developing rail ridership and revenue forecasts to  corroborate information in the Steer Davies and Gleave report.

We compared generally accepted practices for each of these steps to the  Authority\u2019s process for developing the ridership and revenue forecast as  outlined in the April 2012 revised business plan and in supporting  technical documentation. We could not evaluate each of the many  detailed design decisions, assumptions, and model inputs used by the  Authority, but rather focused on the seven key steps and whether they  were implemented in accordance with generally accepted practices.

LOS characteristics were defined for the  four inter-regional travel modes: auto,  conventional rail, high-speed rail, and air.  LOS characteristics covered three broad  categories: costs, times, and reliability,  which were summarized in travel skim  tables.

Characteristics were collected  from published or observed data from  various sources including, the MTC and the  Federal Aviation Administration.

The updated mode  choice models were applied using the MPO trip  tables for each region as input. San Diego is  the only other region that contains the  possibility of intra-regional high-speed rail trips,  but the estimate of these riders was very low  relative to the other regions. Because the level  of effort to develop, calibrate, and apply the  regional mode choice model was very high,  intra-regional ridership for San Diego was  developed using a population-based estimate  rather than a traditional mode choice model.  Inter-regional models: The Authority  developed four sets of models which included  trip frequency, destination choice, primary  mode choice, and access/egress mode choice.  The destination choice component predicts the  destinations of the trips generated in the trip  frequency component based on zonal  characteristics and travel impedances. The  mode choice components (main mode choice,  access mode choice and egress mode choice)  predict the modes that the travelers would  choose based upon the modal service levels as  well as characteristics of the travelers and trips  being made.", "Data were derived from, among other sources,  the California Department of Transportation  Statewide Model, existing regional mode choice  models, and revealed preference and stated  preference survey data.

This improvement will make conditions  more favorable for travel. Trips will therefore be  taken on high-speed rail that might not otherwise  have been made using any of the current modes.  The new trips are commonly referred to as  induced travel.  An upper limit on induced travel of approximately  10 percent of total high-speed rail trips is widely  accepted for proposed high-speed rail systems in  the U.S.  Expected fare revenue is determined by a  calculation using the ridership estimates  generated by the model and the average fares.  The total ridership for the system is generally  calculated by adding the diverted trips calculated  from the mode choice models and the induced  trips to produce the total ridership for the system.  All ridership and revenue forecasting studies  should incorporate an analysis of the sensitivity of  forecast results to key inputs and modeling  assumptions including fare, running time, service  frequency, station locations, and assumptions  about socio-economic and travel growth in  forecast years. Sensitivity analysis typically is  conducted by varying, more or less systematically,  selected forecasting model inputs, parameters, or  assumptions (e.g., inflation rate or fuel cost)  around their \u201cstandard\u201d value, running the model,  and examining the variation in outputs. Sensitivity  analysis can help determine the reliability  associated with the model output forecasts and  can help identify the factors that have greatest  impact on project ridership and revenue.  Model validation is a key component of ridership  and revenue forecasting and generally consists of  testing the validity of the model using data other  than (and usually newer than) the data from which  it was estimated, to assess how well the model  predicts actual ridership.  There are two superior (but not often performed)  ways of checking model performance: (1) the  historical method, in which a prior-year model is  used to forecast current travel, which is then  compared with actual current travel; and (2)  \u201cbackcasting,\u201d in which a current year model is  used to estimate travel for a prior year, which is  then compared with actual travel in the prior year.

In addition, the Authority  developed an extreme case scenario to test the  sensitivity of the model to a series of downside  events, such as increased average rail travel time  from Merced to the San Fernando Valley (140 min.  instead of 126 min), decreased train frequency (3  trains per hour instead of 4 trains per hour during  peak times), lower auto-operating costs and lower  air fares (10 percent below actual 2009 average air  fares).", "The Authority validated the model through tests  performed using Amtrak\u2019s Acela service in the  Northeast Corridor (NEC) as input to the California  high-speed rail model and compared the output with  2008 actual ridership and 2030 NEC forecasts.
