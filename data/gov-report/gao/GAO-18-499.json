In addition, the strategies incorporated goals and activities related to the  health, security, or democracy assistance sectors, which accounted for  the majority of foreign assistance obligations in fiscal year 2016, the most  recent year for which data were available. The strategies we reviewed  include government-wide, agency-specific, multi-agency, regional,  sectoral, and multisectoral strategies as well as country-level strategies  for Afghanistan and Kenya, which are among the largest recipients of  U.S. foreign aid. We limited our review to strategy documents that  agencies provided. We did not review agencies\u2019 efforts to implement the  strategies and did not assess the overall effectiveness of such efforts.  Instead, we focused on the extent to which the strategies we reviewed  provided a clear picture of the organization and management of U.S.  foreign assistance efforts.", "We reviewed the strategies to determine the extent to which each  addressed nine key elements we had identified as important for helping to  ensure that agencies\u2019 foreign assistance is well aligned in terms of  implementation approach and desired results.

We developed these elements on the basis of prior work  related to U.S. government strategies and interagency collaboration as  well as prior work on addressing fragmentation, overlap, and duplication  in the federal government. Our prior work suggests that strategic  documents offer an opportunity to consider the relationship among goals  outlined in the strategies, the roles and responsibilities of various  stakeholders involved in achieving those goals, and information on how  progress toward those goals will be measured. Each strategy was  reviewed and rated by two analysts, including a subject-matter expert in  the strategic area that the strategy addressed. Given the variety of  strategies we reviewed and reviewers\u2019 varying expectations for the detail  and emphasis accorded to the key elements we identified, we rated the  strategies using a three-part scale focused on their presence in each  strategy. We rated a strategy as generally addressing an element if the  strategy provided sufficient detail to understand the element within that  strategy, as partially addressing the element if the strategy mentioned the  element but did not provide sufficient detail, and as not addressing the  element if the strategy did not mention it.

Strategies that do not consistently address  elements related to interagency coordination miss opportunities to ensure  that agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities are clear and distinct and that  coordination mechanisms are well defined.

Forty percent (21 of 52) of the  strategies we reviewed generally defined agencies\u2019 roles and  responsibilities. For example, USAID\u2019s Strategy on Democracy, Human  Rights and Governance identified all agencies involved in its  implementation and laid out the roles and responsibilities of each agency  as well as USAID offices. Thirty-seven percent (19 of 52) of the strategies  partially defined agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities, which suggests the  potential for improvement in this area. For example, State-USAID joint  regional strategies identified the partners and stakeholders and  enumerated the activities that State and USAID or the embassy and  missions would undertake. However, most of those strategies did not  specify the individual agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities. Twenty-three  percent (12 of 52) of the strategies contained no information about  agencies\u2019 lead, support, and partner roles.", "Interagency coordination mechanisms. Thirty-three percent (17 of 52)  of the strategies we reviewed generally identified interagency  coordination mechanisms. For example, USAID\u2019s Multi-Sector Nutrition  Strategy identified joint planning, funding, and programming mechanisms  for coordination among development and humanitarian assistance  agencies at country and regional levels in USAID and the U.S.  government as a whole. Twenty-nine percent (15 of 52) of the strategies  partially identified coordination mechanisms. For example, CDC\u2019s Global  Health Strategy and USAID\u2019s Global Health Strategic Framework both  described the agencies\u2019 respective unique roles in global health but did  not specifically discuss how the agencies would work together to achieve  their goals.

We focused on the six agencies that administer the largest  amounts of foreign assistance, according to fiscal year 2016 obligations  data: the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Defense (DOD), Health and  Human Services (HHS), and State (State); the Millennium Challenge  Corporation (MCC); and the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID). We limited our review to foreign assistance strategies that were  in effect during 2017. We further focused on strategies relating to health,  security, and democracy assistance, which account for the majority of  total foreign assistance obligations, according to fiscal year 2016 data.  We excluded strategies for other assistance sectors, such as  counternarcotics and other law enforcement activities that require  interagency coordination with domestically focused agencies outside the  scope of our review, such as the Departments of Homeland Security and  Justice.", "To identify the strategies for this review, we asked the six agencies to  update a list of 63 government-wide, agency, multi-agency, regional,  sector-specific, and multisectoral strategies that they had provided for a  related report that we published in June 2017. We also asked the  agencies to provide country-level strategies for Afghanistan and Kenya,  two of the largest recipients of U.S. security and development assistance,  based on fiscal year 2016 obligations data. We obtained and initially  reviewed 72 strategies, which included the 63 strategies we identified for  the June 2017 report; 6 country-level strategies for Afghanistan and  Kenya; and 3 updated strategies covering national security, the  President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and water and sanitation.  We determined that 52 of these 72 strategies incorporated goals or  activities related to health, security, or democracy assistance (see fig. 4).  These 52 strategies, which had been issued by December 2017 and were  current in that year, include 44 of those listed in our June 2017 report and  8 of those subsequently identified by the agencies.", "We reviewed the 52 strategies to determine the extent to which they  addressed nine key elements we identified relating to the alignment of  multiple strategies. We identified these nine elements by reviewing prior  reports focused on foreign assistance in the security sector that assessed  the quality of various U.S. government strategies; articulated practices for  enhancing collaboration among federal agencies; or discussed  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication among government programs.  Those reports identified six desirable characteristics for government-wide  strategies and practices for enhancing agency collaboration. For the  purposes of this report, we selected three of these characteristics, related  to interagency coordination, strategic integration, and assessment of  progress toward strategic goals. We excluded three characteristics\u2014 purpose, scope, and methodology; detailed discussion of problems, risks,  and threats; and description of future costs and resources needed\u2014 because we did not consider them to be directly related to alignment of  strategies. The three characteristics we included comprised 15 elements,  9 of which we considered to be directly related to the alignment of health,  security, and democracy assistance sector strategies across multiple  agencies. We excluded 6 elements\u2014for example, potential changes to  structure and details on subordinate strategies and plans for  implementation (e.g., enterprise architecture)\u2014that we did not consider to  be directly related to this topic.", "We reviewed the selected strategies using NVivo, a qualitative data  analysis software package. For each strategy, two reviewers, including at  least one with expertise in the area of foreign assistance addressed by  each strategy, independently identified text related to each of the key  elements we had identified. We used a standardized set of criteria in an  assessment instrument to consistently judge whether each strategy  sufficiently addressed these elements. This instrument contained  evaluative questions intended to gauge the presence of each element\u2014 for example, \u201cTo what extent does the strategy address the agencies  involved and their roles and responsibilities?\u201d. Given the variety of  strategies we reviewed and reviewers\u2019 varying expectations for the detail  and emphasis accorded the key elements we had identified, we rated the  strategies using a three-part scale focused on the presence of these  elements. We rated a strategy as generally addressing an element if the  strategy provided sufficient detail to understand the element in that  strategy; as partially addressing an element if the strategy mentioned it  but lacked sufficient detail; and as not addressing an element if the  strategy did not mention it. The two reviewers for each strategy  independently documented their judgments on the extent to which the  strategy addressed the key elements we had identified. Our initial coding  shows that the reviewers agreed in about 78 percent (363 of 468) of  these initial judgments. The reviewers reconciled their judgments, with  resolution of differences split roughly evenly between accepting the  higher and lower of the initial ratings. A supervisor reviewed each set of  ratings for internal consistency. The supervisor related any identified  issues, as appropriate, to the reviewers, who addressed them before the  supervisor recorded the review as final.", "We examined these strategies and any appendixes included in the  documents that the agencies submitted, because these strategic  documents should broadly describe objectives and efforts\u2014including  interagency coordination, strategic integration, and assessment of  progress toward strategic goals\u2014needed to achieve them. We did not  review agencies\u2019 efforts to implement the strategies and did not assess  the overall effectiveness of such efforts. Instead, we focused on the  extent to which the strategies we reviewed provided a clear picture of the  organization and management of U.S. foreign assistance efforts.", "To measure the extent of strategies\u2019 integration with other relevant  sectoral strategies and with higher- and lower-level strategies, we  performed a word search for references to the other selected strategies in  the same sector and to other strategies or sets of strategies (e.g.,  regional or country-level strategies) that we classified as either higher- or  lower-level strategies. We searched for such references in each of the 14  strategies that we classified as covering the health sector, the 12  strategies that we classified as covering the security sector, and the 8  strategies that we classified as covering the democracy assistance  sector. See appendix III for the results of this analysis.", "We also reviewed agency guidance related to foreign assistance  strategies. We requested current versions of any relevant documentation  from each of the six agencies. State provided us with agency guidance for  developing its functional bureau strategies and joint State-USAID regional  strategies as well as a related template. State also provided guidance  documents related to its monitoring and evaluation policy and  performance management. USAID provided strategic planning and  implementation guidance for its country development and cooperation  strategies. HHS, USDA, and MCC did not provide\u2014and, according to  agency officials, do not have\u2014specific guidance related to what  constitutes a foreign assistance strategy. DOD provided guidance for  developing security assistance programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2017 to July 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Listing of 52 Selected Foreign Assistance Strategies", "paragraphs": ["The following list shows the 52 foreign assistance strategies that we  reviewed.  1.
