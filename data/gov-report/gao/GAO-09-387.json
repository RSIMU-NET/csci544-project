The control deficiencies GAO identified involved: (1) establishing and documenting policies and procedures for identifying and eliminating federal agencies' intragovernmental payroll tax amounts when compiling the CFS, (2) establishing and documenting policies and procedures for preparing and reviewing information included in key sections of the Financial Report of the U.S. Government, (3) establishing criteria for identifying federal entities' significance to the CFS and annually assessing which entities meet such criteria, (4) enhancing procedures for analyzing and reviewing data used when compiling the Statements of Net Cost, and (5) various other control deficiencies identified in previous years' audits.

Consolidated financial statements are intended to present the results of  operations and financial position of all of the components that make up  the reporting entity as if the entity were a single enterprise. Therefore,  when preparing the CFS, Treasury should ensure that intragovernmental  activity and balances between federal agencies are eliminated. Federal  agencies, as well as other employers, are required to pay, among other  taxes, a matching amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes for their  employees (payroll taxes). Federal agencies\u2019 payments of payroll taxes to  the Internal Revenue Service represent intragovernmental transactions.

During our comparison of  information reported in draft versions of the MD&A and Citizen\u2019s Guide  with information reported in the fiscal year 2008 draft CFS, we identified  (1) several inconsistencies and (2) numerous instances in which  information was omitted from, or incorrectly reported in, these draft  sections of the Financial Report that were not detected by Treasury\u2019s  review process. For example, information in the draft MD&A and Citizen\u2019s  Guide regarding certain federal actions for addressing the financial crisis  was incomplete or incorrectly reported. In addition, the $339 billion  change in veterans benefit liability in fiscal year 2008 reported in the draft  CFS was incorrectly reported as $365 billion in the draft versions of the  MD&A and Citizen\u2019s Guide. We communicated our findings to Treasury  officials who corrected the data presented in the MD&A and Citizen\u2019s  Guide sections of the final Financial Report.

The verifying  agency\u2019s Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the data in  the Closing Package and have the Closing Package audited by the agency\u2019s  Inspector General. In addition, the Closing Package process requires  verifying agencies to reclassify their audited financial statements to the  Closing Package \u201cspecial purpose financial statements.\u201d Verifying agencies  must also identify trading partners and enter certain financial statement  notes. The special purpose financial statements are audited to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are (1) free  of material misstatements, (2) in conformity with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States, and (3) presented pursuant to the  requirements of the TFM. Because the Closing Package process requires  verifying agencies to verify and validate the information in the special  purpose financial statements with their audited information and receive an  audit opinion, Treasury is provided a level of assurance that it is compiling  the CFS with audited financial information. All other federal entities that  contribute financial information to the CFS are classified by Treasury as  \u201cnonverifying agencies.\u201d Over 100 nonverifying federal agencies and  entities submitted data for fiscal year 2008. Currently these entities are  only required to submit adjusted trial balance data to Treasury instead of  an audited Closing Package.

For  example, most of the costs associated with pension and health benefits  that are reported by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in its  financial statements are allocated to the costs of OPM\u2019s federal user  agencies for governmentwide federal reporting purposes. Treasury uses  head count figures reported by OPM in its Closing Package to perform the  allocation of pension and health benefit costs across all user federal  agencies. However, we found that Treasury did not detect a significant  variance in head count between certain federal entities from 2007 to 2008,  which resulted in significant errors in the draft SNC. Specifically, we found  that, in fiscal year 2007, the head count used for the Department of  Defense (DOD) was 497,724, and the head count used for \u201call other  entities\u201d was 92,566.
