GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include the protection of critical cyber infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 require NCCIC to perform 11 cybersecurity-related functions, including sharing information and enabling real-time actions to address cybersecurity risks and incidents at federal and non-federal entities.", "The two acts also contained provisions for GAO to report on NCCIC's implementation of its cybersecurity mission. For this report, GAO assessed the extent to which the NCCIC was performing the 11 required functions. To do this, GAO analyzed relevant program documentation, interviewed officials, and conducted a non-generalizable survey of 2,792 federal and nonfederal recipients of NCCIC products and services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken steps to perform each of its 11 statutorily required cybersecurity functions, such as being a federal civilian interface for sharing cybersecurity-related information with federal and nonfederal entities. It manages several programs that provide data used in developing 43 products and services in support of the functions. The programs include monitoring network traffic entering and exiting federal agency networks and analyzing computer network vulnerabilities and threats. The products and services are provided to its customers in the private sector; federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government entities; and other partner organizations. For example, NCCIC issues indicator bulletins, which can contain information related to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and cybersecurity risks and incidents and help to fulfill its function to coordinate the sharing of such information across the government.", "The National Cybersecurity Protection Act also required NCCIC to carry out its functions in accordance with nine implementing principles, to the extent practicable. However, the extent to which NCCIC adhered to the 9 principles when performing the functions is unclear because the center has not yet determined the applicability of the principles to all 11 functions, or established metrics and methods by which to evaluate its performance against the principles. GAO identified instances where NCCIC had implemented its functions in accordance with one or more of the principles. For example, consistent with the principle that it seek and receive appropriate consideration from industry sector-specific, academic, and national laboratory expertise, NCCIC coordinated with contacts from industry, academia, and the national laboratories to develop and disseminate vulnerability alerts. On the other hand, GAO also identified instances where the cybersecurity functions were not performed in accordance with the principles. For example, NCCIC is to provide timely technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response capabilities to federal and nonfederal entities; however, it had not established measures or other procedures for ensuring the timeliness of these assessments. Until NCCIC determines the applicability of the principles to its functions and develops metrics and methods to evaluate its performance against the principles, the center cannot ensure that it is effectively meeting its statutory requirements.", "In addition, GAO identified factors that impede NCCIC's ability to more efficiently perform several of its cybersecurity functions. For example, NCCIC officials were unable to completely track and consolidate cyber incidents reported to the center, thereby inhibiting its ability to coordinate the sharing of information across the government. Similarly, NCCIC may not have ready access to the current contact information for all owners and operators of the most critical cyber-dependent infrastructure assets. This lack could impede timely communication with them in the event of a cyber incident. Until NCCIC takes steps to overcome these impediments, it may not be able to efficiently perform its cybersecurity functions and assist federal and nonfederal entities in identifying cyber-based threats, mitigating vulnerabilities, and managing cyber risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends nine actions to DHS for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of NCCIC, including to determine the applicability of the implementing principles and establish metrics and methods for evaluating performance; and address identified impediments.

The act also required the  center to adhere to nine principles, to the extent practicable, in carrying  out these functions. One principle, for example, is ensuring that timely,  actionable, and relevant information related to cybersecurity risks,  incidents, and analysis is shared. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015  subsequently established additional functions for the center, among other  things. These acts together identified 11 cybersecurity functions that the  center is to perform.", "In addition, the two acts included provisions for us to review NCCIC\u2019s  efforts in carrying out its cybersecurity mission.

We also interviewed relevant NCCIC officials and analyzed the  evidence provided to identify the products and services that the center  develops and disseminates to federal and nonfederal entities and to learn  how information sharing is coordinated and facilitated. We examined how  these products and services are used in support of NCCIC\u2019s mandated  cybersecurity functions. In addition, we assessed the products and  services against the nine principles outlined in the National Cybersecurity  Protection Act of 2014 and interviewed relevant agency officials to  determine how the center adhered to the principles.", "Further, to supplement our work, we developed and administered a  survey to a nongeneralizable sample of 2,792 recipients of the center\u2019s  products and services to determine the effectiveness of current  operations, products, and services in meeting their needs.

Further, ICS-CERT officials stated that it  provides industrial control system vulnerabilities to over 15,000 \u201c.gov\u201d e- mail addresses that are signed up to receive ICS-CERT Vulnerability  Alerts.", "Function 6: Provide timely technical assistance, risk management  support, and incident response capabilities to federal and nonfederal  entities with respect to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and  cybersecurity risks and incidents, which may include attribution,  mitigation, and remediation.", "NCCIC supports this function with the use of five products and services.  With these products, it has the capacity to provide technical assistance,  risk management support, and incident response capabilities to  customers upon request. For example, in responding to and conducting  incident response analyses for public or private sector customers, US- CERT developed Incident Response Team Reports that outlined  mitigation recommendations to the customers.", "In addition, to support risk management, the center conducted, as  services, Risk and Vulnerability Assessments, which are activities to  assist entities in developing strategies for improving their cybersecurity  posture. According to officials, NCCIC attempts to provide a report of its  findings to the requesting entity within 30 days of the assessment.", "Further, NCCIC provided Cyber Assessments of control systems. For  example, the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET\u00ae) can be  downloaded to conduct a self-evaluation of an entity\u2019s cybersecurity  posture against, among other things, best practices and National Institute  of Standards and Technology recommendations. In addition, ICS-CERT  officials stated that upon a customer\u2019s request, NCCIC can provide further  assistance by conducting industrial control system architectural  assessments and network assessments.", "Function 7: Provide information and recommendations on security and  resilience measures to federal and nonfederal entities, including  information and recommendations to facilitate information security and  strengthen information systems against cybersecurity risks and incidents;  and share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures.", "NCCIC has 16 products and services that support this function. Among  these products, the center provided information and recommendations on  security and resilience measures through its Preliminary Digital Media  Analysis Report and Digital Media Analysis Report products.  Specifically, for these products, it conducted analysis of digital media and  provided a report that includes analysis of the exploits and associated  mitigation strategies. Further, according to NCCIC officials, the US-CERT  and ICS-CERT components conduct incident response activities (known  as US-CERT Incident Response Team Report and ICS Incident  Response Deployment) and develop reports to document their findings  at the request of partner entities. These reports can contain  recommendations to strengthen information systems against  cybersecurity risks and incidents and potentially share cyber threat  indicators and defensive measures.", "Function 8: Engage with international partners, in consultation with other  appropriate agencies, to (a) collaborate on cyber threat indicators,  defensive measures, and information related to cybersecurity risks and  incidents; and (b) enhance the security and resilience of global  cybersecurity.", "NCCIC supports this function with the use of 10 products and services. It  engages with international partners to collaborate on cyber threat  indicators, defensive measures, and information related to cybersecurity  risks and incidents. For example, the most recent Cyberstorm exercise\u2014 the department\u2019s national-level exercise series\u2014was conducted during  the spring of 2016 and involved more than 1,200 participants including  NCCIC\u2019s national and international partners. According to the exercise  after-action report, 12 international partners participated in the  Cyberstorm exercise. To enhance the security and reliance of global  cybersecurity, the after-action report identified areas of improvement  relating to the escalation of incidents and coordination of public and  private efforts. ICS-CERT also collaborated with the Ukrainian  government in the aftermath of a cyber attack on its power infrastructure  to develop and disseminate vulnerability alerts, reports, and briefings on  the attack. US-CERT, on a different occasion, collaborated with Canada  on developing vulnerability alerts associated with ransomware.", "Function 9: Share cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and other  information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents with federal and  nonfederal entities, including across sectors of critical infrastructure and  with state and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate.", "NCCIC relies on four products and services to support this function. For  example, it shared cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and  information through its Malware Initial Findings Reports and Malware  Analysis Reports. These reports are based on NCCIC malware analysis  conducted at the request of the customer. They can contain indicators,  such as a description of the malware artifact, as well as defensive  measures, such as the Internet Protocol addresses potentially associated  with the malware.", "Both types of reports are disseminated via the NCCIC Portal. The center  used a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP), which is a designation to ensure that  sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience. MS-ISAC  representatives have access to the NCCIC portal and can share  information with its members per TLP protections.", "Function 10: Participate, as appropriate, in national exercises run by the  department.", "NCCIC has four products and services that support this function. For  example, in addition to Cyberstorm, the center conducted and  participated in external exercises for customers to support the  improvement of national and international cybersecurity. NCCIC officials  stated that these external exercises include federal, state, local, tribal,  territorial, private, and international partners and range from individual  table-top exercises to multi-organization exercises. The center conducted  such an exercise in October 2015 with a state government to improve its  communication capabilities and provided a seminar on the current threats  to control systems worldwide.", "Function 11: Coordinate with the Office of Emergency Communication of  the Department, assessing and evaluating consequence, vulnerability,  and threat information regarding cyber incidents to public safety  communications to help facilitate continuous improvements to the security  and resiliency of such communications.", "NCCIC has four products and services that support this function. Among  its activities, the center engages with the Office of Emergency  Communications in planning and preparing for disasters and incidents,  including cyber incidents, to ensure continued readiness of the  communications network. NCCIC officials stated they meet weekly with  Office of Emergency Communications Regional coordinators during a  NCC Weekly Operations call to discuss threats and vulnerabilities.  According to NCCIC, the Office of Emergency Communications is a  supporting partner of its execution of national coordinator responsibilities  for Emergency Support Function 2\u2013Communications under the National  Response Framework. In addition, officials from the center have briefed  the National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators on how to  share cyber data using NCCIC\u2019s incident reporting process at a national  conference in April 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCCIC\u2019s Adherence to the Implementing Principles in Carrying Out its Cybersecurity Functions Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["NCCIC is required to carry out its functions in accordance with nine  principles specified in the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014,  to the extent practicable. As previously described, these principles,  among other things, relate to ensuring that industry sector-specific,  academic, and national laboratory expertise is sought and receives  appropriate consideration; the information related to cybersecurity risks  and incidents is appropriately safeguarded against unauthorized access;  and shared information is timely, actionable, and relevant to risks,  incidents, and analysis.", "The extent to which NCCIC carried out its 11 cybersecurity functions in  accordance with the nine principles specified in the act is unclear. We  identified instances where, with certain products and services, NCCIC  had implemented its functions in adherence with one or more of the  principles. For example, consistent with the principle that it seek and  receive appropriate consideration from industry sector-specific, academic,  and national laboratory expertise, NCCIC coordinated with contacts from  industry, academia, and the national laboratories to develop and  disseminate vulnerability alerts through the National Vulnerability  Database. In addition, to comply with the principle that the information  related to cybersecurity risks and incidents be appropriately safeguarded  against unauthorized access, the center used the TLP designation to  ensure that sensitive information was shared with the appropriate  audience. Specifically, NCCIC disseminated its products via the NCCIC  portal, using the protocol for products such as Indicator Bulletins, Analysis  Reports, Malware Initial Findings Reports, and Malware Analysis  Reports. (Additional examples of how NCCIC products and services  helped the center implement its functions according to the principles are  provided in appendix IV.)", "On the other hand, we also identified instances where the cybersecurity  functions were not performed in adherence with the principles. For  example, with regard to function 6, NCCIC is to provide timely technical  assistance, risk management support, and incident response capabilities  to federal and nonfederal entities. The function is supported, in part, by  Risk and Vulnerability Assessments. However, NCCIC had not  established measures or other procedures for ensuring the timeliness of  these assessments. According to officials responsible for this service, the  assessments have an estimated completion time frame of 8-10 weeks for  each customer. However, the officials stated that this time frame is not an  established metric by which they evaluate the timeliness of the service.  Further, NCCIC had not established measures or procedures to assess  the actionability of its products and services. For example, US-CERT  Indicator Bulletins, a product that supports several functions, typically  contain actionable information, such as specific malicious Internet  addresses to be blocked. NCCIC had not established a means of  determining the extent to which a particular bulletin helped to mitigate a  risk or prevent an incident.", "In discussing this matter, NCCIC officials acknowledged that they had not  made a complete determination of the applicability of the principles with  all of the center\u2019s functions and thus had not established measures and  procedures for assessing its products and services against the principles.  The officials stated that they have begun to map activities supporting the  cybersecurity functions to the implementing principles. For example,  according to the officials, the center established a unit for reviewing and  making recommendations to improve overall NCCIC operations. During  fiscal year 2016, this unit completed performance management reviews  across the center\u2019s programs to identify areas in which NCCIC could  better align its operations with its overall requirements, including the  principles. Further, officials from the ICS-CERT branch stated that they  were in the preliminary stages of measuring their activities against one of  the nine principles. Specifically, the officials stated that 20 metrics were  being developed that would measure timeliness, relevance, and  actionability (principle 1) across the components of their organization.", "Nevertheless, while these preliminary actions are important steps, they do  not represent a complete determination of the applicability of all nine  principles across all of NCCIC\u2019s statutorily-required cybersecurity  functions. As such, NCCIC officials could not say whether the principles  did or did not apply to all of the 11 functions. Moreover, because a  complete determination of the applicability of the nine principles had not  been done, the center also had not developed metrics and methods for  assessing and ensuring adherence with the principles. Until the center  determines the applicability of the implementing principles for all of its  functions and develops the metrics and methods necessary to ensure that  the principles are met, it will not be positioned to ensure that NCCIC is  effectively meeting its statutory requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCCIC Faces Impediments to Performing Its Cybersecurity Functions More Efficiently", "paragraphs": ["In addition to NCCIC not having made a complete determination of how it  is adhering to the principles, a number of factors impede the center\u2019s  ability to more efficiently perform several of its cybersecurity functions. In  particular, the center faces impediments in tracking security incidents;  maintaining current and reliable customer information, to include  obtaining such information on all owners and operators of the most critical  infrastructure assets; working across multiple network platforms; and  collaborating with international partners.", "Tracking of security incidents is not centralized or reconciled. The  National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 requires NCCIC to  coordinate the sharing of information across the government. This  includes information related to cyber threat indicators, defensive  measures, and cybersecurity risks and incidents.", "However, NCCIC officials were unable to completely track and  consolidate cyber incidents reported to the center, thereby inhibiting its  ability to coordinate the sharing of information across the government. For  US-CERT-related incidents, personnel assigned to the NCICC service  desk generated a daily report of the current status of the open incident  tickets. For example, the July 18, 2016 report had a total of 520 incident  tickets. However, this report did not represent the totality of incidents  across the center because it did not include incidents reported to ICS- CERT. Since the NCCIC service desk did not have access to the data  within the ICS-CERT ticketing system, it could not produce a  management report on the status of all incidents reported to the center.", "NCCIC officials attributed the lack of a single, centralized incident tracking  system to the fact that ICS-CERT and US-CERT had operated as  separate entities prior to the establishment of the center. As such, both  ICS-CERT and US-CERT has its own incident ticketing system. Senior  ICS-CERT officials stated they are aware of this challenge and are  exploring options on how best to integrate the two systems. Until such  integration takes place, NCCIC will continue to encounter difficulty in  completely tracking the total efforts of its branches to address reported  cybersecurity incidents. As a result, the center will be challenged in  determining how effective it is in sharing information related to cyber  threat indicators, defensive measures, and cybersecurity risks and  incidents across the government.", "The difficulty of logging incident data is further compounded by the  multiple ways in which an incident can be reported to the center. US- CERT officials stated that there are six preferred ways in which NCCIC  receives information related to potential incidents. For example, to  communicate with US-CERT, customers can choose e-mail, a phone call,  an automatic submission form, or an automated machine-to-machine  submission as the means to notify US-CERT of an incident. In addition, to  communicate with ICS-CERT regarding an industrial control system- related incident, customers can choose to submit an e-mail or phone  directly to ICS-CERT (Figure 4 shows the ways in which NCCIC prefers  to receive reported incidents.)", "However, contrary to the 6 preferred methods of communicating with US- CERT and ICS-CERT, officials from NCCIC\u2019s Operations and Integration  office provided documentation that identified at least 22 methods by  which the center receives potential incidents. These methods would  include phone numbers and e-mail addresses other than the  aforementioned 6 methods, established by various groups within the four  NCCIC components as a means to communicate with partners.", "In addition, according to NCCIC officials, depending on the method of  reporting, incidents are not always logged into the NCCIC incident  ticketing systems. For example, when customers have prior established  relationships, analysts can be called directly and can handle the incidents  without logging them into the system. The lack of control over the entry  points as well as inconsistencies in logging data, together; inhibit the  center in consistently tracking incidents and their status across the entire  NCCIC.", "Until the center can reduce, consolidate, or modify the points of entry that  customer entities use to communicate with NCCIC, it will lack the ability to  better ensure that all incident tickets are logged appropriately. Thus,  further contributing to the center being less able to effectively perform its  statutorily-required function in coordinating the sharing of information  related to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and cybersecurity  risks and incidents across the government.", "Maintaining current and reliable customer information. The National  Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 requires NCCIC to be the federal  civilian interface for the multidirectional and cross-sector sharing of  information related to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures,  cybersecurity risks and incidents, and analysis and warnings for federal  and nonfederal entities. To perform this function, the center needs to  have accurate and up-to-date contact information for the potential  recipients of the cybersecurity information it shares.", "However, NCCIC\u2019s contact information was not always up to date, thus  impacting its ability to effectively function as a federal civilian interface for  federal and nonfederal entities. Specifically, after e-mailing our survey to  recipients of NCCIC\u2019s products and services, we received 303  undeliverable return messages out of 2,792 recipients contacted. We also  identified individuals who were included on the list of recipients that  NCCIC provided to us that no longer had the role the center indicated or  were no longer with the entity listed.", "NCCIC officials were unable to demonstrate that they had any formal  process for maintaining customer contact information. The officials stated  that maintaining customer contact information was an ad hoc process and  acknowledged that capturing changes to that data was a challenge.", "Without regularly validating data pertaining to its product and service  recipients, the center may lack quality information it needs to effectively  develop and maintain partnerships and share cybersecurity-related  information with federal and nonfederal entities to support its operation as  required by the statutes.", "Obtaining contact information of all owners and operators of the  most critical cyber-dependent infrastructure assets. The National  Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 requires NCCIC to facilitate cross- sector coordination to address cybersecurity risks and incidents. This  includes cybersecurity risks and incidents that may be related or could  have consequential impacts across multiple sectors.", "However, representatives of federal and nonfederal entities that own  critical cyber assets that could have a catastrophic impact on the nation if  victimized by a cyber attack were not fully represented in the NCCIC  customer log. Specifically, our review found that 23 percent of the  entities owning such critical assets (as determined by DHS) were not  represented within the master NCCIC customer log as of September  2016. Without representation of these entities, NCCIC may not have the  information it needs readily available to facilitate coordination with critical  asset owners. NCCIC officials were unable to demonstrate that they had  a formal internal process for maintaining customer contact information  and acknowledged that doing so remains a challenge for the center.", "Without a concentrated effort on ensuring the full representation of the  owners and operators of these critical assets, the center lacks assurance  that it is adequately facilitating the cross-sector coordination of  cybersecurity risk and incidents to the nation\u2019s most critical cyber- dependent assets that, if impacted, could have a catastrophic effect on  the nation.", "Working across multiple network platforms. The National  Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 requires NCCIC to coordinate the  sharing of information across the government. This includes information  related to cybersecurity risks and incidents.", "However, we found that the sharing of information is complicated by  NCCIC analysts having to operate across multiple networks, often  manually entering data into each network, which decreases the rate of  response of coordinating the sharing of incident information to customers  and increases the risk of false entry. For example, officials stated that it  takes on average 3 minutes for a ticket to be closed when working within  one network. Across the 3 systems, it could take up to 15 minutes,  depending on the size of the ticket, and the amount of information needed  to be manually entered into each system.", "According to senior NCCIC officials, this impediment was attributed to a  legacy technical infrastructure implemented prior to the center\u2019s  existence. They added that efforts were under way to address this  impediment. However, NCCIC had not developed an implementation plan  or established time frames for consolidating or integrating the networks.", "Until NCCIC develops a process to avoid manual data entry, it will  continue to face challenges in efficiently sharing information related to  cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and cybersecurity risks and  incidents across the government.", "Collaborating with international partners using the NCCIC Portal.

However, DHS is  migrating the NCCIC portal to the Homeland Security Information  Network. This network is categorized as a FIPS 199 high-impact system  and, thus, requires authentication of individuals with access to the  system. According to NCCIC officials, international partners had  expressed a concern that the new network will have a negative impact on  their collaboration with NCCIC because continued access would require  the submission of international participants\u2019 passports and other sensitive  personal information to a U.S. government entity.", "While DHS has a responsibility to ensure the security over its high-impact  systems, NCCIC may face a barrier to engaging with international  partners. Without taking action to address this potential barrier,  international partners may be reluctant to engage with NCCIC.

These laws together require the  center to carry out 11 cybersecurity functions. More specifically, the  National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 prescribed 7 functions and  the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 prescribed 4 additional functions. The  National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 also identified 9  implementing principles. The two acts also contained provisions for GAO  to report on NCCIC\u2019s implementation of its cybersecurity mission.", "To determine the extent to which it was addressing the 11 cybersecurity  functions, we analyzed the center\u2019s program descriptions, concepts of  operations, and policies and procedures documenting how each of the  center\u2019s components are to operate.

We did not remove multiple instances of the same e-mail  address appearing on more than one list; these duplicates were retained  in the sample frame so that each instance of that e-mail address might  have a chance of initial selection proportional to the size of the customer  list it appeared on.", "We initially drew a random but nongeneralizable sample of 2,907 e-mail  address records, allocated across the 16 customer types roughly  proportional to the sizes of each type. We then removed 115 of this initial  sample because their e-mail addresses duplicated selections made from  other customer lists, for a total sample of 2,792 customer records with  unique e-mail addresses, which we attempted to contact with our survey.", "We began our survey on August 2, 2016. We sent e-mails with login  information to the web-based questionnaire to the sample. We sent up to  three follow-up e-mails during the fieldwork period to those who had not  yet responded. The survey ended on September 8, 2016. The outcomes  of the survey fieldwork are displayed in table 5 below.", "The response rate to the survey, calculated as the number of usable  responses divided by the number found to be eligible was about 14  percent. Because of the variability in coverage of the population by the  sample frame, irregularities in the contact information and eligibility of the  records sampled, and the low rate of response to the survey, the results  of this survey only represent those that responded, and are not  generalizable to any larger population of NCCIC customers. We do not  make any inferences about those not sampled or not responding to the  survey.", "In addition to this limitation, questionnaire surveys of this kind are subject  to other potential errors. To minimize the possibility of measurement error  (differences between reported and true answers) arising from question  design, interpretation or administration, or the misreporting of answers,  we designed and administered the survey in consultation with survey  methodologists, made improvements to the questionnaire based on  pretest results, and had a separate survey methodologist review the draft  questionnaire to identify potential problems in questionnaire design.", "Of the 340 respondents, 14 percent identified themselves as individual  participants in NCCIC activities, 64 percent as representatives of a single  public or private organization, 13 percent as representing an association  or other entity representing a sector or group of organizations, and 9  percent identified in other ways. Thirty-four percent said they represented  federal government entities; 18 percent said they represented state, local,  or tribal entities; 44 percent said they represented private sector entities;  and 4 percent gave other answers.", "During the processing and analysis of reported data, we also identified  and corrected for patterns of response across questions that we could  identify as inconsistent or contradictory. Nonresponse error (failure to  obtain a response to a question or the questionnaire) may lead to bias in  the results if those who do not respond would have given materially  different responses from those who did respond. To minimize  nonresponse, we made follow-up contacts throughout the survey. To  minimize processing error (mistakes in converting reported data into  published survey results), data processing and analysis programming  was independently verified by a separate data analyst.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to February  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: NCCIC Product and Service Information", "paragraphs": ["Table 6 below highlights the total number of each product and service  that the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center  (NCCIC) reported providing to its customers in fiscal years 2015 and  2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: NCCIC Products and Services Supporting Cybersecurity Functions", "paragraphs": ["The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center  (NCCIC) is required to perform 11 cybersecurity functions.
