GAO interviewed and reviewed available information from a non-generalizable sample of representatives from five large airports and six large airlines. GAO also interviewed six airport law enforcement agencies, and seven prosecutors' offices. Further, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed two unions representing customer service agents and five federal agencies with airport safety or security responsibilities. GAO developed and administered a brief, non-generalizable survey to 104 customer service agents working at four selected large airports that GAO visited in March and April 2019.

This lack of data is due, in part, to the limited federal role in addressing such assaults. GAO's survey of 104 airline customer service agents showed that over half (61) reported experiencing such action in the past year, while almost all reported experiencing verbal harassment. About 10 percent reported experiencing physical assaults. Stakeholders GAO interviewed said that while passengers are often verbally disruptive, physical assaults are less frequent. These stakeholders also said that alcohol consumption, frustration over airlines' business practices (e.g., fees for checked or carry-on baggage), and long lines can contribute to these incidents.", "Of the stakeholders\u2014i.e., airlines, airports, law enforcement, and prosecutors\u2014 GAO interviewed who provided perspectives and have responsibilities for passenger assaults, all 23 said state and local laws sufficiently deter and address such incidents, and 15 (of 20) said current resources are sufficient. One prosecutor told GAO the transitory nature of airports makes it difficult to get witnesses to testify at trial; when prosecuted, passengers generally face misdemeanor charges. While stakeholders GAO interviewed generally did not identify gaps in resources, some said incidents could be further mitigated if, for example, airports made law enforcement's presence more visible or airlines provided conflict de-escalation training to customer service agents. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 required that airlines (1) provide such training to all employees, and (2) submit plans to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by January 2019 detailing how airlines respond to passenger assaults. In July 2019, FAA issued a notification to airlines reminding them to submit their plans; officials said they will continue to follow up with airlines until they receive the plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Media outlets have recently reported instances where passengers have  acted violently, abusively, or disruptively towards airline customer service  agents at airports. For example, according to media reports, in 2017, a  \u201cnear riot\u201d broke out at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport  after one airline canceled multiple flights, inciting unrest among roughly  500 passengers. Airport law enforcement reportedly arrested and  charged three passengers with disorderly conduct after the passengers  physically assaulted a customer service agent, among others, during the  incident. Such incidents can threaten safety and security at airports.", "A number of state and local laws generally prohibit certain intentional  verbal and physical acts of aggression, among other types of harmful  actions, against another individual. Even though these laws may not  necessarily be specific to prohibiting such actions against customer  service agents at airports, they can be used to charge and prosecute  passengers. Yet, in recent years, some aviation stakeholders have raised  questions about the safety of customer service agents. The FAA  Reauthorization Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to examine  \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d committed by passengers against airline customer  service agents while they perform their duties at airports. Due to data  availability issues, for the purposes of our report, we refer to certain types  of incidents\u2014to include verbal threats, attempted physical acts, or actual  physical acts\u2014as \u201cpassenger assaults.\u201d The Act also included a provision  that GAO conduct a gap analysis of state and local laws and resources to  determine if they adequately deter and address such assaults. This report  examines (1) what is known about instances of assaults by passengers  against airline customer service agents at airports, and (2) stakeholders\u2019  perspectives on the sufficiency of existing laws and resources to deter  and address such incidents.", "For both objectives, we interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 24  stakeholder groups\u2014including representatives from five large hub  airports, six airlines, six airport law enforcement agencies, and seven  prosecutors\u2019 offices. We selected airports based on a number of factors.  First, we limited our selection to those that FAA designated as large hub  airports in 2017 to capture airports that had a large number of passenger  boardings. We then sought to include airports across a range of  geographic locations as well as a variety of airlines operating at each  selected airport. Finally, we considered whether media outlets had  reported incidents between passengers and customer service agents in  the last 5 years. We selected our six airlines to include both network and low-cost airlines that boarded among the most passengers in 2017 and  serviced a diverse group of airports. During interviews with all  stakeholder groups, we asked representatives for their perspectives on  passenger assaults, including information on the most common type of  misconduct; frequency; whether gaps exist in laws or resources to deter  or address such incidents; and other actions, if any, that could deter or  address passenger assaults. In addition, we interviewed a non- generalizable sample of seven industry organizations\u2014including  representatives from associations representing state prosecutors (two);  airports (one); airlines (one); airport law enforcement (one); and unions  representing customer service agents (two). We selected these  organizations based on the following factors: their inclusion in prior GAO  reports, their role in relevant industries, and recommendations from other  stakeholders.", "We also reviewed available documents and interviewed officials from the  following five federal agencies that have responsibilities related to  aviation safety and security: the Department of Justice (DOJ);  Department of Transportation (DOT); Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA, a component of DOT); Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI, a  component of DOJ); and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA,  a component of the Department of Homeland Security). As part of this  work, we also conducted a literature search to identify articles published  over the past 5 years about anxiety or stress at airports and identified one  additional study by searching the Transit Cooperative Research Program  Publications.", "To understand what is known about passenger assaults\u2014including the  frequency and most common type of passenger conduct\u2014we reviewed  documentation and conducted interviews with officials at the five federal  agencies listed above about available data. We also developed and  administered a non-generalizable \u201cintercept survey\u201d to 104 selected customer service agents staffed at the ticket counter, gate area, or  baggage claim area at the four airports we visited in March and April 2019  to learn about their experiences as airline customer service agents. We  pre-tested our survey with four customer service agents to make sure  questions were clear. Results from this non-generalizable survey cannot  be used to make inferences about the population of customer service  agents but do provide insights into selected customer service agents\u2019  experiences with passengers. Similarly, since we only administered our  survey at four large hub airports, it is possible that we would have  different results if we had surveyed agents at different airports. The final  survey is included in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2018 to September  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Airline customer service agents have a number of duties to assist  passengers at the airport (see fig. 1). Customer service agents can check  passengers into flights; handle and tag checked bags; and board and  deplane passengers on the aircraft; in addition to assisting passengers  when service failures occur, such as helping to locate a lost bag. At  many airports and airlines, customer service agents are trained to work  the ticket counter and the arrival and departure gates. In this role, airline  customer service agents\u2019 interactions with passengers can range from  pleasant to routine to contentious. For example, if bad weather causes an  airline to delay or cancel flights, harried passengers trying to make  connecting flights or get to a destination may take their frustration out on  a customer service agent.", "The following entities are responsible for helping to prevent or address  passenger assaults:", "Airlines seek to provide a safe work environment for customer  service agents. Among other things, airlines set policies and  procedures instructing customer service agents how to handle and  report incidents, in addition to how management should respond.", "Airport law enforcement responds to allegations of violence at  airports and enforces state and local laws. According to airport law  enforcement, when they respond to incidents, they generally capture  information in police reports.", "Airport management, such as a security director, may be informed of  alleged passenger assaults at the airport or support ensuing  investigations and prosecutions.", "Prosecutors at the federal and state level decide whether to charge  passengers for offenses that violate laws.", "No one federal agency is responsible for addressing passenger assaults  against customer service agents at the airport. For example, FAA sets  policies that airlines and their employees must adhere to for aviation  safety, but TSA oversees the security of the nation\u2019s civil aviation system.  However, officials from both TSA and FAA told us their responsibilities for  passenger assaults at airports are limited. In particular, FAA officials said  their primary responsibility is for assaults onboard aircraft as opposed to  at the airport. Similarly, TSA officials said they only get involved in  assaults of airline customer service agents in the rare instances where  incidents affect airport security. Within DOJ, FBI conducts investigations  of incidents that are deemed to violate federal law, and federal  prosecutors can decide whether to prosecute individuals for alleged  incidents that are deemed to violate federal law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Information Is Limited, Almost All Surveyed Customer Service Agents Reported Verbal Harassment, and Some Reported Physical Assaults", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "No Comprehensive Information Is Available to Understand Assaults by Passengers against Airline Customer Service Agents", "paragraphs": ["Limited data are available to determine the frequency or nature of  passenger assaults at airports against airline customer service agents.  We reviewed selected data from DOJ, DOT, FAA, FBI, and TSA and  found that no dataset can isolate such passenger assaults. For example,  while the FBI collects transportation crime data from law enforcement  agencies about incidents that occur at air, bus, or train terminals\u2014 including information on the victim, offender, and location of the crime\u2014 the data cannot isolate passenger assaults against airline customer  service agents.", "While representatives from selected airport law enforcement agencies  and airlines we interviewed said they collect information related to  passenger assaults for their respective airports or airlines, these data  were generally unavailable. In particular, representatives from all six  selected airport law enforcement agencies we interviewed said providing  data on passenger assaults against airline customer service agents would  require manually reviewing all police reports. Results from one selected  airport law enforcement agency that had manually reviewed its data for  2018 found that of the 237 assistance calls it received for incidents  between customer service agents and passengers, law enforcement  completed an incident report for 12 of these calls, and referred two  reports to state prosecutors. Representatives from five of the six  selected airlines declined to share data with us, saying data were not  readily available, or were business proprietary, or business sensitive.  Representatives from the remaining airline provided us with data from the  third and fourth quarters of 2018; this data indicated that incidents  between passengers and customer service agents generally remained  constant, with an average of approximately 1.2 disruptive passengers per  1,000 passenger boardings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "About 10 Percent of Surveyed Customer Service Agents Said Passengers Physically Assaulted Them in the Past Year", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of available data, we surveyed a non-generalizable  sample of 104 randomly selected customer service agents to understand  their experiences performing their jobs over the last year. According to  these 104 customer service agents, almost all (96) reported experiencing  verbal harassment, such as passengers yelling, cursing, or being  argumentative (see fig. 2). Almost half (46) reported experiencing verbal  threats, such as passengers threatening to harm the customer service  agent. Twenty-two customer service agents reported that a passenger  attempted to physically assault them by, for example, attempting to push  them. Fewer (12) customer service agents said that passengers actually  physically assaulted them. We also found that about one-third (34) of  surveyed customer service agents said they experienced \u201cother types of  harmful actions,\u201d which agents said included passengers destroying  property, taking video of agents, grabbing agents\u2019 identification badges,  and stalking agents after work.", "Stakeholders we interviewed from selected airports, airport law  enforcement, and airlines generally agreed that passengers can be  verbally disruptive but that physical assaults are less frequent. More  specifically, of these 17 stakeholders, most (13) agreed that disruptive  passenger behavior is frequent. Most (11) also agreed that physical  assaults occur less frequently than verbal threats. Nevertheless, while  representatives from two selected unions did not have data on such  actions, they emphasized to us that the customer service agents they  represent face difficult working conditions. The union representatives also  stated that passenger assaults, including verbal threats and physical  assaults, are becoming more common. Further, three of the nine  stakeholders who provided a perspective said that incidents against  customer service agents are increasing. For example, representatives  from one airline we interviewed said that over the past 5 years, they have  observed an increase in both the frequency and severity of passenger  assaults, in addition to other disruptive behavior.", "A number of factors may contribute to passenger assaults. Selected  stakeholders, including those from airlines, airports, airport law  enforcement, and other industry associations most commonly cited (24)  alcohol consumption at the airport or drug use as a contributing factor.  For example, according to representatives from one law enforcement  agency, when customer service agents deny boarding to intoxicated  passengers, passengers can become verbally or physically aggressive  toward customer service agents. Other stakeholders told us that  passengers increasingly have more opportunities to consume alcohol  while waiting for their flights, thereby increasing alcohol-related incidents.  For example, representatives from one airport noted that tablets at the  boarding area allow passengers to place orders for alcohol while seated  at the gate.", "Seventeen selected stakeholders we interviewed also told us that airlines\u2019  business practices, such as charging fees for checked and carry-on  baggage or policies around delays and cancellations might aggravate or  surprise passengers and lead them to be aggressive toward customer  service agents. Some stakeholders (10) also said that other factors, such  as long lines and large crowds in the airport can increase passengers\u2019  stress levels. Moreover, according to some stakeholders, service  failures\u2014such as flight delays, cancellations, or lost baggage\u2014can  exacerbate these stressors.", "Of the 61 surveyed customer service agents who reported experiencing  verbal threats, attempted physical assaults, actual physical assaults, or  other harmful actions, most (45) said these incidents negatively affected  their overall well-being. Similarly, selected union representatives we  interviewed also said that these incidents can increase stress and anxiety  for customer service agents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Almost All Surveyed Customer Service Agents Who Said They Experienced a Passenger Assault Reported It, and Airline Management or Airport Law Enforcement Often Took Some Action", "paragraphs": ["Almost all customer service agents (56 of 61) who stated in our survey  that they experienced passenger conduct amounting to more than  harassment said they reported the conduct to someone. Specifically, 46  customer service agents stated that they contacted their immediate airline  manager; 28 stated that they contacted airport law enforcement; and 6  stated that they contacted airport staff or other entities.", "These actions described by customer service agents we surveyed  generally aligned with selected airlines\u2019 procedures for handling  passenger assaults. Specifically, representatives from five selected  airlines told us that while their respective airline\u2019s policy generally calls for  agents to contact management first, agents can also contact airport law  enforcement if they feel like their safety is threatened. However,  representatives from two selected unions told us that airline managers  are sometimes hesitant to inform law enforcement about incidents\u2014or  have their agents contact law enforcement\u2014or to elevate incidents  internally. According to one union representative, airlines prefer to keep  such incidents internal and emphasize providing on-time service to their  passengers. Contacting law enforcement could make this difficult to  achieve, so when disruptive passenger behavior occurs, airlines may be  inclined to allow the passenger onboard the aircraft instead of contacting  law enforcement.", "Of the 56 customer service agents who stated they reported the  passenger conduct, over half (33) said that, to their knowledge,  representatives from airlines, law enforcement, or airports took action in  response. According to our survey results, these representatives generally took a range of actions, including but not limited to, requesting  that a passenger stop the disruptive behavior, completing an airline or  police report, denying a passenger boarding, or arresting a passenger.  Representatives most commonly removed passengers from an area or  denied passengers from boarding (18); diffused the situation (7); or  arrested the passenger (4). Twenty-six customer service agents said that  no action was taken in response to the incident, which left some to not  feel supported by airline management. Moreover, according to  representatives from one union, in some instances, customer service  agents feel that if airline management provides passengers with travel  benefits, such as seat upgrades or airline miles, to diffuse these types of  situations, it can appear to be condoning or rewarding any passenger  misbehavior.", "The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 requires airlines to develop and  submit employee assault-prevention and response plans to FAA by  January 2019. In these plans, airlines are required to document:  reporting protocols for airline customer service agents who have been  the victim of a verbal or physical assault; protocols for notifying law enforcement after an incident of verbal or  physical assault committed against an airline customer service agent; protocols for informing federal law enforcement about violations of  federal law that prohibits interference with security screening  personnel; protocols for ensuring that a passenger involved in a violent incident  with an airline customer service agent is not allowed to move through  airport security or board an aircraft until appropriate law enforcement  has an opportunity to assess the incident and take appropriate action;  and protocols for informing passengers of federal laws protecting federal,  airport, and airline employees who have security duties within an  airport.", "In March 2019, FAA officials said they had not received employee  assault-prevention and response plans from all of the 49 U.S. airlines that  were required to submit such plans. However, at that time, officials also  said they were not concerned about any delays because they believed  airlines already have internal policies and procedures for handling these  types of incidents. Nevertheless, FAA officials told us they intended to  issue a reminder to the airlines. Of the six selected airlines we  interviewed, representatives from two airlines said they had submitted  their plans to FAA, and representatives from the remaining four airlines  said their plans were in development. Further, when we asked airlines to  describe their policies for handling assaults, some of the policies that  representatives described aligned to some requirements in the Act for the  plans. For example, as discussed previously, all six selected airlines told  us they had policies for how customer service agents or managers should  notify airport law enforcement when assaults occur. Moreover,  representatives from all six airlines also described reports that that  customer service agents and employees complete when such incidents  occur.", "In July 2019, FAA issued a notification to airlines, reminding them to  develop and submit their plans. FAA officials attributed delays in following  up with airlines to the government shutdown in early 2019 and multiple  competing requirements in the Act. FAA officials also said they were  initially hesitant to issue a notification around these plans, since the  agency has a limited role and does not promulgate requirements for the  training or oversight of customer service agents. Nevertheless, FAA  officials said they plan to continue to follow up with the airlines as needed  to collect the remaining plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Selected Stakeholders Said State and Local Laws and Resources Sufficiently Deter and Address Passenger Assaults against Airline Customer Service Agents Despite General Satisfaction, Some Said Stronger Penalties and Other Legal Avenues Could Be Pursued", "paragraphs": ["All selected stakeholders we interviewed representing airlines, airports,  airport law enforcement, and prosecutors (23 of 23) who provided a  perspective said that current state and local laws sufficiently deter and  address passenger assaults. We spoke with seven selected state  prosecutors who told us that, among other offenses, they can charge  passengers for actions against customer service agents with assault;  battery (e.g., intentional causing of bodily harm); disorderly conduct (i.e.,  acts that are of a nature to outrage the sense of public decency, or affect  the peace and quiet of persons who may witness them, or engaging in  brawling or fighting); and trespassing. According to these prosecutors,  they typically charge passengers for assaults as misdemeanors, which  one prosecutor told us generally does not result in passengers\u2019 serving  any jail time.", "While four selected state prosecutors who regularly handle misdemeanor  prosecutions did not have data isolating these crimes, three recalled  charging passengers for assaults against customer service agents. For  example, a representative from one prosecutor\u2019s office estimated that,  over the last 5 years, law enforcement had referred 25 to 30 of these  incidents to his office and that his office had prosecuted six or seven of  these cases. In determining whether to pursue a case, five prosecutors  we interviewed told us they weigh a number of factors, such as whether  the customer service agent is willing to file charges; whether law  enforcement observed the assault; and whether witnesses are available  to testify. Nonetheless, according to prosecutors we interviewed, crimes  committed at airports present unique challenges. More specifically,  according to one prosecutor we spoke with, the transitory nature of  airports makes it difficult to get witnesses to testify at a trial, because they  are often passing through the airport en route to another destination.", "Four selected prosecutors also told us that passenger assaults might be  charged as felonies if, for example, the crime involves the use of a deadly  weapon or causes serious physical injury to the victim. However, these  prosecutors told us such instances are infrequent and incidents between  passengers and customer service agents rarely rise to the level of  severity of a felony charge. To that end, none of the three prosecutors we  interviewed who typically prosecute felony cases could remember  charging a passenger for an assault of a customer service agent within  the last year.", "Nevertheless, some selected stakeholders told us opportunities exist to  strengthen penalties for passenger assaults. More broadly, a few  stakeholders that we interviewed\u2014including one airline, one prosecutor,  and one union\u2014suggested opportunities exist to pursue harsher  penalties. According to selected stakeholders, this could be achieved by,  for example, prosecuting passenger assaults as felonies, prosecuting  these incidents at the federal level, or seeking a legislative change to  classify airline customer service agents as a protected class. For  example, under Florida statute, an alleged battery against certain  specified protected classes, including elected officials and teachers, are  automatically reclassified from a first degree misdemeanor to a third  degree felony charge, resulting in potentially harsher penalties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "While Selected Stakeholders Generally Agreed Resources Are Sufficient, Some Suggested Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Most selected stakeholders we interviewed who provided a perspective  said that their current resources sufficiently deter and address passenger  assaults.
