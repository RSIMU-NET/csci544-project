NTIA and RUS face scheduling, staffing, and data challenges in evaluating applications and awarding funds. NTIA, through its new Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, and RUS, through its new Broadband Initiatives Program, must review more applications and award far more funds than the agencies formerly handled through their legacy telecommunications grant or loan programs. NTIA and RUS initially proposed distributing these funds in three rounds. To meet these challenges, the agencies have established a two-step application evaluation process that uses contractors or volunteers for application reviews and plan to publish information on applicants' proposed service areas to help ensure the eligibility of proposed projects. While these steps address some challenges, the upcoming deadline for awarding funds may pose risks to the thoroughness of the application evaluation process. In particular, the agencies may lack time to apply lessons learned from the first funding round and to thoroughly evaluate applications for the remaining rounds. Oversight of funded projects. NTIA and RUS will oversee a significant number of projects, including projects with large budgets and diverse purposes and locations. In doing so, the agencies face the challenge of monitoring these projects with far fewer staff per project than were available for their legacy grant and loan programs. To address this challenge, NTIA and RUS have hired contractors to assist with oversight activities and plan to require funding recipients to complete quarterly reports and, in some cases, obtain annual audits. Despite these steps, several risks remain, including a lack of funding for oversight beyond fiscal year 2010 and a lack of updated performance measures to ensure accountability for NTIA and RUS. In addition, NTIA has yet to define annual audit requirements for commercial entities funded under the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing to discuss the  implementation and oversight of the broadband programs funded through  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Recovery Act). As you  know, access to broadband is seen as vital to economic, social, and  educational development, yet many areas of the country lack access to, or  their residents do not use, broadband. The Recovery Act appropriated $7.2  billion to extend access to broadband throughout the United States. Of the  $7.2 billion, $4.7 billion was appropriated for the Department of  Commerce\u2019s (DOC) National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA) and $2.5 billion for the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS). Specifically, the Recovery Act  authorized NTIA, in consultation with the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC), to create the Broadband Technology Opportunities  Program (BTOP) to manage competitive grants to a variety of entities for  broadband infrastructure, public computer centers, and innovative  projects to stimulate demand for, and adoption of, broadband. Of the $4.7  billion, up to $350 million was available pursuant to the Broadband Data  Improvement Act for the purpose of developing and maintaining a  nationwide map featuring the availability of broadband service, with some  funds available for transfer to FCC for the development of a national  broadband plan to help ensure that all people in the United States have  access to broadband. Similarly, RUS established the Broadband Initiatives  Program (BIP) to make loans and to award grants and loan/grant  combinations for broadband infrastructure projects in rural areas.", "NTIA and RUS have taken many important steps to implement the  broadband provisions in the Recovery Act. NTIA, RUS, and FCC held a  series of public meetings in March 2009, explaining the overall goals of the  new broadband programs. NTIA and RUS also sought public comments  from interested stakeholders on various challenges that the agencies  would face in implementing the broadband programs through these  meetings and by issuing a Request for Information. NTIA and RUS  received over 1,500 comments. FCC, in a consultative role, provided  support in developing technical definitions and participated in the public  meetings. NTIA and RUS initially indicated that they would award  Recovery Act broadband program funds in three jointly-conducted rounds.  On July 1, 2009, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Commerce Gary  Locke, and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the release of  the first joint Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) detailing the  requirements, rules, and procedures for applying for BTOP grants and BIP  grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations. Subsequently, the agencies  held 10 joint informational workshops throughout the country for  potential applicants to explain the programs, the application process, and  the evaluation and compliance procedures, and to answer stakeholder  questions. NTIA and RUS coordinated and developed a single online intake  system whereby applicants could apply for either BTOP or BIP funding.  NTIA and RUS must award all funds by September 30, 2010, and both  BTOP and BIP projects must be substantially complete within 2 years and  fully complete no later than 3 years following the date of issuance of their  award.", "My testimony today discusses (1) the challenges and risks, if any, NTIA  and RUS face in evaluating applications and awarding funds, and the steps  they have they taken to address identified risks, and (2) the challenges and  risks, if any, the agencies face in overseeing funded projects, and the steps  they have taken to address identified risks. My testimony presents  preliminary observations based on ongoing work we expect to complete  this fall.", "To conduct our work, we are reviewing FCC, NTIA, and RUS program  documentation. We are also interviewing relevant staff from the three  agencies regarding their agencies\u2019 efforts to implement the broadband  provisions of the Recovery Act. We are reviewing relevant laws and  regulations; guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  DOC and the Department of Justice, and the Domestic Working Group;  and prior GAO reports. We are comparing the agencies\u2019 efforts to the laws,  regulations, and guidance to identify strengths and weaknesses in their  efforts. To determine what reporting and audit requirements will apply to  recipients of NTIA and RUS funding, we are reviewing the Single Audit  Act, agency regulations and documents, and OMB guidance, and  interviewing agency officials. Finally, we are interviewing stakeholder  organizations representing a range of interests, including associations  representing wireline, wireless, cable, and satellite service providers;  consumer advocates; telecommunication policy researchers; and state  telecommunications regulators to obtain their views on the potential  challenges and risks facing the agencies. We are conducting this  performance audit, which began in April 2009, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

The agencies have 18 months to establish their  respective programs, solicit and evaluate applications, and award all  funds. While in some instances a compressed schedule does not pose a  challenge, two factors enhance the challenges associated with the 18- month schedule. First, NTIA must establish the BTOP program from  scratch, and RUS has existing broadband grant and loan programs, albeit  on a much smaller scale than BIP. Second, the agencies face an  unprecedented volume of funds and anticipated number of applications  compared to their previous experiences.", "The funding associated with BTOP and BIP exceed NTIA\u2019s and RUS\u2019s prior  experience with other grant or loan programs (see fig. 1). In comparison to  the $4.7 billion appropriation NTIA received for BTOP, its Public  Telecommunications Facilities Program received an average of $23 million  annually and its Telecommunications Opportunities Program received $24  million annually. NTIA also administered the one-time Public Safety  Interoperable Communications Program (PSIC), with an appropriation of  about $1 billion, in close coordination with the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS). In comparison to the $2.5 billion appropriation RUS  received for BIP, its Community Connect Program\u2019s average annual  appropriation was $12 million and its Broadband Access Loan Program\u2019s   Program\u2019s  average annual appropriation was $15 million.  average annual appropriation was $15 million.", "NTIA and RUS also face an increase in the number of applications that  they must review and evaluate in comparison to similar programs (see fig.  2). According to preliminary information from the agencies, they received  approximately 2,200 applications requesting $28 billion in grants and loans  in the first funding round. Of these 2,200 applications, NTIA received 940  applications exclusively for BTOP and RUS received 400 applications  exclusively for BIP and 830 dual applications that both agencies will  review. In comparison, NTIA received an average of 838 applications  annually for the Telecommunications Opportunities Program; for PSIC,  NTIA and DHS received 56 applications from state and territorial  governments containing a total of 301 proposed projects. RUS received an  average of 35 applications annually for the Broadband Access Loan  program and an average of 105 applications annually for the Community  Connect Program.", "Staffing challenges. NTIA and RUS will need additional personnel to  administer BTOP and BIP. NTIA\u2019s initial risk assessment indicated that a  lack of experienced and knowledgeable staff was a key risk to properly  implementing the program in accordance with the priorities of the  Recovery Act. In its fiscal year 2010 budget request to Congress, NTIA  estimated that it will need 30 full-time-equivalent staff in fiscal year 2009  and 40 more full-time-equivalent staff for fiscal year 2010. While RUS  already has broadband loan and grant programs in place and staff to  administer them, it also faces a shortage of personnel. RUS\u2019s staffing  assessments indicated that the agency will need 47 additional full-time- equivalents to administer BIP.", "Data challenges. NTIA and RUS lack detailed data on the availability of  broadband service throughout the country that may limit their ability to  target funds to priority areas. According to the agencies, priority areas  include unserved and underserved areas. The agencies require applicants  to assemble their proposed service areas from contiguous census blocks  and to identify the proposed service area as unserved or underserved.  However, the agencies will be awarding loans and grants before the  national broadband plan or broadband mapping is complete.

In the first step,  the agencies will evaluate and score applications based on the criteria in  the NOFA, such as project purpose and project viability. During this step,  the agencies will select which applications proceed to the second step.  After the first step is complete and the pool of potential projects is  reduced, the agencies intend to conduct the second step\u2014due diligence,  which involves requesting extra documentation to confirm and verify  information contained in an application. Since not all applications will  proceed to the second step, not all applicants will be required to submit  extra documentation which will reduce the amount of information the  agencies must review.", "Use of nongovernmental personnel. Both NTIA and RUS are using  nongovernmental personnel to address anticipated staffing needs  associated with the evaluation of applications and awarding of funds. To  evaluate applications, NTIA is using a volunteer peer review system, in  which three unpaid, expert reviewers examine and score applications;  these volunteers must have significant expertise and experience in  broadband-related activities, such as the construction and operation of a  broadband network. In addition, NTIA will use contractors in an  administrative role to assist the expert reviewers. RUS will also use  contractors to evaluate and score applications. Regardless of who reviews  the application, the final selection and funding decisions are to be formally  made by a selecting official in each agency.", "Publish applicant information. To address the challenge of incomplete  data on broadband service, NTIA and RUS require applicants to identify  and attest to the service availability\u2014either unserved or underserved\u2014in  their proposed service area. In order to verify these self-attestations, NTIA  and RUS will post a public notice identifying the proposed funded service  area of each broadband infrastructure applicant. The agencies intend to  allow existing service providers in the proposed service area to question  an applicant\u2019s characterization of broadband service in that area. If this  information raises eligibility issues, RUS may send field staff to the  proposed service area to conduct a market survey. RUS will resolve  eligibility issues by determining the actual availability of broadband  service in the proposed service area. NTIA has no procedure for resolving  these types of issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Agencies\u2019 Remaining Schedule May Pose Risks to the Review of Applications", "paragraphs": ["During the first funding round, the compressed schedule posed a challenge  for both applicants and the agencies. As mentioned previously, NTIA and  RUS initially proposed to utilize three separate funding rounds during the  18-month window to award the $7.2 billion. As such, each funding round  would operate under a compressed schedule. Eight of the 15 industry  stakeholders with whom we spoke expressed concern that a small entity  would have difficulties in completing an application in a timely manner.  The compressed schedule also posed challenges for the agencies. During  the first funding round, the agencies missed several milestones. For  example, RUS originally intended to select a contractor on June 12, 2009,  and NTIA intended to select a contractor on June 30, 2009; however, both  agencies missed their target dates, with RUS selecting its contractor on  July 31, 2009, and NTIA selecting its contractor on August 3, 2009.", "Because of the compressed schedule within the individual funding rounds,  NTIA and RUS have less time to review applications than similar grant and  loan programs. In the first funding round, the agencies have approximately  2 months to review 2,200 applications. In contrast, from fiscal year 2005  through 2008, RUS took from 4 to 7 months to receive and review an  average of 26 applications per year for its Broadband Access Loan  Program. NTIA\u2019s Public Telecommunications Facilities Program operated  on a year-long grant award cycle. For the PSIC program, NTIA and DHS  completed application reviews in roughly 6 months.", "Based on their experience with the first funding round, NTIA and RUS are  considering reducing the number of funding rounds from three to two. In  the second and final funding round, the agencies anticipate extending the  window for entities to submit applications. This change will help mitigate  the challenges the compressed schedule posed for applicants in the first  funding round. However, it is unclear whether the agencies will similarly  extend the amount of time to review the applications and thereby bring  the review time more in line with the experiences of other broadband  grant and loan programs. NTIA officials indicated that the agency would  like to make all awards by summer 2010, to promote the stimulative effect  of the BTOP program. Alternatively, RUS officials indicated that the  agency will make all awards by September 30, 2010, as required by the  Recovery Act, indicating a potentially longer review process.", "Depending on the timeframes NTIA and RUS select, the risks for both  applicants and the agencies may persist with two funding rounds. In  particular, these risks include:    Limited opportunity for \u201clessons learned.\u201d Based on the current  schedule, NTIA and RUS will have less than one month between the  completion of the first funding round and the beginning of the second  funding round. Because of this compressed time frame, applicants might  not have sufficient time to analyze their experiences with the first funding  round to provide constructive comments to the agencies. Further, the  agencies might not have sufficient time to analyze the outcomes of the first  round and the comments from potential applicants. As such, a compressed  schedule limits the opportunity to apply lessons learned from the first  funding round to improve the second round.", "Compressed schedule to review applications. Due to the complex  nature of many projects, NTIA and RUS need adequate time to evaluate  the wide range of applications and verify the information contained in the  applications. NTIA is soliciting applications for infrastructure, public  computer center, and sustainable adoption projects. Therefore, NTIA will  receive applications containing information responding to different  criteria and it will evaluate the applications with different standards. Even  among infrastructure applications, a wide variability exists in the  estimates, projections, and performance measures considered reasonable  for a project. For example, in RUS\u2019s Broadband Access Loan Program,  approved broadband loans for the highest-cost projects, on a cost-per- subscriber basis, ranged as much as 15, 18, and even 70 times as high as  the lowest-cost project, even among projects using the same technology to  deploy broadband.", "Continued lack of broadband data and plan. According to NTIA,  national broadband data provide critical information for grant making.  NTIA does not expect to have complete data for a national broadband map  until at least March 2010. Also, as mentioned previously, FCC must deliver  to Congress a national broadband plan by February 17, 2010. By operating  on a compressed schedule, NTIA and RUS will complete the first funding  round before the agencies have the data needed to target funds to  unserved and underserved areas and before FCC completes the national  broadband plan.

In  the absence of clear audit requirements and guidelines for commercial  recipients of BTOP funding, NTIA will lack an important oversight tool to  identify risks and monitor BTOP grant expenditures.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared  statement. Our future work, which we expect to complete in November,  will provide additional information on the implementation and oversight of  the broadband programs. We also expect to make recommendations at  that time. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you or other  members of the committee might have.", "For questions regarding this statement, please contact Mark L.
