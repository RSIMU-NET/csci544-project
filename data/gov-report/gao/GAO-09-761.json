In 2005, FAA requested that NWS restructure its services by consolidating operations to a smaller number of sites, reducing personnel costs, and providing services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. NWS developed two successive proposals, both of which were rejected by FAA--most recently because the costs were too high. FAA subsequently requested that NWS develop another proposal by late December 2008. In response, NWS developed a third proposal that involves consolidating 20 of 21 existing center weather service units into two locations. NWS sent this proposal to FAA in early June 2009. FAA responded to NWS in August 2009 by requesting more information regarding NWS's proposal. In response to GAO's prior concerns that NWS and FAA lacked performance measures and a baseline of current performance, the agencies have agreed on five measures and NWS has proposed eight others. In addition, the agencies initiated efforts to establish a performance baseline for 4 of 13 potential performance measures. However, the agencies have not established baseline performance for the other 9 measures. NWS officials stated they are not collecting baseline information on the 9 measures for a variety of reasons, including that some of the measures have not yet been approved by FAA, and that selected measures involve products that have not yet been developed. While 4 of the 9 measures are tied to new products or services that are to be developed if NWS's latest restructuring proposal is accepted, the other 5 could be measured in the current operational environment. For example, both accuracy and customer satisfaction measures are applicable to current operations. It is important to obtain an understanding of the current level of performance in these measures before beginning any efforts to restructure aviation weather services. Without an understanding of the current level of performance, NWS and FAA may not be able to measure the success or failure of changes they make to the center weather service unit operations. As a result, changes to the current structure could degrade aviation operations and safety--and the agencies may not know it. NWS and FAA face challenges in their efforts to improve the current aviation weather structure. These include challenges associated with (1) interagency collaboration, (2) defining FAA's requirements, and (3) aligning any changes with the Next Generation Air Transportation System--a long-term initiative to increase the efficiency of the national airspace system. If the restructuring proposal is accepted, the agencies face three additional challenges in implementing it: (1) developing a feasible schedule that includes adequate time for stakeholder involvement, (2) undertaking a comprehensive demonstration to ensure no services are degraded, and (3) effectively reconfiguring the infrastructure and technologies. Unless and until these challenges are addressed, the proposed restructuring of aviation weather services at en route centers poses new risks and has little chance of success."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Weather Service (NWS) plays a significant role in providing  weather services to the aviation community.

In addition, at any one time, as many as 7,000 aircraft\u2014both  civilian and military\u2014could be aloft over the United States. In 2004, FAA\u2019s  Air Traffic Organization was formed to, among other responsibilities,  improve the provision of air traffic services. More than 33,000 employees  within FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Organization support the operations that help  move aircraft through the national airspace system. The agency\u2019s ability to  fulfill its mission depends on the adequacy and reliability of its air traffic  control systems, as well as weather forecasts made available by NWS and  automated systems. These resources reside at, or are associated with,  several types of facilities: air traffic control towers, terminal radar  approach control facilities, air route traffic control centers (en route  centers), and the Air Traffic Control System Command Center. The  number and functions of these facilities are as follows:    517 air traffic control towers manage and control the airspace within  about 5 miles of an airport. They control departures and landings, as well  as ground operations on airport taxiways and runways.    170 terminal radar approach control facilities provide air traffic control  services for airspace within approximately 40 miles of an airport and  generally up to 10,000 feet above the airport, where en route centers\u2019  control begins. Terminal controllers establish and maintain the sequence  and separation of aircraft.    21 en route centers control planes over the United States\u2014in transit and  during approaches to some airports. Each center handles a different  region of airspace. En route centers operate the computer suite that  processes radar surveillance and flight planning data, reformats them for  presentation purposes, and sends them to display equipment used by  controllers to track aircraft. The centers control the switching of voice  communications between aircraft and the center, as well as between the  center and other air traffic control facilities. Three of these en route  centers also control air traffic over the oceans.", "The Air Traffic Control System Command Center manages the flow of air  traffic within the United States.

In addition, throughout the 9-month  demonstration, NWS plans to have the independent team periodically  provide feedback, recommendations, and corrective actions.", "However, NWS has not yet defined all of the performance measures it will  use to determine whether the prototype is successful. In its proposal, NWS  stated that the agencies will begin to document performance metrics and  develop and refine evaluation criteria during the demonstration. If NWS  waits to define evaluation criteria during the evaluation, it may not have  baseline metrics needed to compare to the demonstration results. Without  baseline metrics, NWS may be unable to determine whether the  demonstration has degraded service or not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology Transition", "paragraphs": ["Both agencies could face challenges in effectively transitioning the  infrastructure and technologies to the new consolidated structure, if a  proposal is accepted. In its proposal, NWS planned to move its operations  from 20 en route centers to two sites within 3 years. However, to do so, the  agencies will need to modify their aviation weather systems and develop a  communications infrastructure. Specifically, NWS and FAA will need to  modify or acquire systems to allow both current and new products for an  expanded view of the country. Additionally, NWS will need to develop  continuous two-way communications in lieu of having staff on site at each  en route center. NWS has recognized the infrastructure as a challenge, and  plans to mitigate the risk through continuous dialogue with FAA.

If FAA and NWS are to create a new interagency  agreement that incorporates key dates within the proposal, decisions on  the proposal will have to be made quickly.", "An important component of any effort to improve operations is a solid  understanding of current performance. However, FAA and NWS are not  working to identify the current level of performance in five measures that  are applicable to current operations. Until the agencies have an  understanding of the current level of performance, they will not be able to  measure the success or failure of any changes to the center weather  service unit operations. As a result, any changes to the current structure  could degrade aviation operations and safety\u2014and the agencies may not  know it.", "If the agencies move forward with plans to restructure aviation weather  services, they face significant challenges including a poor record of  interagency collaboration, undocumented requirements, and a lack of  assurance that this plan fits in the broader vision of NextGen. Moreover,  efforts to implement the restructuring will require a feasible schedule, a  comprehensive demonstration, and a solid plan for technology transition.

For example, the agency reported  that it is working with FAA to refine its baseline metrics and plans to have  baseline metrics in place by the end of fiscal year 2009. NWS also plans to  establish a Quality Assurance Manager to work with FAA to develop  additional measures and metrics as appropriate. In addition, NOAA  reported that since submitting its proposal in May 2008 and receiving a  summary of our findings in June 2009, NWS and FAA have made progress  in working together. Specifically, NWS has assigned a liaison to the FAA  Air Traffic Control System Command Center, met with officials from the  Joint Planning and Development Office to discuss the linkage of plans for  the center weather service units and NextGen, and held discussions to  strengthen the NWS and FAA partnership.", "The Department of Transportation\u2019s Deputy Director of Audit Relations  provided comments on a draft of this report via e-mail. In those comments,  she noted that the department agreed to consider our recommendations.  In addition, she noted a slight concern involving our discussion of the  alignment of plans to restructure the center weather service units with  NextGen.
