Under the treaty and subsequent agreements, the Commission is responsible for resolving boundary problems and maintaining the boundary between the United States and Mexico and managing issues involving the waters of the Rio Grande and Colorado Rivers. The focus of Commission responsibilities has evolved over time to include resolving border water quality problems and, more recently, to designing, constructing, and operating and maintaining wastewater treatment facilities along the border (see fig. 1). Much of this change in responsibilities has occurred in response to the expansion of economic activity and the growth of population along the border. These developments have heightened the need for additional water sources and an enhanced environmental infrastructure. 2000 The International Boundary and Water Commission is composed of a U.S. Section and a Mexican Section, each headed by a Commissioner, who must be an engineer. The U.S. Commissioner is appointed by the President for an indefinite term. The current Commissioner was appointed on June 15, 1994. The U.S. Section is located in El Paso, Texas; the Mexican Section is in the adjoining city of Ciudad Juarez, (Chihuahua) Mexico. As of July 1998, the U.S. Section had 254 staff at its headquarters and project offices located along the border. (See fig. 2.)", "The U.S. Section must comply with applicable federal rules and regulations regarding financial management and contracting, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation. When problems such as the need for wastewater treatment plants on the border require joint actions to resolve, the two Commissioners work together to define the problem, plan the solution, and negotiate the level of participation for each country. The Commissioners jointly prepare draft agreements (referred to as \u201cMinutes\u201d) on all aspects of each country\u2019s participation (including cost-sharing arrangements) to present to both countries\u2019 governments for approval.

The Section also receives contributions from federal, state, and local municipalities and the government of Mexico to help construct new projects and operate and maintain existing facilities, such as wastewater treatment plants. Contributions for these purposes totaled approximately $132.2 million from fiscal years 1994 through 1997.

Since these receivables were not included in the accounting records, the U.S. Section\u2019s financial statements and reports did not reflect the Section\u2019s true financial position.
