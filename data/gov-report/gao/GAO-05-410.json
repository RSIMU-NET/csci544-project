GAO (1) identified applicable policy guidance for issuing special uses permits for special events and for commercial filming and still photography, (2) assessed the extent to which this guidance was applied during fiscal year 2003, and (3) determined the extent to which the Park Service implemented the requirement to collect location fees for commercial filming and still photography."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service has developed policy guidance for issuing permits for special events and for commercial filming and still photography activities. This policy guidance includes general criteria about the terms and conditions as to when and where specific types of activities can take place and requires park units to recover applicable costs associated with administering and monitoring special park uses. Recovery of costs associated with filming activities is required by law. Recoverable costs include, for example, the time charged by a park ranger to visit the site of the event, such as a festival held on park grounds, to monitor that the terms and conditions of the permit are met. During fiscal year 2003, park units did not consistently apply Park Service guidance for permitting special events and for commercial filming and still photography, and often did not identify and recover costs associated with permitting such activities, thereby decreasing financial resources available to the parks. Of the six park units we visited, one did not charge fees for processing applications; one only recovered monitoring costs associated with some of its permits; and three others had not updated, for several years, hourly charges to reflect current higher costs for personnel time for administering and monitoring permitted activities. For example, National Capital Parks-Central officials charged no administrative fees for the estimated 1,400-plus permits issued for special events and for filming and still photography in fiscal year 2003. Officials said that park units had not updated fees because of regional policy and a high workload or because updating the fees was given low priority. The Park Service has not implemented a law enacted almost 5 years ago to collect location fees for commercial filming and still photography, resulting in significant annual forgone revenues. The agency has not implemented the law because of delays in reviewing the proposed regulations at the Department of Justice and a lack of agreement among the Interior agencies about the fee schedule and how it is to be applied. We estimated the Park Service would have collected about $1.6 million in location fee revenues in fiscal year 2003, if the requirement to collect such fees had been implemented."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For over 50 years, the National Park Service has permitted special park  uses\u2014such as special events or filming and still photography\u2014that provide  benefits to an individual, group, or organization beyond those available to  the public at large.

In the  past few years, questions have been raised by Members of Congress and  the public about taxpayer costs, commercialism, and Park Service policies  related to permitting these activities. One particular event\u2014held in  September 2003, when the Park Service granted the National Football  League (NFL) use of the National Mall to kick off its season\u2014caused  controversy. Because of some complaints that there was extensive  commercial advertising and some damage to the Mall grounds resulting  from this event, Members of Congress and the public questioned whether  permitting such an event was consistent with established policies, was an  appropriate use of the Mall, and whether taxpayer dollars were used to  support the event. The Park Service also issues hundreds of permits  annually for commercial filming and still photography on park land. The  Park Service is required by law to collect costs and location fees associated  with these permits, and is authorized to collect costs for other permit uses.", "In this context, you asked us to (1) identify applicable Park Service policy  guidance for issuing special uses permits for special events and for  commercial filming and still photography, (2) assess the extent to which  this guidance was applied during fiscal year 2003 to ensure that all  applicable costs were identified and recovered, and (3) determine the  extent to which the Park Service has implemented the requirement to  collect location fees for commercial filming and still photography  activities.", "We identified Park Service policy guidance for special uses permits and  obtained and analyzed applicable laws, regulations, policies, and  procedures. To evaluate the extent to which policy guidance was applied,  we analyzed permit records and other documentation of six selected park  units that we visited and interviewed Park Service headquarters, regional,  and park unit officials. We selected these park units because, during fiscal  year 2003, they had issued the greatest number of both special event and  filming and still photography permits in each of the six Park Service  regions within the continental U.S. To determine the extent to which the  Park Service implemented the requirement to collect location fees for  commercial filming and still photography activities, we interviewed Park  Service officials. We also collected and assessed the reliability of Park  Service data on filming and still photography permits from all park units for  fiscal year 2003 and estimated the forgone location fee revenues by  applying the established fee schedule of another federal land management  agency to the activities reported to GAO by the Park Service.

In the absence of this data, we used an  expert referral technique to identify park units to visit. We asked officials  from each of the Park Service\u2019s seven regional offices to identify, using  their knowledge of regional operations, the three park units within their  respective regions with the greatest number of (1) special event and (2)  commercial filming and still photography permits. In each case, the  officials produced a list in which the same unit had both the most special  events and the most commercial filming and still photography permits for  fiscal year 2003. We selected the top park unit from each of the regional  offices. Park Service regional officials identified the following seven park  units issuing the greatest number of permits for both special events and for  commercial filming and still photography in fiscal year 2003:  Alaska Region\u2014Denali National Park,  Midwest Region\u2014Jefferson National Expansion Memorial,  Intermountain Region\u2014Yellowstone National Park,  Pacific West Region\u2014Golden Gate National Recreation Area,  Northeast Region\u2014Independence National Historical Park,  National Capital Region\u2014National Capital Parks-Central, and  Southeast Region\u2014Blue Ridge Parkway.", "Because of the relatively low number of reported permits issued in the Park  Service\u2019s Alaska Region, we limited our site visits to parks in the six Park  Service regions within the continental United States.", "To determine the extent to which the Park Service implemented the  Commercial Filming Law, requiring it to collect location fees for  commercial filming and still photography activities, we analyzed the  legislation and interviewed Park Service and Department of the Interior  headquarters officials.

Park Service policy allows  the superintendents to waive fees under certain conditions, such as if the  permittee is a state, local, or federal government agency or a tribal  government, or if the superintendent determines that the use will promote  the mission of the Park Service or promote public safety, health, or welfare.  In our calculations to estimate forgone revenues, we only used the permit  activity reported by the park units where a location fee would not have  been waived.
