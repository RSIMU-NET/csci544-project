This report follows GAO's reports on the Navy and Air Force, and assesses (1) changes in the Army's and Marine Corps' use of simulation-based training, including efforts to integrate live and simulation-based training capabilities; and (2) the factors the Army and Marine Corps consider in determining whether to use live or simulation-based training, including the extent to which they consider performance and cost information.

Historically, the aviation communities in both services have used simulators to train servicemembers in tasks such as takeoffs, and emergency procedures that could not be taught safely live. In contrast, the services' ground communities used limited simulations prior to 2000. However, advances in technology, and emerging conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to increased use of simulation-based training in the ground forces. For example, in response to increases in vehicle rollovers, both services began using simulators to train servicemembers to safely evacuate vehicles. The services are also collaborating in the development of some simulation-based training devices. For instance, according to Marine Corps officials, the service reused 87 percent of the Army's Homestation Instrumentation Training System's components in its own training system, achieving about $11 million in cost avoidance and saving an estimated 7 years in fielding time. The services are also taking steps to better integrate live and simulation-based training, developing technical capabilities to connect previously incompatible simulation-based training devices. The Army's capability is now being fielded, and the Marine Corps' is in the initial development phase.", "The Army and Marine Corps consider various factors in determining whether to use live or simulation-based training, but lack key performance and cost information that would enhance their ability to determine the optimal mix of training and prioritize related investments. As the services identify which requirements can be met with either live or simulation-based training or both, they consider factors such as safety and training mission. Also, they have cited numerous benefits of simulation-based training, such as improving servicemember performance in live training events, and reducing operating costs. Both services rely on subject matter experts, who develop their training programs, and after action reports from deployments and training exercises for information on how servicemembers may have benefited from simulation-based training. However, neither service has established outcome metrics to assist them in more precisely measuring the impact of using simulation-based devices to improve performance or proficiency. Leading management practices recognize that performance metrics can help agencies determine the contributions that training makes to improve results. Army and Marine Corps officials also generally consider simulation-based training to be less costly than live training and analyze some data, such as life cycle costs, when considering options to acquire a particular simulation-based training device. However, once simulation-based training devices are fielded, the services neither reevaluate cost information as they determine the mix of training nor have a methodology for determining the costs associated with simulation-based training. Federal internal control standards state that decision makers need visibility over a program's financial data to determine whether the program is meeting the agencies' goals and effectively using resources. Without better performance and cost data, the services lack the information they need to make more fully informed decisions in the future regarding the optimal mix of training and how best to target investments for simulation-based training capabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the services develop metrics, and a methodology to compare live and simulation-based training costs.

Both services\u2019 aviation communities have used  simulators for more than half a century.

In addition, both services began using simulations for the  purpose of training higher-level commanders and their staffs in command  and control and decision making.", "Further advances in technology resulted in the acquisition of simulators  and simulations with additional capabilities designed to help  servicemembers and units acquire and refine skills through more  concentrated and repetitive training. For example, during the 1990s, the  Army introduced more advanced trainers for its ground and aviation  forces. In addition, the Marine Corps began using devices that allowed  individual marines to conduct training in basic and advanced  marksmanship, shoot/no-shoot judgment, and weapons employment  tactics. More recently, during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, both  services introduced a number of new simulators and simulations to  prepare servicemembers for conditions on the ground and emerging  threats. For example, to provide initial and sustainment driver training, the  Army and Marine Corps began using simulators that can be reconfigured  to replicate a variety of vehicles. In addition, in response to an increase in  vehicle rollovers, both services began using egress trainers to train  servicemembers to safely evacuate their vehicles.", "As the Army and Marine Corps have continued to expand their use of  simulation-based training, they have collaborated on the development of  some simulation-based training devices. For example, the Army uses the  Homestation Instrumentation Training System to support collective  maneuver training for platoon through battalion units. In developing a  similar training system\u2014 the Marine Corps Instrumentation Training  System \u2014the service determined that it could reuse 87 percent of the  components in the Army\u2019s system. As a result, officials told us, the  Marine Corps achieved approximately $11 million in cost avoidance and  fielded the system in 2 years instead of the projected 9 years. In turn, the  Marine Corps developed enhancements for its own training system that  the Army has incorporated into its fielded version of the Homestation  Instrumentation Training System. Further, the Army and Marine Corps  determined that they had a similar need for terrain maps of Iraq and  Afghanistan in their simulators. Rather than each service acquiring their  own, the Army and Marine Corps share the same version of Virtual  Battlespace 2, a gaming capability, resulting in shared development costs  and content.

The Army\u2019s live, virtual, and constructive  capabilities were largely incompatible and operators at individual  installations had to develop technical workarounds to connect these  capabilities in a single realistic home station training exercise. According  to Army officials, these workarounds are temporary and require significant  time and manpower to prepare for each exercise, which limits the  availability of simulator operators to support other training needs on an  installation. In an effort to overcome the need for temporary solutions and  more fully integrate live, virtual, and constructive training, the Army began  developing the Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC- IA) in 2005. The LVC-IA is a technical capability that provides common  protocols, standards, and interfaces to standardize existing incompatible  devices across installations and facilitate interoperability without  workarounds.

In particular, the Air Force has identified  the percentage of events that can be completed in a simulator and the  Navy\u2019s Overarching Fleet Training Simulator Strategy contains specific  guiding principles for simulator use. For example, one principle states that  training simulators should be used to replace live training to the maximum  extent possible where training effectiveness and operational readiness  are not compromised. Another states that if a skill or talent can be  developed or refined, or if proficiency can effectively and efficiently be  maintained in a simulator, then a simulator should be used.

As the services look at  ways to optimize the use of training resources, such information could be  useful to guide decisions on the optimal mix of live and simulation-based  training during the training development process, and as commanders  exercise discretion in how best to integrate the use of simulators during  home station training. Specifically, we found that the services collect  utilization data to manage the scheduling and distribution of simulation- based training devices across installations to support home station  training. For example, on a monthly basis, both the Army and Marine  Corps collect data on the number of hours simulators are used and  throughput (i.e., the number of soldiers or marines who use a simulator),  and in some cases, the number of virtual rounds fired or miles driven.  Further, in the case of the Army, the services\u2019 training materiel developer  is currently conducting a study to determine the benefits of simulation- based training. Specifically, the Program Executive Office for Simulations,  Training, and Instrumentation, is compiling case studies to demonstrate  the benefits and impacts of training certain tasks using simulations.

Officials told us they recognize the value of performance metrics, but  given the pace of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past several  years, priority was focused on conducting training and preparing forces to  deploy. Officials further noted that some training tasks are subjective,  making it difficult to develop specific, quantifiable metrics, and that  different devices may require different sets of metrics to reflect how their  use contributes to improved performance.

For example, it had excluded  certain costs from its estimates, such as expenses for aircrew travel to  simulator locations, additional contractor personnel to schedule and  operate simulators, and the purchase of additional simulators to meet  increased demand. Therefore, we recommended that the Air Force  develop a methodology to determine the universe of costs and a means  to collect and track data in order to enhance its ability to make future  investment decisions about the mix of live and virtual training.

In addition, after the simulator or simulation is acquired and  fielded, the services consider the life-cycle cost to operate and maintain  them as they identify the funding needs to be considered in the budget  development process. However, they do not reevaluate cost information  during their training development process as they determine which  training should be conducted live and which can be conducted using a  combination of live and simulation-based training.

During the course of our work, some officials cited  examples of specific costs that could be considered and variables that  might need to be taken into account in developing an approach to  comparing simulation-based and live training. For example, some officials  noted that ammunition costs could be considered significant to both types  of training, but that there are some variables to be considered in  comparing these costs. For instance, they noted that the number of virtual  rounds fired in a simulator could be compared to the cost of live  ammunition, but that there are limits to this type of comparison because  units can fire more rounds in a simulator than they would be allocated  during live training. As a result, a one-to-one comparison does not  present a totally accurate picture of the potential costs that are saved or  avoided when conducting simulation-based training rather than live  training. Additionally, they noted that ammunition has a shelf life. If it is  not used within its available shelf life the services can incur costs to  demilitarize the ammunition. Therefore, firing live ammunition that is  approaching the end of its shelf life may actually result in cost avoidance  rather than an additional cost for the services. In addition, they noted that  comparing the costs of fuel and spare parts of an aircraft used in live  training to the cost of technicians and spare parts needed to maintain  simulators would not provide an accurate comparison if the costs of  facilities, utilities, and training personnel to support the simulators were  not included as well. These costs and variables could serve as the  foundation for developing a cost methodology. Without a means to  assess the impact of using simulators on performance and to compare  the costs associated with live training and the use of simulation-based  training devices, decision makers in the Army and Marine Corps lack  information to make fully informed decisions in the future regarding the  optimal mix of training and related investment decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the Army and Marine Corps take steps to further integrate the use of  simulation-based training with live training, and collaborate on  development efforts in a fiscally constrained environment, both services  are facing important decisions regarding how to adapt current approaches  to meet training requirements and prioritize related investments, including  those related to the acquisition of simulation-based training capabilities.

We recognize that both  services currently collect various types of information on the use of  simulation devices and consider costs to a certain extent in their  acquisition and budgeting processes. However, taking additional steps to  expand these efforts by establishing performance-oriented metrics and a  methodology to identify the costs associated with simulation-based  training would provide them greater insights into how the use of  simulation-based training contributes to improved performance or  proficiency of servicemembers, and a point of comparison for assessing  the cost implications of using simulation-based or live training. Moreover,  until the Army and Marine Corps take actions to increase their visibility  over the impact of simulation-based training on performance and costs,  they will continue to lack key information that could assist them in  determining how to optimize the mix of live and simulation-based training  in the future and target simulation-based training investments on the  devices that have the greatest potential to improve mission performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve decision makers\u2019 abilities to make fully informed decisions  concerning whether training requirements can be met with live and  simulation-based training and determine optimal mixes of live and  simulation-based training, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretary of the Army and the Commandant of the Marine  Corps to take the following two actions:", "Develop outcome-oriented performance metrics that can be used to  assess the impact of simulation-based training on improving the  performance or proficiency of servicemembers and units.", "Develop a methodology\u2014to include identifying the costs that should  be included and how these costs should be captured\u2014for comparing  the costs associated with the use of live and simulation-based  training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with  our recommendations. In response to our recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps to develop outcome-oriented  performance metrics that can be used to assess the impact of simulation- based training on improving the performance or proficiency of  servicemembers and units, DOD agreed that an enhancement in  outcome-oriented performance metrics would be helpful in the decision- making process. DOD noted that given the magnitude and scope of  training tasks, varying competencies of the training audience, and ever  changing technology, the problem set contains many independent  variables. DOD said that it will study the problem set, and as appropriate,  develop a construct and implementation plan to include performance  metrics to assess the impact of simulation-based training on improving  the performance or proficiency of servicemembers and units. We  recognize that DOD must consider many independent variables and note  in our report that some training tasks are subjective, making it difficult to  develop specific, quantifiable metrics. However, facing these same types  of challenges, we describe in our report that the Navy has a simulator  strategy that notes the need to quantifiably demonstrate how simulator  use contributes to achieving objectives. Further, as noted in our report,  Army and Marine Corps training tasks already have associated conditions  and standards. These standards could be used as the basis for  developing performance metrics to evaluate differences, if any, between  live and simulation-based training effectiveness. As both services have  noted anecdotal benefits from the use of simulation-based training, we  continue to believe that establishing performance-oriented metrics would  provide the Army and Marine Corps with greater insights into how the use  of simulation-based training contributes to improved performance or  proficiency.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Army and the Commandant of the  Marine Corps to develop a methodology\u2014to include identifying the costs  that should be included and how these costs should be captured\u2014for  comparing the costs associated with the use of live and simulation-based  training. In its comments, DOD noted that the Army and Marine Corps  capture all relevant costs needed for decision-making during the  Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process in  procuring simulators/simulation devices. DOD further stated that the  Marine Corps training is based on the Systems Approach to Training,  which includes policy on developing outcome-oriented performance  metrics that are employed in school house lesson plans and home station  training. DOD noted that the combination of PPBE and the Systems  Approach to Training ensures that costs are considered in determining  the mix of live and simulation-based training. DOD further stated that the  Army and Marine Corps concur that a more comprehensive cost analysis  would assist decision making in determining the optimal mix of live and  simulation-based training. DOD did not cite any specific steps that the  services plan to take. In our report, we specifically recognize that the  Army and Marine Corps assess costs associated with simulation based  devices, such as life cycle costs, as they make acquisition decisions and  during their budget development process when they determine funding  needs to operate acquired devices. However, the services do not  reevaluate cost information during their training development process  which is the point at which they are determining the mix of live and  simulated based training. Furthermore, beyond those costs currently  assessed in the budget process, we found examples of additional costs  that could be considered if the services were to perform a cost  comparison analysis between live and simulated based training, such as  facilities, fuel and ammunition. Therefore, to enhance their ability to  optimize the mix of training and better understand related cost  implications, we continue to believe the services need to expand their  current efforts and take specific steps to develop a methodology for  comparing costs associated with the use of live and simulated based  training.

Our review  focused on the mix of live and simulation-based training for institutional  and home station training because this training represents a significant  portion of both services\u2019 training. Excluded from this review were live and  simulation-based training at the services\u2019 combat training centers and  during deployment. We selected Army and Marine Corps occupations that  use the largest number of simulation-based training devices and  represent a broad cross-section of how these devices are used by the  services, respectively. For both the Army and Marine Corps, we selected  the aviation, armor, and artillery occupations. In addition, for the Army we  included infantry, and for the Marine Corps we included amphibious  assault vehicles and motor transport occupations. We held discussions  with training officials representing each of these occupations. In addition,  we visited the Army Aviation Center of Excellence in Fort Rucker,  Alabama; the Army Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, GA,  where both services train their armor personnel; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma,  where both services train their artillery personnel.", "To determine how the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 use of simulation-based  training devices has changed since the services first began using  simulators, we reviewed and analyzed service briefings and  documentation that provided information on the historical use of  simulation-based training devices, and the timelines within which  simulators for various occupations became available. In addition, we  interviewed officials from the Department of the Army-Management Office  for Training Simulations; Marine Corps Plans, Policies and Operations;  and the services\u2019 training commands \u2014the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine  Command and the Marine Corps\u2019 Training and Education Command\u2014to  discuss how simulators and simulations were and are currently being  used. We also interviewed officials representing the selected service  occupations and from the Army Reserve Command, the Army National  Guard, and Marine Corps Forces Reserve, to discuss the mix of live and  simulation-based training, how the use of simulators and simulations has  evolved, and the benefits, limitations, and challenges of simulation-based  training. Additionally, we reviewed our prior reports to gain additional  perspective on how simulators and simulations were used in the past. To  assess the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 efforts to better integrate live and  simulation-based training, we evaluated documentation on simulation- based training technologies and capabilities. In addition, we met with  officials from the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 training commands and  materiel development organizations\u2014the Program Executive Office for  Simulations, Training, and Instrumentation and the Program Manager for  Training Systems, respectively\u2014to discuss how they coordinate the  development of simulation-based training capabilities and technologies  and ongoing initiatives to further integrate simulation-based training. We  also obtained and reviewed guidance and documentation from both  services related to the development of certain technical capabilities to  connect incompatible simulation-based training devices\u2014the Army\u2019s Live,  Virtual, and Constructive\u2014Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA), and the  Marine Corps\u2019 Live, Virtual and Constructive Training Environment. We  discussed these technical capabilities with officials from the Army  headquarters, and the services\u2019 training commands and materiel  development organizations. In addition, we reviewed Army documents on  the LVC-IA and the summary of the findings and lessons learned from the  initial fielding of the integrated architecture at Fort Hood, Texas. We also  interviewed officials from Fort Hood, including company, battalion, and  brigade-level officials from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry  Division, to discuss their perspectives on the benefits and challenges  related to the initial LVC-IA exercise. Additionally, we reviewed Marine  Corps\u2019 documents, such as its Live, Virtual and Constructive Training  Environment Initial Capabilities Document; and the Training and  Education Modeling and Simulation Master Plan 2010. We also  interviewed Marine Corps training officials to obtain information on the  purpose and current state of its Live, Virtual and Constructive Training  Environment.", "To ascertain the factors the Army and Marine Corps consider in  determining whether to use live or simulation-based training, including the  extent to which they consider performance and cost information, we  assessed Army and Marine Corps documentation, such as the 2013 Army  Posture Statement; U.S Army Training Concept 2012-2020; Army  Regulation 350-38, Policies and Management for Training Aids, Devices,  Simulators, and Simulations; the 2012 Army Training Strategy; the  Posture of the United States Marine Corps, 2013 Report to Congress;  and Marine Corps Concepts and Programs 2013. We reviewed  Department of Defense (DOD) and Navy Training guidance. We also  reviewed our previous reports on Air Force and Navy virtual training. To  determine the services\u2019 mixes of live and simulation-based training for  institutional and home station training, we reviewed Army and Marine  Corps policies and guidance related to developing and conducting  training, including the Training and Doctrine Command Regulation 350- 70: Army Learning Policy and Systems; U.S. Army Training and Doctrine  Command Pamphlet 350-70-1, Training Development in Support of the  Operational Domain; and NAVMC 1553.1: the Marine Corps\u2019 Systems  Approach to Training User\u2019s Guide.

We reviewed programs of instruction to obtain examples of  the mixes of live and simulation-based training prescribed during  institutional training in the selected occupations. To determine the  services\u2019 mix of training at home station we reviewed examples of the  Army Combined Arms Training Strategies, Army proponent\u2019s Home  Station Gated Training Strategies, and the Marine Corps\u2019 Training and  Readiness Manuals. We also interviewed officials from the Army Reserve  and Army National Guard, as well as unit commanders and officials from  the installations that we visited, i.e., Army\u2019s 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry  Division at Fort Benning, Georgia; 1st Air Cavalry Brigade, 1st Calvary  Division, at Fort Hood, Texas; 31st Air Defense Artillery Brigade, 75th  Fires Brigade, and 214th Fires Brigade at Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and former  Marine Corps battalion and company commanders and officials from the  Marine Corps Forces Reserve to discuss how the Army\u2019s and Marine  Corps\u2019 overarching training strategies assist commanders in developing a  mix of live and simulation-based training for home station training. In  addition, we interviewed Army and Marine Corps training officials to  identify and determine the types of information collected on the use of  simulators and simulations; how this information was being used; and  how the services determine the relationship between simulator usage and  performance. We also obtained examples of the types of information  being collected by both services, and participated in an online  demonstration of the Army\u2019s central repository for this information. In  addition, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s Overarching Fleet Simulator Strategy  and management practices on performance measures. To determine how  costs are considered and compared when developing live and simulation- based training, we met with officials from Department of the Army and  both services\u2019 training commands. We reviewed the Army\u2019s 3rd edition of  its Cost Benefit Analysis Guide to identify potential DOD criteria as to  what factors should be included when conducting a cost-benefit analysis.  We also reviewed Army and Marine Corps acquisition guidance, which  provides instruction on conducting cost-benefit analyses to acquire  simulators. In addition, we reviewed federal internal control standards, our  past reviews on the Air Force\u2019s use of live and virtual training, and federal  cost-estimating and budgeting guidance.
