The United States provides approximately 25 percent of the TC program's annual budget. This report addresses the (1) extent to which the United States and IAEA have policies limiting member states' participation in the TC program on the basis of nuclear proliferation and related concerns; (2) extent to which the United States and IAEA evaluate and monitor TC projects for proliferation concerns; and (3) any limitations and challenges in IAEA's management of the TC program. To address these issues, GAO interviewed relevant officials at the Departments of State (State) and Energy (DOE) and IAEA; analyzed IAEA, DOE, and national laboratory data; and assessed State and IAEA policies toward the TC program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Neither State nor IAEA seeks to systematically limit TC assistance to countries the United States has designated as state sponsors of terrorism--Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria--even though under U.S. law these countries are subject to sanctions. Together, these four countries received more than $55 million in TC assistance from 1997 through 2007. In addition, TC funding has been provided to states that are not party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)--India, Israel, and Pakistan--and neither the United States nor IAEA has sought to exclude these countriesfrom participating in the TC program. Finally, IAEA member statesare not required to complete comprehensive safeguards or additional protocol agreements with IAEA--which allow IAEA to monitor declared nuclear activities and detect clandestine nuclear programs--to be eligible for TC assistance, even though U.S. and IAEA officials have stressed the need for all countries to bring such arrangements into force as soon as possible. The proliferation concerns associated with the TC program are difficult for the United States to fully identify, assess, and resolve for several reasons. While State has implemented an interagency process to review proposed TC projects for proliferation risks, the effectiveness of these reviews is limited because IAEA does not provide the United States with sufficient or timely information on TC proposals. Of the 1,565 TC proposals reviewed by DOE and the U.S. national laboratories for possible proliferation risks from 1998 through 2006, information for 1,519 proposals, or 97 percent, consisted of only project titles. IAEA faces several limitations and challenges in effectively managing the TC program. First, the TC program's impact in meeting development and other needs of member states is unclear because IAEA has not updated and revised the program's performance metrics since 2002. Second, the TC program is limited by financial constraints, including the failure of many member states to pay their full share of support to the program's Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF). In 2007, the TCF experienced a shortfall of $3.5 million, or 4 percent, of the $80 million total target budget, because 62 member states did not pay their full expected contributions, including 47 states that made no payment at all. Furthermore, IAEA has not developed a policy for determining when countries should be graduated from receiving TC assistance, including those defined by the UN as high-income countries. Finally, the TC program's long-term viability is uncertain because of limitations in IAEA efforts to track how project results are sustained and because of shortcomings in strategies to develop new TC program partners and donors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an independent  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an independent  international organization based in Vienna, Austria, that is affiliated with  international organization based in Vienna, Austria, that is affiliated with  the United Nations (UN), has the dual mission of promoting the peaceful  the United Nations (UN), has the dual mission of promoting the peaceful  uses of nuclear energy and verifying that nuclear technologies and  uses of nuclear energy and verifying that nuclear technologies and  materials intended for peaceful purposes are not diverted to weapons  materials intended for peaceful purposes are not diverted to weapons  development efforts.

Most countries have concluded  \u201ccomprehensive safeguards agreements\u201d with IAEA, under which  governments declare their nuclear materials and activities to IAEA.

TC projects have supported  efforts to eradicate tsetse flies and other insect pests in certain regions,  control communicable diseases in developing countries, and develop  higher-yielding agricultural crops. As of June 2008, 1,290 TC projects were  under way, with each project lasting, on average, 3 to 4 years. A TC project  typically has several components, including equipment procurement,  provision of expert services, training, and fellowships. Each year, about  1,600 individuals around the world are granted fellowships by the TC  program, allowing them to pursue specialized nuclear studies at  universities, institutes, and other facilities outside their home countries.", "All TC projects are considered by the Technical Assistance and  Cooperation Committee of IAEA\u2019s Board of Governors\u2014the 35-member  policy-making body for IAEA programs\u2014before they are approved by the  Board of Governors.

In addition to providing funding to IAEA, State coordinates U.S. policy  toward the TC program by working through the U.S. Mission to  International Organizations in Vienna (U.S. Mission).", "We reviewed the TC program in 1997 and found that while the vast  majority of TC projects did not involve the transfer of sensitive nuclear  materials and technologies, nuclear assistance was provided to countries  that posed a proliferation risk. Proliferation concerns about the TC  program have persisted because of the assistance it has provided to  certain countries and because nuclear equipment, technology, and  expertise can be dual-use\u2014capable of serving peaceful purposes, such as  the production of medical isotopes, but also useful in contributing to  nuclear weapons development. For example, in 2006, IAEA refused to  support a TC proposal from Iran requesting assistance for a heavy water  reactor near the town of Arak. Iran stated that the reactor was intended  for the production of medical isotopes. The United States and other IAEA  members objected due to concerns that the plant could serve as a source  of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons.", "In our 1997 report, we recommended that the Secretary of State direct the  U.S. interagency group on IAEA technical assistance to systematically  review all proposals for TC projects in countries of concern prior to their  approval by IAEA to determine whether the projects are consistent with  U.S. nuclear nonproliferation goals. In response, an interagency process  was established, involving State, DOE, and the DOE national laboratories,  to evaluate proposed and active TC projects for proliferation risks. State  leads the reviews of TC project proposals and ongoing projects. DOE  provides technical input to this process using the technical expertise of  the national laboratories to assess the projects\u2019 proliferation risks and  reports its findings to State.", "As agreed with your office, this report assesses the (1) extent to which the  United States and IAEA have policies limiting member states\u2019 participation  in the TC program on the basis of nuclear proliferation and related  concerns; (2) extent to which the United States and IAEA evaluate and  monitor TC projects for proliferation concerns; and (3) any limitations and  challenges in IAEA\u2019s management of the TC program.", "The scope of our review covered the period from 1997 through 2007  because our previous report on the TC program analyzed programmatic  and financial data through 1996. To address these objectives, we  interviewed key U.S. officials at State, DOE, and the U.S. Mission and  analyzed documentation, such as cables, reports and analyses of the TC  program, financial information, and statements and speeches by U.S.  officials. We interviewed other individuals in the United States involved in  TC program issues, including U.S. national laboratory representatives  involved in conducting proliferation risk assessments of TC projects and  proposals; Argonne National Laboratory staff who support State\u2019s  oversight of the TC program and facilitate TC training and fellowship  programs in the United States; and the U.S. representative to IAEA\u2019s  Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Cooperation.", "We also interviewed officials at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria,  including representatives from the TC Department and other agency  departments\u2014specifically, the Departments of Management, Safeguards,  and Nuclear Safety and Security.

We developed a judgmental sample of TC  projects to serve as the basis for our assessment and interviews with  relevant IAEA officials. However, because IAEA did not provide us with an  opportunity to interview relevant IAEA officials who oversee these  projects, we were unable to sufficiently assess the contributions of the TC  program in improving the worldwide safety and security of nuclear  facilities. In addition, because IAEA restricted our access to information  relating to reviews of TC projects by its Safeguards Department, we were  unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of IAEA\u2019s internal review  of TC projects for proliferation concerns.

The United States has designated four countries\u2014Cuba, Iran,  Sudan, and Syria\u2014as state sponsors of terrorism, pursuant to several U.S.  laws. According to our review of IAEA data and financial records, 111 TC  projects were approved for these four countries from 1997 through 2007,  and they received approximately $55.7 million in TC assistance over that  period. These projects ranged across a number of areas, from applying  nuclear technologies to treat diseases and improve crop productivity to  assisting nuclear power development. Table 1 shows the dollar amount of  TC assistance each U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism received  from 1997 through 2007.", "According to State, the United States has applied several types of  sanctions to these four countries, including restrictions on U.S. foreign  assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, certain controls over  exports of dual-use items, and miscellaneous financial and other  restrictions. These sanctions notwithstanding, direct U.S. nuclear trade  with these countries involving the types of technologies provided by the  TC program might not be permitted under U.S. adherence to other  international nonproliferation controls. For instance, in a 2007 report to  Congress, State concluded that three TC projects involving technology  transfer for the operation and maintenance of the Iranian nuclear power  plant at Bushehr could be subject to multilateral export controls if Iran  were to procure such technology directly from suppliers. The State report  noted, \u201cnder the Nonproliferation Principle of the NSG [Nuclear  Suppliers Group] Guidelines the United States and other responsible  members of the NSG would deny such direct transfers.\u201d", "The United States has not sought to systematically exclude or limit the  four U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism from TC assistance. State  officials told us that the department would not recommend withholding  U.S. funding to the TC program because of the support that IAEA provides  to these four countries. They said that it is a long-standing department  policy to pay the full share of U.S. support to the TC program because  doing so helps maintain international political support for and  participation in IAEA, including international support for safeguards. In  addition, because TCF resources are fungible, State officials asserted that  withholding U.S. contributions to the TCF to punish state sponsors of  terrorism would have no practical impact on the TC funding these nations  receive. A U.S. Mission official told us that once the United States provides  its contribution to the TCF, it cedes control over how the funds are  disbursed by IAEA.", "Several laws govern U.S. support to the TC program. One restriction under  these laws prohibits U.S. funds contributed to IAEA from being used for  projects in Cuba, except in certain circumstances. Accordingly, State  withholds a portion of its voluntary contribution to the TCF equal to the  U.S. proportionate share of the TC program\u2019s expenditures in Cuba. In  the past, the United States also withheld a proportionate share of its TCF  contribution for Iran, Libya, and Territories Under the Jurisdiction of the  Palestinian Authority. State also must report annually to Congress on all  IAEA programs or projects in certain countries, including Burma  (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.", "IAEA officials told us that the TC program does not attempt to exclude  countries on the basis of their status as U.S.-designated state sponsors of  terrorism or other political considerations. Under the TC program\u2019s  guiding principles, for example, the provision of TC assistance is not  subject to any political, economic, military, or other conditions that are  inconsistent with IAEA\u2019s statute. Moreover, according to the Deputy  Director General for the TC program, requests for TC assistance are  evaluated strictly on technical merits and the contributions of proposed  projects to a nation\u2019s development priorities, subject to the conditions of  the IAEA statute, IAEA guiding principles and operating rules pertaining to  technical assistance, and any relevant decisions by the Board of Governors  and the UN Security Council. This official added that the program seeks to  include as many countries as possible and that \u201cthere are no good  countries and there are no bad countries\u201d participating in the program. In  her view, denying or limiting participation of member states in the TC  program was a matter for the Board of Governors to consider.", "Other IAEA officials told us that under the agency\u2019s statute, IAEA\u2019s  Secretariat is powerless to limit or condition TC assistance to specific  countries, even in cases where countries have been deemed by the Board of  Governors to be violating their IAEA obligations or in cases where recipient  countries were suspected of being engaged in undeclared, clandestine nuclear  activities. For instance, the Board of Governors determined in September  2005 that Iran had breached its safeguards obligations and was not complying  with IAEA\u2019s statute. However, TC projects in Iran were not restricted until  February 2007 following a UN Security Council resolution on Iran\u2019s nuclear  activities. In addition, in 2008, IAEA\u2019s Director General stated it would be  inappropriate to block approval of a TC project in Syria for a nuclear power  plant feasibility study before IAEA verified claims concerning Syria\u2019s alleged  construction of an undeclared nuclear reactor. According to State officials,  several countries, including the United States, asserted that the approval of  this project would be \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d when Syria had not provided all  of the cooperation required by IAEA to investigate these allegations. IAEA\u2019s  Board of Governors ultimately approved the project in November 2008. The  United States did not attempt to block approval of the project after receiving  assurances that IAEA would monitor the project closely, report as  appropriate, and ensure that any equipment provided under the project would  be used only for the intended purposes.", "Finally, in addition to providing assistance to the four countries the United  States has designated as state sponsors of terrorism, the TC program has  also provided nuclear technology and expertise to other countries that the  United States has sanctioned or taken other punitive actions against.  Examples of such countries and the total amounts of TC assistance  provided to them from 1997 through 2007 include the following:    Approximately $7.3 million for Burma, which is subject to targeted U.S.  trade, financial, and other sanctions. The Secretaries of State and of  Energy have declared jointly that the development of nuclear  infrastructure of any kind in Burma would be inappropriate. TC projects  have been approved for Burma to improve nuclear instrument repair and  maintenance services, enhance pest control, and apply nondestructive  testing techniques in construction projects.", "Approximately $9.7 million for Belarus, which the United States has  characterized as \u201ca regime of repression in the heart of Europe\u201d and  against which the United States has imposed targeted financial sanctions  and travel restrictions. TC support has been provided to assist Belarus in  minimizing threats posed by radioactive waste at former military sites,  establishing a center of competence on radiation oncology, and  remediating areas affected by the Chernobyl accident.", "Approximately $6.1 million for Venezuela, which, among other things,  State has determined to be engaging in diplomacy designed to deliberately  undermine U.S. interests, including deepening relations with Iran and  publicly supporting Iran\u2019s nuclear program. IAEA has approved TC  assistance for Venezuela to help it strengthen its technical capabilities in  radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, and radiopharmaceutical services, and to  more effectively apply nuclear techniques in managing water resources.", "Based on our review of recent project summaries, the TC assistance  provided to these countries does not appear to involve support that could  have direct weapons applications.

Specifically, we found that  national laboratory officials received only the title of proposed projects for  97 percent\u2014or for 1,519 of 1,565\u2014of proposed TC projects they reviewed  from 1998 through 2006. For the remaining 3 percent, or 46 of the  proposed projects, DOE and the national laboratories were able to obtain  some additional information on the proposed projects. See appendix III for  more specific information on the number of TC proposals reviewed by  DOE and the national laboratories from 1998 through 2006.", "DOE and national laboratory officials told us that a TC project proposal  title can occasionally raise proliferation concerns but that the title alone is  generally insufficient to reliably assess proliferation risk. Moreover,  proposal titles can be misleading and obscure more serious proliferation  implications. For instance, the 2006 TC proposal from Iran requesting  assistance for the completion of the Arak heavy water research reactor\u2014a  type of reactor that could be a source of plutonium for nuclear weapons\u2014 was entitled \u201cStrengthening Safety Capabilities for the Construction of a  Research Reactor.\u201d Iran asserted that the reactor was intended for the  production of medical isotopes, and the proposal was approved for  funding by IAEA\u2019s Secretariat. However, as a result of objections by the  United States and other nations, the Board of Governors ultimately did not  approve this proposal.", "In addition to the limited information on TC proposals available to the  national laboratories, the dual-use nature of some nuclear technology also  complicates efforts to assess TC proposals for proliferation risks. IAEA  applies safeguards to nuclear material, equipment, and facilities provided  through the TC program in four \u201csensitive technological areas\u201d\u2014uranium  enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, heavy water production, and handling  of plutonium and mixed uranium-plutonium fuel. These four areas relate  to the production and handling of fissile material. However, according to  DOE and national laboratory officials, these four sensitive areas do not  address all technologies related to the production of fissile material. For  example, \u201cnonsensitive\u201d technology associated with the design and  operation of civilian, light water power reactors might prove useful to  countries seeking to design and build a plutonium production reactor. TC  projects providing such technology might therefore raise proliferation  concerns. Other \u201cnonsensitive\u201d skills and expertise that states acquire  through TC assistance might provide basic knowledge useful to weapons,  such as radioactive materials handling, familiarity with chemical processes  and properties of nuclear materials, and use of various instruments and  control systems.", "Even in cases where more information on TC proposals was obtained,  national laboratory officials told us that they still often lacked crucial  details\u2014such as equipment specifications\u2014to reliably assess the  proliferation risks. As an example, national laboratory officials told us that  some TC proposals could include requests for procurement of \u201chot cells\u201d  to produce isotopes\u2014a technology with dual-use implications. However,  without specific technical details of the hot cell, it would not be possible  to determine the potential proliferation risks associated with such a  device.", "In addition, DOE and national laboratory officials told us that in recent  years, they have received less information about proposed TC projects.  Moreover, DOE and national laboratory officials told us that such  information is arriving closer to the time when such projects must be  approved by the Technical Assistance and Cooperation Committee and the  Board of Governors. The lack of full and timely information on TC project  proposals complicates efforts by the United States and other IAEA  member states to make informed decisions about TC proposals, including  whether they raise proliferation concerns. State, DOE, and national  laboratory officials told us that it is preferable to raise potential  proliferation concerns about TC proposals with IAEA officials early in the  development cycle, when such project proposals can be modified more  readily.", "In 2004, IAEA\u2019s Safeguards Department began reviewing TC projects for  possible proliferation risks.

The most recent  TC program fellow to study nuclear issues in the United States from one of  the U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism\u2014Syria\u2014was in 2001.", "In addition, the broad nature of the criteria to exclude fellows\u2014including  \u201cother political factors\u201d in their home countries\u2014could leave fellowship  decisions open to State officials\u2019 subjective interpretation. For example,  State officials told us that one country in Asia would no longer be  permitted to send TC fellows to the United States because it is considered  a wealthy, high-income nation, even though the description of the informal  guidelines provided to us by State do not indicate that economic  conditions in a TC fellow\u2019s home country are a basis for rejection.", "With regard to IAEA\u2019s management of TC fellows, the agency does not  have a policy to exclude individuals from certain countries from  participating in the TC fellowship program, including individuals from  nations about which the United States has terrorism or proliferation  concerns.

Under a 2002  TC program strategy, IAEA established four strategic objectives and 12  performance metrics to assess program performance between 2002 and  2007. These four objectives were (1) establishing greater linkages between  TC projects and national development plans and greater government  commitment and support to projects; (2) expanding strategic partnerships  to improve the TC program\u2019s visibility in resolving development problems;  (3) increasing the level of funding for technical cooperation activities; and  (4) strengthening the capacity of institutions in member states using  nuclear technologies to become more technically and financially self- reliant.

Similarly, in its 2007 evaluation of TC activities, IAEA\u2019s internal auditor\u2014 the Office of Internal Oversight Services\u2014found that the TC program lacks  a robust, consistent process for assessing the effectiveness of TC projects,  particularly after projects are completed.", "IAEA officials acknowledged these weaknesses in the 2002 metrics,  recognized they were out of date, and said that they wanted to develop  more effective results-based metrics.

Although the size of the TCF and overall  level of funding paid by member states have increased in recent years,  many countries that receive TC assistance still do not pay their full share  of support to the TCF that IAEA expects them to contribute. Specifically,  the TCF experienced a funding shortfall in 2007 of $3.5 million, or 4  percent, of the $80 million total target budget because 62 member states  did not pay their full contributions. Of these 62 countries, 47 states made  no payment at all.

For example, they stated that some member states have helped  ease budget pressures within the TC program by voluntarily reducing the  assistance they receive and gradually becoming donors.

However, we found that IAEA does not systematically review  completed TC projects to verify whether the project results are being sustained  by the recipient country, through government or other support. For example,  the TC program does not conduct any assessments 2, 3, or 5 years past project  completion, to see whether and how a country is maintaining established TC  nuclear technologies and related skills.", "Second, IAEA faces challenges in sustaining the TC program over the long  term because TC funding is distributed across 18 different technical  areas\u2014including nuclear power, nuclear security, food and agriculture,  water resources, and human health\u2014making it difficult for IAEA to set  clear TC program priorities and to maximize the impact of limited program  resources. Appendix V provides a complete list of all the technical areas to  which TC program funding was allocated in 2007.

U.S. Mission officials told us that  IAEA should work to consolidate these areas and identify four or five  future TC program priorities. IAEA officials agreed, but told us that they  have little flexibility to set TC program priorities because they must be  responsive to member state needs which vary across countries and  regions. Nevertheless, TC program officials said they are attempting to  promote priority-setting at the project level\u2014for example, by limiting the  number of projects member states were permitted to submit in 2008, and  by moving away from funding mature nuclear technologies that no longer  require development or in which member states have acquired sufficient  capability to sustain on their own.", "In addition, in 2007, IAEA initiated a fundamental review of the challenges  and opportunities facing its programs to 2020 and beyond.

Although TC program guidance encourages private sector partnerships,  IAEA officials told us that the new partner outreach effort will not extend  to the private sector because they believed the level of effort to establish  such partnerships would outweigh the expected benefits. Furthermore,  while IAEA\u2019s internal auditors have reported on cases where member  states successfully obtained private sector support to sustain TC  projects\u2014thus alleviating the need for further support from IAEA or the  host government\u2014IAEA officials told us that the TC program does not  systematically assess TC proposals with respect to their commercial  potential. IAEA officials told us that member states are not required to  submit information in their TC proposals\u2014such as a market analysis, a  summary of business plans, or potential private sector investors in project  activities\u2014that IAEA could use to evaluate the long-term commercial  prospects of a TC project.", "The TC program\u2019s strategy of focusing its outreach primarily on  international development organizations carries risks because IAEA is not  well recognized as a development organization within the broader  development community. According to the Deputy Director General of the  TC Department, the development community largely perceives IAEA as a  nuclear enforcement body and its development contributions are  overlooked or unknown. In addition, some of the previous partnerships  the TC program has built with international development organizations  have been called into question. For example, a 2007 independent  evaluation of the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  concluded that FAO\u2019s long-standing partnership with IAEA on the use of  nuclear techniques in food and agriculture has ceased to yield a high  return on investment and, therefore, recommended that FAO withdraw  future funding from the joint FAO-IAEA unit. Furthermore, according to  the U.S. representative to the Standing Advisory Group on Technical  Assistance and Cooperation, the TC program faces difficulties in building  relationships with development organizations at the project and country  levels because it does not have a presence in the host countries to  promote the program. For example, this representative told us that the  national liaison officers\u2014who serve as intermediaries on TC projects  between IAEA and the host governments and collaborating institutes\u2014 tend to be technical specialists who do not understand their country\u2019s  development needs, do not network with other development  organizations, and are not involved in the governmental processes that set  national development plans and priorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The world today is dramatically different than when IAEA was created  over 50 years ago. Therefore, certain IAEA policies related to the TC  program, as well as the rights, expectations, and obligations of IAEA  member states that are beneficiaries of the program, merit careful  consideration and, as appropriate, re-examination. In our view, TC  proposals should not be evaluated simply on their technical merits in  isolation from political considerations concerning the countries making  the requests, particularly since the assistance in question involves  supplying nuclear equipment, training, and expertise, some of which is  dual-use in nature. In that regard, we believe that State\u2019s policy of not  encouraging IAEA to systematically limit TC projects in countries that are  U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism communicates a mixed  message on the acceptability of transferring nuclear technologies and  expertise to countries the United States has deemed inherently dangerous.", "We recognize that the TC program provides IAEA member states that are  developing countries with many benefits and that not every project funded  by the program poses a proliferation risk. However, the United States does  not have the necessary information available on a timely basis to make  sound judgments about the proliferation risks of many of these projects,  particularly in the project proposal development phase. A better system,  with more complete and timely data provided by IAEA, would help ensure  that projects are fully and appropriately vetted by U.S. agencies and those  that pose a potential proliferation risk are identified early in the project  development process. Until that happens, we will continue to have  concerns about the potential proliferation risks posed by TC projects,  particularly those linked to countries of concern.", "With greater transparency and earlier information from IAEA on TC  project proposals, the United States government and other countries could  raise and address proliferation concerns with IAEA\u2019s Secretariat before it  endorses projects for approval by the Board of Governors. We are also  concerned by IAEA\u2019s refusal to share information with the United States  and other member states on findings from its internal proliferation reviews  of TC projects. Furthermore, deficiencies in State\u2019s record-keeping on TC  program matters is troubling because we could not determine what, if any,  actions State took to address concerns identified by DOE and the national  laboratories.", "Regarding TC fellowships, State has not established a formal policy  governing the approval of TC fellows from foreign countries interested in  studying nuclear issues in the United States. The absence of such a policy  has allowed individuals from non-NPT countries and individuals from  countries that are U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism who obtain  visas to study in the United States and potentially acquire valuable  information. We also believe IAEA should take steps to improve  monitoring of individuals who have completed fellowships, to track their  whereabouts and ongoing research, and to determine if the knowledge and  information they obtained on TC projects is being applied to strictly  peaceful purposes.", "Regarding our management concerns associated with the TC program, we  believe that all member states receiving TC support should provide their  full contribution to the TCF. We also question the need to provide TC  assistance to high-income countries that have the apparent economic  means to finance their nuclear research and development needs  independently. In our view, IAEA could enhance the impact of its limited  resources by developing and applying reasonable \u201cmeans testing\u201d criteria  in future allocation of TC funding and consider ways in which high-income  countries can be graduated from continued TC assistance. In addition, the  metrics IAEA has used to track TC program performance do not provide  the United States and other member states with sufficient information on  the TC program\u2019s overall value. Development of more meaningful results- based performance measures could allow IAEA to more effectively  demonstrate the TC program\u2019s impact.", "Finally, IAEA could enhance the impact of the TC program\u2019s limited  resources by formally setting priorities for future TC funding, as well as  identifying areas that are less urgent because of the availability of mature  nuclear technologies and other donors. In terms of IAEA\u2019s outreach to  potential new TC donors, we believe that the private sector could be a  crucial partner in supporting the TC program generally and in sustaining  the results of TC projects so that member states can become technically  and financially less dependent on IAEA.

Such steps could include requiring information in  the proposals on potential business plans, marketing strategies, and  strategies for attracting commercial partners once IAEA support has  concluded.", "Finally, to clarify and improve U.S. oversight of the TC program, we  recommend that the Secretary of State undertake the following two  actions:    Enhance record-keeping and formally document management actions  regarding the discussion, action, and disposition of TC project proposals  that DOE and the national laboratories identify as having potential  proliferation concerns.", "Issue formal guidance with well-defined criteria\u2014such as countries  designated by State as sponsors of terrorism or gross human rights  violators\u2014that State should use as the basis for approving or rejecting TC  fellowship requests for nuclear studies in the United States. This guidance  could include, among other things, a list of specific countries from which  State would not approve TC fellows that could be updated and revised  annually, or as other circumstances warrant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to State and DOE for formal comment.  We also provided IAEA with a detailed summary of facts contained in the  draft report. State provided written comments on the draft report, which  are presented in appendix VI. DOE and IAEA provided technical  comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "State strongly opposed the matter for congressional consideration to  require State to withhold a proportionate share of the U.S. voluntary  contribution to the TC program that is equivalent to the amounts of TCF  funding that would otherwise be made available to U.S.-designated state  sponsors of terrorism and or other countries of concern. State objected for  a number of reasons, contending that (1) it would be counterproductive to  a separate recommendation we made in the report encouraging all states  to pay their full share to the TCF; (2) it would not stop TC projects in  targeted countries because TCF funding is fungible; (3) Congress has  exempted IAEA contributions from this type of proportionate withholding;  (4) none of the TC projects in state sponsors of terrorism have been  shown to have contributed to a WMD program; (5) there are adequate  safeguards within IAEA\u2019s Secretariat to prevent TC projects from  contributing to a WMD program; and (6) it would negatively impact the  ability of the United States to achieve other critical objectives within  IAEA.", "We do not believe the matter for congressional consideration is unique or  unprecedented. As we noted in our report, U.S. law currently requires the  withholding of a proportionate share of the U.S. contribution to the TCF  for certain projects in Cuba, and has required withholding in the past for  Iran, Libya, and the Territories Under the Jurisdiction of the Palestinian  Authority. However, in order to give Congress greater flexibility and more  information, we have broadened the matter for congressional  consideration to give Congress the option of requiring State to report on  its rationale for not withholding a proportionate share of the U.S.  contribution to the TCF for U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism.", "Notwithstanding our modification to the matter for congressional  consideration, we still disagree with State\u2019s specific objections to it for the  following reasons:    We do not believe the matter for congressional consideration is  counterproductive to our recommendation to strengthen mechanisms for  collecting member state contributions to the TCF. That recommendation is  geared toward strengthening mechanisms for collecting contributions to  the TCF from member states that are receiving TC assistance. The United  States is the largest donor to the TC program, providing approximately 25  percent of the TCF annual budget, and is not a beneficiary of TC  assistance.", "While contributions to the TCF are fungible, we believe there is a  fundamental principle at stake. As we described in our report, the United  States has applied several types of sanctions limiting foreign assistance  and trade to states it has designated as sponsors of terrorism and to other  countries. To avoid the appearance of an inconsistent approach and to  foster greater cohesion in U.S. policy toward such nations, we believe that  it is fair for Congress to consider requiring State to withhold a share of the  U.S. contribution to the TCF for program activities in countries that the  United States chooses not to engage directly in trade, assistance, and other  forms of cooperation.", "We are aware that in 1994 U.S. contributions to IAEA were exempted from  the law requiring State to withhold proportionate shares of funding to  international organizations for programs in certain countries. However, we  note that the IAEA exemption was enacted in 1994. In our view, the  proliferation concerns about some countries receiving TC assistance\u2014 such as Iran and Syria\u2014have increased rather than diminished since that  time. Furthermore, we note that since the enactment of the 1994  exemption, the law has been further amended to require State to withhold  a proportionate share of funding to IAEA for certain projects in Cuba and  for all projects in Iran if State determines that such projects in Iran are  inconsistent with U.S. nuclear nonproliferation and safety goals, will  provide Iran with training or expertise relevant to the development of  nuclear weapons, or are being used as a cover for the acquisition of  sensitive nuclear technology.", "We do not believe that State can assert with confidence that TC projects  have not contributed to WMD programs in state sponsors of terrorism. The  absence of evidence showing that TC projects have assisted nuclear  weapons development in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism does  not, in our view, constitute proof that such countries have not exploited  TC assistance to advance possible weapons development skills and  activities. Based on findings in our report\u2014including the limited  information available to DOE and the national laboratories on TC projects  and the inherent dual-use nature of some nuclear expertise and  technology\u2014we believe it is difficult to say with confidence that TC  projects are not contributing indirectly to weapons-related knowledge and  expertise in such countries.", "We do not have the same level of confidence as State in the safeguards  within IAEA\u2019s Secretariat to prevent TC projects from contributing to  weapons development.  As we stated in the report, we were unable to  assess the effectiveness of IAEA\u2019s internal process for reviewing TC  proposals and projects for proliferation concerns because IAEA\u2019s  Secretariat declined to provide us with basic information and  documentation regarding the results of its reviews. Furthermore, as  described in the report, IAEA\u2019s Secretariat approved at least one TC  project proposal\u2014involving the Iranian heavy water reactor at Arak\u2014that  State later objected to.", "Finally, neither we nor State can conclude with certainty how other states  might react to an increase in the United States\u2019 proportionate withholding  of funding to the TCF and how this would affect U.S. ability to achieve  other objectives within the agency.", "State agreed with 7 of our 10 recommendations to improve TC program  management and oversight. It neither agreed nor disagreed with the three  other recommendations that called on State, working with IAEA and  member states through the Board of Governors, to explore (1) establishing  a formal mechanism to facilitate greater and more timely information  sharing on TC proposals between IAEA, the United States, and other  countries; (2) strengthening TC program mechanisms for collecting  member state contributions to the TCF, including withholding a  percentage of TC assistance to recipient countries that fail to pay their  target contribution; and (3) establishing criteria for determining when  member states no longer require TC assistance and could be graduated  from further TC support.", "Regarding the recommendation concerning the establishment of a formal  mechanism to facilitate greater and more timely information sharing on TC  project proposals between IAEA and the United States and other  countries, State noted that it would be difficult to implement through  IAEA\u2019s Board of Governors because TC proposals are considered  confidential between IAEA and the recipient state. State commented that a  more achievable goal could be to work with IAEA to ensure that it  publishes a complete listing of project proposals earlier. Because TC  projects can involve transfer of equipment, technology, and expertise that  could potentially contribute to nuclear weapons development, we  continue to believe that TC proposals demand the highest level of scrutiny,  transparency, and information sharing. We question why details of TC  proposals are considered confidential, and believe the United States and  other major donors should have a full understanding of the proposals that  they are being asked to support through their TCF contributions. Finally,  as noted in the report, we found that the quantity of information about TC  proposals currently available to DOE and the national laboratories is  insufficient in many cases\u2014especially in cases where DOE and the  national laboratories obtained only lists of proposal titles\u2014to make  accurate determinations of potential proliferation risks. It is unclear  whether State\u2019s suggestion to work with IAEA to publish the complete  listing of proposed projects earlier would result in sufficient details being  provided to DOE and the national laboratories to allow them to more  reliably assess proliferation risks.", "On our recommendation to strengthen the mechanisms for collecting  member state contributions to the TCF, State commented that the rate of  payment to the TCF by member states has improved in recent years.  However, as we noted in the report, many states receiving assistance are  still not paying their full share of contributions to the TCF. We believe  there is room for continued improvement and that mechanisms should  continue to be strengthened toward that end. We believe the  recommendation is sound and should be implemented.", "Finally, concerning the recommendation to establish criteria for  determining when member states no longer require further TC assistance  and could be graduated from further TC support, State observed that a  proposal for graduating higher-income TC recipient states based on their  per capita gross national product was put forward in 1997. State noted that  one member state objected to graduating countries based solely on such  criteria. We recognize the political and practical challenges of  implementing a graduation strategy for member states receiving TC  assistance. However, as noted in our report, both State and IAEA officials  supported the principle of graduating countries that no longer require TC  assistance. Moreover, our recommendation does not identify specific  graduation criteria or specify that a member state\u2019s income ranking be the  sole factor to serve as the basis for graduating a state from further TC  support.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We employed several  methodologies to address these objectives.", "Our review of the TC program covered the years 1997 through 2007. We  chose this period because our previous report on the TC program reported  on TC programmatic and financial data through 1996. We interviewed key  officials and analyzed documentation, such as cables, presentations,  financial information, and reports and analyses of TC program issues from  the Departments of State (State) and Energy (DOE). State officials also  provided us with relevant IAEA documentation and information, such as  copies of IAEA\u2019s annual \u201cwhite books\u201d identifying TC projects approved  by IAEA, as well as information on specific TC projects from IAEA\u2019s \u201cTC- PRIDE\u201d database. We also interviewed officials in the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission\u2019s Office of International Programs who participate in U.S.  interagency meetings on IAEA TC issues. In addition, we met with  representatives from five national laboratories involved in the DOE  Interdiction Technical Analysis Group, a multilaboratory team providing  DOE with technical analysis of proliferation-related issues, including the  TC program. We also visited the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to  obtain documentation and interview current and former ORNL staff  involved in previous and ongoing assessments of TC proposals and active  projects for potential proliferation concerns. In addition, we visited the  Argonne National Laboratory to interview representatives who provide  support and analytical services to State on TC issues, organize training  seminars for foreign nationals involved in TC projects, and facilitate TC  fellowships for foreign nationals to study nuclear issues in the United  States.", "We also interviewed officials at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria,  including representatives from the TC Department and other IAEA  departments, including the Departments of Management, Safeguards, and  Nuclear Safety and Security; the Office of Internal Oversight Services; and  the Office of External Relations and Policy Coordination. We reviewed and  analyzed information provided by IAEA officials, including presentation  slides, annual reports, internal and external auditor reports, and TC  project brochures. We also reviewed speeches and other statements by  IAEA officials on the TC program and related IAEA issues. IAEA officials  provided us with data on the number of TC projects by year, country, and  technical area, as well as financial information on the TC program over the  past decade. We interviewed knowledgeable IAEA officials on the  reliability of these data, including issues such as data entry, access, quality  control procedures, and the accuracy and completeness of the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  review.", "Furthermore, we interviewed officials at the U.S. Mission to International  Organizations in Vienna (U.S. Mission) regarding TC program policies and  processes. We also met with officials from the Canadian Permanent  Mission to the International Organizations in Vienna who work on IAEA  issues to gain their perspectives on the TC program. We also conducted  interviews with several nongovernmental experts who have monitored  IAEA and developments in the TC program, and met with and obtained  documentation from the U.S. representative to IAEA\u2019s Standing Advisory  Group on Technical Assistance and Cooperation.", "We discussed U.S. and IAEA policies and criteria with State and IAEA  officials on the extent to which countries are limited from receiving TC  assistance because of proliferation and related concerns. We also  reviewed (1) speeches, articles, and other statements made by IAEA  officials; (2) annual State reports to Congress on IAEA assistance provided  to some states that the United States has identified as countries of  concern; (3) speeches and statements by U.S. officials; and (4) cables  between State and the U.S. Mission outlining U.S. policy toward the TC  program. We obtained and analyzed the lists of countries that (1) are  designated by the United States as state sponsors of terrorism, (2) are  party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),  and (3) have comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional  protocols in force with IAEA. We cross-referenced each of these lists  against IAEA financial records to determine how much TC support has  been provided to countries that the United States has listed as state  sponsors of terrorism, are not party to the NPT, or do not have  comprehensive safeguards or additional protocol agreements in force with  IAEA.", "To assess the extent to which the United States and IAEA evaluate and  monitor TC projects for proliferation concerns, we interviewed State and  DOE officials regarding their TC program review processes. We also  interviewed representatives from five of the U.S. national laboratories  involved in past and current evaluations of TC proposals and projects for  proliferation concerns. Through DOE, we obtained and analyzed  information from ORNL and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to  determine the numbers of TC proposals the national laboratories reviewed  each year between 1998 and 2006. We reviewed and verified these data  with DOE and the national laboratory officials, and discussed and verified  the proliferation risks DOE and the national laboratory officials identified  in specific TC proposals. We used IAEA records of approved TC projects  to determine whether TC proposals that the national laboratories had  identified as having possible proliferation risks were approved by IAEA.  Because of IAEA policies that restricted our access to data and related  information on TC proposal and project reviews by IAEA\u2019s Safeguards  Department, we were unable to assess the effectiveness of IAEA\u2019s internal  review of TC proposals and projects for proliferation concerns.", "To determine the challenges and limitations in IAEA\u2019s management of the  TC program, we interviewed officials from State, Argonne National  Laboratory, and IAEA, as well as the U.S. representative to IAEA\u2019s  Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Cooperation. We  obtained and reviewed relevant IAEA documentation addressing TC  program metrics, such as TC program guidance and strategy documents,  IAEA internal audit reports, and meeting reports by IAEA\u2019s Technical  Assistance and Cooperation Committee. To assess financial resource  challenges facing the TC program, we analyzed financial data from TC  program annual reports between 1997 and 2007\u2014including annual budgets  of the Technical Cooperation Fund (TCF), annual contributions by  member states to the TCF, and amounts of annual TC assistance provided  to recipient countries and territories\u2014to determine the level of funding  countries contributed to the TCF and the amounts some countries  received from the TC program over the past decade. We used the United  Nation\u2019s (UN) annual Human Development Reports to determine country  income classifications. For each country, we cross-referenced TC financial  data against country income classifications to determine the amounts of  funding countries designated by the UN as \u201chigh-income\u201d contributed to  and received from the TC program. Additionally, we reviewed TC program  annual reports to determine the technical areas covered and funded by the  program.", "As initially agreed with your office, we intended to assess the extent to  which TC projects have contributed to the safety and security of nuclear  installations around the world. Toward that end, using data provided by  State from IAEA\u2019s TC-PRIDE database, identifying all TC projects funded  in the nuclear security and safety fields since 1997, we developed a  judgmental sample of 22 TC projects (17 national projects and 5 regional  projects) to serve as the basis for our assessment and interviews with  relevant IAEA officials. We selected this judgmental sample by focusing on  projects completed since 2005. Using the data provided by State, we  calculated the average cost of national-level nuclear security and safety  projects completed since that time and selected the 17 projects that  exceeded this average cost. The 5 regional projects in our judgmental  sample were selected by identifying the highest budget project in each of  the five TC program regions completed since 2005. We briefed IAEA  officials on our project selection methodology, and they agreed that it was  fair and unbiased. However, IAEA officials declined to make additional  information available to us on these projects and did not provide us with  an opportunity to interview relevant IAEA officials who oversaw these  projects to discuss their impact and results. As a result of these restrictive  policies, we were unable to sufficiently assess the TC program\u2019s  contributions to improving the safety and security of nuclear facilities  around the world.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2007 to March 2009,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
