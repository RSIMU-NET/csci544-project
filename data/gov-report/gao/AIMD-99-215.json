Thus, the performance improvements expected under the Results Act will not occur merely because an agency has issued an annual performance plan. Rather, performance improvements occur when agencies transform their organizational cultures so that achieving results becomes the driving concern of daily operations and when agency managers and external decisionmakers use results-oriented plans and the planning and management processes that underpin them to inform decisions.", "Congress clearly has shown its interest in agency performance planning to better inform its decisions. As you requested, this report provides summary information based on our review and evaluation of the fiscal year 2000 performance plans of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act. (The CFO Act agencies are listed in figure 2.) As agreed with your offices, our first objective was to summarize our observations on the extent to which the agencies\u2019 plans include three key elements of informative performance plans: (1) clear pictures of intended performance, (2) specific discussions of strategies and resources, and (3) confidence that performance information will be credible. For each of these elements, we characterized each agency\u2019s plan in one of four ways, based on the degree to which the plan contains informative practices associated with that element. These practices, drawn from Results Act requirements, related guidance, and the more informative features of the fiscal year 1999 performance plans, are identified in our published work.", "Thus, to address the first element concerning the degree to which the plan provides a clear picture of intended performance, we characterized each plan in one of four ways: (1) provides a clear picture of intended performance across the agency, (2) provides a general picture, (3) provides a limited picture, or (4) provides an unclear picture. To address the second element, on the extent to which a plan includes specific discussions of strategies and resources, we characterized each plan as (1) containing specific discussions of strategies and resources, (2) general discussions, (3) limited discussions, or (4) no discussions. To address the third element on the extent to which a plan provides confidence that performance information will be credible, we characterized each plan as providing (1) full confidence, (2) general confidence, (3) limited confidence, or (4) no confidence.", "Our second objective was to identify the degree of improvement the fiscal year 2000 performance plans represent over the fiscal year 1999 plans. Based on our analysis, we determined the level of improvement in agencies\u2019 plans by using one of four characterizations: (1) much improvement; (2) moderate improvement; (3) little, if any, improvement; (4) no improvement.

For example, to help achieve improved public health and safety on the highway, DOT has performance goals and measures to reduce the rates of alcohol-related and large truck-related fatalities and injuries and to increase seat belt use, in addition to its goals related to highway fatality and injury rates. The DOT plan also provides helpful information that explains the importance of each goal, the relationship of annual goals to DOT strategic goals, and the relationship of the performance measures to annual goals.", "Similarly, the Department of Education\u2019s plan contains a set of goals and measures related to a vital issue of growing national concern\u2014that schools should be strong, safe, disciplined, and drug-free. Specifically, Education has performance goals and measures to reduce the prevalence of alcohol and drugs in schools, decrease criminal and violent incidents committed by students, and increase the percentage of teachers who are trained to deal with discipline problems in the classrooms. The plan includes explanatory information for each goal and measure. For instance, Education explains that it changed its target level for the percentage of students using marijuana at school because of better than expected reductions in 1998.", "However, we still found cases where program results were not clearly defined. For example, the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) performance plan\u2019s goals and measures continue to generally focus on outputs rather than results. To assess progress in its goal to \u201cincrease opportunities for small business success,\u201d SBA relies on measures such as an increase in the number of loans made by SBA, the number of clients served, the number of bonds issued, and the amount of dollars invested in small businesses. This is important information, but the plan does not show how these measures are related to increasing opportunities for small businesses to be successful\u2014the key result SBA hopes to achieve.", "Sets of performance goals and measures also should provide balanced perspectives on performance that cover the variety of results agencies are expected to achieve. Federal programs are designed and implemented in dynamic environments where mission requirements may be in conflict, such as ensuring enforcement while promoting related services, or priorities may be different, such as those to improve service quality while limiting program cost. Consequently, mission requirements and priorities must be weighed against each other to avoid distorting program performance.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides an illustration of an agency that is using a range of goals to reflect the variety of results it seeks to achieve. VHA recognizes that, as it seeks to improve the health status of veterans, it must provide care efficiently. VHA\u2019s primary healthcare strategy has three performance goals to be achieved by fiscal year 2002, referred to as the 30-20-10 strategy. With fiscal year 1997 as the baseline, VHA has separate goals that focus on (1) reducing the cost per patient by 30 percent, (2) increasing the number of patients served by 20 percent, and (3) increasing to 10 percent the portion of the medical care budget derived from alternative revenue sources. VHA\u2019s ability to fund the costs associated with serving 20 percent more patients than in the past will depend in large part on VHA\u2019s success in meeting its goals to decrease the cost per patient and increase revenues from alternative sources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multiyear and Intermediate Goals Can Provide Useful Perspective on Results to Be Achieved", "paragraphs": ["In reviewing the fiscal year 1999 plans, we said that setting multiyear and intermediate goals is particularly useful when it may take years before results are achieved and in isolating an agency\u2019s discrete contribution to a specific result. In examining the fiscal year 2000 plans, we found that some agencies have started to incorporate these practices into their performance plans.", "For example, the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) plan includes multiyear goals that provide valuable perspective on its plans over several years. In particular, the plan has an objective for fiscal year 2002 to simplify and automate the current General Schedule position classification system by reducing the number of position classification standards from more than 400 to fewer than 100. The plan shows that OPM projects that it will reduce the number of classification standards to 320 by the end of fiscal year 1999 and further reduce the number to 216 by the end of fiscal year 2000. Reducing the number of classification standards is seen by OPM as important because it will provide federal agencies with added flexibility to better acquire and deploy their human capital.", "The Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also includes projected target levels of performance for multiyear goals in its plan. As part of its strategic goal to sustain healthy coasts, NOAA set a target for fiscal year 2002 to increase to 75 the percentage of the U.S. coastline where threats to the habitat have been assessed and ranked. NOAA set a target level of 20 percent in fiscal year 2000 from a baseline of 0 percent in fiscal year 1998.", "In contrast, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides an example of where multiyear goals could be included in the plan but are not. The plan states that the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 requires that 80 percent of all tax and information returns that IRS processes be electronically filed by year 2007. IRS\u2019 plan would be more useful if it discussed this mandate along with target levels to show how it plans to achieve this goal over the next 7 years. Congress will likely expect to receive information relating to IRS\u2019 progress in the area, particularly since IRS has requested funding for this goal. Treasury officials said that they recognize the shortcomings in IRS\u2019 performance measures. As part of its restructuring, IRS is undertaking improvements by developing new performance measures.", "A few agencies have recognized that using intermediate goals and measures, such as outputs or intermediate outcomes, can show interim progress toward intended results. For example, the Department of Justice\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a goal to disrupt and dismantle drug syndicates, but its plan acknowledges that counting the number of cases, arrests, or seizures does not adequately measure the true impact of enforcement efforts. Therefore, addition to those measures, DEA is developing other gauges, such as the ratio of the number of targeted organizations disrupted as a result of DEA involvement in foreign investigations to the total number of targeted organizations. Its plan states that DEA will collect data for this goal in fiscal year 1999.", "Similarly, SSA recognizes in its plan that one change needed for its disability program is that disabled beneficiaries must become self- sufficient to the greatest extent possible. As a first step toward its strategic objective to \u201cshape the disability program in a manner that increases self- sufficiency,\u201d SSA includes an intermediate goal to increase by 10 percent in fiscal year 2000 the number of Disability Insurance beneficiaries transitioning into trial work periods over time.

With baseline and trend data, the performance plans provide a context for drawing conclusions about whether performance goals are reasonable and appropriate. Decisionmakers can use such information to gauge how a program\u2019s anticipated performance level compares with improvements or declines in past performance.", "For example, the DOT plan includes graphs for nearly all goals and measures that show baseline and trend data as well as the targets for fiscal year 1999 and 2000. The graphs clearly indicate trends and provide a basis for comparing actual program results with the established performance goals. The performance goal for hazardous material incidents is typical in that it has a graph that shows the number of serious hazardous materials incidents that occurred in transportation during the period 1988 through 1997. DOT also includes explanatory information that provides a context for past performance and future goals.", "In cases where baseline and trend data are not yet available, the more informative performance plans include information on what actions agencies are taking to collect appropriate data and when they expect to have them. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides baseline and trend data for many of its goals and measures, if such data are available. If data are not available, the plan discusses when HUD expects to develop the baselines. For example, the performance goal and measure to increase the share of recipients of welfare-to-work vouchers who hold jobs at the time of annual recertification indicates that the baseline for households receiving vouchers in fiscal year 2000 will be determined in fiscal year 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Plans Lack Consistent Attention to Mission-Critical Management Challenges and Program Risks", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2000 annual performance plans show inconsistent attention to the need to resolve the mission-critical management challenges and program risks that continue to undermine the federal government\u2019s economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. These challenges and risks must be addressed as part of any serious effort to fundamentally improve the performance of federal agencies. In our assessment of the fiscal year 1999 performance plans, we observed that the value of the plans could be augmented if they more fully included goals that addressed mission-critical management issues. We noted that precise and measurable goals for resolving mission-critical management problems are important to ensuring that the agencies have the institutional capacity to achieve their more results-oriented programmatic goals.", "In assessing the fiscal year 2000 plans, we looked at whether the plans address over 300 specific management challenges and program risks identified by us and the agencies\u2019 Inspectors General. Many of these challenges and risks are long-standing, well known, and have been the subject of close congressional scrutiny. They include, most prominently, federal operations that we have identified as being at among the highest risk for waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.", "We found that agencies do not consistently address management challenges and program risks in their fiscal year 2000 performance plans. In those cases where challenges and risks are addressed, agencies use a variety of approaches, including setting goals and measures directly linked to the management challenges and program risks, establishing goals and measures that are indirectly related to the challenges and risks, or laying out strategies to address them. Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of these various approaches among the management challenges and program risks we identified.", "Agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2000 plans contain goals and measures that directly address about 40 percent of the identified management challenges and program risks. For example, the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) plan contains goals and measures that are designed to address its major management challenges and program risks. DOE\u2019s contract management is one of the areas on our high-risk list, and this is especially important because DOE relies on contractors to perform about 90 percent of its work. Under DOE\u2019s corporate management goal, one objective is to improve the delivery of products and services through contract reform and the use of businesslike practices. The strategies DOE identifies include using prudent contracting and business management approaches that emphasize results, accountability, and competition. DOE\u2019s plan also contains three specific measures addressing contract reform. One of these measures is to convert one support services contract at each major site to become a performance-based service contract using government standards.", "On the other hand, agencies\u2019 plans do not contain goals, measures, or strategies to resolve one-fourth of the management challenges and program risks we identified. In Treasury\u2019s plan, for example, IRS has no goals, measures, or strategies to address several of the high-risk areas we have identified, even though important management reform initiatives are under way across the agency. Specifically, Treasury\u2019s plan does not address internal control weaknesses over unpaid tax assessments (We found that the lack of a subsidiary ledger impairs IRS\u2019 ability to effectively manage its unpaid assessments. This weakness has resulted in IRS\u2019 inappropriately directing collection efforts against taxpayers after amounts owed have been paid.); the need to assess the impact of various efforts IRS has under way to the need to improve security controls over information systems and address weaknesses that place sensitive taxpayer data at risk to both internal and external threats (Our high-risk update reported that IRS\u2019 controls do not adequately reduce vulnerability to inappropriate disclosure.); and weaknesses in internal controls over taxpayer receipts. (Specifically, there is no discussion of IRS\u2019 plans to strengthen efforts to ensure that taxpayer receipts are securely transported, such as prohibiting the use of bicycle or other unarmed vehicle couriers. Our high-risk update pointed out that IRS\u2019 controls over tax receipts do not adequately reduce their vulnerability to theft.)", "Treasury\u2019s plan would be more informative if it captured IRS\u2019 reform efforts and delineated goals and performance measures and, if necessary, developed interim measures to show IRS\u2019 intended near-term progress toward addressing its high-risk operations.", "For about 18 percent of the over 300 management challenges and program risks we identified, agencies have established annual performance goals that appear to indirectly address these issues. For example, while SSA paid over $73 billion in 1998 in cash benefits to nearly 11 million blind and disabled beneficiaries, we found that SSA\u2019s complex process for determining whether an individual qualifies for disability benefits has been plagued by a number of long-standing weaknesses. SSA\u2019s disability benefit claims process is time-consuming and expensive, and SSA\u2019s disability caseloads have grown significantly in the past decade. On the basis of our ongoing review of SSA\u2019s disability claims process redesign effort, we found that SSA has not been able to keep its redesign activities on schedule or demonstrate that its proposed changes will significantly improve its claims process. Further, we found that few people have left the disability rolls to return to work. Although SSA\u2019s plan does not include any direct goals or measures for its disability redesign efforts, it does include an intermediate goal for fiscal year 2000 to increase the number of Disability Insurance recipients and Supplemental Security Income recipients transitioning into the workforce by 10 percent over fiscal year 1997 levels.", "Finally, agencies identify strategies to help them meet the challenges and risks they confront, rather than setting goals and measures in their performance plans. The plans we reviewed contain strategies to address about 18 percent of the identified challenges and risks. For some agencies, these strategies are clearly and directly related to the agency\u2019s efforts to address a specific challenge or risk. For example, DOT\u2019s lack of controls over its financial activities impairs the agency\u2019s ability to manage programs and exposes the department to potential waste, fraud, mismanagement, and abuse. DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan identifies financial accounting as a management challenge and addresses key weaknesses that need to be resolved before DOT can obtain an unqualified audit opinion on its fiscal year 2000 financial audit. DOT\u2019s corporate management strategies include efforts to (1) receive an unqualified audit opinion on the department\u2019s fiscal year 2000 consolidated financial statement and stand- alone financial statements, (2) enhance the efficiency of the accounting operation consistent with increased accountability and reliable reporting, and (3) implement a pilot of the improved financial systems environment in at least one operating administration.", "In other cases, however, it is unclear to what extent the strategies that agencies identify in their fiscal year 2000 annual performance plans will address the management challenges and program risks. Labor\u2019s Inspector General has found, for example, that the department faces serious vulnerabilities within three major worker benefit programs. These program risks include the continued proliferation of unemployment insurance fraud schemes and the escalating indebtedness of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Labor did not develop any performance goals to specifically address these vulnerabilities, and although its plan broadly discusses these concerns, the plan shows that Labor will rely, for example, on the Inspector General\u2019s investigations to help identify and investigate multistate fraud schemes. Labor did not address efforts to reduce the indebtedness of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Similarly, another challenge the Inspector General identified is Labor\u2019s need to ensure that weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and criminal activity are identified and addressed. Here again, Labor\u2019s plan indicates that it will rely on the Inspector General investigations to address this challenge. Because the Inspector General has already identified these management challenges and program risks, it is unclear whether relying on further Inspector General investigations will be a sufficient strategy to systematically address the vulnerabilities that have been identified across several Labor programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordinating Crosscutting Program Efforts Needs Additional Effort", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2000 performance plans indicate that the federal government continues to make progress in showing that crosscutting efforts are being coordinated to ensure effective and efficient program delivery. Among the improvements in the fiscal year 2000 plans over what we observed in the fiscal year 1999 plans are further identification of crosscutting efforts and more inclusive listings of other agencies with which responsibility for those efforts are shared. However, similar to the situation with the 1999 plans, few agencies have attempted the more challenging task of establishing complementary performance goals, mutually reinforcing strategies, and common performance measures, as appropriate.", "The effective and efficient coordination of crosscutting programs is important because our work has suggested that mission fragmentation and program overlap are widespread. We have identified opportunities for improving federal program coordination in vital national mission areas covering counterterrorism agriculture, community and regional development, health, income security, law enforcement, international affairs, and other areas. Our work has found that uncoordinated federal efforts confuse and frustrate program recipients, waste scarce resources, and undermine the overall effectiveness of the federal effort.", "SSA and VA improved their fiscal year 2000 plans over their fiscal year 1999 plans by linking their performance goals and objectives to crosscutting program efforts. SSA, under its goal \u201cto make SSA program management the best-in-business, with zero tolerance for fraud and abuse,\u201d lists 14 crosscutting areas of coordination, including information sharing with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Health Care Financing Administration to help SSA determine Medicaid eligibility. Similarly, VA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 plan briefly describes an extensive array of crosscutting activities and explicitly associates applicable crosscutting activities with each key performance goal, whereas the fiscal year 1999 plan was limited to listings of other entities with crosscutting interests.", "Although most agencies have shown at least some improvement in their identification of crosscutting program efforts, the Department of Defense (DOD) and DOE continue to provide little information about the substantive work of interagency coordination that is taking place. For example, we found that the federal government\u2019s effort to combat terrorism\u2014an effort that cost about $6.7 billion in fiscal year 1997\u2014was among the significant crosscutting programs for which DOD failed to discuss the details of coordination with other involved agencies in both its fiscal years 1999 and 2000 plans. This failure is important because, as we recently testified, opportunities continue to exist to better focus and target the nation\u2019s investments in combating terrorism and better ensure that the United States is prioritizing its funding of the right programs in the right amounts.", "Similarly, DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2000 plan does not show other agencies\u2019 programs that contribute to results that DOE is also trying to achieve. This plan\u2019s \u201cmeans and strategies\u201d section, under the business line of Science and Technology, provides one example. In this discussion, DOE does not identify any federal agency, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), that may contribute to similar science and technology results.

For example, DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan indicates goals and performance measures to be used mutually to support crosscutting programs. The plan states that the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have complementary performance goals to decrease by 80 percent the rate of aviation fatalities by the year 2007. However, the plan could be improved by describing how the strategies of the two agencies are mutually reinforcing.", "HHS also provides valuable perspective to decisionmakers by linking complementary performance goals of agencies within the department. Those linkages suggest how differing program strategies can be mutually reinforcing. For example, one of HHS\u2019 strategic objectives is to reduce tobacco use, especially among the young. To contribute to this objective, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a performance goal to reduce the percentage of teenagers who smoke by conducting education campaigns, providing funding and technical assistance to state programs, and working with nongovernmental entities. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a complementary goal to reduce the easy access to tobacco products and eliminate the strong appeal of these products for children by conducting 400,000 compliance checks and selecting certain sites to target for intensified enforcement efforts to determine the effectiveness of different levels of effort.

By way of illustration, FDA has a goal to develop and make available an improved method for the detection of several foodborne pathogens. FDA\u2019s discussion of this goal refers to an interagency research plan that seeks to more effectively coordinate the food safety research activities of FDA and the Department of Agriculture (USDA).", "FDA\u2019s discussion of joint planning, one approach to interagency coordination, demonstrates how annual performance plans can be used to develop a base of governmentwide information on the strengths and weaknesses of various coordination approaches and tools\u2014as we suggested in our review of the fiscal year 1999 plans.

However, individual agencies show progress in making useful linkages between their budget requests and performance goals, as we will detail in a companion letter to this report. Such progress is important because a key objective of the Results Act is to help Congress develop a clearer understanding of what is being achieved in relation to what is being spent. The Act requires that annual performance plans link performance goals to the program activities in agencies\u2019 budget requests.", "The most informative plans would translate these linkages into budgetary terms\u2014that is, they would show how funding is being allocated from program activities to discrete sets of performance goals. For example, SSA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance plan noted that the agency\u2019s Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) account supported most of the measures in the plan. However, beyond that acknowledgement, SSA provided few details as to how budget resources would actually be allocated to support its performance goals. As a means of communicating its efforts to link budget resources to stated goals, the fiscal year 2000 plan now includes a matrix of SSA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 administrative budget accounts by related strategic goal. For example, the matrix shows that SSA has determined that it will require $38 million to meet its strategic goal of \u201cpromoting responsive programs\u201d and that this amount will come out of SSA\u2019s LAE and Extramural Research accounts.", "As we noted in reviewing fiscal year 1999 performance plans, agencies used a variety of techniques to show relationships between budgetary resources and performance goals. Plans contain crosswalks to help identify how much funding would be needed to support discrete sets of performance goals and where that funding was included in the agency\u2019s budget request. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey portion of the Department of the Interior\u2019s fiscal year 2000 plan provides crosswalks showing (1) the relationship between funding for its budget program activities and funding for its \u201cGPRA program activities\u201d and (2) how \u201cGPRA program activity\u201d funding would be allocated to performance goals. In contrast, some agencies could have used such crosswalks to make their presentations more relevant for budget decisionmaking. For example, Commerce\u2019s plan identifies requirements of $133.2 million to achieve the International Trade Administration\u2019s (ITA) strategic goal of increasing the number of small business exporters. However, it is not clear how this funding level was derived from the budget activities or accounts in ITA\u2019s budget request.", "In addition to providing crosswalks, some agencies also made performance information useful for resource allocation decisions by including this information in the budget justification of estimates traditionally sent to Congress in support of their requests. For example, NRC integrates its budget justification and performance plan for the first time in fiscal year 2000 as part of a broader initiative to integrate its planning, budgeting, and performance management process. Information traditionally contained in a budget justification, such as descriptions of accounts and their funding, was combined with performance information in such a way that the NRC budget justification and its plan could not be separated.", "Although no agency made significant changes to its account or program activity structure in fiscal year 2000 in order to clarify or simplify relationships between program activities and performance goals, some agencies mention the possibility of future change. For example, we have previously noted that VA\u2019s program activities do not clearly align with the agency\u2019s performance goals.

For each performance goal, the plan lists an overall strategy that often clearly conveys the relationship between the strategy and the goal for achieving it, as well as specific activities and initiatives to be undertaken in fiscal year 2000. For instance, DOT expects to increase transit ridership through investments in transit infrastructure, financial assistance to metropolitan planning organizations and state departments of transportation for planning activities, research on improving train control systems, and fleet management to provide more customer service.", "NSF\u2019s performance plan also presents strategies that clearly show how NSF plans to achieve its fiscal year 2000 performance goals. Specifically, the plan describes the general strategies that NSF intends to use to achieve its performance goals for the results of scientific research and education and for most of its performance goals for the NSF investment process and management. To illustrate, NSF will use a competitive merit-based review process with peer evaluations to identify the most promising ideas from the strongest researchers and educators. According to its plan, NSF will work toward the outcome goal of \u201cpromoting connections between discoveries and their use in service to society\u201d by using the merit review process to make awards for research and education activities that will rapidly and readily feed into education, policy development, or work of other federal agencies or the private sector.", "On the other hand, some agencies do not adequately discuss how strategies and programs contribute to results. For example, Labor identifies in its plan 112 means and strategies to accomplish its 42 performance goals and links each strategy to a specific performance goal. However, in some instances, the strategies do not identify how they would help achieve the stated goals. For example, one performance goal states that 60 percent of local employment and training offices will be part of one-stop career center systems. In a related strategy, Labor states that it will \u201ccontinue its support of the adoption and implementation of continuous improvement initiatives throughout the workforce development system,\u201d but does not indicate how these efforts will help achieve the performance goal.", "In some cases, strategies are not provided.

Consistent with our approach last year in reviewing the fiscal year 1999 annual plans, our reviews of each of the agencies\u2019 performance plans and our summary analysis of the 24 plans were based on criteria from our evaluator\u2019s guide and our congressional guide, which in turn are based on the Results Act; OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 2; and other related guidance. In the guides, we collapsed the Results Act\u2019s requirements for annual performance plans into three core questions that focus on performance goals and measures, strategies and resources, and verification and validation. The criteria from the guides were supplemented by practices and examples included in our report Agency Performance Plans: Examples of Practices That Can Improve Usefulness to Decisionmakers (GAO/GGD/AIMD-99-69, Feb. 26, 1999), which builds on the improvement opportunities identified in our fiscal year 1999 performance plans\u2019 summary report.", "From that work, we derived practices to identify each plan\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and determined the extent to which the plan includes three key elements of informative performance plans: (1) clear picture of intended performance, (2) specific discussion of strategies and resources, and (3) confidence that performance information will be credible.
