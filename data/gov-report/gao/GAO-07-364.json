As part of its audit of IRS's fiscal years 2006 and 2005 financial statements, GAO assessed (1) IRS's actions to correct previously reported information security weaknesses and (2) whether controls were effective in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information. To do this, GAO examined IRS information security policies and procedures, guidance, security plans, reports, and other documents; tested controls over five critical applications at three IRS sites; and interviewed key security representatives and management officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS has made limited progress toward correcting or mitigating previously reported information security weaknesses at two data processing sites, but 66 percent of the weaknesses that GAO had previously identified still existed. Specifically, IRS has corrected or mitigated 25 of the 73 information security weaknesses that GAO reported as unresolved at the time of our last review. For example, IRS has improved password controls on its servers and enhanced audit and monitoring efforts for mainframe and Windows user activity, but it continues to (1) use inadequate account lockout settings for Windows servers and (2) inadequately verify employees' identities against official IRS photo identification. Significant weaknesses in access controls and other information security controls continue to threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IRS's financial and tax processing systems and information. For example, IRS has not implemented effective access controls related to user identification and authentication, authorization, cryptography, audit and monitoring, physical security, and other information security controls. These weaknesses could impair IRS's ability to perform vital functions and increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of financial and sensitive taxpayer information. Accordingly, GAO has reported a material weakness in IRS's internal controls over its financial and tax processing systems. A primary reason for the new and old weaknesses is that IRS has not yet fully implemented its information security program. IRS has taken a number of steps to develop, document, and implement an information security program. However, the agency has not yet fully or consistently implemented critical elements of its program. Until IRS fully implements an agencywide information security program that includes risk assessments, enhanced policies and procedures, security plans, training, adequate tests and evaluations, and a continuity of operations process for all major systems, the financial and sensitive taxpayer information on its systems will remain vulnerable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a demanding responsibility in  collecting taxes, processing tax returns, and enforcing the nation\u2019s tax  laws.

Therefore, an important component of an information security  program is providing required training so that users understand system  security risks and their own role in implementing related policies and  controls to mitigate those risks. IRS policy mandates that personnel with  significant security responsibilities be provided with specialized training.  In addition, IRS policy requires that personnel performing information  technology security duties meet minimum continuing professional  education levels in accordance with their roles. Specifically, personnel  performing technical security roles are required to have 24 hours of  specialized training per year, personnel performing nontechnical roles are  required to have 16 hours of specialized training per year, and personnel  performing executive security roles should have 6 hours of specialized  training per year. IRS policy also requires that effective tracking and  reporting mechanisms be in place to monitor specialized training.", "Although IRS has made significant progress in providing security  personnel with job-related training and established a methodology for  identifying employees with significant security responsibilities, in fiscal  year 2006, at least 95 individuals with significant security responsibilities  did not have the minimum number of hours of specialized training  required by IRS policy. Of those 95 individuals, 18 had not completed any  training for the last reporting year. In addition, IRS was not able to  determine whether all of its employees had met minimum continuing  professional education requirements. For example, IRS monitored  employee training through its Enterprise Learning Management System,  but the system could not differentiate between employees who are  required to have only 6 hours of training and employees who are required  to have more.

The policy further requires that IRS track the status of  resolution of all weaknesses and verify that each weakness is corrected.", "IRS has developed and implemented a remedial action process to address  deficiencies in its information security policies, procedures, and practices,  however, this remedial action process was not working as intended. For  example, the verification process used to determine whether remedial  actions were implemented was not always effective. Of the 73 previously  reported weaknesses, IRS had indicated that it had corrected or mitigated  57 of them. However, of those 57 weaknesses, 33 still existed at the time of  our review. In addition, IRS had identified weaknesses but did not  document them in a remedial action plan. For example, we reviewed  system self-assessments for five systems and identified at least 8  weaknesses not documented in a remedial action plan. These weaknesses  pertained to system audit trails, approval and distribution of continuity of  operations plans, and documenting emergency procedures. TIGTA also  reported that IRS was not tracking all weaknesses found during security  assessments in 2006. As a result, increased risk exists that known  vulnerabilities will not be mitigated.", "IRS did not proactively ensure that weaknesses found at one of its  facilities or on one of its systems were considered and, if necessary,  corrected at other facilities or on similar systems. Many of the issues  identified in this report were previously reported at other locations and on  similar systems. Yet, IRS had not applied those recommendations to the  facilities and systems we reviewed this year. For example, we have been  identifying weaknesses with encryption at IRS since 1998. However, IRS  was not using encryption to protect information traversing its network. In  addition, in 2002 we recommended that IRS promptly remove system  access for separated employees and verify that system access has been  removed. Nevertheless, IRS did not promptly remove system access for  separated employees.", "Recognizing the need for a servicewide solution, IRS developed a plan in  October 2006 to address many of the recurring weaknesses.

According to NIST, systems need to have a  reasonably well-controlled operating environment, and failures in  environmental controls such as air-conditioning systems may cause a  service interruption and may damage hardware.
