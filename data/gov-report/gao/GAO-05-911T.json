The program has grown significantly over the past several years. Currently, federal agencies can directly purchase, through more than 16,000 schedule contracts, over 8 million products from more than 10,000 commercial vendors. In fiscal year 2004, purchases from these contracts totaled more than $32 billion. The multiple award schedules program is designed to take advantage of the government's significant buying power. To maximize savings, GSA negotiates discounts that are equal to or greater than those given to the vendor's most favored customers. This testimony focuses on GSA's historic use of two proven negotiation tools to improve the pricing of schedules contracts--pre-award audits and postaward audits of pre-award information.

For more than 25 years, GAO has reported on GSA's multiple award schedules program pricing problems. In March 1977, we reported that pre-award information on 6 of 15 contract proposals was not accurate, complete, or current. In 1979, we again reported that pricing information submitted by some vendors was unreliable. Moreover, only 1 pre-award audit and 10 postaward audits had been conducted during fiscal years 1977 and 1978 of which 9 found inaccurate sales information had been reported by vendors or the availability of better discounts had not been disclosed. These problems continued throughout the 1980s. In the early 1990s, GSA made good use of pre-award and postaward audits, negotiating nearly $480 million in cost savings and recovering about $90 million in vendor overcharges over 5 years. However, in August 1997, GSA revised its acquisition regulations and effectively eliminated the use of postaward audits. While GSA expected pre-award audits to increase, this increase never materialized. In August 2001, the GSA Inspector General reported that GSA was not consistently negotiating most favored customer pricing. For just one contract, the Inspector General projected that over the contract's term, GSA customers would pay nearly $40 million more than they should have. In February 2005, we completed our most recent review of the multiple award schedules program and found that pricing problems persist and that the number of pre-award audits continued to decline. We concluded that GSA was continuing to miss opportunities to save hundreds of millions of dollars."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the General Services  Administration\u2019s (GSA) use of pre-award and postaward audits in pricing  its multiple award schedules contracts. Each year, federal agencies spend  billions of dollars to buy commercial products and professional services  through GSA\u2019s multiple award schedules program. The program is  designed to take advantage of the government\u2019s significant buying power  when purchasing a wide range of commercially available products\u2014such  as office furniture and supplies, personal computers, and tools\u2014and a  variety of professional services. Through more than 16,000 contracts,  federal agencies can directly purchase more than 8 million products from  more than 10,000 commercial vendors. The multiple award schedules  program has grown significantly over the past several years. In fiscal year  2004, federal agencies purchased more than $32 billion of products and  services through the program.", "To get the most out of each taxpayer dollar, GSA seeks to leverage the  government\u2019s immense buying power by negotiating discounts from the  vendor\u2019s price list that are equal to or greater than the vendor\u2019s most  favored customers. These negotiations have a direct bearing on how  economically government agencies procure products and services. Today,  my statement will focus on GSA\u2019s historic use of two proven negotiation  tools to improve the pricing of schedules contracts\u2014pre-award audits and  postaward audits of pre-award information. Pre-award audits allow GSA  contract negotiators to avoid potential vendor overpricing by verifying  pricing information before contracts are awarded. Postaward audits allow  negotiators to identify overpricing of awarded contracts and recover  overcharges.", "In summary, GSA has used these two key price negotiation tools on a  limited basis. When GSA has used pre-award and postaward audits, it has  been able to avoid or recover hundreds of millions of dollars in  overcharges. In recent years, however, the use of these pricing tools has  declined dramatically\u2014despite dramatic increases in program sales.  Consequently, GSA has less assurance that vendor-supplied pricing  information is accurate, complete, and current, and its ability to deter  overpricing and recover overcharges has been minimized. By delaying  action to address its contract pricing problems, GSA continues to miss  opportunities to minimize prices paid for goods and services and save  significant sums of federal dollars."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["GSA established the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program in 1949 to  facilitate federal agencies\u2019 purchase of common products and services  from commercial vendors through schedule contracts. The multiple award  schedules program, the largest FSS program, was designed to provide  agencies with a simplified method for purchasing varying quantities of a  wide range of commercially available products, such as office furniture  and supplies, personal computers, scientific equipment, network support,  and various professional services. The schedules program provides  advantages to both federal agencies and vendors. By using this simplified  method of procurement, agencies can avoid using other more time- consuming and administratively costly procurement methods. Vendors  receive wider exposure of their commercial products and services and  expend less effort to sell them.", "In administering the multiple award schedules program, GSA is  responsible for ensuring that negotiated prices reflect the government\u2019s  aggregate buying power. GSA contracting officials seek discounts from a  vendor\u2019s price list that are equal to or greater than the vendor\u2019s most  favored customer\u2019s discounts. GSA awards contracts to multiple vendors  supplying comparable commercial products and services. Federal  agencies order products and services directly from the vendors that best  meet their needs. Prices paid by federal agencies include a fee for GSA to  recover program costs, including contract administration and program  support.", "In the mid-1990s, GSA had about 5,200 schedules contracts. By fiscal year  2004, this number had increased to over 16,000 contracts. As the number  of contracts offering products and services to federal agencies increased,  the sales volume skyrocketed. Between fiscal years 1995 and 2004,  program sales increased more than sixfold, from $4.9 billion to about $32.5  billion (see fig. 1).", "Because prices that agencies pay for schedule products and services are  the result of negotiations between GSA and individual vendors, the pricing  of products and services being offered is key to the contract negotiation  process. GSA contracting officials use various tools to analyze vendor  offers and establish negotiation objectives. Tools commonly used include  market research, sales histories, invoices and references, and competitor  price lists. Of all the pricing tools available for contract negotiation, two  tools\u2014pre-award audits and postaward audits of pre-award information\u2014 are specifically designed to protect the government from overpricing. Pre- award audits enable contract negotiators to verify that vendor-supplied  pricing information is accurate, complete, and current before the contract  is awarded. Postaward audits serve as a deterrent to overpricing and a  primary tool for recovering vendor overcharges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historically, GSA Has Not Consistently Made Good Use of Pre-award and Postaward Audits", "paragraphs": ["GSA\u2019s use of pre-award audits and postaward audits of pre-award  information has been sporadic\u2014a finding we have reported for more than  25 years. For example, in March 1977, we reported that although sales  from multiple award schedules contracts amounted to $840 million,  vendor proposals were rarely independently audited and the veracity of  the information submitted was suspect. We found that sales and discount  information submitted on 6 of 15 contract proposals was not accurate,  complete, and current. Further, we found that 25 pre-award audits done in  fiscal years 1973 and 1974 had resulted in recommendations of $962,000 in  savings. Eighteen postaward audits done in the same years resulted in GSA  claims of more than $1.4 million. In 1979, we again reported that price  information submitted by some vendors was unreliable. Also, our  comparison of 29 products available through four states\u2019 annual contracts,  as well as GSA schedules, found that prices were on average 20 percent to  57 percent lower under the state contracts. We estimated that had GSA  obtained the same discounts as did the states, $5.8 million would have  been saved in fiscal year 1978 on purchases of calculators, dictating  equipment, typewriters, and lamps from the same manufacturers.  Moreover, of the 11 audits (1 pre-award and 10 postaward) that had been  done during fiscal years 1977 and 1978, all but 2 found inaccurate sales  information had been reported by vendors or the availability of better  discounts had not been disclosed.", "Pricing problems continued throughout the 1980s, and GSA\u2019s use of pre- award audits and postaward audits of pre-award information was limited.  For example, in 1986, we again reviewed GSA\u2019s price negotiations for the  multiple award schedules program, which at that time consisted of about  3,300 contracts with sales of about $2.3 billion. Our review of 20 contracts  found that while the prices GSA obtained appeared to be fair and  reasonable, action was needed to obtain better prices. On one multiple  award schedules contract, where the vendor did not offer the government  discounts comparable to the most favored customer, a reopening of  contract negotiations resulted in an estimated savings of $1.6 million. We  also found that the number of pre-award audits decreased between fiscal  years 1984 and 1985. The decrease was attributed to reductions in the  Inspector General\u2019s staff, a shift in resources to audits of higher dollar  value contracts, and the change from single-year to multiple year  contracts. In response to our concern about the continuing decline in the  number of pre-award audits, GSA agreed to take actions to provide  adequate audit coverage, including shifting resources from other GSA  offices to the Inspector General\u2019s office, as well as within the office, and  an increase in the Inspector General\u2019s fiscal year 1987 budget.", "In the early 1990s, schedules sales remained relatively stable, ranging  between $4 billion and $5 billion, annually. During this period, GSA  successfully performed a significant number of pre-award and postaward  audits. For example, from fiscal years 1992 through 1996, the GSA  Inspector General conducted 624 pre-award audits\u2014an average of 125  each year. These pre-award audits resulted in nearly $480 million in  negotiated cost savings for GSA\u2019s customers. Additionally, from fiscal  years 1990 through fiscal year 1994, the GSA Inspector General reported  that it recovered an average of $18 million each year in vendor  overcharges. Most of these postaward audit recoveries were the result of  vendor failure to provide accurate, complete, and current information in  the negotiation of their contracts and their failure to report and offer price  reductions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Skyrocketing Sales, Pricing Problems and the Overall Decline in the Use of Pre-award Audits Have Continued", "paragraphs": ["In August 1997, GSA revised its acquisition regulations to expand access to  commercial products and services and implement greater use of  commercial buying practices. As part of this revision, GSA specifically  removed language from the examination of records clause that  automatically granted postaward audit rights for pre-award pricing  information in every schedules contract. To offset the reduction in these  postaward audits, GSA proposed to increase emphasis on the use of pre- award audits. According to GSA, this approach would provide the  contracting officer a mechanism for verifying information submitted by  vendors and avoid pricing problems instead of uncovering problems after  contract award. However, recent GSA Inspector General and GAO reviews  have shown that GSA\u2019s long-standing pricing problems have continued and  the plan to increase the use of pre-award audits never materialized."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Inspector General and GAO Continue to Identify Pricing Problems", "paragraphs": ["In August 2001, the GSA Inspector General reported that while schedules  program sales had grown dramatically, certain program fundamentals\u2014 including pricing objectives and other pricing tools\u2014had been  marginalized.

For example, the Inspector  General reported that a major distributor of information technology  products sold its top 10 GSA-selling models to commercial customers at an  average price that was 6 percent lower than the price offered to federal  agencies.

During this  same 8-year period, schedules sales increased nearly five-fold from about  $6.6 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $32.5 billion in fiscal year 2004.", "As the number of pre-award audits performed continued to decline, so too  did the amount of negotiated cost savings. Between fiscal years 1992 and  1997, the GSA Inspector General reported a total of nearly $496 million in  savings\u2014an average of nearly $83 million per year. Between fiscal years  1998 and 2004, the total savings reported had dropped to about $126  million\u2014an average of only $18 million per year (see fig. 3).", "According to GSA Inspector General and contracting officials, the decline  in pre-award audits was largely due an organizational culture that stresses  making award decisions quickly and because pre-award audits were not  emphasized institutionally in GSA. Also, GSA management officials told us  that they believe increasing the contract length from 1 year in the mid- 1990s to the 5 years of today has also limited pre-award audits because the  number of opportunities for pre-award audits has been reduced. We  believe, however, that the potential for pre-award audits is substantial.  Since the mid-1990s, the number of schedules contracts awarded  increased from about 5,200 in fiscal year 1995 to over 16,000 in fiscal year  2004, significantly increasing the potential for pre-award audits.", "While conducting our review, we tested GSA\u2019s assertion that longer-term  contracts reduced the opportunity for pre-award audits, applying GSA\u2019s  guidance to contract negotiators on when to request audit assistance. As  we reported in February 2005, we found that 71 contracts awarded or  extended in fiscal year 2003 met the pre-award audit threshold, but GSA  only completed 14 pre-award audits\u201457 fewer than we identified as  potential audits. In fiscal year 2004, GSA selected 55 contract offers for  pre-award audits. The GSA Inspector General completed 40 of these  audits.", "In our most recent review, we also found that GSA has not conducted  postaward audits of pre-award information since 1997\u2014when GSA revised  its policy on the use of such audits.

With the dramatic increase in  sales and the continuing decline in pre-award audits, the potential for  significant recoveries of vendor overcharges could be substantial."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent GSA Actions to Improve Price Negotiations", "paragraphs": ["In our February 2005 report, we made three recommendations aimed at  helping GSA ensure that prices are effectively negotiated for schedules  contracts. We recommended that the GSA Administrator (1) ensure that  pre-award audits are conducted when the threshold is met for both new  contract offers and contract extensions, (2) develop guidance to help  contracting officers determine when postaward audits are needed, and    (3) direct GSA program management to revise its quality control program  to (a) determine the underlying causes for contract pricing deficiencies  and (b) develop appropriate plans to implement corrective actions.", "GSA management officials agreed with our recommendations, and stated  that GSA would    continue to work with the Inspector General to increase and improve the  number of pre-award audits,   publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register  to request comments on the role of postaward audit reviews in the  acquisition process, and   evaluate the results of the fiscal year 2004 contract file review and that this  evaluation would involve a discussion and identification of the underlying  reasons for any weaknesses.", "We believe that GSA\u2019s actions are a good first step toward addressing its  long-standing pricing problems with multiple award schedules contracts.
