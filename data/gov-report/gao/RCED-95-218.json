Agriculture contributes more than half the pollutants entering the nation\u2019s rivers and lakes. The threat to water quality posed by nonpoint sources of pollution has prompted renewed interest in watershed-based approaches to reducing such pollution. With this in mind, you asked us to (1) determine the number, purpose, location, and funding of federal watershed projects that address pollution caused by agricultural production and (2) provide information on the lessons learned from selected innovative or successful watershed projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Water pollution comes from two types of sources: (1) specific, single locations, such as industrial waste pipes or sewage treatment plants, known as point sources, or (2) multiple dispersed sources over large areas, such as runoff from farms, ranches, logging operations, and urban areas, known as nonpoint sources. Federal officials believe that significant improvements in water quality can be achieved by reducing nonpoint-source pollution.", "The watershed-based approach to reducing nonpoint-source pollution has been receiving increasing interest. Addressing nonpoint-source pollution throughout a watershed allows consideration of the entire hydrological system, including the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater as well as all sources of pollution. Such an approach leads to a holistic treatment, as opposed to piecemeal efforts aimed at individual pollutants or pollution sources.", "A number of federal agencies have primary roles in watershed projects involving agricultural sources of pollution. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), through its various agencies and programs, provides technical, financial, educational, and research support to a variety of watershed projects. These projects give farmers the knowledge and technical means they need to voluntarily improve water quality in their watersheds. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also provides technical assistance and funds states\u2019 support for watershed projects and other efforts to reduce nonpoint-source pollution. The Department of the Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey provides technical assistance to individual watershed projects, primarily in the areas of research, mapping, and water quality monitoring, while Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service enforces the Endangered Species Act, which provides for the protection and restoration of fish and wildlife habitats\u2014two common goals of watershed projects. The Department of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Marine Fisheries Service, provides technical and financial assistance. Finally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for issuing permits under the Clean Water Act for the discharge of dredged and fill materials into U.S. waters, including wetlands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Watershed Projects Vary in Size, Objectives, and Funding", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, federal agencies identified 618 watershed projects that had received federal funds through early 1995. The projects ranged in size from as few as 5 acres to over 150 million acres; about 60 percent covered less than 80,000 acres. Figure 1 shows the distribution of projects by size.", "The projects were geared toward solving various types of problems. As shown in figure 2, over half of the projects were aimed at surface water, about 7 percent at groundwater, and the remainder at both surface water and groundwater resources. More than 85 percent of the projects addressed multiple types of pollutants, while the rest addressed a single pollutant. As shown in figure 3, nutrients and sediments were the pollution problems most frequently addressed by the watershed projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Flexibility and Locally Driven Approaches Are Key to Managing Nine Agricultural Watershed Projects", "paragraphs": ["The common experiences of the nine projects we looked at suggest that achieving success in watershed-based approaches depends on (1) the flexible application of federal assistance and (2) the ability of local officials to enlist broad support and to craft solutions customized to their local needs. At the federal level, participants believed that financial and technical assistance tailored to locally established goals was more effective than prescriptive solutions. At the local level, they identified education, stakeholders\u2019 involvement, and a customized approach to improving water quality as the keys to a successful project."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Participants Favor Flexible Federal Role", "paragraphs": ["Since each watershed project has unique local characteristics, participants emphasized that federal agencies should adopt a flexible approach, providing funding and technical assistance without prescriptive solutions. In some cases, inflexible federal rules hampered the funding and execution of solutions to watershed problems.", "Each project we reviewed combined and addressed such characteristics as the type and source of the pollutant, local agricultural practices, impacts, and the community\u2019s attitudes. For example, both the Big Spring Basin and the Tar-Pamlico River Basin projects were initiated to reduce pollution resulting from nutrients. However, the Big Spring Basin project addresses groundwater contamination from agricultural sources, while the Tar-Pamlico River Basin project addresses surface water contamination from municipal and industrial sources in addition to agricultural sources. An approach to mitigating agricultural discharges that would improve water quality at Big Spring Basin would likely have to be modified in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin to mitigate municipal and industrial discharges and would have to take into account that pollutants reach surface water and groundwater in different ways. Similarly, both the Coos Bay-Coquille River and West Stanislaus County watersheds faced problems resulting from erosion. In the Coos Bay-Coquille River project, the erosion was caused by a combination of timber and agricultural practices, while in West Stanislaus the erosion was caused by the runoff of irrigation water. As a result, the two projects need different strategies to reduce erosion. In addition, the Coos Bay-Coquille River project addressed other problems, such as elevated water temperatures, that were not present in West Stanislaus.", "Because of these combinations of various characteristics, the projects\u2019 participants said that flexible program implementation is crucial to achieving watershed goals. Watershed projects frequently depend on multiple sources of funding and technical assistance obtained through different state and federal programs, each with different requirements. Federal assistance to the nine projects represented about half of the projects\u2019 resources. Agency staff involved in most of the projects we reviewed demonstrated flexibility in working with other participants to meet project goals. For example, USDA and EPA representatives involved in the Huichica Creek project emphasized that they had to find creative ways to work within their respective agencies\u2019 regulations to devise effective strategies and encourage participation by producers. Similarly, participants in the West Stanislaus project said that a key to putting together an effective program was the willingness of federal officials to focus on the overall goal of the watershed project rather than their individual programs.", "However, in several of the projects we reviewed, the participants also pointed out a need for increased levels of and greater flexibility in the financial assistance provided to farmers. For example:", "Participants in the West Stanislaus County, Lake Champlain, and Tar-Pamlico River Basin projects said that changes are needed to (1) provide additional funding to farmers for adopting practices that reduce nonpoint-source pollution and (2) separate funding for improving water quality from funding for agricultural conservation. According to participants, the annual $3,500-per-farmer maximum placed on Agricultural Conservation Program funding is inadequate to support some of the structural measures needed to reduce nonpoint-source pollution. Furthermore, as currently structured, provisions for cost-sharing cover a variety of agricultural conservation practices, including those, such as leveling land for irrigation and building irrigation canals, that may be more related to water conservation and increased crop production than to efforts to improve water quality. Farmers could apply the $3,500 to practices that increase their yield rather than to practices that reduce agricultural pollution but are of no financial benefit. Efforts to reduce nonpoint pollution from agricultural sources can be hindered when competing conservation goals result in applying cost-sharing funds to practices that have little or no direct relationship to water quality.", "Participants in the Huichica Creek project pointed out that USDA\u2019s Small Watershed Program, which is primarily geared toward flood control, provides funding for solutions that are unnecessarily complex. For the problems at Huichica Creek, the solutions eligible for funding would cost far more than the simpler solutions the participants used. For example, USDA staff and landowners wanted to stabilize stream banks to minimize erosion, but they believed USDA\u2019s solution of lining stream banks with rocks was too expensive. Instead, they found that planting young saplings low on the exposed stream bank and interweaving their branches to create a living reinforcement was a much cheaper approach.", "Participants in the West Stanislaus project said the funds received under USDA\u2019s Hydrologic Unit Area program cannot be used for monitoring water quality, and participants in the Coos Bay-Coquille River and the Otter Lake projects noted that funds received under section 319 of the Clean Water Act could not be used for the planning and additional demonstration activities they needed.", "The projects\u2019 participants also stressed the need for flexibility in the role federal agencies play in providing technical assistance to help farmers implement pollution-reduction practices. USDA staff served on the technical advisory committee for the Otter Lake project, although the overall approach was set by the project\u2019s resource planning committee. In the West Stanislaus County project, USDA staff took a more active role, writing the project plan that established the implementation approach as well as identifying an innovative technical solution: using polymers in irrigation systems to reduce sediment runoff. In addition, USDA provided a sociologist to help develop approaches that would maximize voluntary participation.", "However, inflexible federal processes were also cited by some participants. For example, in voicing concern over rigid agency procedures and operating methods, Coos Bay-Coquille River project and state government officials said it took 9 months to obtain a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers (which regulates the disposal of dredged and fill material from wetlands) to build an off-channel pond and to spread the few cubic yards of earth removed in the process over a pasture. Project officials said they could not understand why it took so long to get a permit for such a simple project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participants Favor Locally Driven Approach", "paragraphs": ["The nine innovative or successful projects we reviewed were able to adopt a locally driven approach to achieving the goals for the watersheds. Key elements in a local approach were educating prospective participants about how water quality improvements would benefit them; achieving consensus among these stakeholders in selecting a project\u2019s goals and approaches; and tailoring the project\u2019s strategy, water quality monitoring, and regulatory enforcement to local conditions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Educating Prospective Participants", "paragraphs": ["Education and public outreach played an important role in encouraging cooperation in many of the projects we reviewed. Farm demonstration projects and myriad educational activities were used to familiarize farmers and the general public with the relationship between agricultural or other activities and water quality problems and to encourage the adoption of practices designed to reduce these problems.", "The Big Spring Basin project in Iowa, for example, used an intensive strategy of public education and farm demonstration projects to introduce farmers to management practices that would improve their efficiency and profitability while also reducing the impacts of agriculture on water quality in the watershed. According to participating farmers, the opportunity to observe\u2014through a manure management demonstration project on a neighbor\u2019s farm\u2014that nutrients could be reduced gave them the knowledge and confidence they needed to change their own manure management practices.", "In the Lake Champlain project, a great deal of effort is being expended to inform the public about the water quality problems affecting the lake and to encourage the community\u2019s involvement. Educational and outreach activities include public meetings, the formation of grassroots environmental groups, videos, newsletters, school presentations, and water quality fairs. Similarly, the Coos Bay-Coquille River project, recognizing the role of future generations, has developed a high school curriculum to help students better understand the watershed they live in and the potential impact their activities have on water quality.", "Public education can also involve less structured efforts. For example, the Coos Bay-Coquille River and Huichica Creek project staffs noted that they spent a lot of time meeting with potential participants informally, answering questions and concerns over a cup of coffee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieving Consensus Among Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["In addition to achieving public awareness, projects need to solicit stakeholders\u2019 consensus on goals and approaches, according to participants. Watershed projects typically involve a variety of stakeholders, often having different views about a project\u2019s appropriate scope, approach, and management. The stakeholders may include the government agencies responsible for environmental issues or land management; agricultural, timber, fishery, mining, or other commercial industries; recreational users; municipalities; and urban homeowners. For most of the projects we reviewed, participants agreed that broad-based participation by stakeholders is critical in breaking down barriers and building trust among groups. We noted in several projects that respected community leaders with strong interpersonal skills were instrumental in bringing the stakeholders together.", "One example of successful consensus building is the Coos Bay-Coquille River project, which was managed by associations comprising representatives of timber companies, private landowners, federal land management agencies, state agencies with water and habitat responsibilities, and other interested parties. According to association members, inclusion of the agricultural community in the watershed associations helped members of that community overcome their general distrust of government regulation and negative attitudes about \u201cenvironmental\u201d initiatives, emanating from federal activities to protect the spotted owl and salmon, which local citizens blamed for harming the local economy.", "Projects that impose solutions without getting stakeholders\u2019 buy-in have a greater difficulty in achieving success, as illustrated by the experiences of the Tar-Pamlico River Basin project in North Carolina. The project used a two-phase process to address nutrient pollution. The project\u2019s organizers used public hearings to obtain input from those in the watershed and negotiation and consensus to reach agreement on the implementation strategy and water quality goals. Although this worked well for the first phase, the process broke down during the negotiations in the second phase. The state ultimately approved phase two of the project over the objections of environmental and community groups, which disagreed with (1) the goals for reducing nutrients, (2) the allocation of most of the burden for the reduction to nonpoint sources, and (3) the revised formula used to determine the amount of funds that point-source dischargers would contribute to reduce nonpoint-source pollution in an innovative nutrient credit trading program. Under this program, point-source dischargers agreed to contribute to a nutrient credit trading fund whenever they exceeded the discharge limits. The fund would be used to finance more cost-effective actions to reduce nutrient pollution from agricultural nonpoint sources. However, environmental and community groups felt that concessions made to point-source dischargers in the agreement in phase two shifted too much of the financial burden of improving water quality to the agricultural community. Unless steps are taken to address the misgivings of these groups, a key stakeholder is contemplating a lawsuit against the state to block this phase of the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tailoring Strategies, Monitoring, and Enforcement to Local Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The experiences of successful projects illustrate that strategies, water quality monitoring, and regulatory enforcement efforts vary, depending on local conditions. For instance, while all the projects generally engaged in some form of planning to ensure that stakeholders agreed on the causes of the problem and the corrective actions needed, they devoted different levels of time, effort, and funding to developing such plans. For example, the Lake Champlain project staff spent significant time identifying the cause of that area\u2019s water quality problem before developing a watershed strategy. They systematically monitored the water quality in rivers and streams feeding into the lake, which allowed them to gradually pinpoint the sources of the problem. In contrast, for the Coos Bay-Coquille River project, which is smaller and has less complex problems, a lengthy planning process was not necessary. The community agreed that sediment and riparian (riverbank) destruction in the Coquille watershed were impeding fish spawning and that the salmon fishery was a resource they wanted to save. They quickly established goals for improving the salmon population and measured progress using fish counts.", "Similarly, implementation strategies varied according to local conditions and preferences. The Big Spring Basin project, for example, heavily emphasized demonstration and educational activities, whereas the Big Darby Creek project undertook relatively few demonstration projects, preferring instead to provide funds to support individual farmers\u2019 practices. The Big Darby Creek project also took advantage of a state program that provides low-interest loans to those who implement solutions for nonpoint-source pollution. The Tar-Pamlico River Basin project developed the innovative nutrient credit trading program described previously, which meets the overall goal for reducing the discharge of nutrients by allowing the point-source dischargers to finance the reduction of discharges from nonpoint sources.", "While all participants agreed on the importance of evaluating a project\u2019s performance, they tailored the rigor of their evaluations to the project\u2019s goals. The Coos Bay-Coquille River projects used fish counts to monitor progress, and the West Stanislaus project used sediment assessments, which were easily accomplished by viewing the color of the farms\u2019 agricultural drain water. In contrast, the Big Spring Basin project had over 50 sites to monitor groundwater flow, conductivity, alkalinity, temperature, nitrates, and pesticides.", "The projects\u2019 participants pointed out, however, that even given rigorous monitoring, demonstrating a link between changes in land use and diminished chemical pollution is difficult, if not impossible, especially within a short time frame. For example, participants in the Lake Champlain, Tar-Pamlico River Basin, and Big Darby Creek projects noted that current science can demonstrate only a tenuous link between land use practices and water quality, and it may take years for their projects to produce chemical improvements in water quality. Similarly, participants in the Big Spring Basin project said that climatic variations, such as droughts followed by years of heavy rainfall, and other factors have made it difficult to establish a link between changes in farming practices and groundwater quality, despite more than 10 years of monitoring and analysis.", "All nine watershed projects we reviewed are striving to promote voluntary participation by farmers, but several felt it was also necessary to provide for regulatory enforcement in case cooperation was lacking. Three states\u2014Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Illinois\u2014and two projects have included regulatory components in their watershed management strategies. Wisconsin has enacted statutes that provide for state enforcement actions, such as revoking cost-share agreements, against uncooperative individuals. North Carolina requires the adoption of certain best management practices. Illinois allows public water suppliers to use watershed management strategies to comply with safe drinking water standards, but if compliance is not accomplished within specified time frames, contingency measures must be implemented. In the West Stanislaus project, one water district, which is responsible for managing irrigation canals and maintaining water quality within its jurisdiction, can withhold irrigation water from farmers who refuse to adopt practices that reduce sedimentary runoff from their fields. In the Huichica Creek project, participants voluntarily developed additional restrictions on the use of certain pesticides, which EPA approved for inclusion on the labels of pesticides sold in the Huichica Creek area. At some projects, such regulatory provisions were considered unnecessary and in fact counterproductive. For example, the environmental members of the Coos Bay-Coquille River and the Lake Champlain projects said voluntary efforts were the most feasible way of reducing nonpoint-source pollution, given their communities\u2019 resistance to regulatory enforcement."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We discussed the facts in this report with USDA officials, including the Special Assistant, Strategic Natural Resources Issues Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and with EPA officials, including the Deputy Director, Assessment and Watershed Protection Division, Office of Water.

They felt this approach was not sufficient to preserve and enhance the diversity of plants and wildlife in a way compatible with agricultural operations. Furthermore, they believed the solutions arrived at through that process were overengineered for their situation.

First, landowners were heavily involved in developing the plan and were therefore disposed to implement the recommended practices. Second, having 90 percent (63 of 70) of the Huichica Creek landowners involved in the stewardship facilitated communication and fostered a sense of community.

First, USDA staff and the project\u2019s participants agreed that the involvement of the members of the Conservation District\u2019s Board of Directors, who are well-known and respected farmers, was a key to garnering local support. If outsiders come into the community with solutions, local farmers are skeptical, because they believe each farm is unique in its combination of crops, soils, and management techniques. Second, to discover how to motivate local farmers to participate in the project, a USDA sociologist was used to develop enlistment strategies and estimate the farmers\u2019 participation rates. Although participants were initially skeptical, many felt that the sociologist was very helpful in understanding the social and economic currents that contributed to the project\u2019s success. Third, participants\u2019 ability to see reductions in erosion with their own eyes helped increase participation. USDA staff developed a guide that shows the color of irrigation drain water at three sediment levels: 300 milligrams of soil per liter, 1,000 milligrams of soil per liter, and 9,000 milligrams of soil per liter. Farmers can easily determine whether they are meeting the goal of 300 milligrams, as well as observe whether their neighbors are meeting it.", "Financial assistance also helped increase participation, but cost-sharing ceilings and inflexible requirements limited its usefulness. USDA staff noted that farming is viewed as a financially risky occupation; thus, farmers are reluctant to adopt new, unproven practices that could threaten their profit margin. They said that USDA\u2019s cost-sharing program helped mitigate the financial impact of new practices, but farmers are limited to $3,500 per year in cost-sharing assistance. Some farmers told us that this hindered the effectiveness of the program because many of the practices recommended by the USDA technical experts, such as installing irrigation piping that can control water flow, require significant financial outlays.", "After the plan was developed, USDA staff learned of a new technique that could help reduce sediment but is not eligible for cost-sharing funding. Adding a polymer to the irrigation water causes the sediment to settle out much faster, reducing erosion runoff from the fields. The polymer has been used in water treatment plants for years but has not yet been approved for agricultural use.
