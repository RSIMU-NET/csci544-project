Army and Air Force have led within DOD in assessing core functions, but the Army has done the most, and found, contrary to its expectations, that distinguishing between core and non-core functions does not, by itself, prescribe a sourcing decision. Other factors must also be considered such as risk and operational considerations. The range of alternatives to A-76 likely to be pursued under the core competency-based approach is not yet clear, but DOD has made some progress toward identifying and/or using some alternatives through pilot projects and other efforts by the services as they have focused on the core initiative. However, the use of alternatives could be limited without special legislative authorities and/or repeal of various existing prohibitions, and some could be tempered by the department's efforts to meet the A-76 competitive sourcing goals set by OMB. DOD reported that as of June 1, 2003, it has met OMB's short-term goal to use the A-76 process to study 15 percent of the positions identified in DOD's commercial activities inventory by the end of fiscal year 2003. However, meeting the longer-term goal to study at least 50 percent (226,000) of its nearly 453,000 commercial activity positions through fiscal year 2008 will present a challenge. This is nearly double the number of positions that DOD has previously studied during a comparable time period, and providing sufficient resources (financial and technical) to complete the studies may prove challenging. Also, the defense components, particularly the Air Force, plan to transfer certain military personnel into warfighting functions and replace them with government civilian and/or contractor personnel. This will require the components to reprioritize their funding for operation and maintenance accounts, because it is from those accounts the services must fund replacement civilian or contractor personnel."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is currently examining a core  competency-based approach for making sourcing decisions\u2014that is, the  decision to use a public or private sector source to perform a necessary  agency function or activity based on whether the function or activity is  core to the agency\u2019s mission. This is one of the business transformation  initiatives that have been endorsed by one of DOD\u2019s high-level  management committees, the Senior Executive Council. It believes that  the department should focus its energies and talents on those functions  that are core or directly linked to its warfighting mission, and which must  be performed by the agency, with the expectation that necessary products  or services associated with non-core functions should be obtained from  other government agencies or the private sector.", "In determining how to best perform non-core functions, DOD\u2019s  position is that its components should look beyond just the use of  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, with its focus  on public-private competitions, in making sourcing decisions. It has  expressed interest in examining the use of other alternatives, such  as public-private partnering, transferring functions to other agencies,  employee stock ownerships, and quasi-government corporations.  Nevertheless, Circular A-76 remains an important tool for making  sourcing decisions for non-inherently governmental functions typically  involving commercially available services. Also, A-76 competitive sourcing  is a major initiative under the President\u2019s Management Agenda and OMB  has set ambitious goals for those competitions.", "At your request, we examined DOD\u2019s plans for sourcing non-core  functions and the effect this may have on its A-76 program. Accordingly,  we assessed (1) the department\u2019s progress in assessing its core functions  as a basis for sourcing decisions, (2) the plans and progress DOD has  made in identifying and implementing alternatives to A-76, and (3) the  current status of DOD\u2019s A-76 program.", "In performing work for this review, we obtained and analyzed plans  available from DOD and its components for assessing non-core functions  and identifying alternate sourcing approaches, and reviewed relevant  documents from DOD agencies. We met with officials from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine  Corps, the Defense Logistics Agency, and other organizations to obtain  information on their sourcing programs and efforts to identify alternative  sourcing options. The A-76 data used in this report are derived from a  Web-based DOD commercial activities database; we did not validate  the information in this database. Further details on our scope and  methodology are included at the end of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1955, the executive branch has encouraged federal agencies to  obtain commercially available goods and services from the private sector  when the agencies determined that such action was cost-effective. OMB  formalized the policy in its Circular A-76, issued in 1966. In 1979, OMB  supplemented the circular with a handbook that included procedures  for competitively determining whether commercial activities should be  performed in-house, by another federal agency through an Interservice  Support Agreement, or by the private sector. OMB has updated this  handbook three times since 1979. An extensive revision to Circular A-76  was issued on May 29, 2003, based in part on the recent work of the  congressionally mandated Commercial Activities Panel.", "Under the newly revised circular, agencies may convert commercial  activities to or from contractor performance through a public-private  competition, whereby the estimated cost of public or private performance  of the function is evaluated against published selection criteria in  accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the circular.", "As part of this process, the government identifies the work to be  performed in a \u201cperformance work statement,\u201d prepares an in-house offer  which includes its most efficient organization, and compares all the offers  against each other and the selection criteria. The revised circular provides  several alternative procedures for conducting source selections, only  one of which allow agencies to select a contract based on other than the  lowest cost technically acceptable offer. The four source selection  alternatives are: sealed bid, lowest price technically acceptable, phased  evaluation, and, in certain cases, trade-off (which permits agencies to  weigh cost and non-cost factors).", "Administrative and legislative constraints from the late 1980s through  1995 resulted in a lull\u2014and even a moratorium\u2014on awarding contracts  resulting from A-76 competitions. In 1995, congressional and  administration initiatives placed more emphasis on A-76 as a means of  achieving greater economies and efficiencies in operations. Beginning  about 1995, DOD began to give renewed emphasis to the use of A-76  competitive sourcing under Circular A-76. More recently, competitive  sourcing has received governmentwide attention, as one of five initiatives  of the President\u2019s Management Agenda for fiscal year 2002. DOD has been  a leader among federal agencies in using A-76 in recent years.", "The revised circular requires agencies to prepare two annual inventories  that categorize all activities performed by government personnel as either  commercial or inherently governmental. A similar requirement was  included in the 1998 Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act,  which directs agencies to develop annual inventories of their positions  that are not inherently governmental. DOD\u2019s 2000 FAIR Act inventory  identified nearly 453,000 in-house civilian positions engaged in a variety  of commercial activities, nearly 260,000 of which have been, or are, subject  to competition or direct conversion under Circular A-76. The number  of positions subject to A-76 is less than the total number of positions in  commercial activities because DOD made adjustments to exclude certain  commercial activities from being considered eligible for competition;  they included such reasons as statutory, national security, or operational  considerations. Under the President\u2019s Management Agenda, OMB has  directed agencies to directly convert or compete through cost comparison  studies 15 percent of their total fiscal year 2000 inventories of commercial  activities by the end of fiscal year 2003, with the ultimate goal of  competing at least 50 percent of their inventories by the end of fiscal  year 2008.", "In providing guidance for determining whether activities and functions,  and associated positions are considered to be inherently governmental in  nature, DOD has sometimes equated the term \u201cinherently governmental\u201d  with the somewhat parallel term \u201ccore.\u201d While use of the term \u201ccore\u201d is  associated with the private sector, DOD has sometimes used the term to  designate military and civilian essential positions required for military and  national security reasons. The old A-76 Handbook provided yet another,  but similar, meaning for core. In the context of A-76, core capability was  defined as \u201ca commercial activity operated by a cadre of highly skilled  employees, in a specialized technical or scientific development area to  ensure that a minimum capability is maintained.\u201d", "The concept of core in DOD has also been associated with legislative  requirements to establish core logistics capabilities in government-owned  military maintenance depots. This process is based on a requirement  contained in 10 U.S.C. 2464 to identify and maintain within government- owned and \u2013operated facilities a core logistics capability including the  equipment, personnel, and technical competence required to maintain  weapon systems identified as necessary for national defense emergencies  and contingencies. Regardless of usage, determinations of core and  inherently governmental functions within DOD have often been viewed as  somewhat subjective in nature.", "The term \u201ccore function\u201d recently has gained increased and more  expanded use within DOD, beginning with DOD\u2019s publication of its  September 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review Report, which  recommended the identification of core and non-core functions.  According to the report, \u201conly those functions that must be performed  by DOD should be kept by DOD. Any function that can be provided by  the private sector is not a core government function.\u201d The test to separate  core and non-core functions would be to determine whether a function is  directly necessary for warfighting, according to the report.", "Further emphasis on assessing core functions subsequently came from  DOD\u2019s Senior Executive Council, which, in April 2002, launched a  departmentwide effort to distinguish between core and non-core functions  with an emphasis on retaining in-house only those functions deemed core  to the warfighting mission. Under this approach, it tasked the defense  components with developing plans to transition non-core functions to  alternative sourcing arrangements or A-76 studies, if appropriate, as soon  as possible. In advocating the use of alternatives, the Senior Executive  Council noted that A-76 cost comparisons were lengthy, expensive, and  hard on the workforce. Examples of alternate sourcing strategies cited by  the Council included public-private partnering, employee stock ownership,  and quasi-governmental organizations. Details about these and other  alternatives can be found at appendix I. While use of A-76 studies was still  permitted, emphasis was expected to be given to identifying alternate  sourcing approaches that might be used to transfer non-core functions out  of the department.", "Much publicity to this new core emphasis surrounded Army\u2019s efforts  under its program, which it designated as \u201cthe Third Wave.\u201d The term  \u201cThird Wave\u201d was used to distinguish this current effort from two previous  sourcing efforts under A-76, the first occurring largely in the 1980s and  the second beginning in the 1996-97 time period. Unlike the earlier two  waves, which focused on A-76 studies of about 25,000 and 33,000 positions  respectively, the scope of the Third Wave was to be significantly larger,  potentially involving over 200,000 positions. This was of significant  concern to government employees after several years of A-76 study efforts  within DOD. The Army\u2019s program also received much public attention  because of what Army officials have characterized as an unrelated, but  parallel, effort to have a contractor (RAND) study options for rethinking  governance of the Army\u2019s arsenals and manufacturing plants. The Army  has subsequently indicated it does not plan to pursue the options outlined  in that study which ranged from privatization to creation of a federal  government corporation to operate these facilities. On March 24, 2003,  the Secretary of the Army directed that other action plans be developed  to deal with these facilities.

The article provides  several examples of corporations that identified their core competencies,  helping them to become more successful than their competitors. The  authors likened a diversified corporation to a business tree. For example,  the trunk and major limbs are core products; the smaller branches are  business units. While admitting this concept is difficult to apply to DOD,  the Senior Executive Council nonetheless translated that business tree to  a military application\u2014the core services were described as the set of  activities that actually contribute to the value of the end product (land,  sea, and air operations), the business units were the units of a component  command, the end products were military effects, and the customer was  the combatant commander employing forces and resources.", "In adapting the definition of \u201ccore\u201d from the Harvard Business Review  article to the DOD environment, the Senior Executive Council defined  core as \u201cA complex harmonization of individual technologies and  \u2018production\u2019 (employment, delivery) skills that create unique military  capabilities valued by the force employing !\u201d Several  additional definitions were provided in the Council\u2019s April 2002 memo to  help clarify the reader\u2019s understanding of the definition (see app. III).  According to the memo, however, there are three themes common to each  definition: (1) the knowledge and experience acquired by people, (2) the  discrete and finite set of technologies the people employ, and (3) the  business objectives to be achieved. It stated that DOD\u2019s business objective  to be achieved is warfare.", "The Senior Executive Council\u2019s memo also provided some criteria for  determining core competencies. According to the Council, a core  competency    has potential application to a wide variety of national security needs,    provides a significant contribution to the combatant commander\u2019s    would be difficult for competitors to imitate,    provides the means to differentiate from competitors,    crosses organizational boundaries within an enterprise,  is a direct contributor to the perceived value of the service,    does not diminish with use,    deploys with forces, and    provides training and experience that forms the basis of ethos and culture.", "The memo also noted that these criteria are not \u201cpass/fail\u201d criteria. That is,  some criteria may help to identify core competencies while others may  not, and that these criteria are based on business concepts that have  been adapted to the military domain. Furthermore, the memo stressed  the importance of senior leadership judgment in identifying core  competencies.", "According to various officials, the lack of a clear and concise definition of  the terms related to the core concept initially made it difficult for the Army  and Air Force to apply the core concept to their functions. Both services  have subsequently supplemented the Senior Executive Council definitions  with their own internal documents and specific guidance, which are  discussed in the next sections. That notwithstanding, the definition of  core remains somewhat broad in nature and subjective, and will likely  remain so in the future. The Navy and Marine Corps have only recently  begun their efforts to identify core functions, and have not yet sought to  develop additional guidance. A Defense Logistics Agency official told us  they did not use any additional guidance.", "DOD and service officials told us that while the concepts \u201cinherently  governmental\u201d and \u201ccore\u201d are similar and may overlap, they may not  always be the same. Specifically, not all inherently governmental functions  would be considered core, nor would all core functions be designated  inherently governmental. For example, according to Army analysis,  many civil functions performed by the Army Corps of Engineers, such  as wetlands regulation and eminent domain authority, are inherently  governmental, but they are not core to the Army\u2019s mission. Conversely, we  were told, certain medical services provided by doctors and nurses in the  operating forces are not deemed to be inherently governmental; however,  these services are considered to be core to the Army\u2019s mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress on Identifying Core Functions Has Varied", "paragraphs": ["The Senior Executive Council directed the services and defense agencies  to inventory their organizations and identify their core functions, but only  the Army and Air Force have made much progress in doing so.

The Air Force also  initiated a core competency review, which focused predominately on  military positions. The Navy and Marine Corps are in the early stages of  assessing their core functions. The Defense Logistics Agency broadly  identified its core and non-core competencies, but has not identified  specific positions as core or non-core."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army Efforts Recently Completed", "paragraphs": ["The Army has recently completed an effort to identify its core and  non-core functions for over 200,000 positions. Initially, the Army\u2019s Third  Wave program assumed that all commercial positions were non-core and  thus potential candidates for performance by the private sector or other  government agencies. However, it permitted its components to request  exemption from the non-core designation and, as a result, considered  appeals involving numerous functional areas. Some were sustained while  others were not. The results of this process differed somewhat from the  Army\u2019s initial expectations that all non-core functions could be subject to  competition or alternate sourcing, and the number of positions likely to be  subject to alternate sourcing is not yet clear.", "In permitting its components to present a case for functions to be exempt  from the non-core designation, the Army provided specific guidance on the  submission of exemption requests and the factors to be used to evaluate  those requests. An exemption request needed to provide a compelling case  that a non-core designation could pose substantial and specific risks to  core warfighting missions or would violate a statutory requirement  affecting a function. The Army components submitted 24 requests for  exemption from non-core designation, each representing one or more  broad functional areas. For example, these areas included civilian  personnel, installation management, law enforcement and criminal  investigations, and both military and civilian career progression activities.", "The Army\u2019s authority for reviewing and approving core-competency  exemption requests was the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower  and Reserve Affairs. In evaluating the exemption requests, the Office of  Manpower and Reserve Affairs supplemented the Senior Executive  Council\u2019s definitions of core with six core competencies identified by the  Army in Army Field Manual 1 and other documents. The six competencies  were depicted as:    Shape the security environment\u2014provide a military presence.    Prompt response\u2014provide a broad range of land power options to shape  the security environment and respond to natural or manmade crises  worldwide.", "Forcible entry operations\u2014provide access to contested areas worldwide.

However,  in many instances a mixed decision was rendered regarding individual  functions within a broad functional area. This is illustrated by the Army\u2019s  determination of core competencies for two functions\u2014medical services  and information resources.", "In making its decisions, Army officials determined that medical activities  could be considered core in some circumstances and non-core in others.  The Army also found that, in some cases, functions considered to be  core\u2014such as information resources\u2014contained elements that were  designated non-core.", "The Army determined that many medical functions are core to the Army\u2019s  mission even though they are not classified as inherently governmental.  The Army recognizes that medical functions do not require unique military  knowledge or skills or recent experience in the operating forces to be  performed. However, for troops deployed in theater (i.e., a war zone),  medical functions do need to be performed by in-house personnel because  reliance on host nation contracting for medical support could place  significant risks on the Army forces. The Army has determined that the  in-theater medical mission is a critical element of the Army\u2019s ability to  accomplish its core competencies. Even so, certain functions within the  medical area can be considered both core and non-core. For example,  the optical fabrication function\u2014which is the ability to produce eyewear  (replacement spectacles and protective mask inserts)\u2014is considered a  core competency in support of the operational forces close to the point of  need in the area of engagement. However, this same function performed in  the United States is not considered to be a core competency, and the Army  states that this function may be reviewed for divestiture or privatization.", "Within the information resources function, the Army considers the  management of information resources in a network-centric, knowledge- based workforce to be a core warfighting competency. This core  competency includes information operations that support operating  forces, and utilizes commercial technology adapted for military  applications. Organizations and personnel performing functions that  ensure command, control, and communications interoperability across  Army, joint, interagency, and coalition forces are core functions and need  to be kept in-house. However, other information resource functions\u2014such  as help-desk services\u2014are deemed to be non-core and can be considered  for possible outsourcing.", "Army officials said they recognized that once the determination was  made that a function was considered to be core or non-core to the Army\u2019s  mission, the sourcing of the function would, in many instances, require  additional analysis to determine the amount of core capability to be kept  in-house and the risk the Army might face by sourcing the function. The  types of risk to be considered in evaluating impacts upon a core mission  are force management, operational, future challenges, and institutional.  Additional factors must also be considered. For example, the Army  determined that its casualty and mortuary affairs function is not a core  mission, nor is it an inherently governmental function. However, national  policy dictates that Army officials notify families of a casualty in person.", "Overall, the Army found the results of its review were somewhat contrary  to its, and the Senior Executive Council\u2019s, initial expectation that all  non-core functions should be subject to competition or alternative  sourcing. As noted previously, the Army found the designation of \u201ccore\u201d  does not necessarily indicate military or government civilian performance  is required or necessarily precludes competitive sourcing of the function.  That is, a designation of \u201cnon-core\u201d does not automatically mean that a  function can, or should, be contracted out\u2014other factors must also be  considered. As a result, this has led to some uncertainty regarding how  and to what extent the results of the Army\u2019s core analyses will be used in  sourcing decisions and this potentially has implications for other Defense  components as well. While at this point, the Army is still deciding how to  proceed with implementing the results of its core assessments, Army  officials told us that the core decisions would be reflected in the Army\u2019s  2003 FAIR Act inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Efforts Focus on Military Positions", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force focused its initial core competency review predominately  on military positions. This was done because the Air Force wanted to  identify functions performed by military personnel that might be  realigned for civilian or contractor performance, thus permitting affected  military personnel to be reassigned to operational areas where shortages  of military personnel existed. All military positions were reviewed in  terms of three main core competencies and six distinctive capabilities.  The three institutional core competencies were depicted as:    Developing Airmen (the heart of combat capability).

Our prior work has identified various instances where personnel costs are  generally less for civilian personnel than for military. An additional  4,477 military positions were identified for possible future realignment  through other reengineering efforts, such as adjusting the manpower  requirements process and conducting a business case analysis for  alternative installation support practices, for a total of 22,277 military  positions. Because many of the functions reviewed involved both military  and civilian personnel, an additional 8,900 Air Force civilian positions  were identified for possible conversion to contractor performance. An Air  Force official stated that the service hopes to do a more in-depth review  on the civilian side in the future; however, at the moment, none is planned.  The Air Force expects the number of positions that can be competed in its  FAIR Act inventory will be increased as a result of this review.", "In the near-term, as a direct result of the core function review, the  Air Force has indicated it plans to outsource a significant portion of  the workload of its Pentagon Communications Agency currently  performed by over 400 military personnel.

To  move military positions to operational warfighting positions, additional  government civilian or contractor personnel would be needed to replace  the military personnel. Air Force officials told us that moving the military  personnel out of non-core functions is a high priority, but because of the  high cost involved in adding funds to the operations and maintenance  appropriation account to pay for replacement civilian or contractor  positions, it is currently an unfunded priority. They recently estimated  this additional cost to be about $5 billion over the next 5 years. Moreover,  in its internal budget planning documents for fiscal year 2004, the  Air Force stated that its number one unfunded priority is funding  ($2.34 billion) for moving the initial 6,300 military positions out of  non-core functions.

(A description of the ongoing pioneer  projects can be found in app. IV.)", "The projects propose to use a variety of alternatives, including partnering  and divestiture, and are in varying stages of implementation, as noted in  appendix IV. For example, the Army previously developed a partnership  with the city of Monterey, California, to provide municipal services  needed for the operation of DOD assets in Monterey County. Because of  the success of this project, the Army submitted legislation to Congress  that would allow contracting for municipal services defense-wide. In  another example, the Navy has identified optical (eyewear) fabrication  as a potential candidate for divestiture, because that service is readily  available in the private sector. However, this project is still in the  conceptual phase and no decision will be made until a thorough analysis  has been completed to determine the most appropriate sourcing method.", "DOD was required to go to OMB for approval of these Pioneer Projects to  determine if they would count toward the competitive sourcing goals set  by OMB. The criteria for OMB approval required that projects involve an  element of divestiture, competition, or the transfer of responsibility to  other private or public sector performers. The two pilot Pioneer Projects  that were not approved by OMB had proposed using reengineering or  the development of most efficient organizations as an alternative to A-76  competition. These two projects were not approved because they neither  involved the divestiture of responsibility for performing the function nor  contained a near-term element of competition. DOD officials withdrew  two others because they believed timing was not appropriate for those  actions.", "In responding to OMB\u2019s draft of its most recent revision to Circular A-76,  we stressed the importance of considering alternative approaches to  accomplishing agency missions. Such approaches encompass a wide range  of options, including restructuring, privatizing, transferring functions to  state and local governments, terminating obsolete functions, and creating  public-private partnerships. Given that these options can result in  improved efficiency and enhanced performance, we recommended at  that time that OMB continue to encourage agencies to consider these  and other alternatives to A-76 competition. The revised circular allows  agencies to deviate from certain requirements of the circular with prior  written approval from OMB. For example, agencies are permitted to  explore innovative alternatives, including public-private partnerships,  public-public partnerships, and high performing organizations, with prior  written approval from OMB for a specific competition.", "In addition to these Pioneer Projects, some other initiatives to use an  alternate sourcing approach have emerged within the military services.  For example, the department plans to transfer its personnel security  investigations function, now performed by the Defense Security Service  to the Office of Personnel Management. In another instance, the Secretary  of the Army recently determined that the long-term incarceration of  prisoners was not a core competency of the Army. The department is in  the process of finalizing plans for transferring its military-dedicated prison  at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Although  exact savings from this transfer have not yet been determined, an Army  official stated that transferring the facility to the Bureau of Prisons would  free up almost 500 military positions. In addition, Army officials believe it  will allow for efficiency gains because the cost to incarcerate a prisoner  per year by the Bureau of Prisons is expected to be less than half what it  costs the Army to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Limitations on Use of Alternatives Exist", "paragraphs": ["The services have been charged by the Senior Executive Council to  identify and use sourcing arrangement alternatives to A-76 for their  non-core functions; however, DOD and the services have encountered  potential limitations to their efforts.

In citing areas where legislation might be needed, they  noted that to complete the planned transfer of the personnel security  investigative functions to the Office of Personnel Management, DOD  recently submitted a legislative request to Congress seeking authority to  do so as part of its legislative package known as the Defense  Transformation for the 21st Century Act of 2003. Specifically, the  legislation would allow DOD to transfer this non-core function to the  Office of Personnel Management, which would allow for consolidation of  requests for security clearances under this agency. Alternatively, Army  officials told us that in the initiative to transfer its Fort Leavenworth  prison to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, they did not believe special  authorizing legislation is required. They believe DOD is not required, by  statute, to maintain prisoners in DOD facilities and may use any facility  under the control of the U.S. government.", "DOD officials have also requested some legislative relief to implement  some initiatives that they have already identified. For example, DOD  has requested the repeal of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2465 to allow the department  to bid and compete contracts for security guard services and for the  performance of firefighting functions at military installations in the  continental United States. DOD believes such contracts would be  cost-effective and provide a needed flexibility in exigent situations,  such as September 11, 2001.

The department\u2019s  A-76 goals for the number of positions to be studied and the time frames  for accomplishing those studies have varied over time, reaching a high in  1999 of studying 229,000 positions between 1997 and 2005. However,  DOD experienced difficulty in identifying eligible functions for study and  consequently, in 2001, reduced the goal to study 160,000 positions between  1997 and 2007. Recently, DOD\u2019s study goals have increased because of  OMB\u2019s competitive sourcing goals. To meet OMB\u2019s goal of directly  converting or studying 15 percent of the 453,000 commercial activity  positions identified in the 2000 FAIR Act inventories by the end of fiscal  year 2003, DOD would need to complete A-76 studies on about  68,000 positions between fiscal year 2000 and the end of fiscal year 2003.

Nonetheless, OMB  permitted use of nearly 54,000 of the positions for which DOD  subsequently completed studies, leaving the department approximately  14,000 positions to study by the end of fiscal year 2003.

Regardless, this longer-term  goal could be a challenge, requiring completion of a significantly larger  number of positions for study than has actually been completed in similar  periods in the past. For example, between fiscal years 1997 and 2002,  DOD completed competition studies for about 68,000 positions. Under  the new goals, DOD would be required to complete studies involving  158,000 positions during a 5-year period between fiscal years 2004-08.

As we have tracked DOD\u2019s progress in implementing its A-76 program  since the mid- to late-1990s, we have identified various challenges and  concerns that have surrounded the program. We believe those challenges  and concerns are still relevant to the department\u2019s current A-76 program.  They include (1) the time required to complete the studies, (2) the cost and  other resources required to conduct and implement the studies, and  (3) the selection and grouping of positions to compete.", "In addition, as noted earlier, the Army\u2019s core competency review has  shown that the designation of \u201ccore\u201d does not necessarily mean that  in-house employees should perform a function, nor does the designation  of \u201cnon-core\u201d mean a function should necessarily be considered for  alternative sourcing or A-76 competitions. This may cause further  difficulties in selecting and grouping functions for A-76 reviews or other  sourcing alternatives.", "OMB\u2019s revised A-76 circular states that standard competitions shall not  exceed 12 months from public announcement (start date) to performance  decision (end date). Under certain conditions, a time limit waiver of no  more than 6 months can be granted. The revised circular also states that  agencies shall complete certain preliminary planning\u2014such as scope,  baseline costs, and schedule\u2014before public announcement. Even  so DOD\u2019s studies have historically taken significantly longer than  12-18 months. DOD\u2019s most recent data indicate that the studies take  on average 20 months for single-function studies and 35 months for  multifunction studies. It is not clear how much of this time was needed for  planning that will now be outside the revised circular\u2019s study time frame.", "Once DOD components found that the studies were taking longer than  initially projected, they realized that a greater investment of resources  would be needed than originally planned to conduct the studies. We  previously reported that the President\u2019s 2001 budget showed a wide  range of projected study costs, from about $1,300 per position studied  in the Army to about $3,700 in the Navy. DOD is now estimating costs  at $3,000 per position for new studies beginning in fiscal year 2004.  However, the much larger number of studies required to be completed in  the out-years to meet OMB\u2019s study goals could require DOD components  to devote much greater total resources to this effort than in the past.", "In addition, DOD components, particularly the Air Force, are attempting  to shift military personnel away from commercial type functions to those  more directly related to warfighting. As noted above, because these  functions are not being eliminated, new operations and maintenance  account funds will have to be provided to pay for the additional civilians  or contractors that perform the function(s) currently being performed by  uniformed personnel. As previously mentioned in the report, the Air Force  alone has recently estimated this additional cost to be about $5 billion  over the next 5 years.", "This is an issue other services have also encountered in the past and  will in the future as they plan to shift military personnel away from  commercial positions into warfighting positions, either as a result of its  core assessment or as part of its A-76 studies. We have not seen precise,  reliable figures on the extent to which these conversions may occur, and  the extent to which all affected military personnel would be needed in  warfighting positions. In the past we identified instances where service  components were required to absorb these costs without additional  resources. We recommended in our 2000 report that the Secretary of  Defense take steps to ensure that the services increase funding for  operation and maintenance accounts, as necessary, to fund the civilian  and contractor personnel replacing military positions that have been  transferred to meet other needs. The department acknowledged that  this practice would require the services to program additional funding for  operation and maintenance accounts, viewing this as a service investment  decision. However, given the increased emphasis the department has  placed on moving the military from commercial functions to warfare,  officials from the Army and the Air Force have expressed concern that  there were not adequate funds to replace the military with civilian or  contractor personnel once their positions have been competed or  transferred. This can have the effect of either limiting the number of  conversions that can be made or requiring Defense components to absorb  the costs within their existing budgets, creating limitations in other  program areas.", "As we have previously reported, selecting and grouping functions and  positions to compete can also be difficult. Some functions may be spread  across different geographic locations or may fulfill a roll that blurs the  distinction between \u201ccommercial\u201d and \u201cinherently governmental,\u201d thus  preventing the packaging of some commercial positions into suitable  groups for competition. In addition, as previously noted, DOD excluded  certain commercial functions in its FAIR Act inventories from  competition. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2002 FAIR Act inventory exempted  171,698 positions from competition because of statutory, national security,  or operational concerns. Further, as we have previously reported, most  services have already faced growing difficulties in finding enough study  candidates to meet their A-76 study goals.

Clarification of the department\u2019s expectations for sourcing decisions is  needed along with additional guidance on other factors that may need to  be considered in sourcing decisions. Otherwise, the components may be  left with unrealistic expectations on making sourcing decisions or they  may make changes in sourcing that later prove to be problematic.", "Under the core-competency process, the Air Force identified large  numbers of military personnel who could be reassigned to meet other  military requirements and be replaced by civilian or contractor personnel  who may be a more economical alternative.

This is indicative of what other services are likely to face in seeking to  accomplish such conversions\u2014the need for additional funding in  operations and maintenance accounts to support these conversions.  Such conversions may be a more cost-effective alternative than simply  increasing military end-strength where shortages exist in military  positions.
