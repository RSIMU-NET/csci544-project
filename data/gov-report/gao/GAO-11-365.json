In 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to include in this bundled payment \"oral-only\" ESRD drugs used to treat mineral and bone disorder. Currently, Medicare generally pays for these drugs only if the beneficiary has Part D prescription drug coverage. This report (1) describes the rationales for including oral-only ESRD drugs in the bundled payment, (2) examines dialysis organizations' recent experience providing oral-only ESRD drugs and their future ability to provide these drugs, (3) examines the data sources that CMS could use to account for oral-only ESRD drugs in the bundled payment, and (4) examines CMS's ability to monitor treatment of mineral and bone disorder. GAO interviewed CMS officials, experts in mineral and bone disorder, and representatives of 4 large and 16 small dialysis organizations. GAO also reviewed ESRD payment regulations, related reports, clinical guidelines, and state pharmacy licensure requirements in 10 selected states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There are three key reasons for including oral-only ESRD drugs in the bundled payment for dialysis care. First, including these drugs could promote more efficient dialysis care, because organizations that provide this care receive a fixed payment and gain financially to the extent they reduce their costs for the items and services included in the bundle. Second, including the oral-only ESRD drugs could promote clinically appropriate care. Currently, dialysis organizations gain financially if beneficiaries receive oral-only ESRD drugs instead of drugs that are in the bundle because this reduces costs without reducing the payment these organizations receive. Including oral-only ESRD drugs in the bundle would remove financial incentives under the payment system to use certain drugs over others. Finally, including oral-only ESRD drugs in the bundled payment could improve access to these drugs for certain beneficiaries, such as those who currently lack separate prescription drug coverage for these drugs. Three of the 4 large dialysis organizations interviewed by GAO reported that they provided oral-only ESRD drugs to some of the beneficiaries they served in 2010. In contrast, all of the 16 small dialysis organizations that GAO interviewed reported that they did not provide these drugs in 2010. Regardless of their recent experience providing oral-only ESRD drugs, the large and small organizations GAO interviewed identified issues that could affect their ability to provide these drugs in 2014. For example, most organizations expressed concern about whether the bundled payment for dialysis care would adequately cover the costs of providing oral-only ESRD drugs. To account for oral-only ESRD drugs in the payment bundle in 2014, CMS officials noted that they would be limited to using data on payments for these drugs under Medicare Part D. However, these data may understate the costs that dialysis organizations would incur to provide these drugs, in part, because Medicare currently pays for these drugs primarily for those beneficiaries with Part D coverage. Although CMS does not know whether the bundled payment in 2014 will be sufficient to cover the costs that efficient dialysis organizations would incur to provide the entire bundle of dialysis-related items and services, a potential underestimate of the total cost to provide oral-only ESRD drugs raises questions about payment adequacy beginning in 2014. GAO and others have stated that inadequate payments could lead to access and quality of care issues for beneficiaries on dialysis. CMS is developing new, consensus-based measures that it could use to monitor treatment of mineral and bone disorder. CMS is also developing a new Web-based system to collect data for such measures. However, full implementation of this new system has been delayed repeatedly, and dialysis organizations and others GAO interviewed expressed concern about the reliability of data collected using this system. Recognizing the importance of timely and reliable quality monitoring under bundled payment systems, CMS officials told GAO that they intend to collect data using an alternative mechanism in 2011."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS assess payment adequacy when oral-only ESRD drugs are included in the bundled payment and ensure availability of reliable data for monitoring treatment of mineral and bone disorder.

According to the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department  of Health and Human Services that administers Medicare, in 2007,  Medicare spent about $9.2 billion on dialysis treatment and related items  and services for approximately 329,000 beneficiaries on dialysis.", "Medicare pays dialysis organizations a single rate for providing dialysis  treatment and certain related items and services, which is a common form  of Medicare payment known as bundling. Medicare pays the bundled rate  per dialysis treatment\u2014generally for three treatments per week. Effective  January 1, 2011, the bundled payment for dialysis care expanded to  include payment for some additional items and services. As a result, the  bundled payment covers the following under Medicare Part B: (1) dialysis  treatment and associated routine services, such as nursing, equipment,  supplies, and ESRD-related laboratory tests; (2) injectable drugs used to  treat complications related to ESRD; and (3) oral ESRD drugs that have  injectable equivalents.", "This payment change was consistent with our previous recommendation  that the bundled payment for dialysis care be expanded to include all  ESRD services in order to improve efficiency and remove financial  incentives to provide more injectable ESRD drugs than necessary.  However in a subsequent report, we noted that bundled payment systems  may give providers an incentive to underserve the most costly  beneficiaries to avoid financial losses.

We selected the 4 large dialysis organizations because they  owned the largest number of dialysis facilities nationwide. At the time of  our study, these large dialysis organizations reported that they owned  about 150 to 1,750 dialysis facilities and served about 12,400 to 130,500  dialysis patients. In addition, 3 of these organizations collectively owned  about 61 percent of dialysis facilities and served about 63 percent of  dialysis patients in 2008. We randomly selected the 16 small dialysis  organizations from 10 states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New  York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah. These 10  states were located in all four census regions and accounted for about 50  percent of all beneficiaries on dialysis as of December 31, 2008.

During hemodialysis, a machine pumps blood  through an artificial kidney and returns the cleansed blood to the body.", "One common complication of ESRD is mineral and bone disorder, which  can result in a variety of negative clinical conditions in ESRD patients,  including weak and brittle bones and cardiovascular disease. Because  mineral and bone disorder is associated with abnormal calcium,  phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the blood,  treatment of mineral and bone disorder typically involves monitoring the  levels of these substances in the blood and providing a combination of  medications to control these levels. The medications that are generally  provided to treat mineral and bone disorder are vitamin D, calcimimetics,  and phosphate binders. Vitamin D and calcimimetics are used to help  maintain normal levels of calcium and PTH, while phosphate binders are  used to reduce excessive phosphorus levels. Vitamin D is generally  administered intravenously, although a small number of patients\u2014usually  those who receive dialysis in their home\u2014are treated with the oral form of  the drug.

For example, representatives from 2 of the 20  dialysis organizations in our review indicated that, if the bundled payment  amount for dialysis care was inadequate, beneficiaries might not receive  certain high-cost oral-only ESRD drugs\u2014even if these drugs were the most  clinically effective. Additionally, experts on mineral and bone disorder  noted that, to minimize costs, dialysis organizations could choose to  increase their provision of calcium-based phosphate binders, which tend  to be relatively inexpensive. However, the use of calcium-based phosphate  binders could increase beneficiaries\u2019 blood calcium levels, which could  have adverse clinical effects.

These requirements  generally pertain to staffing, drug storage, security, and delivery. For  example, all 10 states we selected for our review required that  1.  a pharmacist be in charge of a pharmacy;  2.  a pharmacist supervise drug dispensing at a pharmacy;  3.  a pharmacy meet drug storage standards, such as securely storing  drugs in a designated space; and  4.  a pharmacy follow security procedures, such as restricting access to a  pharmacy when a pharmacist is off duty.", "Representatives from the 3 large dialysis organizations that operated  pharmacies in 2010 said that providing oral-only ESRD drugs to all of the  Medicare beneficiaries they will serve in 2014 would be challenging.

For example, officials from the Board of Pharmacy in 2  states\u2014Georgia and Ohio\u2014told us that their states generally prohibited  pharmacies in their states from mailing drugs to beneficiaries at dialysis  facilities. Representatives from 1 of these 3 large dialysis organizations  also noted that, although their dialysis organization operated a pharmacy,  the pharmacy served only about 2 percent of the dialysis organization\u2019s  current patients and served patients in only 1 of the 27 states in which the  dialysis organization operated. As a result, this dialysis organization would  need to comply with the pharmacy licensure requirements of the other 26  states to provide oral-only ESRD drugs to the Medicare beneficiaries it will  serve in these states.

Part D payment data represent PDP  payments to pharmacies for each medication provided to beneficiaries,  and these data also include information on beneficiary cost-sharing and  the amounts beneficiaries paid for drugs while they were in the coverage  gap. Retiree Drug Subsidy data represent the total amounts that Medicare  paid to groups such as employers or unions to subsidize the drug coverage  of Medicare beneficiaries in these groups.

Specifically:    Part D data for 2007 through 2009 accounted for only about two- thirds of beneficiaries on dialysis. In 2007, for example, Part D  payments for oral-only ESRD drugs for beneficiaries on dialysis with Part  D coverage totaled about $445 million; however, this amount did not  include payments for oral-only ESRD drugs for the approximately one- third of beneficiaries on dialysis who lacked Part D coverage. Because it is  unclear whether or to what extent beneficiaries with and without Part D  coverage are comparable in their utilization of oral-only ESRD drugs, using  Part D data to account for beneficiaries without Part D coverage presents  challenges. If the two groups of beneficiaries were comparable in their  utilization of oral-only ESRD drugs, total spending on these drugs for all  beneficiaries on dialysis\u2014including the approximately one-third of  beneficiaries without Part D coverage\u2014could have been an estimated   $216 million higher in 2007.", "Part D drug coverage in 2007 through 2009 generally was less  comprehensive than the coverage that dialysis organizations will  be required to provide. Most stand-alone Part D PDPs during this time  did not cover drugs when beneficiaries\u2019 annual drug costs were in the  coverage gap. However, beginning in 2014, dialysis organizations will be  responsible for covering the cost of oral-only ESRD drugs for beneficiaries  on dialysis. Moreover, some studies suggest that more comprehensive  coverage of oral-only ESRD drugs, which dialysis organizations will be  required to provide, could lead to greater use of and adherence to  prescriptions for these drugs. As a result, beneficiaries\u2019 use of oral-only  ESRD drugs, and therefore dialysis organizations\u2019 costs of providing these  drugs, could be higher than the historical Part D data indicate.", "Part D data reflect payment rates that may be lower than dialysis  organizations\u2019 costs. Part D data reflect payment rates that PDPs  negotiated with drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Because PDPs  generally have larger numbers of beneficiaries than dialysis organizations  and are providing a wider range of drugs, these plans may be able to  negotiate larger volume discounts for purchasing oral-only ESRD drugs.  Furthermore, these Part D data do not account for PDPs\u2019 administrative  costs of providing prescription drugs, including oral-only ESRD drugs.", "CMS does not know whether the payment amount for the entire bundle of  items and services, including oral-only ESRD drugs, will be adequate\u2014that  is, whether it will cover the costs incurred by an efficient dialysis  organization to supply oral-only ESRD drugs in addition to the range of  other items and services included in the bundle. However, the possibility  that Part D data may understate the costs of providing oral-only ESRD  drugs raises questions about the adequacy of the overall bundled payment  rate. We and others have noted that inadequate payments under bundled  payment systems could impair the ability of providers such as dialysis  organizations to furnish beneficiaries with access to high-quality care.  CMS officials stated that they had not yet determined what the bundled  payment rate will be when oral-only ESRD drugs are included, because  CMS was focused on implementing the current payment system for  dialysis care.

Beginning in 2009, CMS stopped  collecting data via a paper data collection form for the quality measures  included in the CPM Project because CMS intended to begin collecting  data for these measures from all dialysis facilities in CROWNWeb in  February 2009. However, CMS officials told us that full, national  implementation of CROWNWeb was delayed because a contractor tasked  with designing and implementing CROWNWeb performed poorly. CMS  officials told us that CMS hired a new contractor in September 2009 and  scheduled full implementation of CROWNWeb for December 2009.  According to CMS officials, full implementation of CROWNWeb was  delayed again because CMS needed to update CROWNWeb to address  security requirements for federal data systems. Due in part to these  delays, CMS modified the implementation of CROWNWeb to a \u201cphase-in\u201d  approach whereby the number of facilities submitting data to CROWNWeb  increases in phases until full implementation is achieved. Specifically,  about 180 dialysis facilities currently submit data to CROWNWeb, and  CMS planned to begin collecting data from all dialysis facilities\u2014 approximately 5,600\u2014in June 2011. However, due to continued  implementation challenges, CMS recently delayed the full, national  implementation of CROWNWeb until February 2012.", "In addition to concerns about implementation delays, dialysis  organizations and others we spoke with expressed concern about the  reliability of the data in CROWNWeb. For example, 9 of the 20 dialysis  organizations we interviewed expressed concern about the reliability of  manually entered data and CMS noted that there is a data error rate of  over 20 percent for data submitted to CROWNWeb via the batch  submission process in the current phase of CROWNWeb implementation.  According to CMS officials, CMS has contracted with two vendors that are  responsible for evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data in  CROWNWeb.

In response to our recommendation that CMS assess  the adequacy of the bundled payment when oral-only ESRD drugs are  included, CMS stated that it would carefully analyze data on the utilization  of these drugs before including them under the bundled payment. CMS  also noted that, before implementing this payment change, the agency  would allow for public comment through the rulemaking process and  would carefully examine any concerns expressed by the public to ensure  that beneficiaries continue to have access to needed medications.  Furthermore, CMS stated that it was confident that the additional amount  to be included in the ESRD prospective payment system to account for  oral-only ESRD drugs would be adequate to account for the average  patient\u2019s oral drug needs. They noted that particular aspects of the  payment system are intended to account for the higher drug costs of some  patients.

The representatives generally noted that our draft report was well-written  and balanced and that they appreciated that we collected data and  perspectives from a variety of organizations. The groups also underscored  our findings related to dialysis organizations\u2019 ability to provide oral-only  ESRD drugs. Specifically, representatives from all of the groups reiterated  some of the possible challenges we described in our draft report related to  providing these drugs, including the complexity of complying with state  pharmacy licensure requirements, the potential for fragmentation of care,  and the potential influence of the payment change on physician  prescribing behaviors for oral-only ESRD drugs. The groups representing  large and small dialysis providers also expressed unease about the  additional costs they will incur to provide these drugs. The five groups\u2019  comments on our draft report generally focused on three areas of concern:  (1) the reasons for including oral-only ESRD drugs in the bundled payment  system, (2) the data CMS intends to use to account for oral-only ESRD  drugs in the bundled payment system, and (3) CMS\u2019s ability to monitor the  quality of care provided to dialysis beneficiaries.

For  example, representatives of RPA and NRAA commented that beneficiaries\u2019  cost sharing for these drugs could be higher than it would be if the drugs  remained covered under Part D because the Part D coverage gap will be  reduced. In addition, representatives of AKF noted that some  beneficiaries currently receive financial assistance to help cover their out- of-pocket costs for Part D drugs and once oral-only ESRD drugs are  included in the Part B payment bundle, these beneficiaries will no longer  receive this assistance.", "We did not assess the extent to which beneficiaries\u2019 cost sharing will  change when oral-only ESRD drugs are included in the bundled payment  system because doing so was beyond the scope of our study. Although  beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for drugs covered under Part D will  decrease once the Part D coverage gap is eliminated, beneficiaries will  continue to be responsible for cost sharing for Part D-covered drugs. As  noted in the preamble to the final rule for the design of the bundled  payment system for dialysis care, whether a particular beneficiary\u2019s cost  sharing for oral-only ESRD drugs increases or decreases when these drugs  are included in the bundled payment will depend on his or her individual  circumstances.

Representatives from RPA and NRAA commented that these data may not  reflect changes in treatment patterns since 2007. In addition,  representatives from KCC commented that MIPPA did not limit CMS to  using Part D data from 2007, 2008, or 2009 to account for oral-only ESRD  drugs in the bundled payment. KCC representatives also asserted that it  was not CMS\u2019s position that MIPPA limited the agency to using these data  to expand the bundled payment to include oral-only ESRD drugs. They  noted further that in the proposed rule for the new payment system, CMS  calculated $14 per dialysis treatment to account for oral-only ESRD drugs  in the bundled payment amount. However, KCC\u2019s estimate of the cost of  providing these drugs was $45 per treatment. KCC representatives  suggested that we note the true cost of providing oral-only ESRD drugs in  the report. Representatives of NRAA also commented that if the amount of  the bundled payment were not adequate, small dialysis organizations  could go out of business, which could create access problems for  beneficiaries.", "In our draft report, we noted the potential limitations of Part D data and  recommended that CMS assess the extent to which the bundled payment  for dialysis care would be sufficient to cover an efficient dialysis  organization\u2019s costs to provide these drugs. CMS asserted that MIPPA  limited the agency to using data on Medicare payments for oral-only ESRD  drugs in 2007, 2008, or 2009 to account for these drugs in the bundled  payment system. In addition, CMS officials also reiterated that they were  limited to using data from the Part D program. However, assessing the true  cost of providing oral-only ESRD drugs and CMS\u2019s interpretation of MIPPA  was beyond the scope of our study. Of most concern is whether the  payment for the entire bundle of services will be adequate to cover the  costs of efficient dialysis organizations.
