For example, transactions within a \"closed-flow\" virtual currency system do not produce taxable income because a virtual currency can be used only to purchase virtual goods or services. An example of a closed-flow transaction is the purchase of items to use within an online game. In an \"openflow\" system, a taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for real goods or services may have earned taxable income since the virtual currency can be exchanged for real goods or services or readily exchanged for governmentissued currency, such as U.S. dollars.", "Virtual economies and currencies pose various tax compliance risks, but the extent of actual tax noncompliance is unknown. Some identified risks include taxpayers not being aware that income earned through virtual economies or currencies is taxable or not knowing how to calculate such income.

However, IRS has not provided taxpayers with information specific to virtual currencies because of other priorities, resource constraints, and the need to consider the use of these recently-developed currencies, according to IRS officials. By not issuing guidance, IRS may be missing an opportunity to address virtual currency tax compliance risks. Given the uncertain extent of noncompliance with virtual currency transactions, formal guidance, such as regulations, may not be warranted. According to IRS officials, formal guidance requires extensive review, which adds to development time and cost. However, IRS may be able to develop more timely and less costly informal guidance, which, according to IRS officials, requires less extensive review and can be based on other existing guidance.

Virtual economies can be closed, meaning  the economic activities and units of exchange used within the community  do not interact with the real economy outside of the virtual environment  setting, or they can be open, with some economic activity occurring in  both the virtual setting and the real economy. A virtual currency is,  generally, a digital unit of exchange that is not backed by a government- issued legal tender. Virtual currencies can be used entirely within a virtual  economy, or can be used in lieu of a government-issued currency to  purchase goods and services in the real economy. Some virtual  economies may function similarly to barter exchanges, where bartering is  the exchange of goods or services in lieu of monetary payments. For  example, a carpenter may build a desk for a dentist in exchange for  dental work. Barter transactions are taxable transactions, and taxpayers  must report the fair market value of the good or service received on their  tax returns. Some of the variations in virtual currencies and their  interaction with the real economy are shown in figure 1.", "2The 2007 Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint\u2014a 5-year strategic plan for improving service to  taxpayers\u2014is a collaborative effort of IRS, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and the IRS  Oversight Board.

One mechanism that  assists IRS in enforcing tax laws is information reporting, through which  third parties report to IRS and taxpayers on certain taxpayer transactions.  For example, subject to certain thresholds, third-party settlement  organizations are required to report on Form 1099-K payments in  settlement of third-party network transactions. A common example of a  third-party settlement organization is an online auction-payment facilitator,  which operates as an intermediary between buyers and sellers by  transferring funds between their accounts in settlement of purchases.  Another type of third-party information reporting is performed by barter  exchanges, which, generally, are organizations that facilitate barter  transactions among exchange members. Such barter exchanges are  required to report on Form 1099-B each member\u2019s barter transactions  proceeds. Third-party information reporting is widely acknowledged to  increase voluntary tax compliance, in part because taxpayers know that  IRS is aware of their income.", "Likewise, in its role in administering the tax code, IRS must implement the  laws Congress enacts through detailed guidance. To accomplish this  responsibility, IRS publishes several forms of guidance, such as  regulations, revenue rulings and procedures, and notices. IRS also  provides more informal guidance on its website based on factors such as  perceived need, media coverage, or IRS staff identifying an emerging tax  compliance issue. As outlined in IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint and  related reports, a key part of IRS\u2019s strategy for preventing and minimizing  noncompliance is to outreach to taxpayers to help them understand and  meet their tax responsibilities. One of the guiding principles of this  approach is to enhance IRS\u2019s website so that it becomes the first choice  of taxpayers for obtaining the information they need to comply.", "9Third-party settlement organizations must file Form 1099-K if gross payments to a payee  exceed $20,000 and there are more than 200 transactions with the payee in a given tax  year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Virtual Economy and Currency Transactions May Be Taxable If They Produce Income", "paragraphs": ["10For federal tax purposes, all income is taxable, although the tax code excludes some  items from income, such as gifts or inheritances, subject to exceptions, while it allows  other items to be deducted to reduce taxable income, subject to limitations and  restrictions, such as trade or business expenses. have no value outside the game and David cannot exchange his  online money for U.S. dollars.

The tax compliance risks we identified for virtual economies  and currencies are described below.", "Taxpayer lack of knowledge of tax requirements. Income is  generally defined as any undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly  realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.  The unsophisticated taxpayer may not properly identify income  earned through virtual economies or currencies, such as virtual online  game assets exchanged for real word currency, as taxable income. If  taxpayers using virtual currencies turn to the Internet for tax help, they  may find misinformation in the absence of clear guidance from IRS.  For example, when we performed a simple Internet search for  information on taxation of bitcoin transactions, we found a number of  websites, wikis, and blogs that provided differing opinions on the tax  treatment of bitcoins, including some that could lead taxpayers to  believe that transacting in virtual currencies relieves them of their  responsibilities to report and pay taxes.", "Uncertainty over how to characterize income. Even if taxpayers  are aware that they may have a tax liability, they may be uncertain  about the proper tax treatment of virtual transactions, according to tax  experts, including academics and tax practitioners with whom we  spoke. For example, characterization depends on whether the virtual  economy activity or virtual currency unit is to be treated as property,  barter, foreign currency, or a financial instrument. According to some  experts with whom we spoke, some virtual currency transactions  could be considered barter transactions, which may not be an obvious  characterization to unsophisticated taxpayers. This characterization  could result in noncompliance with requirements for reporting and  paying tax on barter income.", "Uncertainty over how to calculate basis for gains. Income earned  from virtual economy or currency transactions may not be taxable if it  is equivalent to that from an occasional online garage sale, meaning  occasional income from selling goods for less than their original  purchase price. It may be difficult for individuals receiving income from  virtual economies to determine their basis for calculating gains. For  example, some online games require players to pay a monthly fee in  exchange for use of the game and a monthly allowance of virtual  currency. If a player then sells a virtual tool gained in the game for  real money, calculating the basis for any taxable gain may be difficult  for the unsophisticated taxpayer.", "Challenges with third-party reporting. Third-party information  reporting requirements do not apply specifically to transactions using  virtual economies or currencies. Virtual economy or currency  transactions may be subject to third-party information reporting to the  extent that these transactions involve the use of a third-party payment  network to mediate the transaction and the taxpayer meets reporting  threshold requirements. Because virtual economy and currency  transactions are inherently difficult to track, including identifying the  true identities of the parties to the transaction, third-party information  reporting may be difficult or prohibitively burdensome for some virtual  economy and currency issuers to administer.", "Evasion. Some taxpayers may use virtual economies and currencies  as a way to evade taxes.

EBEI determined that virtual economies  presented opportunities for income underreporting and developed (1) a  potential compliance strategy, including initiating a compliance  improvement project to gather research data and analyze compliance  trends, and (2) a potential action plan for specific compliance activities.  According to IRS compliance officials, IRS ultimately decided not to  pursue these actions in light of available IRS resources and other higher  priority needs. Also, IRS did not find strong evidence of the potential for  tax noncompliance related to virtual economies, such as the number of  U.S. taxpayers involved in such activity or the amount of federal tax  revenue at risk.", "However, in November 2009, based on EBEI having determined the  need, IRS posted information on its website on the tax consequences of  virtual economy transactions.

According to IRS  compliance officials, IRS would learn about tax compliance issues related  to virtual currencies as it would any other tax compliance issue, such as  IRS examiners identifying compliance problems during examinations or  taxpayers requesting guidance on how to comply with certain tax  requirements. To date, these processes have not resulted in IRS  identifying virtual currencies used outside of virtual economies as a  compliance risk that warrants specific attention.", "Likewise, IRS has not issued guidance specific to virtual currencies used  outside of virtual economies due to competing priorities and resource  constraints, and because the use of virtual currencies is a relatively  recent development that requires further consideration before guidance  can be issued, according to IRS\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel and compliance  officials.
