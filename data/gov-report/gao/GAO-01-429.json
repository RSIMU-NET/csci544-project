Ten of these cities formed the core of the former Soviet Union\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.  Many are located in geographically remote locations and were so secret that they did not appear on any publicly available maps until 1992.  Behind their walls, thousands of scientists and engineers worked on the design, assembly, and production of the Soviet nuclear arsenal.  These Russian cities remain high-security areas, and access to them is limited.  Russia\u2019s Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM) manages the nuclear facilities that are located within the cities.  MINATOM estimates that about 760,000 people live in the nuclear cities, including the family members of the nuclear workers as well as teachers and various support personnel.  Approximately 122,000 inhabitants are employed in key nuclear enterprises.", "The Russian government has announced its intention to reduce the size of its nuclear weapons complex and asked for U.S. assistance in this endeavor.  A critical component of this effort includes finding new employment opportunities for weapons scientists, engineers, technicians, and support staff who will lose their jobs from the complex\u2019s downsizing. The U.S. government has also been concerned that Russian weapons scientists in need of money may sell sensitive information to countries or terrorist groups trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.  NCI, which is being implemented by the Department of Energy (DOE) and its national laboratories, seeks to assist Russia in downsizing its weapons complex by employing weapons scientists and other residents of the cities in nonmilitary scientific or commercial activities.  NCI works in conjunction with another DOE program\u2014the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP)\u2014which also seeks to employ weapons scientists and is implemented throughout all of Russia, including several nuclear cities, as well as Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.", "In early 1999, we issued a report addressing both programs, identified a number of management weaknesses, and recommended several corrective actions.  Regarding NCI, we pointed out that the program faced impediments to success, including restrictions on access to the cities and poor prospects for foreign investment.  We recommended that NCI not expand beyond three pilot cities in Russia\u2014Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk\u2014until DOE had demonstrated that its efforts were achieving the program\u2019s objectives of creating jobs for weapons scientists. Currently, the program is operating in these cities, plus Avangard\u2014a nuclear weapons assembly/disassembly facility located in Sarov.  This report discusses the (1) costs to implement NCI, including the amount of program funds spent in the United States and Russia, as well as planned expenditures; (2) impact of the Department\u2019s NCI projects; and (3) status of the European Nuclear Cities Initiative (ENCI).", "To develop this information, we obtained cost data from DOE\u2019s headquarters and the national laboratories.  We reviewed all of DOE\u2019s NCI projects to determine their impact on meeting the program\u2019s goals and objectives.  We also met with MINATOM officials in Russia and visited the closed nuclear city of Sarov.  In addition, we met with, among others, officials of Italy\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs who are major proponents of the proposed ENCI."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In July 1998, then Vice President Gore and the former Prime Minister of Russia issued a joint statement noting that nuclear disarmament is associated with several socioeconomic factors, including the problem of finding worthwhile civilian-sector employment for Russian personnel formerly employed in the nuclear weapons complex.  In September 1998, both countries signed an agreement\u2014the Nuclear Cities Initiative\u2014to create jobs for people in the nuclear weapons complex. Russian officials have identified the need to create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in its nuclear cities over the next several years.  Under the terms of the agreement, the United States will seek to assist in creating new jobs by   sharing its experience in downsizing the U.S. nuclear weapons production complex; facilitating the selection of promising commercial projects that will lead to employment opportunities for workers;   developing entrepreneurial skills for displaced workers, including training in how to write business plans; facilitating the search for potential investors, market analysis, and marketing for products and services; and facilitating access to existing investment mechanisms, including investment funds.", "NCI is limited to working in the municipal areas of each city.  Beyond these areas are various secret nuclear institutes or technical areas.  DOE\u2019s strategy is to encourage investment in commercial enterprises in the municipal areas of the cities thus shrinking, over time, the size of the restricted areas in accordance with the plans of the Russian government. DOE officials believe that if commercial efforts are successful, not only will those employed in weapons manufacturing remain in the city but so will their relatives and friends and there will be less reason for weapons scientists, technicians, and engineers to leave the area.  Figure 1 shows the location of Russia\u2019s 10 nuclear cities, and appendix I provides additional information about each city.", "The day-to-day management of NCI resides within DOE\u2019s Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, National Nuclear Security Administration.  DOE and its national laboratories have long-standing relationships with MINATOM and several closed cities as well as experience in the downsizing of the U.S. weapons complex.  The NCI program is managed by an office director with a headquarters staff of seven employees who provide technical, budget, and procurement support.  DOE headquarters is responsible for, among other things, setting overall program policy, providing oversight and guidance for the national laboratories, and allocating program funds.  DOE has tasked the national laboratories to play a major role in the program.", "DOE, under the same general authority under which it operates the NCI program, also operates the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention program.  IPP seeks to employ weapons scientists in several countries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia and some of its nuclear cities. According to DOE, IPP is designed to commercialize technologies that utilize the expertise of the scientists who work at the various nuclear weapons institutes.  Although the IPP program focuses on employing nuclear weapons scientists, it also has a component that seeks to employ scientists in the former Soviet Union\u2019s chemical and biological weapons institutes.  In our 1999 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Energy take steps to maximize the impact of IPP\u2019s funding and improve oversight of the program.  Specifically, we recommended, among other things, that the Secretary (1) reexamine the role and costs of the national laboratories\u2019 involvement with a view toward maximizing the amount of program funds going to the former Soviet Union, and (2) eliminate those IPP projects that did not have commercial potential.  DOE subsequently implemented our recommendations.", "The U.S. government has supported other programs that have directed money to scientists working in the closed cities.  For example, since 1994, the U.S. Departments of State and Defense have spent over $40 million on scientific research projects in which one or more of the weapons institutes in Sarov, Snezhinsk, or Zheleznogorsk have participated.  These projects are administered under the auspices of the State Department\u2019s International Science and Technology Center program.  The Center was established by international agreement in November 1992 as a nonproliferation program to provide peaceful research opportunities for weapons scientists and engineers in countries of the former Soviet Union. The scientists working with the Center conduct research and development in a variety of scientific fields, such as environmental remediation and monitoring, nuclear reactor safety, vaccines and other medical treatment, and energy production.", "The U.S. government has also undertaken efforts in the nuclear cities through the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation. Established by the U.S. government in 1995, the Foundation is a nonprofit charitable organization designed to promote scientific and technical collaboration between the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union.  From October 1996 through December 2000, the Foundation awarded 19 grants totaling about $275,000 to support projects in Sarov and Snezhinsk.

Of that amount, about $11.2 million (or 70 percent) had been spent in the United States by the national laboratories and DOE\u2019s headquarters, and about $4.7 million (or 30 percent) had been spent for projects and activities in Russia as shown in figure 2.  The U.S. national laboratories\u2019 costs to implement the program for such items as overhead, labor, equipment, and travel represented the bulk of the funds spent in the United States.  DOE officials told us that these expenditures were significant but were part of the program\u2019s start up costs.  These officials told us that laboratory costs will be reduced and that the laboratories\u2019 role will diminish as commercial investors develop business contacts in the nuclear cities as a result of the program.  The expenditures for Russia included contracts with Russian organizations to buy computers and other equipment, a small business bank loan program, and various community development projects.  MINATOM officials told us that they were dissatisfied with the amount of program funds that had been spent in their country.  In response to direction provided in a conference report on its fiscal year 2001 appropriations, DOE stated in its program guidance that its goal is to spend at least 51 percent of fiscal year 2001 program funds in Russia."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. National Laboratories\u2019 Expenditures Comprise Majority of U.S. Program Costs to Date", "paragraphs": ["Of the $11.2 million that was spent in the United States for the program, the national laboratories\u2019 expenditures made up $10.7 million, or about 96 percent of that amount.

DOE\u2019s headquarters\u2019 expenditures covered, among other things, obtaining studies related to Russia\u2019s defense conversion activities and establishing a Website for the program.  Regarding the laboratories\u2019 expenditures in the United States, these costs were incurred primarily to develop and monitor various NCI projects and activities.  According to DOE officials, the laboratories\u2019 expenditures represent program startup costs.  They noted that the program has taken longer to start up because of the economic problems facing Russia and the barriers involved in trying to start new businesses and related activities in the nuclear cities.

Overhead costs comprised the greatest percentage of costs (about 41 percent) and were charged for various activities, such as contract/procurement support and other activities related to the program\u2019s implementation.  For example, some laboratories charge an overhead fee for administering travel services for both U.S. and Russian officials.  The next highest cost was for labor\u201434 percent.  The laboratories have assigned a principal investigator to manage each NCI project.  The principal investigators from the laboratories told us that they spent from 5 to 75 percent of their time on monitoring NCI projects. Additionally, they told us they spent most of this time during the early stages of the project to establish contacts with their Russian counterparts and to help develop contracts with Russian organizations in the nuclear cities.  As the figure shows, the remaining 25 percent of the U.S. expenditures included travel (airfare and per diem) of laboratory personnel within the United States and to Russia; costs to purchase materials and services for the program, such as U.S.-based consultants; and other miscellaneous costs, such as training, videoconferences, and translation services.", "DOE officials told us that they were concerned about the amount of funds spent by the laboratories to administer the program\u2014particularly, the overhead costs.  However, these officials believe that the laboratories play an important role in the start up of the NCI program.  Some DOE officials, including the program director, stated that laboratory costs would be reduced over time as businesses invest their own capital in the nuclear cities.  However, the program director was not sure when the laboratories\u2019 role in the program would be reduced.", "DOE has taken some steps to reduce laboratory costs as shown in the following examples:   One laboratory official from the Savannah River Site told us that, in general, overhead for contracts at his site is about 37 percent of the total cost of NCI-related contracts.  He subsequently negotiated with DOE an 11-percent overhead rate in fiscal year 2000 for Russian-related programs to include NCI-related contracts.  He said this was done to increase the amount of funds going to Russia.", "Some of the NCI projects are being managed directly by DOE\u2019s headquarters in an effort to limit national laboratories\u2019 overhead expenditures.", "DOE recently took over from a national laboratory the management of a U.S. firm that is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day operations of International Development Centers.

As figure 4 shows, the largest category of expenditures (about 58 percent) was for contracts.  The contracts were used to establish, among other things, the Sarov Open Computing Center. The Center was established in 1999 with NCI funds to help Russian scientists develop commercial skills.  According to Center\u2019s officials, a portion of these funds was used to supplement the salaries of the Russian scientists.  In addition, some of these funds were used to (1) finance the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\u2019s (EBRD) activities to establish a small business bank loan program in the cities and (2) support various community development activities.  The materials purchased by DOE and the national laboratories for use in Russia comprised 36 percent of the expenditures and included such things as medical equipment, computers, and payments to Russian consultants/trainers.  The remaining expenditures (about 6 percent of the total) were for Russian personnel traveling to the United States.", "MINATOM officials told us that they were dissatisfied with the amount of NCI funds that had been spent in Russia.  The First Deputy Minister of MINATOM told us that Russia should have received about 65 percent of the funds programmed for NCI, as it was his understanding that DOE had planned to spend that percentage of program funds in Russia.  He questioned why Russia had not received the amount he had expected and wanted to know what happened to these funds.  The First Deputy Minister also noted that Russia needs help in creating about 1,500 jobs per year in the nuclear cities and that DOE\u2019s funding for the program has been insufficient to meet this goal.  He concluded that when MINATOM officials review NCI\u2019s progress to date, the picture is not optimistic.  In his opinion, the lack of progress in the program increases the negative views of the program held by various Russian government officials who allege that the program is a way for the United States to gain access to weapons data in Russia\u2019s nuclear cities.", "The Congress and DOE have set goals for increasing the amount of NCI program funds spent in Russia.  An October 2000 conference report on DOE\u2019s appropriations for fiscal year 2001 stated that the conferees were concerned about the amount of funding for Russian assistance programs that remain in the United States for DOE contractors and laboratories rather than going to the facilities in Russia.  The conferees directed that not more than 49 percent of NCI program funding be spent in the United States in fiscal year 2001.  The conferees expect DOE to continue to increase the level of funding (beyond 51 percent) for Russia in each subsequent year but did not establish a ceiling for the amount of funds that should ultimately be spent in Russia.  DOE\u2019s NCI Program Guidance, issued in January 2001, noted that in order to meet the spending target established by the conference report, U.S. project managers will spend or commit at least 65 percent of the funds for each project in Russia.

DOE\u2019s initial financial guidance for the program, which was issued in May 1999, only noted that an accounting procedure overseen by an experienced budget and fiscal official will include regular monthly reports by the laboratories on individual NCI projects.  The guidance was silent on the issue of specific reporting requirements, including how expenditures for U.S. and Russian activities should be identified.  Although the national laboratories were generally providing cost information on a monthly basis, a DOE budget official told us that this information lacked consistency and uniformity.  As a result, the budget official was not confident that the cost information was accurately depicting the breakout of expenditures between U.S. and Russian activities.  For example, in May 2000, DOE developed a breakout of the costs and concluded that 65 percent of the funds had been spent in the United States and 35 percent had been spent in Russia.  However, the analysis of Russian expenditures included the funds that were obligated as well as actual expenditures.  According to one DOE official, this analysis overstated expenditures in Russia.", "Some national laboratory officials told us that the lack of standardized reporting guidance made it difficult to determine how to account for program expenditures in the United States and Russia or what to include in these cost categories.  During the course of our review\u2014and, in part, as a result of our work\u2014DOE established a standardized monthly and quarterly financial report for the NCI program.  In January 2001, DOE\u2019s NCI budget official distributed guidance directing all of the national laboratories to report NCI project costs by using a standard format for identifying expenditures.

According to DOE officials, once funds are transferred to a laboratory, they can be redirected by the laboratory from one project to another.  One national laboratory redirected approximately $130,000 from two projects dealing with fiber optics and telecommunications to another project.  The NCI program director was not made aware of this transfer until the laboratory requested additional funding from DOE to replenish these projects\u2019 funding.

The Department awarded $1.5 million to EBRD in February 2000 for the bank to set up the programs. As of December 2000, the bank had spent over $438,000 of the $1.5 million on salaries for its own staff consultants, to train new loan officers in the cities, and to cover operating expenses.  According to the bank, as of February 2001, it had made about 280 loans to businesses in the cities. DOE routinely receives information on the loan program, but that information does not provide details about the background of the loan recipients.  However, according to information from EBRD on loans made in Snezhinsk, the recipients are typically not current employees of the weapons institutes and the loans are not necessarily used to start new businesses.  Furthermore, the businesses that receive loans are mostly in the retail trading sector, such as clothing and household goods stores. Some MINATOM officials told us that they question the value of the loan programs, noting that the loans are not going to the types of businesses that are appropriate for highly educated weapons scientists.  Officials from the weapons institute in Sarov told us that they did not request the loan program and objected to DOE\u2019s using NCI funds to start it because it does not play a role in restructuring the workforce.

The Russian company was formed in February 2000 by six former weapons institute employees.  According to a national laboratory official, these employees left the institute to form the company.  The NCI program allocated $395,000 to the project in fiscal years 1999 and 2000.  According to a national laboratory official, the Russian company has used the funds to pay for office space, equipment, and salaries.  It also used NCI funds to enter into one contract to receive training and has entered into agreements to distribute and service bar-code and auto-identification technologies manufactured by three U.S. companies.", "DOE has canceled several NCI projects that were intended to create jobs for weapons scientists for a variety of reasons. According to DOE, many projects were designed to \u201cjump-start\u201d the program with the expectation that not all would evolve into large-scale jobs creation projects. Furthermore, several of these projects were subsequently determined to not be viable, have run into difficulties, and have either been canceled or stalled.  For example, the program funded one project in Zheleznogorsk to expand the capacity for recycling luminescent tubes that contain mercury. DOE allocated $250,000 to this project but spent only $2,000.  The national laboratory official responsible for overseeing the project said that MINATOM was not willing to bring the recycling technology out of the restricted part of the city.  Because access restrictions prevented DOE from working to expand the recycling capacity within the secure area of the institute, the Department canceled the project.", "DOE funded another project to determine the viability of producing canola oil in the Zheleznogorsk region.  The oil can be used for cooking and animal feed and can be used industrially to make lubricants, fuels, and soaps.  Initial work under the project would have been to determine whether or not the crop could be successfully grown in the area. According to the national laboratory official responsible for overseeing the project, DOE and officials from the weapons institute in Zheleznogorsk were interested in the idea, but the city\u2019s mayor was not.  The national laboratory official told us that the mayor was more interested in promoting the production of barley for livestock that could also be used to make beer and vodka to bring in tax revenues for the city.  The national laboratory official was denied access to the city when she tried to promote the project.  DOE allocated $302,000 to the project and spent about $114,000 before canceling it.", "Other NCI projects have been canceled or delayed due to a lack of Russian support and cooperation.

As we reported in November 2000, international aid efforts have had difficulty in promoting economic growth in Russia.  The country appears to be a long way from having a competitive market economy, and its transition over the past decade has been more difficult than expected.  DOE faces even greater problems in trying to promote economic development in the nuclear cities.  The cities are geographically and economically remote.  Although the cities have a skilled and well-educated workforce, those residents have depended upon government support for their livelihood and do not generally have experience in business or entrepreneurial ventures.", "According to DOE and industry officials, access to the nuclear cities has been a major impediment.  The Russian government requires that all visitors apply for an access permit at least 45 days before arriving but does not always grant those requests.  DOE provided us with a list of 25 instances since 1999 in which the Russian government denied requests from DOE headquarters staff, national laboratory staff, U.S. embassy personnel, and Members of Congress for access to one or more of the three cities.  (See app. V for more detail.)  Complications over a request for access even led to the cancellation of a scheduled Joint Steering Committee meeting in November 2000, which the NCI program director considered a major setback to the program.

The criteria included such factors as the number, cost, and sustainability of created jobs, the involvement of industry, and whether the project could enhance Russian weapons technology.  The process then called for proposals to be reviewed by (1) one or more of three types of working groups; (2) a technical committee comprising government and nongovernment officials; and (3) other U.S. government agencies and offices within DOE with an interest in aid to Russia.", "DOE and national laboratory officials have told us, however, that the implementation of the project approval process to date has been inconsistent and \u201cad-hoc.\u201d  DOE officials told us that the program did not have documentation to show how approved projects had moved through the review process.  According to the NCI program director, projects were approved for funding without a comprehensive review process in order to implement the program quickly and engage the Russians.  In addition, although projects are reviewed by DOE and MINATOM through the workings of the Joint Steering Committee, MINATOM officials have not supported several of the major NCI projects, including the EBRD small business loan programs and the community development projects because they did not directly lead to sustainable jobs for weapons scientists. According to DOE officials, DOE and MINATOM have differing views about what the NCI program should be funding.  MINATOM believes that only projects that lead directly to jobs creation should be funded while DOE has asserted that many different activities\u2014in addition to jobs creation\u2014need to be addressed as part of the program.", "In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, the Congress directed that DOE establish and implement project review procedures for the NCI program before DOE would be allowed to obligate or expend all of its fiscal year 2001 appropriation.  The act specified that the procedures shall ensure that any scientific, technical, or commercial NCI project (1) will not enhance Russia\u2019s military or weapons of mass destruction capabilities; (2) will not result in the inadvertent transfer or utilization of products or activities under such project for military purposes; (3) will be commercially viable within 3 years; and (4) will be carried out in conjunction with an appropriate commercial, industrial, or nonprofit entity as partner.  In response, in January 2001, DOE issued new guidance for the NCI program that includes more detail on the project selection and approval process.  For example, the guidelines spell out the process by which DOE will review projects\u2014internally and with interagency assistance\u2014for any military application.  The review process is also supposed to confirm that scientific, technical, and commercial projects will have a partner and that they are commercially viable.  It is too early to tell how closely DOE will adhere to this project-approval process.

Since 1994, DOE has spent over $13 million on about 100 IPP projects in five nuclear cities, including the three nuclear cities participating in the NCI program\u2014Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk. According to IPP\u2019s Deputy Director, several of the projects have funded the development of promising technologies, such as prosthetic devices and medical implants, nuclear waste clean up technology, and portable monitoring devices to detect nuclear material.   He told us that these projects might be commercialized in the next few years.  One U.S. national laboratory official told us that there was not a clear distinction between the two programs, and other laboratory officials noted that some projects have been proposed for funding under both programs, shifted from one program to another, or have received funding from both programs.

The Directors of the NCI and IPP program told us that, in their opinion, there was nothing wrong with some overlap in projects or in sharing administrative functions.  The IPP program director told us that although he did not believe that the two programs were duplicative, there is potential for duplication to occur because both have a common approach for creating jobs in the nuclear cities.", "Some of the failures of the NCI commercial development projects may have been avoided if DOE had a common project approval process and had incorporated some of the elements of the IPP project selection process from the outset of the program.  In 1999, we recommended that DOE eliminate those IPP projects that did not have commercial potential. Subsequently, DOE implemented our recommendation and strengthened its project selection process.  IPP requires that all proposed projects have an industry partner to help ensure the commercial viability of each project.  The IPP program has also relied on the U.S. Industry Coalition to help evaluate and develop commercial projects.  In contrast, the NCI program has not established a similar relationship with the Coalition or any other industry group nor has it required an industry partner for its projects.  On March 21, 2001, DOE solicited the Coalition\u2019s support in disseminating information among its members about the Nuclear Cities Initiative.", "Most of NCI\u2019s initial commercial development projects would not likely have been approved under the IPP program\u2019s more rigorous approval process.  This is because unlike the IPP program, the NCI program did not require that projects have industry partners or demonstrate commercial viability until January 2001, when program guidance on the subject was issued.  In addition, the program has only recently begun to develop a more systematic process, as IPP has, for obtaining the views of business or industry experts on the commercial viability of projects.  According to the Deputy Director of the NCI program, DOE is now developing a contract with a consulting firm that will review proposed projects for commercial viability.", "In addition, the NCI program has recently adopted practices established under the IPP program regarding the funding of projects.  In January 2001, the NCI program required that 65 percent of all project funds be spent in Russia.  The guidance is similar to a congressional restriction on the IPP program, which mandates that no more than 35 percent of IPP funds may be obligated or spent by the national laboratories to carry out or provide oversight of any program activities.  Moreover, the IPP program has allocated funds to the national laboratories accompanied by approval letters that specify the exact amount of funding to be allocated (and spent) at the laboratories and in Russia.  A similar approval letter procedure has only recently been adopted for the NCI program.", "Although the programs have many similarities, the level of access to the nuclear cities granted to DOE officials is strikingly different, depending on which program they are representing.  For example, officials of the nuclear city of Snezhinsk do not allow DOE and national laboratory officials access to the restricted weapons institutes under NCI.  This restriction has impeded the implementation of a few NCI projects.  For example, a U.S. national laboratory official told us that he was not granted access to visit a weapons institute in Snezhinsk to observe the equipment being considered for use in an NCI project related to the development of fiber optics.

For example, ENCI plans to focus on environmental cleanup and energy-efficiency technology projects that Landau officials believe tap into the strengths of the weapons scientists in the two nuclear cities.  Italian officials do not believe that the cities possess sufficient commercial potential to develop sustainable business enterprises in the foreseeable future.

It also poses a daunting challenge.  The nuclear cities are geographically and economically isolated, access is restricted for security reasons, and weapons scientists are not accustomed to working for commercial businesses.  Thus, Western businesses are reluctant to invest in the nuclear cities.  However, the successful collaboration of a major U.S. computer firm in the Russian nuclear city of Sarov, without U.S. government assistance, is an example of what can be accomplished over time if the skills of Russia\u2019s weapons scientists are properly matched with the needs of business.", "Although DOE has had some modest successes with helping Russia create jobs for its weapons scientists and downsize its nuclear weapons complex, we believe that DOE needs to rethink its strategy.  A disproportionate percentage of program funds is being spent in the United States\u2014about 70 percent\u2014most of which are going to the U.S. national laboratories instead of to Russia.  This is also a major irritant to Russian officials who told us that if DOE is serious about creating jobs in the nuclear cities, a larger percentage of program funds should be spent in Russia.  A conference report on DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2001 appropriations has directed that no more than 49 percent of Nuclear Cities Initiative funds be spent in the United States and DOE has incorporated this goal into its program guidance.  DOE will have to more effectively monitor and control program spending to meet this goal.  We are encouraged that one U.S. national laboratory has negotiated lower overhead rates in order to put more resources in Russia and that DOE has taken steps, as a result of our review, to systematically track U.S. and Russian program expenditures. However, DOE has not developed the quantifiable program goals and milestones that are needed to track progress and make decisions about future program expansion to other nuclear cities and the level of resources needed to continue the program.", "About one-half of the NCI projects are not designed to create businesses or lead to sustainable employment but rather focus on infrastructure, community development, and other activities.  In our view, DOE needs to concentrate its limited program funding on those activities that will most realistically lead to sustainable employment for weapons scientists. Attempting to change the social fabric of the nuclear cities through community development projects, thereby making the cities more attractive to potential investors, may not be a realistic or affordable goal. Furthermore, industry representatives told us that the outcome of these types of projects would have little impact on a company\u2019s decision to invest in the nuclear cities.  Indeed, MINATOM and weapons institute officials from Sarov have questioned the value of community development projects because they do not create sustainable jobs in the nuclear cities.", "While we believe that the above changes are necessary to improve the implementation of NCI, in our view, a more fundamental question needs to be addressed by DOE.  Does the Department need two separate programs operating in Russia\u2019s nuclear cities with the same underlying goals and, in some cases, the same types of projects?  The IPP program and NCI share a common goal\u2014the employment of Russian weapons scientists in alternative, nonmilitary scientific or commercial activities.  Combining the two programs could alleviate many of the concerns we have with the implementation of NCI.  For example, the IPP program already has established limits on the amount of funds to be spent in the United States and Russia as well as a strengthened project review and selection process that focuses on the commercialization of projects and jobs creation. Furthermore, efficiencies might be gained by combining the administrative structures of both programs, particularly given that the overhead rates at most national laboratories are relatively high.  While we are encouraged that DOE has already taken some steps to reduce laboratory costs, there may be additional opportunities for cost savings in this area.  Ultimately, the success of DOE\u2019s efforts to create jobs for Russia\u2019s weapons scientists depends on industry\u2019s willingness to invest in the nuclear cities and elsewhere throughout Russia. We believe that there is a limit to what U.S. government assistance can do in this regard.  It is instructive to note that the proposed ENCI limits and targets its assistance because of the difficulty involved in creating sustainable commercial businesses in the nuclear cities.  We also believe that this is an appropriate time for the Department to take a closer look at the operations of both its programs and determine how they could work more efficiently and effectively as part of a more consolidated effort.

DOE\u2019s written comments are presented in appendix VII.  DOE concurred with our recommendations and provided technical comments that were incorporated in the report as appropriate. DOE provided additional comments on the following issues: (1) job creation and complex downsizing, (2) economic diversification, (3) the similarities between NCI and the IPP program, and (4) program metrics and project review.", "DOE noted that our report focused on job creation as the primary measure of NCI success or as the metric for individual activities.  In DOE\u2019s view, this reflects an inadequate appreciation of the goals of the program.  The program\u2019s goal is not simply funding the employment of weapons scientists but also downsizing Russia\u2019s weapons complex through economic diversification.  The outcome of this approach, DOE contends, is sustainable alternative nonweapons jobs that ultimately move scientists out of the weapons facilities.  We recognize that Congress has identified the objectives of the NCI program as being both job creation and downsizing Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons complex.  Although this report focuses more on job creation, we have identified, where appropriate, the downsizing of Russia\u2019s weapons complex as another objective of the program.  We have focused on the job creation objective for a number of reasons.  First, it is highlighted in the government-to-government agreement between the United States and Russia which states that the purpose of the NCI program is to create a framework for cooperation in facilitating civilian production that will provide new jobs for displaced workers in the nuclear cities.  Second, the Russian officials we met with told us that they are judging the NCI program by one standard\u2014the creation of sustainable jobs.  These Russian officials have criticized community development projects because these projects do not lead directly to employment opportunities or provide sustainable jobs for weapons scientists.  In addition, the industry representatives we talked to said that the outcomes of the community development projects would have little impact on their company\u2019s decision to invest in the nuclear cities.  We continue to believe that DOE needs to concentrate its limited program funding on those projects that will most realistically lead to sustainable employment for weapons scientists.", "Regarding economic diversification, DOE stated that MINATOM would prefer that funding be provided directly for major projects through a top down approach that reflects central planning.  According to DOE, successful economic diversification efforts in the United States have occurred based on active partnerships among government, industry, and the community, which support entrepreneurship and \u201cgrowth from below\u201d\u2014a goal endorsed by the NCI program.  In our view, DOE\u2019s premise that economic diversification approaches in Russia can be modeled after U.S. experiences may be misleading.  The economies and social and political structures of the two countries are not comparable.  As we noted in our report (1) international aid efforts have had difficulty promoting economic growth in Russia, (2) the country appears to be a long way from having a competitive market economy, and (3) Russia\u2019s transition experience over the past decade has been more difficult than expected. Regardless of the approach that is taken to stimulate economic development in the nuclear cities, we continue to believe that DOE faces a daunting challenge in meeting the ambitious goals of the NCI program.  We also continue to question, as we did in our 1999 report, whether DOE possesses the expertise needed to develop market-based economies in a formerly closed society.", "DOE also noted that our discussion of duplication between NCI and IPP reflects an incomplete understanding of the differing, but complementary, goals of the program.  DOE noted that IPP is an older program that focuses on the commercialization of technology inside the weapons institutes of the nuclear cities, while NCI focuses only in the municipal areas of the nuclear cities.  In DOE\u2019s view, it is not surprising that program managers at the national laboratories might seek funding for the same proposed activity from NCI and IPP.  According to DOE, scientists all over the world try to maximize their chances of receiving grants by applying to multiple sources, and such activity does not make NCI and IPP duplicative or automatic candidates for administrative consolidation.  While we recognize that differences exist in the implementation of both programs, both programs share a common underlying goal\u2014the employment of Russian weapons scientists in sustainable, alternative, nonmilitary scientific or commercial activities.  Therefore, we continue to question whether DOE needs two separate programs with two sets of similar project review procedures funding numerous similar types of projects in the nuclear cities.  As noted in the report, we found that some NCI projects have (1) been proposed for funding under both programs, (2) shifted from one program to another, or (3) received funding from both programs. Combining the two programs could also alleviate many of the concerns we have with NCI\u2019s implementation such as strengthening the project selection and review process.  Furthermore, we continue to believe that efficiencies might be gained by combining both programs.", "Finally, DOE noted that the Nuclear Cities Initiative is less than 2-1/2 years old and that project review processes and program metrics need time to mature and be fully implemented.  DOE stated that new project review procedures have been instituted to ensure effective coordination and that the program\u2019s performance is being measured.  While we recognize in the report that new procedures have recently been put into place, it is unclear to us why it took DOE over 2 years to develop and implement these procedures when similar procedures already existed under the IPP program.  As noted in the report, some of the failures of the NCI commercial development projects might have been avoided if DOE had a common project approval process and had incorporated some of the elements of the IPP project selection process from the outset of the program.  Concerning NCI\u2019s program metrics, we recognize in the report that DOE has performance measures, but we continue to believe that these measures require greater specificity.  For example, without specific targets, such as the number of scientists that DOE plans to help find jobs for, it is difficult to determine whether the program is on track to meets its long-term objectives.  DOE has concurred with our recommendation to establish quantifiable milestones that will more clearly gauge the NCI program\u2019s progress in the nuclear cities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the amount of NCI program funds spent in the United States and Russia, we obtained data from DOE\u2019s headquarters and the U.S. national laboratories.  Our task was complicated because DOE and the national laboratories were not systematically tracking these types of data. As a result, we developed, in cooperation with DOE\u2019s Nuclear Cities Initiative budget officer, a standardized format and agreed-upon definitions for capturing this information for each laboratory by various cost components, such as salary and benefits, overhead, and travel.  The format also was used to help identify program expenditures in the United States and Russia.  We reviewed the data submissions from the laboratories to ensure that the program expenditures were grouped by the appropriate expenditure categories.  We had numerous discussions with DOE and several national laboratories\u2019 financial officers to ensure that the data were consistent and conformed with agreed-upon definitions of what comprised U.S. and Russian costs.  In cooperation with the NCI program office, we reviewed all of the cost data submitted by the national laboratories to ensure that expenditures were consistently categorized.  In several instances, we worked directly with national laboratory program and finance officials to clarify and/or supplement cost data they had provided us with.", "To assess the NCI projects and their impact, we reviewed all of the projects that had been implemented by DOE.  We developed a list of projects from information provided by DOE and the U.S. national laboratories.  We made some judgments in order to arrive at a final list of projects to review.  For example, we excluded activities involving the development of strategic plans, workshops, and other support activities because, while these efforts support the program, we did not consider them to be projects in their own right.  In addition, we decided to consider all of the community development activities as one project because those activities involved relatively small expenditures of funds.  The NCI program staff concurred with these and other judgments we made about the projects. (See app. VI for a list of projects reviewed.)", "To assess the impact of the NCI projects, we used, whenever possible, the information contained in DOE\u2019s NCI database to determine the extent to which each project focused on critical nonproliferation objectives, such as the number of weapons scientists engaged in the project and its potential commercialization benefits.  However, we found that the database did not always contain current information.  We also met or spoke with the principal investigator for each project or a representative who was familiar with the project.  We discussed how projects were meeting these objectives and what role the investigator played in meeting these objectives.  We met or spoke with officials from the following national laboratories to discuss NCI projects:  Argonne National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, National Energy Technology Laboratory, Westinghouse Savannah River Company, and the Kansas City Plant.  We also met with representatives from DOE to discuss those projects that were being managed by DOE\u2019s headquarters.  During the course of our work, we also met with or had discussions with officials from the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Industry Coalition, Inc., the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.", "In several instances, we contacted industry officials to follow up on the status of commercialization activities and obtain their views about trying to start businesses in the nuclear cities.  For example, we discussed selected projects and related commercial activities with officials from ADAPCO, Fresenius Medical Care, Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe), Motorola, Oracle, Intel Corporation, and Delphi Automotive Systems.  We toured the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF) Software Technology Laboratory in Sarov, which is the company that a Western firm contracts with for software development.", "We visited Russia in September 2000 to meet with MINATOM officials in Moscow, including the first deputy minister.  We traveled to Sarov to meet with representatives from VNIIEF and Avangard, the weapons assembly facility that is located in Sarov.  During our visit to Sarov, we asked to visit the Avangard facility, but our request was denied.  While in Sarov, we visited the Open Computing Center and met with numerous weapons scientists who were working there.   We also visited the Analytical Center for Nonproliferation (one of the projects) and VNIIEF Conversia, the organization that seeks to develop commercial ventures in the city.  We also met with the deputy mayor of Sarov to learn more about the economic and social conditions in that city.   We also met with representatives from the nuclear city of Snezhinsk during our visit to Moscow.", "To obtain information about the status of the European Nuclear Cities Initiative, we visited Rome, Italy, and Brussels, Belgium, in January 2001.

EBRD is using local branches of Sberbank, which is the largest commercial bank in Russia, to implement the loan program in the cities.  As of the end of December 2000, EBRD had spent about $440,000 of the $1.5 million.  About 74 percent of those expenditures paid for the salaries of the EBRD employees who set up the loan programs and act as consultants.  The remaining expenditures were used to train and employ 10 new loan officers hired from within the cities, train other potential loan officers, and cover standard operating expenses, such as office rent, communications, and travel.", "EBRD requested NCI funds to cover the administrative costs of the loan programs for the first 18 months of operation.  Thereafter, the expectation is that the programs will be self-sustaining on the basis of the proceeds from loan repayments.  According to the EBRD representative responsible for overseeing the loan programs, the bank is likely to request an extension from DOE if it has not spent the $1.5 million by the end of the 18-month period.", "The new loan departments in the Sberbank branches may borrow from EBRD\u2019s existing $300 million Russian Small Business Fund.  While EBRD has not set aside loan capital specifically for the three cities, business owners in Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk are now able to work with local loan officers to compete with other Russian businesses for micro loans (up to $30,000) and small loans (up to $125,000) from EBRD. Applicants can receive both a micro and small loan at the same time.", "As of the end of February 2001, EBRD had issued 279 loans totaling over $1,080,000. Nearly all of the loans were micro loans, and the average size was $3,879.  EBRD reported that none of the loans were in arrears more than 30 days.  The EBRD representative responsible for the program has projected that the level of loan activity will increase from about 30 loans per month in late 2000 to 130 per month by June 2002.  If that level of activity is reached, the bank estimates that it will have issued over 1,600 loans totaling about $9 million by June 2002.  The representative also told us in February 2001 that she expected a total of 18 loan officers to be employed in the cities in the near future.", "DOE does not have good information on whether loan recipients were former weapons institute employees.  What the Department has learned about the loan recipients in Snezhinsk\u2014which it believes is representative of the three cities\u2014suggests that most of the loans have gone to small retail and wholesale businesses, including food and household goods merchants.  Information supplied by EBRD for loans in Snezhinsk through July 2000 showed that about one-third of the recipients were former institute engineers, physicists, or computer specialists, including some who left the institute in the early 1990s.  According to the EBRD representative, the bank does not target loans to specific types of businesses, nor is EBRD concerned about placing limits on who is employed in the businesses that receive loans.  The bank is interested in helping to create a sound economy in the cities that will include businesses that might employ spouses or children of weapons scientists and not just weapons scientists themselves.  As EBRD has sufficient loan funds, it does not see any reason to ration these funds to a specific group while denying access to others, given that any economic activity in the cities is a benefit.  The representative also said that EBRD probably would not have gone into Sarov, Snezhinsk, or Zheleznogorsk without NCI support.", "A former NCI staff person who was responsible for overseeing the grant to EBRD wrote that because virtually all inhabitants of the cities are employees of the institutes or dependents of employees, loans to small retail businesses are helping to foster entrepreneurial skills among institute employees or their dependents.  In addition, the loan programs are helping to diversify the economy of the cities.  Russian officials were critical of the loan program.  According to a Deputy Director at VNIIEF, there was no coordination with the institute on the decision for NCI to support the loan program.  He also said that the EBRD loans do not play a role in restructuring the VNIIEF workforce.", "The First Deputy Director of MINATOM told us that in his view, the EBRD loan program is inefficient.  He noted that the loans are small and the interest rates high (about 38 percent).  The bank loans result in a very fast turnover of capital and do not result in production facilities that create self-sustaining enterprises.  In his view, butcher shops and flower shops are good, but they do not resolve the fundamental problem of promoting self-sufficiency for weapons scientists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Successful Commercial Venture Established in Sarov Without U.S. Government Assistance", "paragraphs": ["During the course of our review, we found that a major U.S. computer company employs former weapons scientists in Sarov and has done so without U.S. government assistance.  According to the company official responsible for the work in Sarov, in the early 1990s, a Russian-speaking employee of the company who was familiar with the skills available in the nuclear cities pursued the idea of starting an operation in Russia.  A representative of the U.S. company met with officials from Sarov and determined that the company could benefit by taking advantage of the scientists\u2019 skills in mathematics and attractive salary scale.  Over the past 7 years, the number of former weapons scientists under contract to the U.S. company has grown from less than 10 to about 100.  Although the software operation in Sarov is partly owned by the weapons institute in that city\u2014the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics\u2014the scientists are no longer employed by the weapons institute. When we visited the software operation in September 2000, we were told that the employees work full time and that their salaries are up to three times what they had been paid at the weapons institute.", "The official who oversees the work in Sarov also told us that other technology firms have expressed an interest in working in the closed cities but have not made the commitment.  He said that, while his company has been very pleased with the productivity of the operation in Sarov, it is difficult for Western companies to work in Russia because of language problems, restricted access, and the lack of a relationship with the Russian government.  For example, gaining access to Sarov on a regular basis has been difficult for his company, although it has become easier.  He believes that the NCI program can help Western businesses overcome these obstacles by, among other things, keeping channels of communication open with MINATOM and nuclear city officials.  At the same time, he suggested that the program should concentrate its efforts on projects that will play to the strengths of the Russians.  For example, he believes that projects that attempt to link the research and analytical skills of the scientists with the needs of Western companies will be more likely to succeed than projects that attempt to start new commercial ventures in the closed cities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Denials of Access Requests to Three of Russia\u2019s Nuclear Cities", "paragraphs": ["This appendix presents information on 25 instances since 1999 in which the Russian government denied requests for access to nuclear cities made by DOE staff and others.
