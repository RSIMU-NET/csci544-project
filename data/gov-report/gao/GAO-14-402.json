HUD's RAD program was created in 2011 to preserve affordable housing by, among other things, allowing owners to convert these tenant-protection vouchers to project-based vouchers for units in three designated HUD programs.

In contrast, residents with project-based vouchers can only benefit from the assistance if they remain in the specific unit. As of March 1, 2014, property owners had converted a total of 6,670 units to project-based vouchers in nine states. The percentage of vouchers that are project-based including RAD conversions was 3.81 percent, and without RAD, would have been 3.45 percent. Further, the impact of these conversions on the overall long-term percentage of project-based vouchers will be small because the conversions are limited to the remaining 38,000 units assisted through the three designated HUD programs, which is relatively small compared to the over 2 million total outstanding vouchers.

HUD used the rental  assistance provided by these programs\u2014referred to as covered programs  in our report\u2014with other subsidies to develop affordable housing from the  1960s through the 1980s. Although these programs are no longer used to  develop new units, many properties subsidized under these programs  continue to offer rental assistance to eligible low-income residents today.  However, upon contract expiration, owners of these properties will have  few options for renewing the assistance and will no longer be required to  maintain affordable rents or make their units available to low-income  residents.", "HUD\u2019s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program was created, in  part, to respond to this concern. Prior to the creation of RAD in 2011,  HUD had limited authority to extend the availability of rental assistance at  these properties when the contracts expired (or owners terminated them).  However, HUD would make tenant-protection vouchers available to the  residents living in these units to keep their rents affordable and prevent  them from being displaced. Tenant-protection vouchers are \u201ctenant- based\u201d\u2014that is, tied to the resident, not the unit. When the resident with a  tenant-protection voucher leaves the unit, rental assistance is no longer  available at that unit. As a result, the number of permanent housing units  that target low-income residents and offer subsidized rents declines.", "Among other things, the RAD program allows the owners of properties  receiving rental assistance under the covered programs to convert these  tenant-protection vouchers to project-based vouchers upon contract  expiration or termination. As preservation of affordable housing is one of  HUD\u2019s goals for its housing policies, project-based vouchers tie the  assistance to the property\u2014and preserve the property\u2019s long-term  affordability\u2014because residents with project-based vouchers can only  benefit from the subsidy if they remain in the specific unit. The  conversions result in a contract between the property owners and a public  housing agency (PHA), which administers the program. These  conversions are also intended to allow property owners to leverage  private debt and equity in order to address immediate capital needs.", "The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012  mandated that we review the long-term impact of conversions under RAD  on the ratio of project-based vouchers to tenant-based vouchers. This  report examines (1) how HUD has implemented RAD conversions of  tenant-protection vouchers to project-based vouchers for properties under  the covered programs; (2) how these conversions are expected to affect  the long-term percentage of project-based vouchers and costs to the  voucher program; and (3) how these conversions have affected selected  converted units and the housing choices available to assisted residents.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed and assessed HUD guidance  and procedures for implementing the RAD program. Specifically, to  describe how HUD has implemented conversions of the covered  programs under RAD, we reviewed HUD\u2019s RAD notices and guidance on  processes and procedures the agency uses to process applications  submitted for conversions. We compared HUD\u2019s guidance and  procedures to the applicable federal internal control standards. We also  selected nine properties in four geographically diverse locations that  converted assistance to project-based vouchers, and we interviewed  HUD field office staff who had worked on those conversions. To describe  how conversions have affected the percentage of project-based vouchers  to tenant-based vouchers and costs to the voucher program, we obtained  and analyzed HUD data on conversions and data on the total number of  tenant-based and project-based vouchers as of March 1, 2014. We  assessed the reliability of the data by verifying that data fields, such as  the total number of units in a property, total number of units converted to  project-based vouchers, and dates for conversions, were reasonable and  consistent with our data request, and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report. We also obtained and  analyzed documentation from HUD to determine the impact of these  conversions on the budget. To determine how the conversions have  affected selected converted units and the housing choices available to  assisted residents, we interviewed the five property owners (or their  representatives) for the nine converted properties we selected, and we  interviewed assisted residents from the converted properties where  possible. We also interviewed officials representing property owners and  PHAs from the Council for Large Public Housing Authorities, the Public  Housing Authorities Directors Association, the National Association of  Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the National Affordable Housing  Management Association, and the National Leased Housing Association.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 through April  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The  RAD program provides HUD the opportunity to test the conversion of  units subsidized under HUD\u2019s public housing and certain other programs  to long-term (typically 15 to 20 years), project-based voucher or rental  assistance contracts\u2014two forms of rental assistance that tie the  assistance to the unit in order to provide subsidized housing to low- income residents. The goals of the RAD program include maintaining the  affordability of federally assisted rental properties and improving their  physical and financial condition. Specifically, property owners and PHAs  (for the public housing program) can leverage the subsidy payments  under the newly converted contracts to raise capital through private debt  and equity investments to make improvements. The RAD program  consists of two components. The first component focuses on the  voluntary conversion of public housing properties, while the second  component of RAD\u2014and the focus of our review\u2014addresses the  following programs that provide subsidized rents to residents. The  project-based contracts under these programs\u2014generally between HUD  and the owners of private rental housing\u2014were entered into in the 1960s,  1970s, and 1980s, typically for terms of 15, 20, or 40 years. New  contracts cannot be authorized under these programs, and current  contracts are either not eligible for renewal or have limited contract  renewal provisions.", "The Rent Supp program was authorized in Section 101 of the Housing  and Urban Development Act of 1965, which authorized rent  supplements on behalf of needy tenants living in privately owned  housing and was the first project-based assistance program for  mortgages insured by HUD\u2019s Office of Housing. Eligible tenants pay  30 percent of the rent or 30 percent of their income toward the rent,  whichever is greater. The Rent Supp program provides payments  directly to the project owner to cover the difference between the  tenant\u2019s payment and the HUD-approved rent. Rental assistance  under Rent Supp contracts is not eligible for renewal.", "The RAP program was established by the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1974 to provide additional rental assistance  subsidies to property owners on behalf of very low-income tenants.  RAP was available only to Section 236 properties and was the  predecessor of the project-based Section 8 program. Eligible tenants  under the RAP program generally pay 30 percent of their monthly  adjusted income or 10 percent of gross income toward rents,  whichever is greater. HUD pays the difference between the tenant  payment and the HUD-approved rent directly to the owner. Rental  assistance under RAP contracts is not eligible for renewal.", "The Mod Rehab program provides project-based rental assistance for  low-income families and is intended for housing units that require a  moderate level of repair. Contracts under the Mod Rehab program are  between the owner and PHA. Eligible tenants generally pay 30  percent of their monthly adjusted income toward rents. PHAs pay the  difference between the tenant payment and the approved rent directly  to the owner. Mod Rehab projects with expiring housing assistance  payment contracts are eligible for renewal, but renewal options are  limited in that the assistance is generally only renewed in the form of a  1-year contract, which makes it difficult for property owners to secure  financing for capital improvements.", "Under RAD, owners may elect to apply for a long-term, project-based  voucher contract for their property rather than have PHAs provide eligible  residents tenant-protection vouchers when a property\u2019s rental assistance  contract with HUD (or with a PHA in the case of the Mod Rehab program)  expires or the contract is terminated due to prepayment of the mortgage  (in the case of Rent Supp and RAP). Tenant-protection vouchers are a  type of assistance provided under the Housing Choice Voucher (voucher)  program. The voucher program pays subsidies to property owners to help  very low- and extremely low-income households rent units on the private  market. The voucher program currently serves over 2 million  households. PHAs administer the program on HUD\u2019s behalf, including  special-purpose vouchers, such as tenant-protection, and project-based  vouchers. Eligible owners apply to HUD to request approval for the  conversions and must take specific steps and meet certain criteria, such  as notifying residents of the conversions, obtaining consent from each  resident who has already received a tenant-protection voucher in order to  convert their unit, and passing housing-quality-standards inspections for  the units proposed for conversion. Once approved, the conversions  allow the owners to convert their current assistance to long-term, project- based voucher contracts.", "After the conversion, if residents decide to move, they would lose their  assistance because it is tied to the unit. However, project-based vouchers  provide a mobility option for residents. The mobility option for residents  allows them to apply for a tenant-based voucher from their local PHA and  be placed at the top of the PHA\u2019s wait list for tenant-based vouchers after  having resided in the converted unit for 1 year. The ability of residents to  relocate, however, is subject to the availability of vouchers from the PHA.", "As of March 2014, HUD had approved project-based voucher funding for  a total of 8,014 units, of which 6,670 units (61 properties) had their rental  assistance converted to project-based voucher assistance through RAD.  There is a high concentration of conversions in certain geographic areas  due to the Rent Supp and RAP programs being concentrated in these  areas. Specifically, a large percentage of conversions have taken place in  New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey (see fig. 1).  Approximately 38,000 affordable housing units continue to be assisted  under the Rent Supp, RAP, and Mod Rehab programs.

As a result, the percent of  project-based vouchers increased slightly from 3.45 to 3.81 percent (see  table 1).", "RAD conversions can have a larger impact on the percentage of project- based vouchers for smaller PHAs compared to larger PHAs. For  example, the Brockton Housing Authority (Massachusetts)\u2014a smaller  local PHA\u2014had a total of 61 project-based vouchers prior to RAD  conversions of rental assistance under the covered programs. This PHA  now administers an additional 463 project-based vouchers for three  properties that converted rental assistance, for a total of 524 project- based vouchers out of 1,716 total vouchers. Since it has a small portfolio  of vouchers, the percentage of vouchers that are project-based increased  from about 5 percent to about 31 percent. Conversely, the percentage of  project-based vouchers for the Michigan State Housing Development  Authority\u2014a larger state PHA\u2014changed only slightly. This housing  agency added 495 vouchers to their 2,075 project-based vouchers, for a  total of 2,570 project-based vouchers. Since this PHA has a larger  portfolio of vouchers (24,113 total vouchers), the increase of project- based vouchers as a result of RAD did not substantially impact the  percentage of project-based vouchers, increasing it from about 9 percent  to about 11 percent.

The  remaining active contracts for the Rent Supp, RAP, and Mod Rehab  programs include about 38,000 units, which is relatively small compared  to the over 2 million vouchers currently assisting low-income residents.  Further, not all of the units are likely to be converted to project-based  vouchers.

HUD documentation on the  conversion process shows that HUD uses the same calculation for  providing budget authority for the project-based vouchers converted  under RAD as it does for calculating budget authority for the tenant- protection vouchers. Specifically, when HUD issues tenant-protection  vouchers to protect residents from rent increases upon the expiration of  rental assistance, a local PHA with jurisdiction in the area is selected to  administer the tenant-based vouchers. HUD then determines the budget  authority for these vouchers by calculating the PHA\u2019s average per-unit  per-month cost of all the vouchers, and multiplying that amount by the  number of eligible households receiving tenant-protection vouchers. That  funding is then added to the PHA\u2019s voucher budget authority.", "For example, for a property that converted to project-based vouchers  under RAD in the state of Washington, a total of 35 units were eligible for  conversion to project-based vouchers upon expiration of a Rent Supp  contract on July 31, 2013. The average per-unit per-month cost of that  property\u2019s administering PHA\u2019s voucher program was $475. Therefore,  the total cost of the tenant-protection vouchers per month would have  been $16,625 (35 residents x $475). Because RAD allows for the  conversion of tenant-protection vouchers to project-based voucher  contracts, HUD used the same exact calculation to fund the 35 project- based vouchers that were funded for this property. As such, conversions  of the tenant-protection vouchers to project-based vouchers under RAD  would result in the same amount used to fund the project-based vouchers  that would have funded the tenant-protection vouchers. Additionally,  tenant-based and project-based voucher subsidies are generally subject  to the same payment standard limits. The subsidies are based on  payment standards that cannot exceed 110 percent of the fair-market rent  established by HUD for standard rental housing given the unit size the  voucher will be used for in that area.", "Program requirements that allow assisted households with project-based  vouchers to move to a different unit will not add to the cost of these  conversions. According to project-based voucher regulations, residents  with a converted project-based voucher can move after a year of residing  in the unit and be eligible for a tenant-based voucher. The project-based  voucher would remain available for another eligible household, and the  household intending to move would be placed on the PHA\u2019s waitlist for  the next voucher that becomes available (i.e., after another voucher  holder exits the program).

Specifically, this report examines (1) how HUD has  implemented RAD conversions of tenant-protection vouchers to project- based vouchers under the covered programs; (2) how these conversions  are expected to affect the long-term percentage of project-based  vouchers and costs to the voucher program; and (3) how these  conversions have affected selected converted units and the housing  choices available to residents.", "To examine how HUD has implemented conversions to project-based  vouchers, we reviewed RAD program notices and documentation on  processes and procedures the agency uses to process applications  submitted for conversions. We also reviewed documentation on what  information HUD collects for the conversions and how the conversions  are tracked throughout the various stages of the application process. We  also reviewed HUD\u2019s online RAD resources and webinars for explaining  the RAD program. We compared HUD\u2019s guidance and procedures to the  applicable federal internal control standards. We selected nine properties  in four geographically diverse locations (California, Massachusetts,  Michigan, and New York) that participated in the conversions, and we  spoke with cognizant officials from the HUD field offices in these  locations. We selected the nine properties to reflect a mix of properties  that have converted under RAD based on the following factors: (1)  number or units converted at the property; (2) the program that the  property was receiving rental assistance under (Rent Supp, RAP, or Mod  Rehab); (3) the location of the property (urban or nonurban); and (4)  geographic dispersion.", "To describe how conversions have affected the percentage of project- based vouchers to tenant-based vouchers, we obtained and analyzed  HUD data on conversions and vouchers. The voucher data included the  total number of tenant-based and project-based vouchers and the number  of project-based vouchers created as a result of RAD conversions as of  March 1, 2014. We calculated the percentage of vouchers that are  project-based and assessed the extent to which RAD conversions to  project-based vouchers affected the percentage. We assessed the  reliability of RAD and voucher data by verifying data fields, such as the  total number of units in a property, total number of units converted to  project-based vouchers, and dates for conversions. We also performed  other electronic tests, such as comparing data to different sources, and  we conducted interviews with knowledgeable agency officials. We found  that RAD conversion and voucher data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We also obtained and analyzed documentation from HUD to  determine the impact of these conversions on the budget. Specifically, we  examined HUD documentation on conversions to project-based vouchers  and the costs of funding tenant-protection vouchers (absent RAD) when  the rental assistance would have expired compared to the funding of  project-based vouchers (through the RAD conversion). We also  interviewed public housing agency (PHA) and HUD officials regarding the  potential impact of the conversions on the costs of the voucher program.", "To examine how the conversions have affected selected converted units  and the housing choices available to residents, we conducted  nongeneralizable interviews with the five property owners (or their  representatives) representing the nine converted properties we selected,  and we interviewed residents from the three converted properties we  visited as we were able to schedule meetings with residents on-site. We  also interviewed officials from the PHAs administering the vouchers for  the converted properties and HUD field office staff who oversaw the  conversions for the nine selected properties. Additionally, we interviewed  officials representing property owners and PHAs, such as the Council for  Large Public Housing Authorities, the Public Housing Authorities Directors  Association, the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment  Officials, the National Affordable Housing Management Association, and  the National Leased Housing Association.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 to April 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
