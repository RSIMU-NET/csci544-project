Threats to satellites from both adversaries\u2014 such as jamming and cyber attacks\u2014and space debris are increasing. DOD is making changes to how it designs its space systems to increase the resilience and survivability of space capabilities. But it has been challenged in adopting new approaches, such as using commercial satellites to host payloads, and in prioritizing cybersecurity for all of its weapon systems. For hosted payloads, GAO recommended, and DOD concurred, that the department bolster and centralize collection and analysis of cost, technical, and lessons learned data.", "Implementing leadership changes . DOD is planning major changes to leadership for space. It recently proposed legislation to establish a United States Space Force\u2014initially to be housed within the Department of the Air Force\u2014that would, according to the President's Space Policy Directive, consolidate existing military space activities and minimize duplicative efforts across DOD. GAO found in July 2016 that changes are needed to reduce fragmentation that has negatively affected space programs for many years. But open questions remain about governance as new programs get underway and whether the changes themselves may result in further fragmentation. For example, it is unclear at this time how the new Space Development Agency will mesh with organizations currently involved in testing and acquiring new space technologies.", "Having the right resources and know-how . While there is increased attention on funding for space and building the Space Force, new programs can still face resource challenges. DOD has begun over 9 new space programs at a time when it is also seeking increased investments in ships, aircraft, and the nuclear triad, among other programs. Moreover, it is unclear whether DOD has a sufficient workforce to manage its new programs. GAO issued a report earlier this month that found DOD does not routinely monitor the size, mix, and location of its space acquisition workforce. Further, DOD has difficulty attracting and retaining candidates with the requisite technical expertise. GAO recommended that DOD collect and maintain data on its space acquisition workforce. DOD did not concur, but GAO maintains that DOD should have better information on such personnel, especially in light of its proposal for establishing the Space Force. GAO also found in March 2019 that key software-intensive space programs often did not effectively engage users to understand requirements and obtain feedback.

These capabilities include  positioning, navigation, and timing; meteorology; missile warning; and  secure communications, among others. Space systems can take a long  time to develop and involve multiple segments, including space, ground  control stations, terminals, user equipment, and launch, as figure 1 below  shows. DOD satellite systems are also expensive to acquire. Unit costs  for current DOD satellites can range from $500 million to over $3 billion.  The associated ground systems can cost over $6 billion to develop and  maintain and the cost to launch a satellite can climb to well over $100  million.", "Table 1 provides highlights of the current status of DOD\u2019s major space  programs. As the table shows, DOD is also in the beginning phases of  acquiring several constellations of new satellites and ground processing  capabilities\u2014including for missile warning, protected communications,  space-based environmental monitoring, and space command and control.  We have work underway to assess the Air Force\u2019s space command and  control development efforts and examine DOD\u2019s analysis of alternatives  for wideband communication services. For a more complete description of  these major space programs, see appendix I. In addition, DOD is  exploring alternatives for acquiring wideband satellite communications as  well as funding development of new launch vehicles as it pursues a new  acquisition strategy for procuring launch services.", "Our prior work has shown that many major DOD space programs have  experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. For instance,  the total program cost for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency  (AEHF) satellite program, a protected satellite communications system,  has grown 117 percent since the program\u2019s original cost estimate and its  first satellite was launched more than 3.5 years late. For the Space Based  Infrared System (SBIRS), a missile warning satellite program, the  program cost grew 265 percent from its original estimate and the launch  of the first satellite was delayed roughly 9 years. Both programs moved to  the production phase where fewer problems tend to surface, and where  there is typically less risk of significant cost and schedule growth. A more  recent major satellite program, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, has  seen an almost 4-year delay due to technical issues and program cost  growth of about 32 percent.", "Cost and schedule growth has also been a challenge for satellite ground  systems and user equipment. Ground system delays have been so  lengthy, that satellites sometimes spend years in orbit before key  capabilities can be fully exploited. For example,", "The command and control system for GPS III satellites, known as the  Next Generation Operational Control System, or OCX, is  approximately 5 years behind schedule. As a result, the Air Force has  had to start two separate back-up efforts to modify the current ground  system to ensure the continuity of GPS capabilities and to make anti- jamming capabilities available via Military Code, or M-code, until OCX  is delivered. Our ongoing review of GPS includes an assessment of  OCX schedule risk and potential impacts on OCX delivery,  acceptance, and operation. We expect to issue our report on GPS in  spring 2019.", "Development of GPS user equipment that can utilize the M-Code  signal has lagged behind the fielding of GPS M-code satellites for  more than a decade, due to prolonged development challenges. In  December 2017, we found that while DOD had made some progress  on initial testing of the receiver cards needed to utilize the M-code  signal, additional development was necessary to make M-code work  with the over 700 weapon systems that require it. We also found that  DOD had begun initial planning to transition some weapon systems to  use M-code receivers, but significantly more work remained to  understand the cost and schedule of transitioning to M-code receivers  across DOD. Further, in December 2017, we found that multiple  entities were separately maturing their own receiver cards. We  recommended that DOD assign responsibility to a single organization  to collect test data, lessons learned, and design solutions so that  common design solutions are employed and DOD could avoid  duplication of efforts. DOD concurred with the recommendation, but  has not yet taken action on it.", "We have previously reported that over 90 percent of the capabilities to  be provided by Mobile User Objective System communications   satellites\u2014currently, five satellites are in orbit, the first of which  launched in 2012\u2014are being underutilized because of difficulties with  integrating the space, ground, and terminal segments and delays in  fielding compatible user terminals.", "Largely because of technical and management challenges, the Joint  Space Operations Center Mission System (JMS) Increment 2  program\u2014intended to replace and improve upon an aging space  situational awareness and command and control system\u2014was almost  3 years behind schedule and 42 percent over budget before the Air  Force stopped development work last year. Earlier this month, we  reported that operational testing in 2018 found that JMS Increment 2  was not operationally effective or suitable due, in part, to missing  software requirements, urgent deficiencies that affected system  performance, and negative user feedback.", "Cost and schedule growth in DOD\u2019s space programs is sometimes driven  by the inherent risks associated with developing complex space  technology; however, over the past 10 years we have identified a number  of other management and oversight problems that have worsened the  situation. These include making overly optimistic cost and schedule  estimates, pushing programs forward without sufficient knowledge about  technology and design, and experiencing problems in overseeing and  managing contractors, among others. We have also noted that some of  DOD\u2019s programs with operational satellites, such as SBIRS, were also  exceedingly ambitious, which in turn increased technology, design, and  engineering risks. While SBIRS and other satellite programs provide  users with important and useful capabilities, their cost growth has  significantly limited the department\u2019s buying power at a time when more  resources may be needed to protect space systems and recapitalize the  space portfolio."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Facing Acquisitions of New Space Systems", "paragraphs": ["DOD faces significant challenges as it replenishes its satellite  constellations. First, DOD is confronted with growing threats in space,  which may require very different satellite architectures and acquisition  strategies. Second, DOD is in the midst of planning major changes to its  leadership for space. While these changes are designed to streamline  decision-making and bring together a dispersed space workforce, they could cause some disruption to space system acquisition programs.  Third, in fiscal year 2016, Congress gave DOD authority to speed up  acquisition timeframes by streamlining acquisition processes and  oversight. GAO is examining DOD\u2019s application of streamlining to its  weapons programs. For space, challenges with past streamlining efforts  may offer some lessons learned. And fourth, DOD may face resource and  capacity challenges in taking on multiple space acquisitions at one time.  For example, our work and other reports point to potential gaps in the  space acquisition workforce and ongoing difficulties managing software  development."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Growing Threats to Satellites Require New Approaches", "paragraphs": ["According to Air Force Space Command and others, U.S. space systems  face intentional and unintentional threats that have increased rapidly over  the past 20 years. These include radio frequency interference (including  jamming), laser attacks, kinetic intercept vehicles, and ground system  attacks. Additionally, the hazards of the already-harsh space environment  (e.g., extreme temperature fluctuations and radiation) have increased,  including numbers of active and inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies,  and other fragments and debris. According to a February 2019 Defense  Intelligence Agency report, China and Russia in particular are developing  a variety of means to exploit perceived U.S. reliance on space-based  systems and challenge the U.S. position in space. The report also states  that Iran and North Korea have demonstrated some counterspace  capabilities that could pose a threat to militaries using space-based  services.", "In response, recent governmentwide and DOD strategic and policy  guidance have stressed the need for U.S. space systems to be survivable  or resilient against such threats and DOD has taken steps to be more  resilient in some of its new programs. As we found in October 2014, one  way to do this is to build more disaggregated systems, including  dispersing sensors onto separate satellites; using multiple domains,  including space, air, and ground to provide full mission capabilities;  hosting payloads on other government or commercial spacecraft; or some  combination of these. With capabilities distributed across multiple  platforms, rather than centralized onto just a few satellites, it may be more  difficult for an adversary to target all assets to attack full system  capabilities, and if an attack does take place, the loss of one smaller  satellite or payload could result in less capability loss than damage to, or  loss of, a large multifunctional satellite. In addition to disaggregation,  DOD could make satellites more maneuverable and build in defense  capabilities to protect themselves as a means to increase survivability.", "We also found in October 2014 that some of these options could have  beneficial impacts on acquisition. For example, acquiring smaller, less  complex satellites may require less time and effort to develop and  produce. This may be in part due to improved requirements discipline, as  more frequent production rates may allow program managers to delay  new requirements to the next production cycle instead of incorporating  them into ongoing timelines midstream. Building more, less-complex  satellites might also provide DOD the opportunity to use commercial  products and systems that have already been tested in the market. At the  same time, however, addressing the need to make satellites more  resilient could introduce complications. For example, DOD may need to  acquire higher quantities of satellites, which may make it more difficult to  manage acquisition schedules. In addition, potentially more development  and production contracts may result in more complexity for program  offices to manage, requiring increased oversight of contractors. Adding  more satellites and new technologies may also complicate efforts to  synchronize satellite, terminal, and ground system schedules, limiting  delivery of capabilities to end users.", "Our work has also found potential barriers to making satellites more  resilient. For example, in October 2014, we found that disaggregation  could require DOD to make significant cultural and process changes in  how it acquires space systems\u2014for instance, by relying on new  contractors, relinquishing control to providers who host government  payloads on commercial satellites, using different contracting methods,  and executing smaller but more numerous and faster-paced acquisition  programs. It will likely require DOD to be more flexible and agile when it  comes to satellite acquisitions, especially with regard to coordinating  satellite delivery with interdependent systems, such as user equipment.  Yet, as we have previously found, DOD\u2019s culture has generally been  resistant to changes in space acquisition approaches, and fragmented  responsibilities have made it very difficult to coordinate and deliver interdependent systems. Senior leaders have recognized the need to  change the space acquisition culture, and as discussed below, changes  are being made to space leadership and acquisition approaches.", "More recently, in July 2018, we found that two factors have contributed to  DOD\u2019s limited use of commercially hosted payloads. First, DOD officials  identified logistical challenges to matching government payloads with any  given commercial host satellite. For example, most of the offices we  spoke with cited size, weight, and power constraints, among others, as  barriers to using hosted payloads. Second, while individual DOD offices  have realized cost and schedule benefits from using hosted payloads,  DOD as a whole has limited information on costs and benefits of hosted  payloads. Further, the knowledge DOD obtained is fragmented across the  agency\u2014with multiple offices collecting piecemeal information on the use  of hosted payloads. The limited knowledge and data on hosted payloads  that is fragmented across the agency has contributed to resistance  among space acquisition officials to adopting this approach. We  recommended, and DOD concurred, that the department bolster and  centralize collection and analysis of cost, technical, and lessons learned  data on its use of hosted payloads.", "Lastly, in October 2018, we found that DOD faced mounting challenges in  protecting its weapon systems\u2014satellites and their ground systems  included\u2014from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. We reported  that this was due to the computerized nature of weapon systems, DOD\u2019s  late start in prioritizing weapon system cybersecurity, and DOD\u2019s nascent  understanding of how to develop more secure weapon systems. In  operational testing, DOD routinely found mission-critical cyber  vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program  officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and even  discounted some test results as unrealistic. Using relatively simple tools  and techniques, testers were able to take control of systems and operate  largely undetected, due in part to basic issues such as poor password  management and unencrypted communications. DOD has recently taken  several steps to improve weapon system cybersecurity, including issuing  and revising policies and guidance to better incorporate cybersecurity  considerations. Further, in response to congressional direction, DOD has  also begun initiatives to better understand and address cyber  vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Space Leadership Changes Are a Positive Step, But Have Some Risk", "paragraphs": ["We and others have reported for over two decades that fragmentation  and overlap in DOD space acquisition management and oversight have  contributed to program delays and cancellations, cost increases, and  inefficient operations. For example, in February 2012 we found that  fragmented leadership contributed to a 10-year gap between the delivery  of GPS satellites and associated user equipment. The cancellations of  several large programs over the past 2 decades were in part because of  disagreements and conflicts among stakeholders.", "In July 2016, in response to a provision of a Senate Report  accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2016, we issued a report that reviewed space leadership in more  depth and concluded that DOD space leadership was fragmented. We  identified approximately 60 stakeholder organizations across DOD, the  Executive Office of the President, the Intelligence Community, and civilian  agencies. Of these, eight organizations had space acquisition  management responsibilities; eleven had oversight responsibilities; and  six were involved in setting requirements for defense space programs. At  the same time, many experts stated that no one seemed to be in charge  of space acquisitions. Our report highlighted the pros and cons of various  options to reorganize space functions recommended in prior  congressionally-chartered studies. The issue has taken on more  importance in recent years, as DOD has realized satellites are highly  vulnerable to attacks and needs to make dramatic changes in space  system architectures and operations. We have found that leadership has  not been focused enough to overcome interagency rivalries and  resistance to change, and it has not been able to get concurrence on  future architectures.", "The President\u2019s Administration and DOD have taken significant steps to  change space leadership. Most recent is the President\u2019s Space Policy  Directive-4, issued on February 19, 2019, and DOD\u2019s subsequent  legislative proposal submitted on March 1, 2019, to establish a United  States Space Force as a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces  within the Department of the Air Force. The Policy Directive states that  this is an important step toward a future military department for space and  that the Space Force will (1) consolidate existing forces and authorities  for military space activities, as appropriate, to minimize duplication of  effort and eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies; and (2) not include the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, the National Reconnaissance Office, or other  non-military space organizations or missions of the United States  Government.", "According to the Policy Directive, the Space Force would include the  uniformed and civilian personnel conducting and directly supporting  space operations from all DOD Armed Forces, assume responsibilities for  all major military space acquisition programs, and create the appropriate  career tracks for military and civilian space personnel across all relevant  specialties. Pertaining to organization and leadership, the Policy Directive  creates a civilian Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space, to be known  as the Under Secretary for Space, appointed by the President, and  establishes a Chief of Staff of the Space Force, who would serve as a  member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.", "Furthermore, the Policy Directive states that as the Space Force matures,  and as national security requires, it will become necessary to create a  separate military department, to be known as the Department of the  Space Force. This department would take over some or all  responsibilities for the Space Force from the Department of the Air Force.  The Policy Directive requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct  periodic reviews to determine when to recommend that the President  seek legislation to establish such a department.", "Our past work has identified fragmentation in space leadership, but  because implementation has not yet occurred, it remains to be seen  whether this policy directive and proposed legislation would resolve these  issues. In implementing these changes there are many complexities to  consider. For example, because space capabilities are acquired and used  across the military services and defense agencies, it will be important to  address many details on how to implement a Space Force among these  equities. Our past work suggests that without close attention to the  consequences of the compromises that will inevitably have to be made to  carve out a new force structure from existing space functions, there is risk  of exacerbating the fragmentation and ineffective management and  oversight the Space Force is intended to address. For instance, earlier  this month, DOD established the Space Development Agency to unify  and integrate efforts across DOD to define, develop, and field innovative  solutions. But it is unclear how this new organization will mesh with the  Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, which acquires satellites,  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which creates  breakthrough technologies and capabilities, and similar organizations.", "Moreover, even if changes are implemented effectively, they are only a  first step toward addressing space acquisition problems. As we discuss  below, programs will still need to embrace acquisition best practices, such  as using demonstrable knowledge to make decisions. Our prior work has  found that they will also need to be open to flexible and innovative  approaches, and work effectively with a very wide range of stakeholders,  including those that will not be part of the Space Force, such as the  intelligence agencies, civilian space agencies, the current military  services, as well as entities within the Office of the Secretary of Defense  who help oversee and manage acquisitions. Senior leaders have  acknowledged that additional changes are needed and have taken steps  to help bring them about, such as the restructuring of the Air Force\u2019s  Space and Missile Systems Center, which is designed to break down  stovepipes and streamline acquisition processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Past Streamlining Efforts Offer Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["DOD is managing a number of new space acquisition programs using a  new authority, established under Section 804 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which is to provide a streamlined  alternative to the traditional DOD acquisition process. Specifically, the  programs\u2014which include follow-on missile warning and protected  communications satellites, among others\u2014will be exempted from the  acquisition and requirements processes defined by DOD Directive  5000.01 and the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development  System. Instead, program managers are encouraged to use a tailored  approach to documentation and oversight to enable them to demonstrate  new technologies or field new or updated systems within 2 to 5 years. We  have ongoing work looking across the military departments at how  middle-tier acquisition authority is being implemented, including for the Air  Force\u2019s space acquisition programs, and plan to issue a report later this  spring.", "GAO and others have highlighted lessons learned from past efforts to  streamline, specifically with an approach adopted for space systems in  the 1990s known as Total System Performance Responsibility  (TSPR). TSPR was intended to facilitate acquisition reform and enable  DOD to streamline its acquisition process and leverage innovation and  management expertise from the private sector. Specifically, TSPR gave a  contractor total responsibility for the integration of an entire weapon  system and for meeting DOD\u2019s requirements. We found in May 2009 that  because this reform made the contractor responsible for day-to-day  program management, DOD did not require formal deliverable  documents\u2014such as earned value management reports\u2014to assess the  status and performance of the contractor. As a result, DOD\u2019s capability  to lead and manage the space acquisition process diminished, which  magnified problems related to unstable requirements and poor contractor  performance. Further, the reduction in DOD oversight and involvement  led to major reductions in various government capabilities, including cost- estimating and systems-engineering staff. This, in turn, led to a lack of  technical data needed to develop sound cost estimates.", "Best practices that we identified in the aftermath of TSPR include  retaining strong oversight and insight into programs; using quantifiable  data and demonstrable knowledge to make decisions to proceed, not  allowing development to proceed until certain thresholds are met,  empowering program managers to make decisions on the direction of the  program but also holding them accountable for their choices, and  canceling unsuccessful programs. Similarly, in its study of TSPR  programs, the Defense Science Board/Air Force Scientific Advisory Board  Joint Task Force emphasized the importance of managing requirements,  sufficiently funding programs, participating in trade-off studies, and  assuring that proven engineering practices characterize program  implementation, among other actions.

While there is increased  attention within DOD on funding for space and building the Space Force,  such widespread acquisition activities could still pose resource  challenges. For example:", "Funding requests for space system modernization have in the past 10  years represented a small percentage (3.9 to 5 percent) of total  weapon system modernization funding DOD requested. Space is  competing with ships, aircraft, and the nuclear triad, among other  programs for funding. This can be challenging, because over the past  2 years, DOD has begun over 9 new space acquisition programs to  recapitalize current space capabilities and enhance system  resiliency. In the past, we have found that it has been difficult for  DOD to fund multiple new space programs at one time, particularly  when it was concurrently struggling with cost overruns and schedule  delays from its legacy programs. For example, OCX system  development challenges have resulted in a $2.5 billion cost increase  and approximate 5-year delay to the system becoming operational\u2014 using more resources for a longer time\u2014at a cost to other programs.", "It is unclear whether DOD has a sufficient workforce to manage  multiple new space programs. We issued a report this month that  found DOD did not routinely monitor the size, mix, and location of its  space acquisition workforce. We collected and aggregated data  from multiple DOD space acquisition organizations and found that at  least 8,000 personnel in multiple locations nationwide were working  on space acquisition activities at the end of 2017. Echoing concerns  raised in our prior work, we also found that DOD had difficulty  attracting and retaining candidates with the requisite technical  expertise. Officials from the Air Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems  Center were concerned that there are not enough experienced mid- level acquisition personnel and also expressed concern that the bulk  of military personnel assigned to program management positions  were more junior in rank than the Center was authorized to obtain. We  recommended that DOD (1) identify the universe of its space  acquisition programs and the organizations that support them, and (2)  collect and maintain data on the workforce supporting these  programs. DOD concurred with our first recommendation but not the  second.", "Software is an increasingly important enabler of DOD space systems.", "However, DOD has struggled to deliver software-intensive space  programs that meet operational requirements within expected time  frames. Although user involvement is critical to the success of any  software development effort, we found in our report issued earlier this  month on DOD software-intensive space programs that key programs  that experienced cost or schedule breaches often did not effectively  engage users to understand requirements and obtain feedback.  Program efforts to involve users and incorporate feedback frequently  did not match plans. The lack of user engagement has contributed to  systems that were later found to be operationally unsuitable. The  programs we reviewed also faced challenges in delivering software in  shorter time frames, and in using commercial software, applying  outdated tools and metrics, as well as having limited knowledge and  training in newer software development techniques. DOD  acknowledged these challenges and is taking steps to address them,  including identifying useful software development metrics and ways to  include them in new contracts. We recommended, and DOD  concurred, that the department ensure its guidance addressing  software development provides specific, required direction on the  timing, frequency, and documentation of user involvement and  feedback. Moreover, it should be noted that software development  has been a struggle for other non-space weapons programs as well.
