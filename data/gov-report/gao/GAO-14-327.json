Army officials indicated that there is one case between four Army MHPI projects and Pinnacle Property Management (Pinnacle) that met the dollar threshold criteria and that would have been approved through this process. However, Army officials did not use the standard process because the Army determined that it needed to limit access to Pinnacle litigation information to avoid disclosing any information material to the litigation strategy. As a result, the Army used an alternative process to review and approve litigation costs for Pinnacle that is consistent with MHPI operating agreements. Had the standard process been followed, litigation and litigation cost information would have been shared with the MHPI projects construction company, Clark Realty Capital (Clark), and four different offices within the Army. Army and Clark officials decided to use the alternative process allowed by the MHPI\u2019s operating agreements so that fewer personnel would be aware of ongoing litigation information involving Pinnacle. The alternative process allows the Army and Clark to directly approve specific actions on behalf of the MHPI project, such as approving litigation and audit expenses, and allows sharing information with only Clark and one Army office.", "According to Army officials and our analysis of these four MHPI projects\u2019 accounts, Pinnacle litigation expenses have not prevented the projects from meeting their normal operating requirements, such as conducting maintenance or paying for utilities. Rents collected from these four MHPI projects funded the normal operating requirements for these projects as well as the Pinnacle litigation and audit expenses. Rents collected in excess of operating expenses normally are available for other purposes such as construction; capital, repair, and replacement of buildings; and future reinvestment. However, because litigation expenses were also paid from the rents collected at the four MHPI projects involved in the litigation, some funds have not been available for these purposes. Nevertheless, Army officials said that the Pinnacle litigation and audit costs have had no effects on the four projects\u2019 ability to move forward with construction as planned so far or to meet any scheduled capital repair projects because these projects were developed within anticipated funding levels.", "The Army property-management agreements provide that the party that substantially prevails in a legal action may recoup their legal expenses.

The Army\u2019s goal for the MHPI is to  significantly improve the quality of housing offered to military members  and their families so the Army can continue to attract and retain military  personnel. Section 2803 of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2013 was intended to strengthen the oversight of the MHPI by  implementing a series of measures for financial integrity and  accountability, and requires the Secretary of Defense to submit expanded  reports to Congress on expenditures and receipts related to the MHPI.

We also interviewed Army  officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army  (Installations, Housing & Partnerships), the Office of the Assistant Chief of  Staff for Installation Management, the Office of the Army General  Counsel, and MHPI project asset managers who have knowledge of  MHPI guidance and practices used in managing MHPI projects\u2019 funds  spent on litigation.", "To determine whether Army litigation and audit costs have had any  effects on managing the MHPI projects, we discussed with Army officials  any litigation and audit expenses not accounted for during the MHPI  annual budget process to determine whether these costs had adversely  affected any of the accounts used to manage the MHPI projects involved  in litigation. We also obtained and analyzed MHPI project-management  account documentation to determine whether litigation and audit costs  had any effects on MHPI project accounts. Specifically, we obtained and  analyzed the MHPI projects\u2019 budgeted operating expenses from calendar  years 2009 through 2013 to determine whether the projects had to reduce  their operating expenses due to litigation. To assess the reliability of  these cost data for Army MHPI projects involved in litigation not  accounted for during the MHPI annual budget process, we met with Army  officials to discuss these data and the processes and controls that were  used to maintain the data.

The Department of the Army  currently has 34 MHPI projects at 44 installations in the United States.  Since these projects began, the Army has invested $1.97 billion and the  private sector has invested $12.6 billion in the initial development of the  military housing projects. In a typical privatized military housing project,  the developer is a limited liability company or partnership that has been  formed for the purpose of acquiring debt, leasing land, and building and  managing a specific project or projects. The limited liability company is  typically composed of one or several private-sector members, such as  construction firms, real-estate managers, or other entities with expertise  in housing construction and renovation. In those cases where a military  department has made an investment in the limited liability company, the  department may also be a member of the limited liability company. In a  typical privatized military housing project, a military department leases  land to a developer for a term of 50 years. The military department  generally conveys existing homes on the leased land to the developer for  the duration of the lease. The developer is responsible for constructing  new homes or renovating existing houses and then leasing this housing,  giving preference to service members and their families. Although the  developers enter into these agreements to construct or renovate military  housing, the developer normally enters into various contracts with design  builders and subcontractors to carry out the actual construction and  renovation.

Clark  Pinnacle Family Communities oversees some of the highest-profile  installations in the Army\u2019s MHPI program. The company is a joint venture  between Clark, based in the Washington, D.C., area, and Pinnacle, based  in Seattle.

Pinnacle was the property-management firm actually  conducting day-to-day property-management activities (e.g.,  maintenance) at the projects once they were completed. According to  Army officials, Clark, through a series of internal audits, determined in  2010 that Pinnacle allegedly was involved in substantial and systemic  fraud in the management of the privatized housing at Fort Benning, and  ultimately found similar alleged fraud in the management of the privatized  housing at Fort Belvoir. As a result, Clark initiated audits of the two  California MHPI projects managed by Pinnacle and began to uncover  alleged circumstances similar to those at Fort Benning and Fort Belvoir."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Litigation against Pinnacle", "paragraphs": ["In 2010, Clark asked the Army for permission to remove Pinnacle as  property manager at Fort Benning and Fort Belvoir because of alleged  willful misconduct by Pinnacle employees, and for approval to initiate  related litigation on behalf of the MHPI entities against Pinnacle; the Army  agreed. Subsequent to the initiation of the Fort Belvoir and Fort Benning  litigation, Pinnacle attempted to unilaterally amend the terms of the  California property-management agreements to make it harder to remove  them as property manager. In response, the California MHPI entities then  brought suit in California court against Pinnacle seeking a declaratory  judgment that the agreements had not been effectively amended by  Pinnacle. Pinnacle then filed a cross-suit seeking to uphold the  amendments. According to Army officials, the Army wanted Pinnacle  removed as the MHPI projects\u2019 property manager due to the alleged fraud  and mismanagement. Additionally, Army officials stated that they have  been motivated by concerns for resident safety because it has been  alleged that Pinnacle engaged in falsifying records regarding  maintenance and repairs that Pinnacle employees were responsible for  performing at all four project locations.", "An Army official stated that Pinnacle has attempted to obtain information  on the amount of funds the MHPI projects have spent on litigation and  other litigation strategy-type information, such as documents provided to  the Army by Clark, both through discovery and through a Freedom of  Information Act request, which the Army (with Department of Justice  assistance) successfully denied. According to Army officials, the relevant  property-management agreements include a provision that a party who  sues under the agreement and substantially prevails is entitled to recoup  their legal fees from the losing party. Further, our review found that the  MHPI projects\u2019 property-management agreements include a provision  allowing the substantially prevailing party in litigation brought to enforce or  interpret the agreements to be repaid for all court costs and for the  reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and certified public  accountants. Because legal fees are potentially recoverable, they are  material both to the litigation and to any potential settlement negotiations.", "In June 2010, Pinnacle was removed as property manager at Fort  Benning, and in December 2012 Pinnacle was removed from  management at Fort Belvoir.

The alternative process is  consistent with the relevant MHPI projects\u2019 operating agreements. The  standard process has thresholds governing potential withdrawals or  expenditures for Army MHPI project litigation expenses. In the standard  process, Army officials generally make major decisions related to MHPI  projects, including litigation costs, by following guidance in the Residential  Communities Initiative Portfolio and Asset Management Handbook. For  example, the Army treats litigation not accounted for in the budget  process as a major decision requiring higher-level approval within the  Army when costs exceed either 5 to 10 percent of the annual budget or  $250,000 over budget. In the standard process, Army officials generally  seek approval of such major decisions from either the Office of the  Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management or the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy and Environment).  The process involves sharing litigation information and estimated costs  between the developer and four offices within the Army (MHPI Project  Office, Garrison Commander, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for  Installation Management, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the  Army ). However, according to  Army officials, the standard process has not yet been used to approve  any major decisions regarding litigation expenses, because the Pinnacle  cases are the only cases that met the major-decision threshold criteria  whose litigation expenses have been approved and would have gone  through this process had decisions not been made to restrict access to  information pertaining to this litigation.", "Although the Pinnacle cases met the major-decision threshold criteria,  according to Army officials, Army officials decided to use an alternative  management process to review and approve litigation costs so they could  restrict information and confine decision making to a higher organizational  level. This process is consistent with the MHPI projects\u2019 operating  agreements for managing these projects and allows for Clark and only  one Army office to review associated cost information. Specifically, these  agreements do not specify any internal deliberative process within the  Army, but rather only require that Army agreement is obtained for certain  major decisions. As a result, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army  (Installations, Housing & Partnerships), acting on behalf of the Army, can  directly approve specific actions proposed by Clark senior leadership on  behalf of the MHPI project, such as approving the litigation and audit  budget and expenses. Additionally, Army officials stated that while the  standard process was not followed, the alternative process did allow for  information regarding the Pinnacle litigation to be periodically coordinated  with high-level officials within the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for  Installation Management. Army officials stated that they wanted to restrict  access to the litigation and audit cost estimates because legal fees are  potentially recoverable and as a result are material both to the litigation  and to any potential settlement negotiations.", "According to Army officials, throughout the litigation process, Army and  Clark officials have regularly shared litigation documents and met to  discuss the Pinnacle litigation. After the approval of the MHPI project\u2019s  annual operating budgets, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army  (Installations, Housing & Partnerships) and counsel in the Office of the  Army General Counsel reviewed Clark\u2019s proposed budget for Pinnacle  litigation and audit expenses for that year. Further, the Army and Clark  met approximately quarterly with counsel representing the four MHPI  projects in the Pinnacle litigation to discuss any significant developments  in the cases, specific plans for the next quarter, and general plans for the  rest of the year\u2014including any anticipated changes in the legal and audit  expenses previously budgeted for.

Within each MHPI project, the Army receives  revenue and distributes the cash flow in a specified order to accounts,  such as the revenue account; operating-expenses account; capital,  repair, and replacement account; debt-service account; and construction  and reinvestment accounts. Figure 1 shows the flow of funding within the  Army MHPI projects.", "Revenue account: The revenue account is funded by servicemember  rent, which is typically based on the Basic Allowance for Housing  allotments received. This funding is typically disbursed on a monthly basis  to pay the budgeted amounts for the operating expense account; capital,  repair, and replacement account; and debt-service account. According to  Army officials, Pinnacle litigation and audit expenses were also paid from  revenues that flowed into the MHPI projects.", "Operating-expenses account: Each Army MHPI project has an account  to pay for all operating expenses including maintenance, utilities, and  other administrative costs.

MHPI project asset managers for the four projects  connected to Pinnacle litigation stated that their projects have not had to  reduce their operating expenses during the Pinnacle litigation.  Furthermore, MHPI project asset managers stated that any increases or  decreases in budgeted operating expenses from year to year were due to  fluctuations in housing occupancy and changes in utility and maintenance  costs and not litigation expenses. Table 1 provides a summary of the four  MHPI projects\u2019 budgeted operating expenses from calendar years 2009  through 2013.

The Army requested an audit of the projects\u2019 financial data from  January 2009 through June 2012 and the audit results showed that no  maintenance was deferred during this period.", "Debt-service account: This account is used to pay the outstanding debt  for the MHPI project. Based on our review of MHPI project account data,  we found that all four MHPI projects have little or no balance in this  account because debt is paid off throughout the year.", "Construction account and Reinvestment account:  Construction Account\u2014Before the start of an MHPI project, a plan is  developed for construction, and needed funding levels are determined.  This plan is reviewed annually based on actual and estimated costs to  determine if any changes are needed to the development scope of the  project. This account is used to pay for the initial development and  construction of the MHPI project, which according to Army officials  generally lasts during the first 7 to 10 years of project operations. As  discussed earlier, the revenue account funds the budgeted amounts for  the operating expense account; the capital, repair, and replacement  account; and the debt-service account, and any funding not needed for  these purposes flows to the construction account. However, because  litigation expenses were also paid from the revenue account, officials  stated that additional funding has not transferred into the construction  account as otherwise would likely have occurred. Nevertheless, Army  officials said that the Pinnacle litigation and audit costs have had no  effects on the projects\u2019 ability to move forward with construction as  planned because these projects were developed within anticipated  funding levels. According to Army officials, currently all four of the projects  are nearing the end or have recently completed the initial development  period, and after the development and approval of a 5-year future plan,  the construction account will be closed.", "Reinvestment Account\u2014According to Army officials, any funds remaining  in the construction accounts when the projects reach the end of their  initial development and construction phase are moved to the reinvestment  account. This account is also used to hold the MHPI projects\u2019 excess  cash flow that is not required after payment of the operating expenses,  debt service, and other payments. Funds start to accumulate in the  reinvestment account for future use in renovation or replacement of  homes after the initial development and construction of the project ends.  Since all four of the projects are still in or have recently completed this  initial development phase\u2014and based on our review of MHPI project  account data\u2014no funds have accumulated in the reinvestment accounts  as of February 2014. Due to the MHPI projects\u2019 incurring litigation and  audit expenses, less funding will ultimately be available to transition from  the MHPI projects\u2019 construction account to the reinvestment account  unless litigation concludes prior to the transition, and funds are recouped  assuming the projects prevail in the litigation with Pinnacle.", "The MHPI projects\u2019 property-management agreements provide that the  party that substantially prevails in a legal action may recoup their legal  expenses.
