To perform this work, GAO followed the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and additional guidance from the Environmental Protection Agency, using data provided by officials responsible for legislative branch operations and the General Services Administration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Legislative branch operations generated about 316,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents) in fiscal year 2006. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated by legislative branch operations is equal to the emissions produced by about 57,455 cars and represents an increase of about 4 percent from the average annual quantity emitted in fiscal years 1998 through 2001. The largest source of these emissions (63 percent) was the consumption of electricity purchased from an external provider that relies primarily on fossil fuel combustion to generate the electricity. The second-largest source of emissions (32 percent) was the combustion of fossil fuels in the Capitol Power Plant to produce steam for the majority of the legislative branch buildings. The remaining 5 percent of emissions came from other sources that each generated 1 percent or less of emissions, such as natural gas and chilled water purchased from outside sources and business travel in government-owned and -leased vehicles. While emissions in 2006 increased 4 percent over the base year levels, emissions in the intervening years varied depending on factors such as fluctuations in weather, the fuel mix used at the Capitol Power Plant, and the quantity of renewable energy used by legislative branch operations. A strategy for reducing emissions includes conducting energy audits to identify and evaluate energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, as well as evaluating other emissions-reduction projects that may fall outside the scope of energy audits. Such a strategy would also involve developing an implementation plan that considers cost-effectiveness, the extent to which the projects reduce emissions, and funding options. Energy audits are a key step because the projects identified through the audits would address the largest sources of emissions--purchased electricity and fossil fuel combustion in the Capitol Power Plant--and would include information on cost-effectiveness and the potential for reducing emissions. Agencies could finance these projects through direct appropriations or contracts with utility or energy service companies. Since fiscal year 1998, the Architect of the Capitol, GAO, and the Government Printing Office have commissioned 11 energy audits of some of their facilities, but the audits have generally not been comprehensive and the agencies have varied in the extent to which they have implemented the projects identified through the audits. Another part of a strategy would involve evaluating the cost-effectiveness, emissions reduction, and funding options of projects that may fall outside the scope of energy audits--such as acquiring fuel-efficient vehicles--on a case-by-case basis. The energy audits and evaluations of other projects would provide information for legislative branch agencies to develop plans for implementing projects to reduce emissions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Greenhouse gas emissions\u2014including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous  oxide, and certain synthetic chemicals\u2014result from a variety of sources,  such as the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial activities, and natural  processes. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, have contributed to  increased global temperatures and related changes in Earth\u2019s climate.  Climatic changes resulting from greenhouse gas emissions could have  significant economic and environmental consequences, including elevated  sea levels, shifts in agricultural productivity, and damage to sensitive  ecosystems. Because most U.S. carbon dioxide emissions result from the  combustion of fossil fuels, efforts to cut emissions generally focus on  increasing the efficiency of activities powered by fossil fuels or switching  to renewable-energy sources. Besides decreasing emissions, these efforts  often achieve financial savings through decreased energy expenditures.", "The U.S. government has taken some action to inventory and reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the federal government published  an inventory of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions in 2006 and has  developed voluntary programs that encourage participants to conduct  inventories and set targets to reduce their emissions. Furthermore, certain  energy-efficiency and air-quality programs for the federal government,  while not specifically designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, have  had that effect. Agencies within the executive branch of government have  also responded to an executive order that directed them to inventory their  emissions and set an emissions reduction target. However, legislative  branch agencies have not been required to inventory their emissions or  implement an overall emissions reduction strategy, and they have not  undertaken any comprehensive voluntary efforts.", "The legislative branch includes Congress and its supporting agencies\u2014  the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), GAO, Government Printing Office  (GPO), Library of Congress (LOC), Congressional Budget Office (CBO),  U.S. Botanic Garden, Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and  Stennis Center for Public Service.

In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas  Protocol, the scope of our work included direct emissions, such as the  combustion of fossil fuels at the Capitol Power Plant, and indirect  emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, natural gas,  steam, and chilled water. We excluded other indirect emissions that are  optional under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, such as those generated  from business travel in private vehicles or commercial airplanes, employee  commuting, or paper use. Our work covered the legislative branch\u2019s leased  and owned facilities and vehicles within the Washington, D.C.,  metropolitan area. We excluded indirect emissions from the U.S. Capitol  Police for security reasons, as well as nonlegislative branch facilities  under AOC\u2019s jurisdiction, such as the U.S. Supreme Court. We also  excluded emissions from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and  the Stennis Center for Public Service because of their small size and  location within buildings outside of the legislative branch. To calculate  emissions and identify emissions trends, we collected and analyzed data  for fiscal years 1998 through 2006 from AOC, CBO, GAO, GPO, LOC, the  Senate Sergeant at Arms, the House of Representatives Chief  Administrative Officer, and the General Services Administration (GSA).  The House of Representatives Chief Administrative Officer was unable to  provide fuel use data from the House of Representatives\u2019 23 vehicles or  volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions data from its furniture shop  that performs wood refinishing, painting, and upholstery. In addition, AOC  was unable to provide data on leaks from their oil, diesel, and propane  tanks. Therefore, greenhouse gas emissions from these sources were not  included in our calculations. We used the average annual emissions in  fiscal years 1998 through 2001 as the base year for our trend analysis  because this is the time period set by the Chicago Climate Exchange, a  voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program. We also used data from the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to compare changes in  the local weather to changes in emissions to help explain emission trends.", "To identify a strategy for reducing emissions, we reviewed documents  from the World Resources Institute (WRI), and Congressional Research  Service (CRS); and we interviewed officials and reviewed documents from  AOC, GPO, and GAO to learn about energy audits and emissions reduction  projects that the legislative branch has already implemented. We also  interviewed officials from DOE\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  (NREL) and Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) about energy  audits, and types of emissions reduction projects and their cost- effectiveness; and officials from GSA about emissions reduction projects  related to government-owned and -leased vehicles. In addition, we  interviewed Pepco Energy Services about its renewable-energy contracts  with the legislative branch agencies.

The other principal  greenhouse gases are methane, nitrous oxide, and three types of synthetic  gases\u2014hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.  Like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are released during the  combustion of fossil fuels by stationary and mobile sources.  Hydrofluorocarbons are emitted from refrigerants that leak from chillers  and air-handling units. Perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride are  generally not emitted by legislative branch operations.", "Each greenhouse gas has a global warming potential\u2014a measure of its  heat-trapping ability relative to that of carbon dioxide. For example,  methane is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide, so its global  warming potential is 21. Global warming potentials are used to convert  emissions of non-carbon-dioxide gases into their carbon dioxide  equivalents to allow comparisons of the total cumulative warming effects  of different greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide equivalents are calculated  by multiplying the emissions of the non-carbon-dioxide gas by its  corresponding global warming potential (see app. I for a list of the global  warming potentials of the principal greenhouse gases). The common unit  of measure for reporting greenhouse gas emissions is metric tons of  carbon dioxide equivalents.", "Legislative branch operations generate greenhouse gas emissions from the  combustion of fossil fuels in the Capitol Power Plant; business travel in  government-owned and -leased vehicles; the use of heavy machinery; the  release of VOCs in furniture and print shops; fugitive emissions, such as  leaks in refrigeration equipment and fuel tanks; the combustion of fossil  fuels in emergency generators; and the consumption of purchased  electricity, natural gas, steam, and chilled water. AOC, GAO, and GPO  have jurisdiction over the majority of these sources through their  management of legislative branch property. While AOC operates the  facilities within the Capitol complex, LOC, CBO, the Senate, and the House  of Representatives are responsible for their own energy consumption.  These entities also procure their own office equipment, and own and lease  vehicles independent of AOC. In addition, the Senate and House of  Representatives run the operations of their own furniture shops that  perform wood refinishing, painting, and upholstery, and the Senate  operates its own print shops. LOC also leases facilities independent of  those managed by AOC. Table 1 shows the number of facilities, vehicles,  and other property managed by each entity.", "The Capitol Power Plant produces steam and chilled water for the  majority of the Capitol complex, as well as steam for GPO. Steam is used  for heating buildings and hot water, as well as for cooking and  humidification. Chilled water is used for cooling buildings and equipment,  as well as for dehumidification. Two of the Capitol Power Plant\u2019s seven  boilers are coal-fired units with auxiliary gas burners, and the other five  run on natural gas or oil. AOC uses a mix of fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and  natural gas\u2014in the Capitol Power Plant to help ensure continuity of  operations in case of a supply shortage or an increase in the price of one  of the fuels. Ten chillers in the Capitol Power Plant\u2019s refrigeration plants  run on electricity to generate chilled water. In addition to the steam and  chilled water produced by the Capitol Power Plant, AOC purchases steam  and chilled water from GSA for one building under its jurisdiction (the  Ford House Office Building), and GAO also purchases its steam from GSA.  GAO has six electric-powered chillers and GPO has three electric-powered  chillers that produce chilled water for these agencies. The legislative  branch agencies purchase their electricity primarily from Pepco Energy  Services and natural gas from Washington Gas.", "Options to reduce emissions include projects that can be divided into five  categories\u2014energy efficiency, renewable energy, adjustment of power  plant fuel mix to include less carbon-intensive fuel, energy curtailment,  and offsets. Energy efficiency means using less energy to produce a given  level of service or an increase in output for the same amount of energy.  Energy-efficiency projects include enhancing the energy efficiency of  equipment, installing a cogeneration (combined heat and power) system,  and upgrading vehicles to more fuel-efficient models. Renewable energy is  derived from resources that are generally not depleted by human use, such  as the sun, wind, and water movement. In most cases, renewable energy  releases less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels. Renewable-energy projects  include purchasing renewable energy, generating renewable energy on  site, procuring alternative-fuel vehicles, and adjusting power plant fuel mix  to include renewable fuels. In addition to adjusting the fuel mix to include  renewable fuels, adjustments could be made to the fuel mix to use less  carbon-intensive fuel, such as natural gas. Energy curtailment means a  decrease in activity to reduce energy consumption, such as turning off  lights when not in use. Finally, offsets refer to projects that would reduce  or remove emissions outside an entity\u2019s sphere of operations and are  generally used to supplement other projects that directly reduce  emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Branch Operations Generated 316,000 Metric Tons of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2006, a 4 Percent Increase from Base Year Levels", "paragraphs": ["Legislative branch operations generated about 316,000 metric tons of  greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents) in  fiscal year 2006.

In addition, the  consumption of purchased natural gas, steam, and chilled water each  accounted for approximately 1 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions  from legislative branch operations. The natural gas was used to heat  buildings within the Capitol complex that do not receive steam from the  Capitol Power Plant, to operate appliances in GAO\u2019s cafeteria, and as part  of the printing process at GPO.

Despite the overall increase in emissions, there was  one notable decrease in emissions during this time period\u2014a 6 percent  decrease from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2004. The 6 percent decrease  can likely be attributed to AOC\u2019s purchase of renewable energy from  Pepco Energy Services during an 8-month period beginning in September  2003. The most recent decrease in emissions (1 percent), from fiscal year  2005 to fiscal year 2006, was likely influenced by two factors: a change in  the fuel mix at the Capitol Power Plant that was due to a malfunction in  the coal-fired boilers, which required AOC to replace some coal with more  expensive\u2014but less emissions-intensive\u2014natural gas; and lower fuel  consumption that was due to more moderate temperatures.

Energy  audits also include information on the cost-effectiveness of projects and  on the extent to which the projects could reduce emissions, which assist  agencies in evaluating and selecting projects. In general, projects  identified by energy audits as generating savings sufficient to pay for the  capital costs of the projects are deemed cost-effective. Other projects  identified through the energy audits may partially pay for themselves and  could be considered cost-effective relative to other projects. Energy- efficiency projects are generally more cost-effective than renewable- energy projects because many renewable-energy projects are not cost  competitive when compared with more traditional sources of power.", "There are three main types of energy audits\u2014preliminary, targeted, and  comprehensive. Each type is distinguished by the level of detail and  analysis required to complete the audit. Less detailed audits include less  accurate estimates of project costs and energy savings. Preliminary energy  audits are the least detailed and provide quick evaluations to determine a  project\u2019s potential. These energy audits do not provide sufficiently detailed  information to justify investing in the identified projects. Instead,  preliminary audits are primarily used to decide if a more detailed  evaluation is necessary. Targeted audits are detailed analyses of specific  systems, such as lighting or boiler replacement. Comprehensive audits are  detailed evaluations of all major energy-using systems. Targeted and  comprehensive audits provide sufficiently detailed information to justify  investing in projects. AOC, GAO, and GPO commissioned six preliminary,  four targeted, and one comprehensive energy audit of some of their  facilities from fiscal years 1998 through 2006.", "AOC commissioned preliminary audits of the Capitol in June 2000, the  Rayburn House Office Building in April 2003 and December 2003, the Hart  Senate Office Building in December 2003, and the LOC Madison Building  in May 2005. These audits identified cost-effective projects, meeting the  definition of cost-effectiveness found at 10 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 436.18-436.22. For  example, the energy audit of the LOC Madison Building identified 12 cost- effective projects with savings-to-investment ratios ranging from 1.02 to  3.87. It was estimated that these projects would reduce emissions from  electricity by approximately 4,760 metric tons per year. However,  according to agency officials, AOC has not followed up with energy audits  that provide sufficiently detailed information to justify investing in  projects at these facilities because of fiscal constraints. There are also  approximately 27 buildings under AOC\u2019s jurisdiction that have not had any  type of energy audit. In the fiscal year 2008 budget, AOC requested   $1.1 million to fund the first two years of a five-year plan to perform  energy surveys of all its facilities.", "In addition to the energy audits, AOC has conducted Facility Condition  Assessments and other studies of facilities in need of upgrades and  repairs, which identified projects that would yield potential energy  efficiency improvements. However, most of these projects have not been  implemented. Since 2004, AOC has evaluated the viability of changing the  Capitol Power Plant to cogeneration, which could provide steam,  supplementary electricity, and backup power to the Capitol complex and  reduce emissions by more efficiently capturing the energy output. AOC  also began a project in 2001 to evaluate the clean coal technology  alternatives to supplement or replace the existing Capitol Power Plant  steam generating facilities to reduce emissions from burning coal. In  addition, AOC took initial steps in response to legislation that required the  agency to develop and implement a cost-effective energy conservation  strategy. For example, AOC purchased a building automation system that  will be used to operate mechanical and electrical systems more efficiently  throughout the Capitol complex, purchased energy-efficient chillers to  supplement production of chilled water at the Capitol Power Plant, and is  evaluating proposals from contractors for installing energy conservation  measures, including on-site renewable energy, on the rooftop of the  Dirksen Senate Office Building.", "In 1999, GPO had a preliminary energy audit and chose to implement two  of the projects identified as cost-effective\u2014the replacement of its chillers  and 15,000 light fixtures\u2013after a targeted energy audit of the chillers in  2000. According to officials, GPO pursued only those projects with the  shortest payback periods because of its limited budget and plans to  relocate. GPO does not have a regular schedule for conducting energy  audits.", "GAO had a comprehensive energy audit in 2002 and plans to have another  comprehensive energy audit by fiscal year 2009. GAO also conducts a  targeted energy audit of its facility every 2 years as part of its building  assessment report. GAO has implemented the majority of the projects  identified through its audits, such as installing optimization controls for  the air-handling system and installing specialized software to decrease  electricity use during periods of peak demand. In addition, GAO routinely  considers other opportunities taking into account technology, price, and  available funding.", "Legislative branch agencies have three methods for financing energy  audits and implementing projects: energy savings performance contracts  (ESPC), utility energy savings contracts (UESC), or direct appropriations.  Congress authorized agencies to use ESPCs to privately finance energy- efficiency and renewable-energy projects in 1986. Under an ESPC,  agencies enter into a long-term contract (up to 25 years) with a private  energy services company under which the company conducts a  comprehensive energy audit of the agency, then finances and implements  projects approved by the agency. The agency then repays the company  with the resulting energy savings. The energy audits of the Rayburn and  Hart buildings were done through an initial proposal for an ESPC. UESCs  are similar to ESPCs, but are offered by electric and gas utilities and can  cover smaller projects. The third financing mechanism is direct  appropriations. While GPO\u2019s preliminary audit was conducted by Pepco  Energy Services under an initial proposal for an UESC, GPO opted to fund  the projects with direct appropriations. According to GPO officials, the  projects cost $6 million and reduced the agency\u2019s energy bills by $1 million  a year. GAO funds its energy audits through direct appropriations and  seeks funding for implementing projects in its annual budget requests.", "In 1995, DOE\u2019s FEMP initiated the SAVEnergy Program, which provided  funding for energy audits of federal facilities but not for project  implementation.

Energy Star-qualified and  FEMP-designated products meet energy-efficiency guidelines set by EPA  and DOE and, in general, represent the top 30 percent most energy  efficient-products in their class of products. These products cover a wide  range of categories, including appliances and office equipment. According  to the Energy Star program, office products that have earned the Energy  Star rating use about half as much electricity as standard equipment and  generally cost the same as equipment that is not Energy Star-qualified.  Under section 104 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, agencies are required  to purchase Energy Star-qualified and FEMP-designated products. Some of  the agencies have reported adopting such practices to further reduce  emissions. For example, officials from AOC and GAO reported that they  currently have all Energy Star-qualified information technology equipment.", "Purchasing renewable electricity: Renewable-energy certificates (REC)  represent the environmental, social, and other positive attributes of  electricity generated by renewable resources. RECs can be purchased  independent of the associated electricity from a wholesale supplier or  bundled with the electricity from a utility company. It is usually less  expensive to buy RECs from a wholesale supplier because a supplier  generally has access to a wider array of resources than a utility company.  In both cases, purchasing RECs helps the electricity generator invest more  money in renewable energy, increasing the amount of renewable  electricity and decreasing the amount of fossil fuel electricity entering the  country\u2019s power supply. For 8 months beginning in September 2003, AOC  purchased RECs from its utility, Pepco Energy Services\u2014equal to  51,296,000 kilowatt hours, or approximately 15 percent of its annual  electricity use. In November 2006, AOC, GPO, and GAO participated in a  GSA areawide electricity contract with Pepco Energy Services to purchase  RECs equal to 3 percent of their energy consumption in order to meet the  Energy Policy Act of 2005 federal purchase requirement.

The legislative  branch vehicle fleets include 35 alternative-fuel vehicles and, in September  2006, AOC adopted a policy specifying that all newly acquired vehicles,  with a few exceptions, are to be alternative-fuel vehicles. Although  legislative branch entities are purchasing these vehicles, they generally  fuel them with gasoline because the infrastructure for supplying  alternative fuel in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area is not  conveniently located for legislative branch employees. LOC was the only  entity that reported using ethanol to fuel its alternative-fuel vehicles to  date, using 18 gallons in fiscal year 2006. LOC also reported using 8 cubic  feet of compressed natural gas in fiscal years 2005 through 2006 to fuel its  two gasoline/compressed natural gas light-duty vehicles. Alternative-fuel  vehicles that run on ethanol or gasoline are, on average, $1,500 more  expensive than the lowest-priced gasoline vehicle in fiscal year 2007 and  get 20 percent to 30 percent fewer miles per gallon, but Congress is  encouraging the use of these vehicles because burning ethanol in vehicles  instead of gasoline reduces emissions by 18 percent to 29 percent per  gallon. In response, AOC\u2019s alternative fuel-vehicle policy states that the  initial cost shall not be considered as a factor unless it exceeds the initial  cost of a comparable conventionally fueled vehicle by at least 5 percent.  However, despite the emissions reductions associated with burning  ethanol in vehicles instead of gasoline, the net energy benefit of using  ethanol is less clear cut when full life-cycle emissions are taken into  account.

We excluded other indirect emissions that are  optional under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, such as those generated  from business travel in private vehicles or commercial airplanes, employee  commuting, or paper use. Our work covered the legislative branch\u2019s leased  and owned facilities and vehicles within the Washington, D.C.,  metropolitan area. We excluded indirect emissions from the U.S. Capitol  Police for security reasons, as well as non-legislative branch facilities  under AOC\u2019s jurisdiction, such as the U.S. Supreme Court. We also  excluded emissions from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and  the Stennis Center for Public Service because of their small size and  location within buildings outside of the legislative branch.", "To calculate emissions for the inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and  identify emissions trends, we selected a base year, which is a reference  year against which changes in emissions are measured over time. We  selected the average annual emissions in fiscal years 1998 through 2001 as  the base year because this is the time period set by the Chicago Climate  Exchange, a voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program. We collected  activity data from the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), GAO, Government  Printing Office (GPO), Library of Congress, Congressional Budget Office,  Senate Sergeant at Arms, House of Representatives Chief Administrative  Officer, and General Services Administration (GSA) for each source of  emissions, such as kilowatt hours of electricity, from fiscal years 1998  through 2006. In general, we multiplied the data by a corresponding  emissions factor to determine emissions for each year. An emissions  factor is a representative value that relates the quantity of a pollutant  released to the atmosphere with an activity associated with the release of  that pollutant. See table 2 for a list of emissions factors. We converted all  greenhouse gas emissions to carbon dioxide equivalents by multiplying  emissions for each greenhouse gas by its corresponding global warming  potential. See table 3 for a list of the global warming potential of each  greenhouse gas. The House of Representatives Chief Administrative  Officer was unable to provide fuel use data from the House of  Representatives\u2019 23 vehicles or volatile organic compounds (VOC)  emissions data from its furniture shop that performs wood refinishing,  painting, and upholstery. In addition, AOC was unable to provide data on  leaks from their oil, diesel and propane tanks. Therefore, greenhouse gas  emissions from these sources were not included in our calculations.

Some entities also  made assumptions about their data. For example, AOC\u2019s data were  incomplete because there were periods of time for which AOC was not  billed for energy use. AOC officials made the assumption that these  facilities were under the control of a contractor/vendor during this period  and bills were being paid for by these outside entities. We did not  independently verify the accuracy of the data. In calculating the  greenhouse gas emissions, we also had to make several assumptions in the  absence of data.
