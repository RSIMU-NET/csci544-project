However, without adequate security protections, VA's systems and information are vulnerable to exploitation by an array of cyber-based threats, potentially resulting in, among other things, the compromise of veterans' personal information. GAO has identified information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. The number of information security incidents reported by VA has more than doubled over the last several years, further highlighting the importance of securing the department's systems and the information that resides on them.", "GAO was asked to provide a statement discussing the challenges VA has experienced in effectively implementing information security, as well as to comment on a recently proposed bill aimed at improving the department's efforts to secure its systems and information. In preparing this statement GAO relied on previously published work as well as a review of recent VA inspector general and other reports related to the department's security program. GAO also analyzed the draft legislation in light of existing federal requirements and best practices for information security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to face long-standing challenges in effectively implementing its information security program.

Further, the department's inspector general has identified development of an effective information security program and system security controls as a major management challenge for VA. These findings are consistent with challenges GAO has identified in VA's implementation of its security program going back to the late 1990s. More recently, GAO has reported and made recommendations on issues regarding the protection of personally identifiable information at federal agencies, including VA. These were related to developing and implementing policies and procedures for responding to data breaches, and implementing protections when engaging in computerized matching of data for the purposes of determining individuals' eligibility for federal benefits.", "Draft legislation being considered by the Subcommittee addresses the governance of VA's information security program and security controls for the department's systems. It would require the Secretary of VA to improve transparency and coordination of the department's security program and ensure the security of its critical network infrastructure, computers and servers, operating systems, and web applications, as well as its core veterans health information system. Toward this end, the draft legislation prescribes specific security-related actions. Many of the actions and activities specified in the bill are sound information security practices and consistent with federal guidelines. If implemented on a risk-based basis, they could prompt VA to refocus its efforts on steps needed to improve the security of its systems and information. At the same time, the constantly changing nature of technology and business practices introduces the risk that control activities that are appropriate in the department's current environment may not be appropriate in the future. In light of this, emphasizing that actions should be taken on the basis of risk may provide the flexibility needed for security practices to evolve as changing circumstances warrant and help VA meet the security objectives in the draft legislation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me to participate in today\u2019s hearing on information  security at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In  order to ensure the implementation of this framework, FISMA assigns  specific responsibilities to agencies, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB), the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), and agency inspectors general.", "Specifically, each agency is required to develop, document, and  implement an agency-wide information security program and to report  annually to OMB, selected congressional committees, and the  Comptroller General on the adequacy of its information security policies,  procedures, practices, and compliance with requirements. For its part,  OMB is required to develop and oversee the implementation of polices,  principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal  agencies.

In particular, the auditor identified significant  technical weaknesses in databases, servers, and network devices that  support transmitting financial and sensitive information between VA\u2019s  medical centers, regional offices, and data centers.

In a number of products issued beginning in 1998, we have  identified wide-ranging, often recurring deficiencies in the department\u2019s  information security controls. These weaknesses existed, in part,  because VA had not fully implemented key components of a  comprehensive information security program. The persistence of similar  weaknesses over 16 years later indicates the need for stronger, more  focused management attention and action to ensure that VA fully  implements a robust security program.", "In addition, we have recently reported on issues regarding the protection  of personally identifiable information (PII) at federal agencies, including  VA.
