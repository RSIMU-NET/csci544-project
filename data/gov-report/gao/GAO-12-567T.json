DHS established the CFATS program to assess the risk posed by these facilities and inspect them to ensure compliance with DHS standards. ISCD, a division of IP, manages the program. A November 2011 internal ISCD memorandum, prepared by ISCD senior managers, expressed concerns about the management of the program. This statement addresses (1) how the memorandum was developed and any challenges identified, (2) what actions are being taken in response to any challenges identified, and (3) the extent to which ISCD\u0092s proposed solutions require collaboration with NPPD or IP. GAO\u0092s comments are based on recently completed work analyzing the memorandum and related actions. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, DHS\u0092s internal memorandum and action plans, and related documents, and interviewed DHS officials.", "In a July 2012 report, GAO recommended that ISCD explore opportunities to develop measures, where practical, to determine where actual performance deviates from expected results.

The memorandum was intended to highlight various challenges that have hindered ISCD efforts to implement the CFATS program. According to the former Director, the challenges facing ISCD included not having a fully developed direction and plan for implementing the program, hiring staff without establishing need, and inconsistent ISCD leadership\u0097factors that the Director believed place the CFATS program at risk. These challenges centered on three main areas: (1) human capital issues, including problems hiring, training, and managing ISCD staff; (2) mission issues, including problems reviewing facility plans to mitigate security vulnerabilities; and (3) administrative issues, including concerns about NPPD and IP not supporting ISCD\u0092s management and administrative functions.", "ISCD has begun to take various actions intended to address the issues identified in the ISCD memorandum and has developed a 94-item action plan to track its progress. According to ISCD managers, the plan appears to be a catalyst for addressing some of the long-standing issues the memorandum identified. As of June 2012, ISCD reported that 40 percent (38 of 94) of the items in the plan had been completed. These include directing ISCD managers to meet with staff to involve them in addressing challenges, clarifying priorities, and changing ISCD\u0092s culture; and developing a proposal to establish a quality control function over compliance activities. The remaining 60 percent (56 of 94) that were in progress include those requiring longer-term efforts\u0097i.e., streamlining the process for reviewing facility security plans and developing facility inspection processes; those requiring completion of other items in the plan; or those awaiting action by others, such as approvals by ISCD leadership. ISCD appears to be heading in the right direction, but it is too early to tell if corrective actions are having their desired effect because ISCD is in the early stages of implementing them and has not yet established performance measures to assess results.", "According to ISCD officials, almost half of the action items included in the June 2012 action plan require ISCD collaboration with or action by NPPD and IP. The ISCD memorandum stated that IP and NPPD did not provide the support needed to manage the CFATS program when the program was first under development.

My statement today summarizes the  testimony we delivered on July 26, 2012 before the House Committee on  Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security. The events of  September 11, 2001, triggered a national re-examination of the security of  facilities that use or store hazardous chemicals in quantities that, in the  event of a terrorist attack, could put large numbers of Americans at risk of  serious injury or death. Chemicals held at these facilities can be used to  cause harm to surrounding populations during terrorist attacks; can be  stolen and used as chemical weapons or as precursors (the ingredients  for making chemical weapons); or stolen and used to build an improvised  explosive device. To mitigate this risk, the DHS appropriations act for  fiscal year 2007 required DHS to issue regulations to establish risk- based performance standards for securing high-risk chemical facilities,  among other things. DHS established the CFATS program to assess the  risk, if any, posed by chemical facilities; place high-risk facilities in one of  four risk-based tiers; require high-risk facilities to develop security plans;  review these plans; and inspect the facilities to ensure compliance with  the regulatory requirements.

The ISCD memorandum,  which was leaked to the media in December 2011, cited an array of  challenges that, according to these officials, hindered ISCD\u2019s ability to  implement and manage the CFATS program.

To conduct  this work, we reviewed applicable laws and regulations, as well as NPPD,  IP, and ISCD policies and procedures for administering the CFATS  program, analyzed the ISCD memorandum prepared by the former ISCD  Director in consultation with the former Deputy Director, compared it with  the proposed action plan ISCD officials prepared to address the  challenges identified, and compared subsequent action plans to monitor  ISCD\u2019s progress.  Our results are based on the ISCD\u2019s action plan as of  June 2012 so these results reflect the status of ISCD\u2019s progress up to that  point in time.
