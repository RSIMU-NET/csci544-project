Transparent and reliable  information concerning these payments and other financial activities is  important in order for Congress to provide effective oversight of the  Judgment Fund. The Schedules of Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity Costs,  and Custodial Revenues, which were prepared and audited until fiscal  year 2013, included Judgment Fund balances and activities along with  other Treasury-managed accounts.

The Judgment Fund is also available to pay interest and  costs on claims in certain circumstances. Administration of the Judgment  Fund has changed substantially since its inception, with varying degrees  of control and oversight by Congress, GAO, and Treasury. Originally, the  Judgment Fund was limited to paying judgments of less than $100,000,  as certified by the Comptroller General and entered by the U.S. Court of  Claims (the predecessor to the current U.S. Court of Federal Claims) or a  U.S. District Court, as well as authorized interest and costs. In the 1960s,  new laws extended the Judgment Fund\u2019s availability to awards and  compromise settlements. In the next decade, the Supplemental  Appropriations Act, 1977, eliminated the Judgment Fund\u2019s $100,000  payment ceiling, resulting in no upper limit on the amount that could be  paid from the Judgment Fund on any particular claim. The General  Accounting Office Act of 1996 transferred certification of payments from  the Judgment Fund from GAO to Treasury. Since 1996, Treasury has  managed the Judgment Fund, including certifying payments. Treasury  established Fiscal Service in October 2012, and delegated key Judgment  Fund functions to that bureau.", "Fiscal Service is responsible for, among other things, providing central  payment services to federal agencies. Fiscal Service is the primary  disburser of payments to individuals and businesses on behalf of federal  agencies, including benefit payments made by the U.S. Social Security  Administration and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, federal  income tax refund payments, and payments to businesses for goods and  services provided to the federal government. Annually, Fiscal Service  disburses more than a billion payments, with an associated total dollar  value of more than $2.4 trillion.", "Administering the Judgment Fund is among the services that Fiscal  Service provides. A federal agency may request payment of a claim from  the Fund on its behalf only in instances where funds are not legally  available to pay the claim from the agency\u2019s own appropriations or other  funding source. Amounts paid from the Fund vary from year to year.  Treasury reported that the Fund paid about $3 billion and $4 billion for  administrative and litigative claims in fiscal years 2015 and 2016,  respectively.", "Fiscal Service carries out its mission through direct support from its three  divisions. The primary focus of the Judgment Fund Branch is to receive  and process claims for Judgment Fund payments. As shown in figure 1,  the Judgment Fund Branch operates within Fiscal Service\u2019s Financial  Services and Operations Division.", "Fiscal Service only certifies payments of claims from the Judgment Fund  when the following four tests have been met: (1) claims are final,   (2) claims are monetary, (3) one of the authorities specified in the  Judgment Fund statute permits payment, and (4) payment is not legally  available from any other source of funds (e.g., claims are only paid from  the Judgment Fund when payment is not otherwise provided for in a  specific appropriation or by another statutory provision). Generally,  federal agencies are not required to reimburse the Judgment Fund. Two  exceptions are Judgment Fund payments made pursuant to (1) the  Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA) and (2) the Notification and Federal  Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No FEAR Act).", "Currently, Treasury produces, and posts on its website, a voluminous  spreadsheet\u2014referred to as the Judgment Fund Transparency Report to  Congress\u2014when Congress requests it, but is not otherwise required to  do so. The spreadsheets are data extracts from JFICS that provide  information on the types and amounts of claims and the agencies for  which the payments were made. Members of Congress introduced  legislative proposals in the recent past related to the Judgment Fund. For  example, in the 115th Congress, a bill entitled the Judgment Fund  Transparency Act of 2017 (H.R. 1096), as reported (amended) by the  Committee on the Judiciary on October 16, 2017, would amend the  Judgment Fund statute to require Treasury to post on its website  information related to claims on the Judgment Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury-Provided Information Was Not Fully Responsive and Not Fully Reconciled", "paragraphs": ["In response to the Committee\u2019s request for Schedules of the Judgment  Fund Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity Costs, and Custodial Revenues  prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and related information,  Treasury provided to the Committee nine \u201cexhibits\u201d that contained  selected information on Judgment Fund payments and other related  information to answer nine questions in the Committee\u2019s request. We  reviewed the Treasury-provided information and found that it did not  provide the Schedules of Judgment Fund Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity  Costs, and Custodial Revenues for fiscal years 2010 through 2016,  prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and appropriate note  disclosures or MD&A to the Committee, as requested.", "In addition, we identified numerous differences between amounts  included in the exhibits provided to the Committee and those reported in  Treasury\u2019s (1) unaudited transparency reports, (2) audited Schedules, or  (3) audited Financial Statements. For example, we identified differences  between administrative and litigative payments for fiscal years 2010  through 2016 reported on Exhibits 1 and 2 - Judgment Fund  Administrative and Litigative Payments by Defendant Agency and Fiscal  Year and those reported in Treasury\u2019s (1) unaudited transparency reports,  (2) audited Schedules, and (3) audited Financial Statements, for all years  presented (as shown in tables 1, 2, and 3).", "Further, we identified numerous differences between financial and  nonfinancial information in Treasury\u2019s exhibits and comparable  information contained only in the transparency reports. For example, the  Committee asked Treasury to disclose the amount of Judgment Fund  payments for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act  (EAJA) for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. In response, Treasury  provided Exhibit 8 - Amounts Paid from the Judgment Fund for EAJA  Claims by Fiscal Year. We compared total payments for each fiscal year  reported in Exhibit 8 with those reported in the transparency reports for  the same years and identified differences in payments for principal,  attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs, as shown in table 4.", "We provided Treasury the results of our comparisons and requested  explanations for the differences we identified, and Treasury provided  explanations for some of them. Subsequently, Treasury officials informed  us that they discovered that the exhibits were created in a faulty manner,  and rather than expending resources to reconcile and explain the  numerous differences we identified, they indicated that Fiscal Service  staff would submit new exhibits to the Committee; however, they did not  provide a date by which they would do so.", "Judgment Fund Branch staff further explained that the Committee\u2019s  request was a unique request for information that could not be fulfilled  with existing standard reports and queries. To respond to the request,  Fiscal Service created ad hoc queries of the JFICS database using  different instructions for extracting data for the exhibits than those used  for creating the transparency reports. The Judgment Fund Branch relied  on these ad hoc queries, primarily from JFICS, to prepare the exhibits  answering the nine questions included in the Committee\u2019s request.  However, according to Judgment Fund Branch officials, the Judgment  Fund Branch does not prepare financial statements, such as the  Schedules of Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity Costs, and Custodial  Revenues. Rather, its primary focus is receiving and processing claims  for Judgment Fund payments. In addition, these officials told us that they  could not confirm whether the Judgment Fund Branch worked with the  Fiscal Accounting Branch to respond to the Committee\u2019s request or  prepare the exhibits provided to the Committee.", "Treasury\u2019s policy is to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility,  and integrity of the information that it disseminates to the public. This  policy directs Treasury bureaus and departmental offices to develop  standards for information quality and ensure that the standards are used  when disseminating information. The policy also directs that such  information be accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased. In addition, policy  guidelines specifically state that in situations where public access to data  and methods will not occur, especially rigorous checks to analytic results  should be applied and documented. According to Fiscal Service officials,  this policy applies strictly to information disseminated to the public, and  the related procedures in the policy do not apply to information  transmitted to federal entities, including Congress. Fiscal Service officials  did not provide evidence of a similar policy or procedures for ensuring the  quality of the information disseminated to Congress and other federal  entities. Fiscal Service officials also did not provide us with  documentation indicating that any checks or reviews were performed on  the exhibits\u2014in a manner consistent with Treasury\u2019s written policy and  review procedures for disseminating information to the public\u2014before  Treasury provided them to the Committee.", "As a result, the exhibits that Treasury provided to the Committee were not  responsive to the Committee\u2019s request and are at increased risk that they  may contain unreliable information. Accordingly, the Committee lacks  important, reliable information needed to effectively oversee Judgment  Fund activities, including considering whether enacting new legislation  would benefit the American people by ensuring better management of the  Judgment Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Documented Procedures and Control Activities for Processing Payments", "paragraphs": ["According to Fiscal Service\u2019s documented policies and procedures,  payments from the Judgment Fund may be made only upon certification  by Fiscal Service. An important step in the claims payment certification  process is for the Fiscal Service claims analyst and claims reviewer to  confirm that an agency\u2019s claim for payment from the Judgment Fund is  not otherwise provided for by another source of funds. This confirmation  is necessary to make sure that the Judgment Fund is not used for  payments that should be paid directly by the involved agency or another  funding source. Another important step in the claims payment certification  process is to confirm that the claim is final, meaning that the applicable  federal officials have fully resolved the claim\u2019s underlying dispute and the  only outstanding issue is payment of the claim. Additionally, Fiscal  Service calculates the amount of any interest that may be authorized and  initiates action under federal debt collection law to offset any known  indebtedness to the United States by the claimant. In the actual  \u201ccertification\u201d step, Fiscal Service does not review or evaluate the merits  of the underlying claim.", "Payments made by the Treasury Judgment Fund on behalf of agencies  are initiated upon the receipt of claim requests that agencies submit to  Fiscal Service. These requests must be submitted online through JFICS  or by sending completed payment request forms to the Judgment Fund  Branch via fax or mail.", "Claims submitted through JFICS must be accompanied by a FS Form  197, Voucher for Payment, page 2, signed by the claimant, and either a  (1) settlement agreement or (2) court order.

Fiscal Service staff review  the forms for completeness and ensure that each FS Form 194 has been  signed by the agency authorizing official. Fiscal Service relies on this  signature and the presence of a U.S. government email address on the  FS Form 194 as its primary controls for ensuring that a mailed or faxed  claim has been authorized by the agency. Fiscal Service also relies on  this signature to confirm that the claim is appropriate and is eligible to be  paid from the Judgment Fund. For claims entered directly in JFICS by  an agency, the agency authorizing official must click on \u201cI agree\u201d on the  JFICS certification page to affirm that the claim is authorized by the  agency and appropriate for payment from the Judgment Fund. (See fig. 2  for a depiction of the Judgment Fund claims process.)", "Depending on the claim amount, Fiscal Service staff perform a minimum  of two levels of review on Judgment Fund claims, whether the claims are  received by fax or mail or directly entered into the JFICS system by  agencies. First, the claims analyst reviews the claim to ensure that the  agency has provided all of the information necessary to process it. Once  the claims analyst determines that all of the information has been  provided, the claim is forwarded electronically to the claims reviewer. The claims reviewer performs a secondary review to determine if all the  information required has been provided, as well as to ensure that the  claims analyst entered the mailed or faxed information into JFICS  correctly. Claims for less than $1 million do not require further review and  are submitted to the Treasury Disbursing Office for payment. Claims for  $1 million or more are subject to management review, and claims for $50  million or more are sent to the Fiscal Service Office of Chief Counsel for  review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In connection with its oversight efforts, the Committee requested certain  information from Treasury about Judgment Fund financial balances,  activities, and other information.
