Coroners refer cases of suspected neglect to the state survey agency and law enforcement entities such as the state Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contracts with survey agencies in every state to periodically inspect nursing homes and investigate allegations of poor care or neglect. MFCUs are charged with investigating and prosecuting resident neglect. GAO examined (1) the results of Arkansas coroner investigations, (2) the state survey agency's experience in investigating coroner referrals, and (3) whether weaknesses in state and federal nursing home oversight identified in prior GAO reports were evident in the survey agency's investigation of coroner referrals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to the Pulaski County coroner, he referred 86 cases of suspected resident neglect to the state survey agency for the period July 1999, when the Arkansas law took effect, through December 2003. Agency officials said that other state coroners referred four cases during this time period. Importantly, these 86 referrals constituted just 2.2 percent of all nursing home deaths the coroner investigated. However, the referrals included disturbing photos and descriptions of the decedents, suggesting serious, avoidable care problems; more than two-thirds of the 86 referrals listed pressure sores as the primary indicator of neglect. Some photos of decedents' pressure sores depicted skin conditions so deteriorated that bone or ligament was visible, as were signs of infection and dead tissue. The referrals involved 27 homes, over half of which had at least 3 referrals. Arkansas state survey agency officials told GAO that they received 36 (fewer than half) of the Pulaski County coroner's referrals. The 50 referrals not received described decedents' conditions similar to those the survey agency did receive. Of the 36 referrals for alleged neglect that it received, the survey agency complaint investigations substantiated 22 and eventually it closed the home with the largest number of referrals. However, the agency's investigations often understated serious care problems--both when neglect was substantiated and when it was not. For 11 of the 22 substantiated referrals, the state survey agency either cited no deficiency for the decedent or cited a deficiency at a level lower than actual harm for the predominant care problem identified by the coroner. In contrast, MFCU investigations of many of the 11 referrals found the homes negligent in caring for decedents, and the MFCU reached settlements with the owners of several homes. In half of the 14 referrals not substantiated, the MFCU or an independent expert in long-term care either found neglect or questioned the \"not substantiated\" finding. Moreover, they found gaps and contradictions in the medical records for some decedents, raising a question about the survey agency's conclusions that the same records indicated appropriate care had been provided. GAO's prior work on nursing home quality of care found that weaknesses in federal and state oversight nationwide contributed to serious, undetected care problems indicative of resident neglect. GAO's review of the Arkansas survey agency's investigations of coroner referrals confirmed that serious, systemic weaknesses remain. Oversight weaknesses GAO previously identified nationwide and those it found in Arkansas included (1) complaint investigations that understated the seriousness of allegations and were not timely; (2) predictable timing of annual state surveys that could enable nursing homes so inclined to cover up deficiencies; (3) survey methodology weaknesses, coupled with surveyor reliance on misleading medical records, that resulted in missed care problems; and (4) a policy that did not always hold homes accountable for neglect associated with a resident's death."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An October 2002 series in the St. Louis Post Dispatch concluded that  avoidable deaths of vulnerable nursing home residents was a widespread  but rarely investigated problem. The series spotlighted an Arkansas law  requiring investigations by county officials, such as coroners, of all nursing  home deaths. Under this law, deaths associated with suspected resident  neglect, including poor quality care, are referred to the state survey agency  and to law enforcement entities. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for managing Medicare  and Medicaid, contracts with survey agencies in every state to oversee the  quality of nursing home care. In 1998, we reviewed allegations that  thousands of California nursing home residents died because of poor care.  We found oversight weaknesses that were systemic and not limited to  California. Despite federal and state oversight, over half of the decedents  in our sample had received unacceptable care that sometimes endangered  their health and safety. We also found that state surveyors sometimes  classified deficiencies at homes where residents had died as less serious  than warranted. Our subsequent reports on nursing home quality  continued to demonstrate that (1) an unacceptably large proportion of  nursing homes\u2014one-fifth as of early 2002\u2014harmed residents and   (2) states\u2019 periodic inspections of nursing homes failed to identify all  serious deficiencies, such as preventable weight loss and pressure sores.", "Our preliminary work on this report found that the 1999 Arkansas law was  the only such law nationwide. You asked us to consider Arkansas\u2019s  experience with required coroner investigations to assess the effectiveness  of nursing home oversight by the Arkansas state survey agency and by  CMS. Specifically, we examined (1) the results of Arkansas coroner  investigations of nursing home resident deaths, (2) the experience of the  Arkansas state survey agency in investigating suspected cases of resident  neglect referred by county coroners, and (3) whether systemic weaknesses  in state and federal nursing home oversight identified in our prior reports  were evident in the survey agency\u2019s investigations of coroner referrals.", "To identify the results of nursing home death investigations by Arkansas\u2019s  75 coroners, we asked the Arkansas Office of Long Term Care, the state  survey agency, to identify referrals from each county coroner since the  law\u2019s effective date. Because the agency told us that all but four of the  referrals were made by the Pulaski County coroner, where the state capital  Little Rock is located, we focused on that county\u2019s referrals. We obtained  and reviewed copies of the coroner\u2019s referrals, including the investigative  reports, autopsy reports (if one was conducted), and photos of decedents  that documented suspected care problems. We interviewed the Pulaski  County coroner to determine how reported deaths were investigated, the  basis for determining when referrals were warranted, and the process for  transmitting referrals to the state survey agency and law enforcement  entities. To evaluate state survey agency investigations of coroner referrals  of suspected nursing home neglect, we asked the Arkansas survey agency  to provide documentation on the results of its investigations. Since the  agency treats such referrals as complaints, we reviewed the agency\u2019s  guidance to surveyors on complaint investigations and discussed the  procedures with agency officials. We followed up with agency staff to  clarify facts regarding specific investigations of coroner referrals, as  needed. To assess the overall quality of care provided at homes with  coroner referrals, we obtained data from the survey agency on other  complaints against these homes and analyzed data in CMS\u2019s On-line  Survey, Certification, and Reporting system (OSCAR). CMS officials  generally recognize OSCAR data to be reliable, and we judged it to be  appropriate for our work.", "Since the Pulaski County coroner referrals were also sent to the Arkansas  Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU), we obtained copies of its  investigative files. MFCUs are charged with investigating and prosecuting  Medicaid provider fraud and incidents of patient abuse and neglect. In  Arkansas, the MFCU is located within the office of the state attorney  general. We compared the results of the state survey agency and MFCU  investigations to identify similarities and differences in their findings. For  some coroner referrals of suspected resident neglect for which we  questioned the state survey agency\u2019s decision to not substantiate the  existence of serious care problems, we asked a professor of nursing with  expertise in long-term care to assess the consistency between the findings  from the agency\u2019s investigations and the decedents\u2019 conditions as  documented by the coroner. The expert\u2019s assessment was based on a  review of the various investigative reports, medical records we obtained,  and photos of decedents taken by the coroner. We also discussed our  evaluation of the investigations with officials from the Arkansas state  survey agency, the MFCU, and CMS. To identify whether systemic  weaknesses in state and federal nursing home oversight were evident in  the survey agency\u2019s investigations of coroner referrals, we reviewed our  findings regarding the Arkansas state survey agency\u2019s investigations in the  context of our prior work on nursing home quality.

On the basis of statutory requirements, CMS defines  standards that nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare  and Medicaid programs, and contracts with states to assess, through  annual surveys and complaint investigations, whether homes meet these  standards. CMS is also responsible for monitoring the adequacy of state  survey activities.

A standard survey entails a team of state surveyors,  including registered nurses, spending several days in the nursing home to  assess compliance with federal long-term care facility requirements,  particularly whether care and services provided meet the assessed needs  of the residents and whether the home is providing adequate quality of  care, such as preventing avoidable pressure sores, weight loss, or  accidents. State surveyors assess the quality of care provided to a sample  of residents during the standard survey, which is the basis for evaluating  nursing homes\u2019 compliance with federal requirements. CMS establishes  specific investigative protocols for state surveyors to use in conducting  these comprehensive surveys. These procedural instructions are intended  to make the on-site surveys thorough and consistent across states. When a  deficiency is identified, the nursing home is required to prepare a plan of  correction that must be approved by the state survey agency. Our earlier  work indicated that facilities could mask certain deficiencies, such as  routinely having too few staff to care for residents, if they could predict  the survey timing; CMS therefore directed states, effective in 1999, to   (1) avoid scheduling a home\u2019s survey for the same month of the year as the  home\u2019s previous standard survey and (2) begin at least 10 percent of  standard surveys outside the normal workday (either on weekends, early  in the morning, or late in the evening)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complaint Investigations", "paragraphs": ["Complaint investigations provide an opportunity for state surveyors to  intervene promptly if quality-of-care problems arise between standard  surveys. A nursing home resident, family member, friend, nursing home  employee, or others may file complaints. CMS requires the investigation of  complaints that represent immediate jeopardy to resident health and  safety within 2 working days and considers such complaints to be those  where one or more of the conditions alleged in the complaint, if true, may  have caused or is likely to cause serious injury, harm, impairment, or  death to a resident. Beginning in 1999, CMS required investigation of  complaints that allege harm to a resident (but which do not rise to the  level of immediate jeopardy) within 10 working days, but did not provide  detailed guidance to the states about what constitutes harm until  November 2003. In November 2003 guidance, CMS generally defined two  categories of complaints representing harm: (1) those that, if true, would  impair the resident\u2019s mental, physical, and/or psychosocial status, which  must be investigated within 10 working days, and (2) those that would not  significantly impair the resident\u2019s mental, physical, and/or psychosocial  status, which must be investigated within 45 calendar days. Other  complaints that do not rise to the level of either immediate jeopardy or  harm do not have to be investigated until the home\u2019s next survey, or in  some cases, not at all if the state survey agency can determine with  certainty that no investigation, analysis, or action is necessary. The  requirements identified in the November 2003 guidance became effective  on January 1, 2004.", "Generally, nurse surveyors investigate complaints onsite at the nursing  home by reviewing medical records and interviewing staff and residents.  The investigations typically include a sample of residents in addition to the  resident who is the subject of the complaint to help determine if the  problems are systemic. Depending on the volume of complaints against a  particular home, several complaints for different residents may be  investigated concurrently. Each complaint may contain one or more  allegations that a facility is violating federal quality-of-care standards. For  example, a single complaint could allege problems with resident abuse,  treatment of pressure sores, and proper feeding and hydration. In the  course of complaint investigations, the state survey agency can either  substantiate or not substantiate the specific allegations or discover other,  unreported violations of federal standards (see table 1). A substantiated  complaint, however, does not necessarily mean that the state survey  agency found neglect of the resident who was the subject of the complaint  but rather may indicate other, unrelated care problems. If the state survey  agency finds a current violation of a federal standard during a complaint  investigation\u2014even if the violation does not relate to the specific  allegations being investigated or the residents who are the subject of the  complaint\u2014it is required to cite a deficiency against the home. If a  complaint investigation reveals no current violation of federal standards  but determines that an egregious violation of federal standards occurred in  the past that was not identified during earlier surveys, a deficiency known  as past noncompliance should be cited and a civil monetary penalty  imposed.

Federal  monitoring surveys can be either comparative or observational. A  comparative survey involves a federal survey team conducting a complete,  independent survey of a home within 2 months of the completion of a  state\u2019s survey in order to compare and contrast the findings. In an  observational survey, one or more federal surveyors accompany a state  survey team to a nursing home to observe the team\u2019s performance.  Roughly 81 percent of federal surveys conducted in fiscal year 2003 were  observational. State performance reviews, implemented in October 2000,  measure state performance against seven standards, including statutory  requirements on survey frequency, requirements for documenting  deficiencies, timeliness of complaint investigations, and timely and  accurate entry of deficiencies into OSCAR. These reviews replaced state  self-reporting of their compliance with federal requirements. In October  2000, CMS also began to produce 19 periodic reports to monitor both state  and regional office performance. The reports are based on OSCAR and  other CMS databases. Examples of reports that track state activities  include pending nursing home terminations (weekly); data entry  timeliness (quarterly); tallies of state surveys that find homes deficiency- free (semiannually); and analyses, by state, of the most frequently cited  deficiencies (annually). These reports, in a standard format, enable  comparisons within and across states and regions and are intended to help  identify problems and the need for intervention.

Coroners who find reasonable cause to suspect that the  death is due to maltreatment are directed to report their findings to the  state Department of Human Services and to law enforcement and the  appropriate prosecuting attorney. The statute leaves the scope of the  investigation up to each coroner.", "Like most states, Arkansas already required unnatural deaths to be  reported to the coroner for investigation before enactment of the 1999  law. According to a coroner who was instrumental in demonstrating the  need for the legislation, nursing home administrators chose to release  decedents to funeral homes despite the existing requirement for a coroner  investigation of deaths that occurred under suspicious circumstances.  From 1994 to 1998, this coroner\u2019s office conducted six exhumations of  nursing home residents and, after full postmortem examinations, all six  were determined to have died unnatural deaths.

Complaint allegations are entered on an  intake form that also includes the source of the complaint and eventually  the outcome of the investigation. To document their actions, Arkansas  surveyors generally prepare a one-to two-page summary specifically  describing how the complaint was investigated and which specific  allegations were or were not substantiated.

Generally, MFCUs have concurrent jurisdiction with local investigative  and prosecutorial authorities and can both investigate and prosecute such  cases statewide. On the basis of an investigation, a MFCU can initiate  criminal actions in state court but must first obtain permission from the  local prosecutor.

Even when measured against the number of complaints filed against  nursing homes and abuse and neglect case referrals to the MFCU, the  number of coroner referrals was very small. However, the coroner\u2019s  referrals, many accompanied by photos, often depicted signs of serious,  avoidable care problems.", "According to the Pulaski County coroner, his staff generally arrives at the  nursing home or hospital within 15 to 20 minutes after the notification,  which is expected to be immediate, of a resident\u2019s death. Facilities have  been instructed not to disturb the resident\u2019s body. The initial on-site  investigation consists of (1) a physical examination of the body, which is  photographed; (2) interviews with the treating physician, staff, and  perhaps family members; and (3) a review of the decedent\u2019s medical  records, including a comparison of doctors\u2019 prescriptions and nurses\u2019  notes to ensure that medications were properly administered. During the  investigation, the coroner\u2019s staff looks for several key indicators of  whether a decedent may have received poor care, including significant  weight loss; dehydration; pressure sores; undocumented injuries, such as  bruises or skin tears; and interviews with family members. Many of these  care indicators are similar to those examined during the state survey  agency\u2019s annual inspection of every nursing home. Before releasing the  body to a funeral home, the coroner may order a toxicology report or ask  the state medical examiner to conduct an autopsy to determine whether  care problems, such as a medication error or blood poisoning (sepsis)  from infected pressure sores, contributed to the resident\u2019s death. Of the 86  residents referred by the coroner to the state survey agency and the  MFCU, 14 had autopsies completed.", "Pressure sores, typically serious and often numerous, were the  predominant indication of care problems identified in 67 percent of the  coroner\u2019s referrals (see fig. 1). Pressure sores are caused by unrelieved  pressure on the skin that squeezes the tiny blood vessels supplying the  skin with nutrients and oxygen, causing the skin and ultimately,  underlying tissue to die. Most pressure sores can be prevented with  adequate nutrition, sanitation and frequent repositioning of the resident.", "In some of the coroner\u2019s photos, bone or ligament was visible, as were  signs of infection or dead tissue, indicating a serious stage IV pressure  sore (see table 3).", "Other indications of care problems identified by the coroner included  bruises, abrasions, and skin tears (12 percent) and falls or broken bones   (6 percent). For one referral, the bruise covered the decedent\u2019s entire  upper chest and for another the arm from the elbow to the shoulder. In  about 15 percent of referrals, the indications of care problems identified  by the coroner were difficult to categorize, such as a decedent with a  catheter whose penis was bloody and irritated, a resident who died when  he attempted to burn off his restraints with a cigarette lighter, and a  resident who was taken to the hospital with breathing problems. An  autopsy of the last resident revealed the presence of toxic or excessive  levels of drugs that likely caused the respiratory problems and contributed  to the development of pneumonia and to death.", "For some referrals, the coroner found evidence of multiple care problems.  For example, a 1999 referral involved a decedent with a 9-square inch  pressure sore on her lower back, a gangrenous foot, and ants on her  feeding tube and wounds. According to the resident\u2019s daughter, the odor in  her mother\u2019s room at the nursing home was so great that she had to leave.  The autopsy attributed the gangrene to arteriosclerosis that restricted the  blood supply to her legs but also found that the resident suffocated when  dried mucus that had accumulated in her mouth broke off and blocked her  breathing passage. According to the MFCU, her wounds and oral care  appeared to have been neglected for some time.", "The 86 cases of suspected resident neglect occurred in 27 nursing homes.  Although it is difficult to precisely identify the proportion of Pulaski  County nursing homes that had referrals because facilities closed and  opened during the time period we examined, over half of the 27 homes had  three or more referrals (see fig. 2). Fourteen homes accounted for almost  80 percent of the referrals. Some homes had a pattern of referrals  spanning several years. For example, one home had seven referrals\u2014one  in 1999, two in 2000, two in 2001, and another two in 2002. Three of these  seven referrals involved stage IV pressure sores, some of which were  blackened with dead tissue, and one referral involved a resident who died  because of an overdose of drugs administered by the nursing home.  Nineteen of the 27 nursing homes were referred by the Pulaski County  coroner, many of them more than once, because the deceased residents  had pressure sores (see app. I). Eleven of the 12 referrals for one home  involved pressure sores. The standard surveys of these homes, however,  infrequently raised concerns about the care provided to prevent and treat  pressure sores.

A final complaint investigation at  the home about 6 weeks later\u2014following the resident\u2019s death\u2014found that  he had 28 pressure sores when he died; 7 of the pressures sores, 2 of  which were stage IV, did not have a physician\u2019s order for treatment.", "Only five of the referrals for decedents at other homes resulted in the  citation of a deficiency at the actual harm or higher level for the decedent  in question (see table 5). The deficiencies cited involved quality of care or  abuse/neglect for four of the five decedents. For one of the five decedents,  who had numerous, serious pressure sores, no current violations of  federal standards were identified during the investigation of the coroner\u2019s  referral. Under CMS guidance, surveyors would need to identify a current  resident with inadequate treatment to prevent and heal pressure sores in  order to cite a pressure sore deficiency at the actual harm level. However,  the surveyor determined that an egregious past violation of federal  standards involving this decedent warranted citing a deficiency known as  past noncompliance and imposition of a civil monetary penalty. Because  the deficiency occurred in the past and was assumed to have been  corrected by the facility, a plan of correction was not required and no  deficiency could be cited for the underlying care issue\u2014inadequate  treatment to prevent and heal pressure sores. Although Arkansas state  survey agency officials told us that they frequently cite past  noncompliance, we found that it was cited for only one coroner referral.", "For the remaining 11 substantiated coroner referrals, the state survey  agency cited either no deficiency for the decedent or cited a deficiency at  a level lower than actual harm for the predominant care problem identified  by the coroner, even though the MFCU\u2019s investigations found neglect for  six of the decedents, in effect substantiating the existence of serious care  problems in these cases (see table 6). The MFCU\u2019s findings raise a  question about the thoroughness of state survey agency complaint surveys.  Because the nature of the problems identified by the coroner in these 11  referrals did not appear to differ significantly from referrals for home A  that were substantiated at the actual harm or higher level (see table 5), we  asked the state survey agency to review the 11 referrals to determine why  no serious deficiencies were cited and if past noncompliance should have  been cited. Noting their current heavy workload, state survey agency  officials agreed to review 2 of the 11 cases. They told us that they could  not cite an actual harm pressure sore deficiency for either decedent  because the decedents were not in the facility at the time of the complaint  investigations and under CMS guidance, surveyors would need to identify  a current resident with inadequate treatment to prevent and heal pressure  sores in order to cite a pressure sore deficiency at the actual harm level. In  one of these cases, however, agency officials told us that they should have  cited past noncompliance because of the serious nature of the decedent\u2019s  condition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Survey Agency Decision Not to Substantiate Some Coroner Referrals Was Questionable", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of the MFCU\u2019s investigations and our own review, we  question the state survey agency\u2019s decision not to substantiate more of the  coroner\u2019s referrals or forward them to another agency for further  investigation. Overall, the state survey agency did not substantiate 14 of  the 36 coroner referrals that it investigated. Although we did not assess  each of the 14 unsubstantiated referrals in detail, the state survey agency\u2019s  findings for 7 decedents were challenged either by the results of the  MFCU\u2019s investigations or by an expert review conducted at our request.  Both the MFCU and our expert noted omissions and contradictions in the  medical records of some of the 14 decedents, raising a question about the  state survey agency\u2019s conclusions that the same records indicated care had  been provided.", "The MFCU\u2019s investigations identified neglect of two decedents that the  state survey agency failed to substantiate. In one of the cases, the MFCU  found that the nursing home failed to (1) accurately assess changes in the  resident\u2019s status, allowing the resident to develop stage II pressure sores  before the staff was even aware that he had a skin problem; (2) track the  resident\u2019s ability to perform certain basic activities of daily living;   (3) routinely monitor his weight despite continued weight loss; and   (4) follow physician orders, sometimes delaying prescribed treatment. In  the other case, the MFCU found that the nursing home failed to provide  necessary treatment, rehabilitation, care, food, and medical services. In  particular, the resident had no skin breakdown upon admission to the  facility. But 7.5 months later, she had six pressure sores, including one on  her right hip that was almost 4 inches across and had progressed to stage  IV and two others that had progressed to stage III. There was no  comprehensive care plan to address the resident\u2019s pressure sores. Other  care was also found negligent. For example, during a hospital stay about   2 months before the resident\u2019s death, the hospital found a large area on the  back of her tongue with a thick buildup of saliva that had not been  properly cleaned at the nursing home for up to 7 days.", "For five other coroner referrals not substantiated by the state survey  agency, the expert agreed that we had a basis to question the state survey  agency\u2019s findings. For example, the expert found that (1) some facilities  were not removing the dead tissue around pressure sores; (2) the color of  one decedent\u2019s skin suggested it was urine stained, a situation that  contributes to skin breakdown and infection; and (3) two decedents were  not receiving oral care, the lack of which the expert characterized as  \u201cprofound\u201d for one decedent. For three of the five cases, the expert found  evidence that neglect contributed to the residents\u2019 physical condition as  documented in the coroner\u2019s referrals. In general, the expert found the  degree of skin damage and pressures sores in the reviewed cases to be  \u201cvery suspicious\u201d and concluded that preventive measures, such as special  mattresses, would have precluded the development of such severe  pressure sores, despite the decedents\u2019 health status. The expert also found  the scarce and inconsistent mention of pain assessment and management  to be suspicious enough to warrant concern about abuse. Although three  of the five deceased residents were receiving hospice care at the nursing  home, our expert questioned the apparent lack of care for these residents.  Ideally, hospice care provides consistent pain assessment and  intervention, measures to prevent further skin breakdown and the  associated discomfort, and local treatment to minimize odor. These  standards are inconsistent with not changing pressure sore dressings, even  if a family member asks not to have them changed. Finally, our expert  questioned if some of the facilities had a quality assurance process in place  to identify systemic problems, such as the incidence of pressure sores. We  found that the state survey agency had cited the facility where two of the  five decedents had resided for immediate jeopardy regarding the federal  requirements to maintain a quality assurance committee that meets  regularly. This deficiency was cited about 9 months before and 9 months  after the residents\u2019 deaths.", "In two of the five cases, the state survey agency had concluded that  serious pressure sores were acquired during hospitalizations but did not  identify other care problems noted by our expert consultant. For example,  one of the nursing homes failed to remove dead tissue around the pressure  sores, an indication of poor care. In addition, the expert noted the lack of  oral care for one of these decedents, again raising questions about the  quality of care provided by the home. Even if the state survey agency had  justifiably concluded that the decedents\u2019 serious pressure sores were  acquired during hospitalizations rather than in the nursing homes where  the residents died, neither case was referred to Arkansas\u2019s Division of  Health Facility Services, the entity responsible for oversight of hospitals  that serve Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. State survey agency  officials agreed that it might have been appropriate to refer such cases to  this division. CMS\u2019s 1999 guidelines for complaint investigations instruct  state survey agencies to refer cases to another agency when it lacks  jurisdiction.", "Omissions and contradictions in the medical records for four other  decedents whose referrals were not substantiated raise a question about  the state survey agency\u2019s conclusions that these same records indicated  care had been provided. For example, in two cases, the MFCU found  numerous omissions in the facility\u2019s care and treatment records, such as  missing entries on the medication records and nurse assistant flow sheets,  as well as a discrepancy as to when a pressure sore was first noted. In  another case, the MFCU concluded that there were so many  documentation problems that it was difficult to follow the course of one  decedent\u2019s care, including late entries that were \u201cquestionable and too  many.\u201d In addition, in another case, our expert consultant found that the  seriousness of a pressure sore was understated by the home.", "Federal surveyors also found evidence that state surveyors missed or  failed to cite deficiencies, including some that harmed residents. A March  2000 federal comparative survey of an Arkansas nursing home, some of  whose residents were the subject of coroner referrals, found care issues  that had not been identified by the state survey agency. A comparative  survey is conducted within 2 months of a state survey to independently  verify its accuracy. Overall, federal surveyors cited 19 health-related  deficiencies that state surveyors did not, including failure of the nursing  home to develop and implement effective procedures to prevent neglect  and abuse of residents. Three of the 19 deficiencies that state surveyors  did not identify were cited by federal surveyors at the actual harm level:  failure to provide (1) necessary care and services to maintain a resident\u2019s  highest well being; (2) good nutrition, grooming, and personal and oral  hygiene; and (3) treatment and services to increase and prevent further  degradation in a resident\u2019s range of motion. Federal surveyors also cited a  widespread failure in infection control procedures at the potential for  more than minimum harm level. One of the coroner-referred deaths at this  facility occurred within 6 weeks of both the state and federal surveys that  were about 1 month apart. The decedent arrived in the hospital emergency  room with a fever of 104\u00b0, an indication of infection, as well as ragged  tears on his right knee and shin and serious pressure sores on both  buttocks.

These oversight weaknesses include  (1) complaint investigations that understated the seriousness of the  allegations and were not conducted promptly; (2) annual standard survey  schedules that allowed nursing homes to predict when the next survey  would occur; (3) survey methodology weaknesses, coupled with surveyor  reliance on misleading medical records, that resulted in overlooked care  problems; and (4) a policy that did not always hold nursing homes  accountable for care problems identified after a resident\u2019s death."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Serious Complaints Were Inappropriately Prioritized and Not Promptly Investigated", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, we reported that many survey agencies in the 14 states we  examined often assigned inappropriately low investigation priorities to  complaints and failed to investigate serious complaints promptly.

Based on our draft report, CMS  reviewed the Arkansas state survey agency\u2019s prioritization of the 36  coroner referrals the agency said it received. CMS concluded that about   31 percent of the referrals should have been prioritized for more prompt  investigation. Furthermore, CMS found that 5 referrals prioritized by the  state as requiring an investigation within 10 working days suggested the  potential for immediate jeopardy and should have been prioritized for  investigation within 2 working days. The state survey agency prioritized 6  other referrals as not requiring investigation for up to 45 days, but CMS  indicated that 1 of these referrals should have been prioritized for  investigation within 2 days, and the remaining referrals within 10 working  days (actual harm).", "Although the state survey agency classified most of the 36 referrals as  requiring investigation within 10 working days, we found a significant  disparity between the prioritization it assigned and the time it actually  took to conduct the investigations. As shown in figure 3, 16 referrals were  investigated in 10 working days or less and 19 referrals took between 11  and 290 working days to investigate. Identifying time frames in terms of  working days, as CMS\u2019s guidance requires, however, understates the actual  elapsed time between receipt and investigation of referrals. The average  elapsed time from the date the survey agency received a referral until it  initiated its investigation was 46 calendar days. Seven referrals were not  investigated for between 91 and 425 calendar days and the investigation of  an additional 11 referrals took between 21 and 90 calendar days (see fig.  3). State survey agency officials told us that because of surveyor turnover  and the number of complaints received from all sources, the agency could  not investigate all coroner complaints quickly; CMS has identified  untimely complaint investigations in many other states.

For example, a home could (1) significantly change its  level of care, food, and cleanliness by temporarily augmenting its staff just  prior to or during the period of the survey and (2) adjust resident records  to improve the overall impression of the home\u2019s care. We believe that the  striking disparity between annual survey findings that failed to identify  serious problems in preventing and treating pressure sores and the  numerous instances of serious pressure sores identified by the coroner is  partly the result of the predictability of annual surveys. In July 2003, we  reported that standard surveys in Arkansas, as well as those nationwide,  continued to be highly predictable.", "In 2003, we reported that the timing of 36 percent of Arkansas\u2019s most  recent surveys (34 percent nationwide) could have been predicted by  nursing homes. We considered nursing home surveys predictable if  homes were surveyed within (1) 15 days of the 1-year anniversary of their  prior survey (28 percent for Arkansas) or (2) 1 month of the maximum   15-month interval between standard surveys (8 percent for Arkansas).  The director of the Arkansas state survey agency acknowledged that the  predictability of the state\u2019s standard surveys allowed homes to mask  problems by having more staff on hand during surveys. On the basis of the  finding in our 2003 report, she told us she has tried to reduce survey  predictability, in part by using computer programs to vary the timing of  homes\u2019 surveys. For 168 of Arkansas\u2019s approximately 236 nursing homes  surveyed since our last report (August 1, 2003, through June 22, 2004),   22.6 percent of the surveys were predictable.", "In 1998, we recommended that CMS segment the standard survey into  more than one review throughout the year, simultaneously increasing state  surveyor presence in nursing homes and decreasing survey predictability.  Although CMS disagreed with segmenting the survey, it did recognize the  need to reduce predictability. CMS directed states in 1999 to (1) begin at  least 10 percent of standard surveys outside the normal workday (either  on weekends, early in the morning, or late in the evening) and (2) avoid  scheduling, if possible, a home\u2019s survey for the same month of the year as  the home\u2019s previous standard survey.

Because CMS has not yet completed  the redesign of the survey methodology, nearly 7 years later Arkansas  surveyors, as well as those in other states, still rely on a flawed survey  methodology to detect resident care problems. As noted earlier, omissions  and contradictions in the decedents\u2019 medical records, as well as the  coroner\u2019s photos, sometimes raised questions about whether appropriate  care had been provided in cases the state survey agency did not  substantiate.", "Our 1998 report recommended that CMS revise federal survey procedures  by using a stratified random sample of resident cases and reviewing  sufficient numbers and types of resident cases. Under development since  1998, CMS\u2019s redesigned survey methodology is intended to more  systematically target potential problems at a home and give surveyors new  tools to better document care outcomes and conduct on-site  investigations. Use of the new methodology could result in survey findings  that more accurately portray the quality of care provided by a nursing  home to all residents. CMS officials told us that the new methodology  would be piloted in 2005 in conjunction with an evaluation that compares  its effectiveness with that of the current survey methodology. Our work in  Arkansas suggested the existence of sampling problems, underscoring the  importance of implementing the revised survey methodology. For  example, three residents with serious pressure sores who died on March 7,  March 29, and April 3, 2000, and were the subject of coroner referrals were  not included in the resident sample for one home\u2019s March 3, 2000, annual  standard survey. The survey failed to identify any pressure sore or other  quality of care deficiencies. It is difficult to understand how residents with  such serious care problems could have been omitted from the survey. In  addition, the extent of the physical deterioration of some decedents where  the MFCU identified neglect but the state survey agency did not find  similar problems for current residents also raises a question about state  survey agency sampling methodology because the seriousness of  decedents\u2019 conditions suggested that care problems were systemic.", "In some coroner referrals that the state survey agency did not substantiate,  surveyors noted that the medical records indicated that care had been  provided. However, the MFCU found omissions and contradictions in  decedents\u2019 medical records, including missing entries and late entries that  were \u201ctoo many and questionable.\u201d The medical record for one decedent  showed the resident\u2019s height as 10 inches different from the height in her  nutritional assessment (height is an important factor in determining a  resident\u2019s appropriate weight). Since surveyors screen residents\u2019 medical  records for indicators of improper care, misleading or inaccurate data may  result in care deficiencies being overlooked. We also found evidence that  Arkansas surveyors took medical records at face value even when these  records were contradicted by color photos that documented decedents\u2019  physical conditions. For example, our expert consultant found that the  coroner\u2019s photos of one decedent clearly showed that dead tissue around  pressure sores had not been removed even though the state surveyor cited  medical records indicating such care was provided just 11 days before the  resident\u2019s death. The coloration of the same decedent\u2019s skin also  suggested that she was left in her own waste for extended periods.

We believe that CMS\u2019s vague policy on past  noncompliance is partly responsible for this situation. First, the Arkansas  state survey agency did not always cite past noncompliance when  warranted. For example, the MFCU found that nursing homes had  neglected eight decedents referred by the coroner but the state survey  agency either cited no deficiency for the decedents, cited a deficiency at a  level lower than actual harm for the predominant care problems identified  by the coroner, or found the referrals to be unsubstantiated. According to  state survey agency officials, care problems similar to those of the  decedents were not identified in a sample of current residents and, under  CMS policy, the decedents\u2019 care problems were assumed to have been  identified and corrected by the home. Second, for the one coroner referral  that the Arkansas state survey agency did cite for past noncompliance, the  home was not required to prepare a plan of correction because no current  deficiency was identified. When past noncompliance is identified, it is  recorded in OSCAR and on CMS\u2019s Nursing Home Compare Web site simply  as past noncompliance without additional information on the specific  deficient practice(s), such as failure to prevent and treat pressure sores.", "Moreover, CMS policy discourages citing past noncompliance unless the  violation is egregious.

According to  CMS officials, the objective of its survey policy is to focus surveys on  current residents and care problems rather than on poor care provided in  the past. We question CMS\u2019s assumption that if a decedent\u2019s care problem  is not found to affect other residents at the time of a complaint  investigation, it was identified earlier by the home and corrected. On the  basis of our past work, it is also possible that the state survey agency\u2019s  complaint investigation missed serious care issues.

On the  basis of our prior work, we believe it is likely that serious care problems  similar to those identified by the Pulaski County coroner exist in other  Arkansas counties and in other states. Despite Arkansas\u2019s annual standard  surveys and intervening complaint investigations, the negligent care  provided to some residents before they died was never detected. In  addition, complaint investigations initiated by the state survey agency in  response to coroner referrals often failed to cite deficiencies for serious  care problems that, according to the MFCU\u2019s investigations and our expert  consultant, constituted or suggested neglect. Even when the Arkansas  state survey agency found the neglect to be egregious, it did not hold the  nursing home accountable by citing a little used deficiency known as past  noncompliance.", "We believe that CMS\u2019s policy on past noncompliance is flawed for three  reasons. First, the policy involves considerable ambiguity. CMS does not  define what constitutes an egregious violation yet implies that one exists  where care problems relate to a resident\u2019s death, which is often difficult to  demonstrate without an autopsy. Moreover, the term egregious is not  clearly related to CMS\u2019s scope and severity grid, which defines serious  deficiencies as actual harm or immediate jeopardy. Second, CMS\u2019s policy  on past noncompliance does not hold homes accountable for negligence  associated with a resident\u2019s death unless similar care problems are  identified for current residents. CMS assumes that (1) similar care  problems were not found because they have already been identified and  corrected by the home and (2) the state survey agency did not miss the  deficiency for current residents. However, our prior work demonstrated,  and our work in Arkansas confirmed, that (1) nursing home records can  contain misleading information or omit important data, making it difficult  for surveyors to identify care deficiencies during their on-site reviews and  (2) states\u2019 surveys of nursing homes do not identify all serious  deficiencies, such as preventable weight loss and pressure sores. Third,  the policy obscures the nature of the specific care problem, such as  avoidable pressure sores, because the only deficiency reported in OSCAR  and to the public on CMS\u2019s Nursing Home Compare Web site is \u201cpast  noncompliance.\u201d We believe that the goal of preventing resident neglect by  requiring nursing homes to comply with federal quality standards is  inconsistent with a policy that discourages citing deficiencies because the  harm was simply not egregious enough or was potentially missed for  current residents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator of CMS revise the agency\u2019s current  policy on citing deficiencies for past noncompliance with federal quality  standards by taking the following two actions:    hold homes accountable for all past noncompliance resulting in harm to  residents, not just care problems deemed to be egregious, and    develop an approach for citing such past noncompliance in a manner that  clearly identifies the specific nature of the care problem both in the  OSCAR database and on CMS\u2019s Nursing Home Compare Web site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and State Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CMS; the Arkansas Department of  Human Services, Office of Long Term Care (the state survey agency); the  Arkansas MFCU; and the Pulaski County coroner.

We do  have the authority to evaluate the performance of federally funded  entities\u2014such as the state survey agency and the MFCU\u2014that are  responsible for ensuring that Medicare and Medicaid nursing home  residents receive quality care, and we therefore focused our work on how  these entities responded to the cases referred to them.", "In particular, CMS highlighted the lack of referrals from most Arkansas  coroners and the processes followed by coroners, primarily the Pulaski  County coroner, in making referrals to the state survey agency. During our  interviews, the Pulaski County coroner and MFCU officials demonstrated  their awareness of the absence of an enforcement mechanism in the state  law to ensure that nursing homes and coroners comply with the law; the  Pulaski County coroner told us that he intends to pursue this issue with  the state legislature. According to CMS, the quality of the documentation  provided by coroners did not conform to key principles of forensic  science, such as embedded photo dating and subject identification, photo  scale metrics and color charting, and interviews with residents\u2019 physicians.  While the coroner referrals may have lacked these features, the referral  packages we examined clearly identified the decedents, the time the  coroner\u2019s office was notified of the deaths, and the time the coroner\u2019s staff  arrived at the homes. It is also clear from the documentation that the  photos were taken shortly after death. Requiring such a level of forensic  evidence from the coroner substantially exceeds the burden of proof the  state survey agency requires for other complaints filed, which is how the  coroner referrals are treated. The coroner referrals are intended to be the  starting point for the state\u2019s investigation, not a substitute for its own  thorough investigation.", "Both CMS and the state survey agency expressed concern about the  elapsed time between the dates of death and the receipt of coroner  referrals by the survey agency. In particular, they noted that our analysis  excluded five referrals the coroner made in 2004 that related to deaths in  2003, with the elapsed times from the deaths to receipt of the referrals  ranging from 222 to 400 days. We excluded these five referrals because  they had not yet been referred when we completed our data collection for  this report, which covered referrals for the period July 1999 through  December 2003. In principle, we agree with CMS\u2019s view that the value of  a timely investigation by the state survey agency can be influenced by the  length of time associated with referrals, even though we found that the  coroner\u2019s referral of several cases up to 4 months after the residents\u2019  deaths did not appear to have handicapped the investigations. For  example, the state survey agency substantiated three coroner referrals  with deficiencies at the actual harm and immediate jeopardy level even  though the referrals were not received for between 65 and 106 calendar  days after residents\u2019 deaths. Although the survey agency did not  substantiate one coroner referral that was not received until 102 days after  the resident\u2019s death, the MFCU found neglect. For the 36 referrals the  survey agency said it received from the coroner for the period we  analyzed, the average elapsed time from the date of death until the coroner  made his referral was 38 days (ranging from zero to 180 days), whereas the  average elapsed time from the date the survey agency received the referral  until it initiated its investigation was 46 days (ranging from zero to 425  days). Notwithstanding these elapsed times for coroner referrals and  state investigations, CMS commented that it would study its priority  criteria for complaint triage and refine its policy with regard to the  treatment of and response to complaints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Coroner Referrals and State Survey Agency Investigations", "paragraphs": ["Both CMS and the state survey agency questioned the validity of the  number of Pulaski County coroner referrals, commenting that we lacked  independent verification of the number actually referred; they also  believed that the report\u2019s language suggested referrals had been received  but not investigated. We revised the report to make it clear that the  coroner told us he had referred 86 cases of suspected neglect of deceased  nursing home residents to the state survey agency and the MFCU for  investigation (and, as noted below, we reviewed the related case  documentation for each of the 86 referrals). We also revised the report to  clarify that the state survey agency investigated the 36 coroner referrals  that it told us it had received. CMS asserted that the coroner was unable  to provide its clinical team with a list of his referrals; however, CMS\u2019s  comments do not reflect that the coroner\u2019s case files were not automated.  We compiled a list of the 86 referrals ourselves. Our list was based on  documentation provided by the coroner for each of the cases he told us he  referred, including a narrative summary describing the suspected neglect,  copies of decedents\u2019 medical records, autopsy reports, and photos  documenting the decedents\u2019 conditions. Although the state survey agency  and the MFCU told us that they did not receive all 86 coroner referrals, we  believe that the MFCU\u2019s receipt of almost three fifths of the coroner\u2019s  referrals (compared with the state survey agency\u2019s receipt of fewer than  half) provides independent corroboration that the Pulaski County coroner  made more than 36 referrals during the 4.5-year period we examined. As  noted in the report, the coroner was instrumental in securing passage of  the law, a fact that is inconsistent with the suggestion that the coroner  withheld referrals. To address the disparity in the number of referrals the  coroner told us he made and the number the state survey agency and the  MFCU told us they received, the coroner began requiring signed receipts  in March 2004, a practice reflected in our draft report.", "The state survey agency commented that we had understated the number  of investigations of nursing home deaths it had conducted. The agency  identified 22 investigations that, in most cases, were based on the receipt  of a complaint from individuals other than the coroner.", "We excluded 9 of these 22 investigations because they were conducted  prior to the residents\u2019 deaths. For example, one complaint of alleged rape  of a 91-year-old resident was filed by a hospital that found the resident had  a sexually transmitted disease. The complaint was not substantiated. The  coroner\u2019s investigation of the resident\u2019s death 5 months later resulted in a  referral based on seven serious pressure sores on the decedent\u2019s feet,  lower back, and hips, a problem that was not noted during the  hospitalization.", "We revised our analysis to include 1 of the 22 cases because the coroner  confirmed that he had indeed made the referral. Thus, we adjusted the  number of coroner referrals from 85 in the draft report to 86 in the final  report. We also revised the number of referrals the state survey agency  said it received from 35 to 36. We confirmed that this additional referral  was not received or investigated by the MFCU.", "For 7 cases, we determined that the allegations in the non-coroner  complaints were similar to the concerns raised by the coroner\u2019s  investigations and have added footnotes in the appropriate sections of the  report, depending on whether the investigations substantiated (2  complaints) or did not substantiate (5 complaints) the complainants\u2019  allegations.", "For the remaining 5 cases, we made no changes in the report. In one case,  the survey agency\u2019s complaint investigation focused on an issue different  from the suspected neglect identified by the coroner. In four other cases,  the agency included the decedents\u2019 records in its resident samples during  standard surveys. The decedents were not included in any deficiencies  cited during these surveys and, importantly, the surveyors lacked the  coroner\u2019s photos of pressure sores, which would have been particularly  useful in raising questions about the care provided as documented in the  decedents\u2019 medical records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Predictability and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Both CMS and the state survey agency questioned the relevance of survey  predictability to complaint investigations resulting from coroner referrals  and suggested we delete this analysis from the final report. Neither  organization commented on our assessment of the impact of survey  methodology weaknesses and misleading medical records on detecting  quality-of-care problems. We retained this analysis in the final report  because we believe the issues of survey predictability and methodology  are relevant to state survey complaint investigations of coroner referrals.  Our 1998 and subsequent work found that predictable surveys allowed  homes so inclined to (1) significantly change the level of care, food, and  cleanliness by temporarily augmenting staff just prior to or during a  survey, and (2) adjust resident records to improve the overall impression  of the home\u2019s care. We also reported in 1998 that surveyors may overlook  significant care problems during annual surveys because of survey  methodology weaknesses and omissions or misleading information in  resident medical records.", "Although the predominant care problem identified in 67 percent of the  coroner\u2019s referrals involved serious pressure sores, most of the nursing  homes referred had not been cited for a pressure sore deficiency at the  actual harm level or higher on any of their previous four standard surveys.  We believe that the striking disparity between annual survey findings and  the predominant care problems identified by the coroner relates to the  predictability of annual surveys, weaknesses in survey methodology, and  misleading medical records\u2014all of which contribute to the phenomenon  of undetected care problems. Our work in Arkansas suggested the  existence of sampling problems in a home whose annual survey failed to  detect any quality-of-care problems, even though three residents, all with  serious pressure sores, died within 1 month. The fact that none of these  residents was included in the nursing home\u2019s annual standard survey  underscores the importance of implementing a revised survey  methodology that CMS has had under development for 7 years. Our report  also provides several examples where misleading medical records  contributed to the failure of the Arkansas state survey agency to detect  care problems that the MFCU or our expert consultant identified and were  obvious in some of the coroner\u2019s photos of decedents.", "CMS further commented that our analysis of survey predictability  resurrected prior reports and recommendations to which CMS has  previously responded and that we failed to acknowledge CMS and state  survey agency progress in reducing survey predictability. We believe that  CMS\u2019s comments are inaccurate. In our 1998 report, we recommended  segmenting the survey into more than one review throughout the year to  reduce survey predictability. CMS responded to this recommendation by  requiring that 10 percent of state annual surveys be conducted on  weekends, at night, or early in the morning. Despite CMS\u2019s introduction of  \u201coff hour\u201d surveys, we reported in 2003 that about one-third of state  surveys remained predictable (36 percent in Arkansas). Contrary to CMS\u2019s  comments, the draft report did acknowledge that Arkansas appeared to be  making progress in reducing survey predictability through the use of  computer programs to vary the timing of homes\u2019 surveys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of the Arkansas Law", "paragraphs": ["In oral comments, the Pulaski County coroner indicated that our report  was fair and accurate. He also told us that he believes the law has had a  significant, positive impact on the quality of care provided to nursing  home residents in Pulaski County.

He also cited the declining number of  referrals\u2014only six 2003 resident deaths were referred compared to 18 in  2002.
