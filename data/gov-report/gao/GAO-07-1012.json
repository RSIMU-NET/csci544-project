However, because rental assistance is not an entitlement, not all who are eligible receive assistance. In response to a congressional mandate, GAO assessed (1) the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran renter households, (2) how HUD's rental assistance programs treat veteran status (whether a person is a veteran or not) and whether they use a veterans' preference, and (3) the extent to which HUD's rental assistance programs served veterans in fiscal year 2005. Among other things, GAO analyzed data from HUD, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Bureau of the Census, surveyed selected public housing agencies, and interviewed agency officials and veterans groups. GAO makes no recommendations in this report. VA agreed with the report's findings. HUD objected to the characterization in the report regarding HUD's policies on veteran status and program eligibility and subsidy amounts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, an estimated 2.3 million veteran renter households had low incomes. The proportion of veteran renter households that were low income varied by state but did not fall below 41 percent. Further, an estimated 1.3 million, or about 56 percent of these low-income veteran households, had housing affordability problems--that is, rental costs exceeding 30 percent of household income. Compared with other (nonveteran) renter households, however, veterans were somewhat less likely to be low income or have housing affordability problems. HUD's policies for its three major rental assistance programs generally do not take veteran status into account when determining eligibility or assistance levels, but eligible veterans can receive assistance. Also, HUD generally does not distinguish between income that is specific to veterans, such as VA-provided benefits, and other sources of income. The majority of the 41 largest public housing agencies that administer the housing choice voucher or public housing programs have no veterans' preference for admission. The 13 largest performance-based contract administrators that oversee most properties under project-based programs reported that owners generally did not adopt a veterans' preference. In fiscal year 2005, an estimated 11 percent of all eligible low-income veteran households (at least 250,000) received assistance, compared with 19 percent of nonveteran households. Although the reasons for the difference are unclear, factors such as differing levels of need for affordable housing among veteran and other households could influence the percentages."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Disproportionately large numbers of military veterans have appeared  among the homeless population in recent years, raising concerns about the  incomes and housing conditions of veterans who rent, rather than own,  their homes. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), on any  given night at least 194,000 veterans were homeless in fiscal year 2005\u2014 about one-third of the adult homeless population\u2014and many veteran  renters could be on the verge of homelessness if they have low incomes or  precarious living conditions in overcrowded or substandard housing. The  return of more veterans from service in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014some with  significant physical and psychological challenges\u2014could increase demand  for affordable housing with supportive services such as mental health and  substance abuse treatment. However, neither the VA nor other  government agencies report information specifically on the housing  conditions or housing costs of veterans who rent.", "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the primary  federal provider of rental housing assistance through its housing choice  voucher, public housing, and project-based programs. Vouchers, which are  annually renewable, enable about 2 million households to rent units of  their choice in the private market, while public housing and project-based  assistance is available to about 2.8 million households in specifically  designated units. These programs generally serve low-income  households\u2014those with incomes that are 80 percent or less of their local  area median incomes (AMI). Assisted households generally pay 30 percent  of their monthly incomes, after certain adjustments, in rent, and HUD pays  the remainder. Third-party administrators manage the programs on HUD\u2019s  behalf\u2014local public housing agencies (PHA) for the voucher and public  housing programs and individual private property owners for the project- based programs. PHAs and property owners are responsible for ensuring  eligibility and for determining the amounts that tenants contribute toward  their rents. However, because the rental assistance programs are not  entitlement programs\u2014the extent of assistance is limited by the amount of  appropriated funds\u2014not all renter households that are eligible receive  assistance. In this report, we refer to households that do not receive rental  assistance as \u201cunassisted.\u201d", "In 2005, an estimated 6 million unassisted low-income renter households  had what HUD termed \u201cworst-case housing needs\u201d\u2014that is, they paid  more than half of their income in rent, lived in severely inadequate  housing, or both. Many PHAs and property owners have long waiting lists  of renters seeking subsidized housing. Within broad program  requirements, PHAs and property owners generally have the discretion to  use a system of \u201cpreferences\u201d to give certain populations\u2014such as the  elderly, veterans, or the homeless\u2014priority in receiving assistance as  rental units or vouchers become available to new program participants.  HUD requires PHAs and property owners to describe their preference  policies in their administrative plans\u2014documents required for the voucher  and public housing programs\u2014or their tenant selection plans, which are  required for the project-based programs. HUD also funds a limited number  of supportive services programs for which PHAs and property owners can  apply that pay for service coordinators, economic self-sufficiency  initiatives for tenants, and other activities.", "The conference report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2006 Military Quality  of Life and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act mandated that we conduct  a study on housing assistance to low-income veterans. As agreed with your  Subcommittees, our study focuses on low-income veterans who rent their  homes. Specifically, this report discusses (1) the income status and  demographic and housing characteristics of veteran renter households; (2)  how HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs treat veteran status (that is,  whether a person is a veteran or not) and veteran-specific benefits in  determining eligibility and subsidy amounts; (3) the extent to which PHAs  and property owners participating in HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs  establish a veterans\u2019 preference in their administrative and tenant  selection plans; and (4) the extent to which HUD\u2019s rental assistance  programs served veteran households in fiscal year 2005.", "To determine the income status and demographic and housing  characteristics of veteran households, we utilized the Bureau of the  Census\u2019s (Census) 2005 American Community Survey (ACS), which  identified households\u2019 veteran status, income, and other demographic  characteristics, in conjunction with HUD\u2019s defined income categories\u2014 low (80 percent of AMI or less), very low (50 percent of AMI or less), and  extremely low (30 percent of AMI or less). Using HUD\u2019s income limits for  calendar year 2005, we estimated, by geographic area, the number of  veteran households that were in each income category. We also used  information on veteran households in ACS to describe certain  demographic characteristics, and the cost and quality of their housing.  (Not included in the 2005 ACS survey universe are individuals who live in  group quarters\u2014which include college dormitories, correctional facilities,  and certain types of nursing facilities and hospitals\u2014or homeless  individuals.) Unless otherwise noted, all reported numeric estimates  derived from ACS are subject to sampling errors of plus or minus 10  percent or less of the value of those numeric estimates. To determine how  HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs treat households veteran status in  determining eligibility and subsidy amounts, we reviewed HUD\u2019s eligibility  policies and regulations on rental assistance programs and interviewed  officials from HUD and VA. To determine whether PHAs and property  owners participating in HUD\u2019s programs have established a veterans\u2019  preference for households, we conducted interviews with officials from  the 41 largest PHAs that administer the public housing program (34 PHAs)  and the voucher program (40 PHAs), and from the 13 largest performance- based contract administrators (PBCA) that oversee property management  under project-based rental assistance programs. The PHAs and PBCAs  that we interviewed were responsible for administering or overseeing  more than half of the roughly $28 billion in assistance provided through  the three programs in fiscal year 2005. However, information on  preferences is not statistically generalizable to the other PHAs and  property owners. Finally, to determine the extent to which HUD\u2019s rental  assistance programs served veteran households in fiscal year 2005, we  matched data from HUD on program participants with data from VA on  living veterans and used these matched data to estimate the percentage of  low-income veteran renter households that received HUD assistance. For  all of our research objectives, we consulted with officials from various  housing and veterans groups, including Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center  on Housing Studies, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the  National Coalition of Homeless Veterans, the Corporation for Supportive  Housing, Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion, and  Volunteers of America.", "Appendix I contains a more detailed description of our scope and  methodology. We conducted our work in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los  Angeles, and Washington, D.C., from March 2006 through July 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to Census data, in 2005 an estimated 21.9 million households, or  20 percent of the 111.1 million households nationwide, were \u201cveteran  households\u201d\u2014that is, they had at least one member who was a military  veteran. As figure 1 shows, most veteran households\u2014about 80 percent\u2014 owned their own homes, a significantly higher percentage than was the  case for other (nonveteran) households.", "Census data also show that renter households were more likely to be low  income than were owner-occupied households. In 2005, an estimated 36.8  million households nationwide rented homes, including about 4.3 million  veteran households. Approximately 66 percent of renter households were  low income; in contrast, 32 percent of homeowners were low income.  Many of these households must rent because they lack sufficient income  and savings to purchase a home. Furthermore, studies by HUD and others  have noted the difficulties many renters face in finding a place with  affordable rents because growth in household incomes has not kept pace  with rising rents in many markets.", "VA, through a variety of programs, provides federal assistance to veterans  who are homeless, and also provides homeownership assistance, but does  not provide rental assistance. One of the agency\u2019s largest programs for  homeless veterans is the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem (GPD)  program, which provides funding to nonprofit and public agencies to help  temporarily shelter veterans. GPD funding can be used for purposes such  as paying for the construction or renovation of transitional housing and  reimbursing local agencies for operating the program. In fiscal year 2005,  the GPD program spent about $67 million and had about 8,000 beds that  were available to homeless veterans. VA also administers eight other  programs for outreach and treatment of homeless veterans. In addition to  its homelessness programs, VA provides a variety of programs, services,  and benefits to veterans and their families. Included among them are  pension payments, disability payments, health care services, training and  education allowances, and burial expenses. The VA assists veterans in  becoming homeowners through its Home Loan Guaranty program, which  offers mortgages with favorable terms, including no down payment,  limitations on closing costs, no private mortgage insurance, and easier  credit standards to qualify for a loan.", "HUD provides rental housing assistance through three major programs\u2014 housing choice voucher, public housing, and project-based. In fiscal year  2005, these programs provided rental assistance to about 4.8 million  households and paid about $28 billion in rental subsidies. These three  programs generally serve low-income households\u2014that is, households  with incomes less than or equal to 80 percent of AMI. Most of these  programs have targets for households with extremely low incomes\u2014  30 percent or less of AMI. HUD-assisted households generally pay 30  percent of their monthly income, after certain adjustments, toward their  unit\u2019s rent. HUD pays the difference between the household\u2019s contribution  and the unit\u2019s rent (under the voucher and project-based programs) and  the difference between the PHAs\u2019 operating costs and rental receipts for  public housing.", "The housing choice voucher program provides vouchers that eligible  families can use to rent houses or apartments in the private housing  market. Voucher holders are responsible for finding suitable housing,  which must meet HUD\u2019s housing quality standards. The subsidies in the  voucher program are connected to the household (that is, tenant-based),  so tenants can use the vouchers in new residences if they move. The  approximately 2,500 PHAs that administer the voucher program are  responsible for ensuring that tenants meet program eligibility  requirements and that tenant subsidies are calculated properly. PHAs also  are required to develop written policies and procedures to administer the  program consistently with HUD regulations.", "The public housing program subsidizes the development, operation, and  modernization of government-owned properties and provides units for  eligible tenants in these properties. In contrast to the voucher program,  the subsidies in the public housing program are connected to specific  rental units (that is, project-based), so tenants receive assistance only  when they live in these units. Approximately 3,300 PHAs manage the  public housing program on behalf of HUD. PHAs are responsible for  ensuring tenant eligibility for the program, properly calculating tenant  subsidies, and ensuring that their policies and procedures conform to HUD  regulations.", "Finally, through a variety of project-based programs, HUD provides rent  subsidies in the form of multiyear housing assistance payments to private  property owners and managers on behalf of eligible tenants. Tenants may  apply for admission to these properties with project-based rental  assistance contracts. About 22,000 property owners and managers  currently participate in the programs and, similar to PHAs, must ensure  tenants meet eligibility requirements, calculate subsidies correctly, and  develop administrative policies and procedures that are consistent with  HUD regulations. For most of these project-based properties, HUD  contracts with PBCAs\u2014typically state and local housing agencies\u2014to  oversee property management and process requests for payments from  property owners. The PBCAs are also responsible for conducting annual  management and occupancy reviews, which include reviewing property  owners\u2019 tenant selection plans.", "HUD rental assistance programs are not entitlements, and as a result, the  amount of funding HUD requests and Congress provides annually limits  the number of households that these programs can assist. Historically,  funding for these programs has not been sufficient to assist all eligible  households. Because the demand for rental assistance outstrips available  resources, many PHAs and property owners have waiting lists of  applicants seeking rental assistance. PHAs and property owners can use a  system of preferences for giving certain populations\u2014such as the elderly,  veterans, or the homeless\u2014priority in receiving assistance as units or  vouchers become available.", "In addition to rental assistance, HUD funds a limited number of supportive  services programs. The programs offer counseling, education and job  training, mental health services, transportation, and child care, among  other services. Generally, PHAs and property owners must apply for  funding under these programs. Supportive services not funded by HUD  can be made available through partnerships between individual properties,  local organizations, and other federal agency programs.", "HUD administers other programs that help low-income households,  including eligible veteran households, obtain access to affordable rental  housing. Our review did not focus on these programs because they make  up a relatively small percentage of HUD\u2019s funding when compared with  the three major rental assistance programs. Further, they are not solely  rental assistance programs, but rather serve multiple purposes; for  example, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) provides  formula grants to states and localities to build, acquire, and rehabilitate  affordable housing for rent or homeownership. In addition, other federal  agencies administer programs that provide forms of rental assistance to  eligible populations, such as the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) Low- Income Housing Tax Credit program and U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (USDA) Rural Housing Service programs. The tax credit program funds  the development of rental units that are restricted to low-income  households for a number of years, while USDA\u2019s programs (which are  small relative to HUD\u2019s programs) fund the development of low-income  rental units or subsidize rents in rural areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Than Half of Low-Income Veteran Renter Households Had Housing Affordability Problems", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of ACS data, an estimated 2.3 million veteran renter  households had low incomes in 2005.

Before 1998, federal law required PHAs  and property owners to offer a preference to eligible applicants to their  subsidized housing programs who (1) had been involuntarily displaced,  (2) were living in substandard housing, or (3) were paying more than half  their income for rent. PHAs were required by law to allocate at least 50  percent of their public housing units and 90 percent of their housing  choice vouchers to applicants who met these criteria. Similarly, project- based owners had to allocate 70 percent of their units to newly admitted  households that met these criteria. The Quality Housing and Work  Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) gave more flexibility to PHAs and  project-based property owners to administer their programs, in part by  eliminating the mandated housing preferences.

However, HUD may examine the use of preferences as part of  specific studies or reports. For example, HUD discussed the use of  preferences by PHAs in its November 2000 report on the use of  discretionary authority in the housing choice voucher program. HUD  reported that about 71 percent of the 1,684 PHAs that were reviewed used  admission preferences for the housing choice voucher program.

Some  officials told us that the PHA did not need a veterans\u2019 preference because  veteran applicants generally qualified under other preference categories,  such as elderly or disabled.

Thus, these  percentages likely understate the actual share of all eligible veteran renter  households that receive federal rental assistance.)", "The reasons why other households were nearly twice as likely as veteran  households to receive HUD assistance are unclear. But, based on our  analyses and discussions with agency officials, some potential  explanations include (1) differences in the extent of housing needs  between veteran and other households, (2) infrequent use of a veterans\u2019  preference by PHAs and property owners, and (3) statutory requirements  for targeting extremely low-income households. First, as discussed earlier  in this report, although a significant proportion of low-income veteran  households face affordability problems, an even larger proportion of other  (nonveteran) households face more severe affordability problems. Thus,  the level of veteran demand for rental assistance may be lower than that of  nonveteran households. Second, and again as discussed earlier in this  report, HUD rental assistance programs do not take veteran status into  account when determining eligibility, and most PHAs and property owners  do not offer a veterans\u2019 preference. As a result, these policy decisions  likely focus resources on other types of low-income households with  housing needs. Third, although low-income households generally are  eligible to receive rental assistance from HUD\u2019s three programs, statute  requires that a certain percentage of new program participants must be  extremely low income. These targeting requirements may lead to a higher  share of HUD rental assistance going to nonveteran households because  veteran households generally are less likely to fall within the extremely  low-income category.", "According to HUD, other federal rental assistance programs (such as IRS\u2019s  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, HUD\u2019s HOME, and USDA\u2019s rental  assistance programs) also can provide assistance to veterans. Thus, the  share of veterans receiving HUD rental assistance does not reflect the  share of veterans that receive some other form of federal rental assistance.  Furthermore, according to HUD, veterans may be more likely to receive  rental assistance from some of these other programs, in part because these  other programs do not target extremely low-income households as do  HUD\u2019s voucher, public housing, and project-based programs.

For the records in PIC  and TRACS that were matched to BIRLS, about 65 percent matched on  Social Security number, first and last names, and date of birth; about 30  percent matched on Social Security number and some combination of  names and date of birth; and about 5 percent matched on names and date  of birth only. We used the resulting matched information to determine the  number of veteran households that received rental assistance from HUD  and the annual subsidy amount that HUD paid to veteran households in  2005. Our totals of HUD-assisted veteran households could underestimate  the actual number of veteran households in the programs because of a  lack of complete information on all living veterans in the data we obtained  from VA. For example, Social Security numbers, which we used to match  VA and HUD data, may not have been available for all veterans who served  in the 1970s or earlier.
