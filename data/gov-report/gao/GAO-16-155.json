IRS does not have an organizational structure for information referrals with clear leadership for defining objectives and outcomes for measuring cost-effectiveness and results. Without clear leadership, IRS does not know how effectively it is leveraging information referrals to address the tax gap. IRS has incomplete documentation of procedures for the information referral process, increasing the risk of delays and added costs in routing the information for further action. Although one-quarter of the information referrals in fiscal year 2015 were sent for destruction after screening, IRS has not documented procedures for supervisory review of those referrals prior to destruction. Without procedures to address these control deficiencies, IRS is compromised in its ability to know how effectively it is leveraging tax noncompliance information reported by the public.", "Fragmentation and overlap across IRS's general information referral process and eight specialized referral programs, such as for reporting identity theft and misconduct by return preparers, can confuse the public trying to report tax noncompliance to IRS. Yet coordination between referral programs is limited, and IRS does not have a mechanism for sharing information on crosscutting issues and collaborating to improve the efficiency of operations across the mix of referral programs.

The inventory of information referrals is stored on a wall of  bookcases until Fresno ICT clerical staff are available to screen them.", "Initial screening. Once assigned to review information referrals, Fresno  ICT clerical staff screen the information referral text describing the alleged  violation (shown in figure 2).

Fresno ICT routes information referrals to 26 different  locations across about 15 other IRS operating divisions and units. SB/SE  and W&I audit divisions are the most common recipients of information  referrals from the Fresno ICT, as shown in figure 4.

In contrast, IRM procedures for the  correspondence scanning performed by ICT clerical staff detail steps on  removing staples from paper to be scanned and the daily tasks for  cleaning the scanners. The lack of documented procedures clearly  linking the guidelines to the physical logistics of clerical routing of paper  forms increases the risk that the guidelines will not be implemented  consistently.", "We also found deficiencies in maintaining and communicating the  guidelines to the clerical staff. According to an Accounts Management  official, in the fall of 2014, the Accounts Management unit inadvertently  distributed an outdated copy of the guidelines that did not incorporate  clarifications added to aid the Fresno ICT staff with clerical screening of  information referrals involving child identify theft (discussed further  below). According to Accounts Management officials, they are working to  ensure that updated guidelines are communicated in a timely basis to the  clerical staff. At the June 2015 coordination meeting, the Fresno ICT  managers said that they were not aware that the Accounts Management  unit had distributed updated guidelines on the Servicewide Electronic  Research Program. As a result, the Fresno ICT managers did not  distribute copies of the latest guidance for the clerical staff to follow.  According to IRS officials in September 2015, the Accounts Management  unit began to electronically distribute updated guidelines each month and  to alert the Fresno ICT managers by email so they can print paper  guidelines for the clerical staff. However, we noted that the revised IRM  for ICT operations does not have procedures for this communication  practice. In December 2015, when we discussed this with IRS officials,  they agreed that the IRM should document the guidelines and procedures  for the Fresno ICT clerical staff for screening and routing information  referrals.", "In addition, inadequate controls over maintaining and communicating the  routing guidelines coupled with incomplete procedures linking the routing  guidelines to the routing boxes have contributed to clerical confusion and  errors that resulted in IRS erroneously destroying information referrals  from taxpayers reporting child identity theft. In March 2015, the ICT  clerical staff we observed in Fresno said that they were uncertain how to  route such referrals. The clerical staff we interviewed said that the label  on the identity theft routing box originally specified child identity theft as  key words for screening and routing, but those key words were omitted at  some point in updating the box label. Although the routing guidelines for  screening and routing identity theft referrals approved by the Tiger Team  had not changed, some clerical staff stopped routing child identity theft  referrals and instead retained those for destruction. We were not able to  quantify how many information referrals reporting child identify theft may  have been erroneously destroyed between the fall of 2014 and March  2015.", "During our audit visit, we reviewed the most recent box of 155 information  referrals retained for destruction and identified 12 information referrals  reporting potential child identity theft or misuse of a child\u2019s tax  identification number where the parent or custodian did not know who  was using the child\u2019s identity. During a meeting with Fresno ICT  managers regarding the 12 information referrals, the ICT managers said  that they determined that 4 of the 12 referrals were correctly retained for  destruction because the individual submitting the referral did not specify  another tax issue and did not know who used the child\u2019s identity. Seven of  the 12 referrals should not have been retained for destruction and were  subsequently routed by the Fresno ICT as stolen refund cases, and one  of the 12 referrals alleging identity theft by a tax return preparer was  routed to the Return Preparer referral program. During the June 2015  coordination meeting that we observed, Accounts Management officials  orally directed the Fresno ICT managers to instruct the clerical staff to  route referrals about child identity theft. The Fresno ICT managers  instead requested that Accounts Management and Tiger Team clarify the  guidelines for child identity theft reports to avoid further confusion. In  August 2015, the clarification was added to the routing guidelines.", "Inadequate controls over the guidelines without clearly documented  clerical review procedures pose the risk that clerical staff may apply  outdated or inaccurate routing guidelines. Misrouting the information  referrals causes delays and added cost for IRS in getting referrals to the  appropriate unit for follow-up. Information referrals inappropriately  retained for destruction may compromise IRS\u2019s ability to combat tax  noncompliance reported by the public and to assist identity theft victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Lacks Supervisory Review and Segregation of Duties for Preparing Information Referral Inventory Reports", "paragraphs": ["According to federal internal control standards, effective management of  an organization\u2019s workforce\u2014its human capital\u2014is essential to achieving  results.

This should  include separating the responsibilities for authorizing transactions,  processing and recording them, reviewing the transactions, and handling  related assets. No one individual should control all key aspects of a  transaction or event.", "According to Fresno ICT management, due to limited experienced staff  for the information referral process, management relies on one lead clerk  to keep track of the information referral inventory. That Fresno ICT lead  clerk is responsible for several key inventory reporting duties which  include documenting the number of referrals received, counting and  mailing those routed to other IRS units, and compiling the weekly  inventory reports. The weekly inventory reports compiled by the Fresno  ICT are used by Submission Processing, Accounts Management, and  other IRS units participating in the Tiger Team to track the volume of  information referrals received, referrals waiting in inventory, and volumes  routed to other units. Inventory information is used by the Fresno ICT  management in assigning clerical staff The Fresno ICT has not trained  additional lead clerks to compile the inventory reports. Given the  fragmented organizational structure and shared use of the weekly report,  it is unclear whether the Accounts Management unit or the Fresno ICT is  responsible for documenting procedures on how to prepare the inventory  reports.", "In addition, IRS officials explained that due to time constraints and other  priorities in the Fresno ICT, information referral inventory reports are not  reviewed by a supervisor before relaying the weekly report to Accounts  Management. During our visit, we tested several weekly reports to the  transmittal forms that document the number of information referrals that  are routed to other units. Developing the reports involves several  calculations to document the number of information referrals received and  routed to each of the other operating units. We identified errors in tallying  the counts of referrals retained, recording the number of referrals sent to  each IRS unit, and calculating the total number routed.

The ICT quality review  staff are to sample all ICT work streams, but we could not determine  which, if any, retained referrals had been reviewed under that process.  According to the Fresno ICT managers and lead clerical staff, the lead  clerk is to conduct a limited visual review of the referrals retained for  destruction before sealing and dating each storage box, but we found no  documentation of such reviews. Also, IRS does not track common  reasons as to why referrals are not routed for follow-up.", "Information referrals inappropriately retained for destruction may  compromise IRS\u2019s ability to combat tax noncompliance reported by the  public and to assist identity theft victims. According to the Fresno ICT  manager, prior to our March 2015 site visit, the Fresno ICT conducted an  ad hoc quality review of referrals retained for destruction and had trained  all clerical staff on the routing guidelines. According to the Fresno ICT  manager, the clerical staff who do not screen information referrals  regularly\u2014such as temporary seasonal staff during the tax filing   season\u2014are less familiar with the guidelines and are more likely to  incorrectly retain referrals for destruction. In response to the ad hoc  review by Fresno ICT, the ICT removed and routed for follow-up several  hundred referrals that otherwise would have been destroyed.", "During our March 2015 visit to the IRS ICT office in Fresno, California, we  reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 38 information referrals (screened  during early January 2015 through mid-March 2015) retained for  destruction. Even though IRS had conducted an ad hoc quality review of  referrals retained for destruction prior to our visit, we questioned IRS  officials about 10 of the 38 retained referrals we reviewed. These 10  referrals lacked documentation of clerical screening and tax identification  number research or did not appear to follow the routing guidelines. IRS  managers subsequently determined 4 of the 10 should not have been  retained for destruction. Three referrals were routed to other IRS units  after clerical staff completed TIN research and re-screened. One Spanish  language referral had not been screened and was sorted for screening by  a clerical staff person knowledgeable of Spanish.", "The ad hoc review conducted by the Fresno ICT in March 2015 saved  hundreds of referrals from destruction, but without periodic monitoring of  the reasons for referrals being retained, IRS is missing an opportunity to  identify patterns in retention errors. Analysis of referrals retained before  destruction could help identify clerical staff errors that may be addressed  by better documenting procedures. For example, the screening and  routing guidelines do not have a procedure for referrals in languages  other than English. The Fresno ICT has set up two boxes labeled for  Spanish and other languages, respectively. However, clerical staff may  not know to sort other language referrals in those boxes, and lead clerks  may not regularly check those boxes because they are not part of the  weekly routing mail and inventory report. Without procedures for  reviewing information referrals retained for destruction, some referrals  may be inappropriately retained which may compromise IRS\u2019s ability to  combat tax noncompliance reported by the public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Misroutes Returned Are Used as a Measure of Routing Quality, but the Extent of Misrouting Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Federal internal controls and all transactions and other significant events  need to be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily  available for examination.

The weekly inventory management and routing report  documents the number of misroutes returned by various IRS units. The  Fresno ICT uses the misrouted referrals to provide feedback to clerical  staff about specific errors and then re-routes the paper referrals by mail to  the appropriate unit for follow-up. IRS units that return misroutes to the  Fresno ICT use an IRS transmittal form to document the return of  misroutes to the ICT. The transmittal form also reports the number of  referrals incorrectly sent to the IRS unit. This feedback process adds  costs of mailing misroutes back and delays in re-routing referrals for  follow-up. For fiscal year 2016 as of December 2015, W&I returned 625  misrouted information referrals by mail to Fresno.

Some of the  specialized referral programs with overlapping responsibilities already  have some formal means of coordinating on crosscutting issues and  sharing information on related referrals. For example, the Return Preparer  Office and SB/SE Abusive Transactions regularly coordinate on abusive  transactions involving tax preparers and can access common electronic  information systems to identify overlapping referrals. The Return Preparer  Office also shares information with the Identity Theft Program on identity  theft, a crosscutting issue. For example, identity theft can involve another  IRS unit and a different referral form, such as the Identity Theft Program  and the Return Preparer Office based on the type of identity theft. If the  taxpayer is alleging that they are an actual or potential victim of identity  theft, the specific Identity Theft referral form should be used to report the  allegation. If the taxpayer is alleging a return preparer filed a return or  altered their return without their consent, the Return Preparer Office  referral form should be used to report the allegation. Other referral  programs using specialized forms also have practices that could improve  information referral processing, as shown in table 5.", "Improving the referral intake process through improved collaboration and  coordination could benefit both IRS and the public. Specifically,  harmonizing referral forms and instructions to avoid duplicate and  misdirected filings may improve efficiency and help to reduce public  confusion and administrative burden. For example, an IRS mechanism for  coordinating referrals could explore electronic fax (e-fax) as a method to  improve efficiency of referral intake. In fiscal year 2015, IRS received over  87,000 information referrals submitted on Form 3949-A or as letters. As  previously mentioned, IRS only accepts paper information referrals, which  must be mailed to the Fresno office where the Image Control Team  manually sorts and routes the form to other IRS units for further review. In  contrast, five referral programs with forms\u2014Identity Theft, SB/SE Abusive  Transactions, Return Preparer Office, TE/GE Exempt Organizations, and  E-file program\u2014allow the public to submit referrals by fax. In 2013, IRS  briefly explored and rejected the e-fax option for information referrals  because the Image Control Team screening clerks at that time did not  have computers to access fax submissions. Since December 2014,  Fresno Image Control Team clerks have had access to computers to  perform TIN research for information referrals; however, IRS has not  revisited the e-fax option. Although IRS officials stated they do not believe  e-fax for information referrals is feasible due to the large volume received,  other IRS units collaborating across referral programs could provide  lessons learned or suggestions for streamlining the intake process  through e-fax or other options.", "Without a broader collaborative mechanism to communicate across its  referral programs and collaborate on practices for receiving and  screening referrals, IRS may be missing opportunities to leverage  resources, streamline intake processes, and address challenges arising  from the fragmented and overlapping referral programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities to Consolidate Referral Intake", "paragraphs": ["Resolving the inefficiencies of IRS\u2019s paper-based information referral  system poses a unique challenge for management, given resource  constraints, the complexity of current processes, and the need to protect  taxpayer information. We have previously identified a number of  management approaches that may enable IRS to consolidate the referral  intake and screening process and improve efficiency, including  implementing process improvement methods and technology  improvements that improve efficiency, increase product quality, and  decrease costs. Process improvement methods can involve examining  processes and systems to identify and correct costly errors, bottlenecks,  or duplicative processes while maintaining or improving the quality of  outputs. Providing information to policymakers on how to improve  efficiency and reduce and better manage fragmentation, overlap, or  duplication can help alleviate some of the government\u2019s fiscal pressures  and improve program effectiveness.", "Another component of improved efficiency involves identifying,  developing, and implementing strategies that streamline the reporting of  tax noncompliance while appealing to the public. According to IRS\u2019s  Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2014 through 2017, the public has a  preference for Internet-based service over other service channels such as  phones, paper, or in-person. IRS says it is committed to expanding its  portfolio of digital service offerings to meet customer expectations while  continuing to keep taxpayer data secure. State tax agencies and other  federal agencies accept fraud referrals via online Internet submission. For  example, among seven of the most populous states, five provided an  online reporting option to report allegations of tax fraud and evasion.  Similarly, the Social Security Administration has an online form for  reporting fraud via its website.", "Finally, strengthened collaboration across the nine referral programs  could enable IRS to explore a more systemic online referral submission  process: such an effort could help the agency improve its ability to more  efficiently receive and process information referrals, while also reducing  the public confusion caused by trying to choose among multiple forms.  Currently, IRS\u2019s specialized referral forms to report alleged tax  noncompliance are received within IRS units through different channels  (mail, fax, email). As discussed earlier, the public often uses information  referrals because it is a general form that is used to report different tax  noncompliance; however, we found that information referrals are  misrouted and often retained for destruction. According to a Return  Preparer Office official, the Return Preparer Office is exploring conversion  of its specialized referral form to an online form. However, if the various  referral programs separately explore developing online form submission,  IRS risks replicating or compounding the fragmented mix with multiple  referral forms and means of submission. An IRS official stated that a  universal online referral intake system to control the routing of referrals  would be preferable to separate systems for each referral form.  Streamlining referral submission could be less cumbersome for the public  and could reduce delays and rework in re-routing information to  specialized referral programs. According to IRS officials, more electronic  submissions is a vision for the future but funding is limited.

The documents include the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM), Form 3949-A  Screening and Routing Guidelines, operating division referral processing  flowcharts, organizational charts, and training materials. We interviewed  IRS officials responsible for maintaining the screening and routing  guidelines and those overseeing the clerical screening and routing  process, and in March 2015 we observed the information referral  screening process in Fresno, California. We reviewed coordination  meeting agendas and minutes and observed coordination meetings  between the officials responsible for the screening process and with other  IRS unit officials. In addition, we analyzed inventory data on the volumes  of referrals received and routed to operating divisions for fiscal years  2012 through 2015.
