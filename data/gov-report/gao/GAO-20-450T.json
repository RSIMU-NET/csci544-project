To do so, GAO summarized the findings discussed in its July 2019 report on DHS's EEO efforts and reported on DHS's actions taken to address recommendations. To obtain updates on actions taken by DHS, GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed DHS EEO officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses multiple information sources to identify potential barriers to equal employment opportunity (EEO), but lacks performance metrics for tracking its progress towards eliminating identified barriers. DHS generally uses the information sources that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance recommends, such as employee survey results, to help identify potential barriers. While DHS reports some improvements in employee engagement and representation of minorities and women from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, it does not have complete performance metrics, such as the retention rate of women in law enforcement positions. Using performance metrics could help DHS assess its progress in eliminating barriers.", "DHS and its components have identified various deficiencies in their EEO programs, but lack policies and procedures for developing action plans and formal staffing models to address deficiencies. For example, in each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2018, DHS reported that senior managers at DHS components did not successfully implement EEO action plans and incorporate EEO action plan objectives into agency strategic plans. Further, DHS components lacked action plans to address nearly half (179 out of 369) of the deficiencies self-reported by all components from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. For example, in fiscal year 2017, four DHS components did not have action plans to ensure that their EEO directors report directly to their agency heads, as required by EEOC guidance. Developing policies and procedures to help ensure components' EEO programs have action plans for addressing deficiencies could help DHS components better comply with EEOC requirements.", "In addition, developing and using formal staffing models\u2014a tool to determine the number of staff required\u2014for their EEO programs could help DHS and its components to identify, request, and obtain the staff they need. For example, DHS and its components reported that staffing challenges contributed to some of their program deficiencies, and acknowledged they did not have formal staffing models for their EEO programs.", "DHS has plans to address nine areas of noncompliance in its EEO program identified by EEOC. In its July 2017 review of DHS compliance with EEOC requirements, EEOC found that DHS did not provide complete demographic data on new hires and promotions in its fiscal year 2016 report to EEOC. DHS reported to EEOC that it had collected and analyzed such demographic data beginning in fiscal year 2019.", "DHS's EEO and human capital offices assist and support DHS components in identifying and addressing EEO barriers. However, DHS's EEO office lacks policies and procedures to ensure components respond timely and completely to areas of noncompliance identified in EEOC feedback letters. Additionally, DHS EEO officials said they lack authority to ensure components' compliance with EEOC requirements. Without addressing these issues, DHS may not be effectively positioned to manage its EEO program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its July 2019 report, GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including develop performance metrics for the department's EEO program; develop DHS and component formal staffing models; and analyze options for granting additional authorities to the most senior official for EEO and Diversity.

Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission\u2019s (EEOC) Management Directive 715 (MD-715)  requires that, to attract and retain top talent, federal agencies are to  identify EEO barriers in their workforces and deficiencies in their EEO  programs, execute plans to address them, and report annually to EEOC.", "In 2009, we reported that DHS had opportunities to better identify and  address barriers to EEO in its workforce. Specifically, we found that DHS  was not regularly including employee input in identifying potential barriers.  We also found that it had not yet met most of its target completion dates  for planned activities to address barriers. We recommended that DHS (1)  develop a strategy to regularly include employee input in identifying  potential barriers to EEO, and (2) establish interim milestones for  completing planned activities to address identified barriers. By 2013, DHS  had responded to our recommendations by including a strategy to  regularly use employee input to identify barriers, and by identifying  essential activities and establishing interim milestones to address barriers  identified in its MD-715 reports.", "This testimony is based primarily on our report that we recently issued  entitled, Equal Employment Opportunity: DHS Could Better Address  Challenges to Ensuring EEO in Its Workforce.

In  addition to analyzing workforce data, in each of the fiscal years 2014  through 2017, DHS utilized the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\u2019s  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey and DHS\u2019s employee exit survey  results to help identify and address barriers.", "To further help identify barriers, EEOC guidance states that agencies  must solicit input from agency employee and advocacy groups, and union  officials. During our small group discussions, DHS employee groups told  us that through the MD-715 report development process, they helped  identify and address triggers and barriers. For example, Special  Emphasis Program Managers we spoke with told us that DHS  components conduct climate surveys to obtain input from employees on  workforce practices every 1 or 2 years. Further, several DHS  components\u2019 MD-715 reports referenced soliciting employee input, such  as obtaining Disability Employment Program Managers\u2019 input via  quarterly disability employment advisory council meetings where they  share best practices and discuss issues and topics including barriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Reports Some Improvements in Employee Engagement and Representation of Minorities and Women, but Lacks Performance Metrics for Tracking Progress", "paragraphs": ["DHS reports some improvements in employee engagement and  representation of minorities and women.

EEOC guidance states that having department-wide applicant flow data  could aid in analyzing differences in selection rates among different  groups for a particular job. In July 2017, EEOC informed DHS that the  agency\u2019s applicant flow data were incomplete, which makes it difficult to  pinpoint barriers. DHS has reported challenges in collecting department- wide data because the department does not have a consolidated  applicant flow data system. According to DHS, four of its components use  one system (USA Staffing), while five other components use a different  system (Monster Government Solutions).", "CRCL officials told us that DHS is developing a new system to integrate  applicant flow data department-wide. However, the officials could not give  us a time frame for when the system is expected to be completed. In its  fiscal year 2018 MD-715 report, DHS reported that it continues to work  towards developing a central repository for all applicant flow data. As a  work-around, DHS officials said that it obtains these data directly from  each component that uses Monster Government Solutions. In its fiscal  year 2018 MD-715 report, DHS reported that it used applicant flow data to  complete analyses, but it also reported a number of limitations, including  that data were not available.
