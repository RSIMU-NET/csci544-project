State/INL and USAID allocated this funding under the following government-wide foreign assistance funding categories: Civil Society, Counternarcotics, Good Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights, and Transnational Crime. U.S. agencies use these categories to broadly define foreign assistance programs for planning, budgeting, and reporting across agencies, countries, and regions. Over 80 percent of the funding went toward Rule of Law and Human Rights, and Counternarcotics efforts. Of the $723 million, State/INL allocated about $542 million and USAID allocated about $182 million.", "There were 445 State/INL and USAID M\u00e9rida Initiative projects active from fiscal year 2014 through 2018. State/INL funded 388 of the projects and USAID funded 57, which tended to be larger with higher funding amounts than State/INL projects. State/INL projects generally focused on providing training and assistance to Mexican officials from the justice sector, border security, military, and law enforcement, as well as equipment, including for forensic drug laboratories, drug detection, and border surveillance. Many USAID projects were intended to engage with Mexican civil society organizations and the public to address corruption, promote trust in government, or prevent crime and violence, such as through skill-building for youth, efforts to advance human rights, or technical support for judicial system development.

To describe the number and  type of M\u00e9rida Initiative projects active during this period, we analyzed  detailed project-level data provided to us by State/INL and USAID,  including implementers, project descriptions, time frames, and obligated  or estimated funding amounts. Some projects that were active from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018 started before this time frame and  some projects ended after this time frame. We assessed the reliability of  the funding and project data by checking for missing data and obvious  errors, and by interviewing State and USAID officials about how the data  were compiled. When we found potential errors or duplicate data, we  contacted relevant agency officials, and obtained additional information to  resolve these data issues.
