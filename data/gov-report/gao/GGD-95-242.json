Specifically, our objectives were to (1) assess the extent to which Commerce\u2019s second and third reports\u2014issued in 1993 and 1995\u2014fulfilled the requirements of the 1990 act and addressed the recommendations in our 1992 report; (2) review the process by which federal agencies collect FDI data; (3) review the status and processes of the data exchanges, or links, initiated by the 1990 act between the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and its Bureau of the Census and between BEA and the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS); and (4) evaluate the extent to which implementation of the act has brought about the intended improvements in public information on FDI in the United States.", "Commerce has issued three FDIUS reports\u2014in August 1991, June 1993, and January 1995. Commerce has approached each of the three FDIUS reports differently, in response to changing public concerns about FDIUS and limited staff and budget resources, according to Commerce officials. Together, the 1993 and 1995 reports included discussion of all the data requirements of the 1990 act for which data exists, and responded to the recommendations in our 1992 report. In addition, based on factors such as organizational structure of the reports and individual chapters, sufficiency of evidence for principal findings, coverage of specific industry sectors, coverage of countries with the largest shares of direct investment in the United States, and use of relevant outside economic studies, we found that the two reports adequately present the Commerce Department\u2019s analysis and findings.", "Overall, the Commerce reports\u2019 analyses and conclusions relating to the effects of FDIUS on the U.S. economy were thorough and reasonable. There were a few exceptions where Commerce\u2019s conclusions were more definitive than warranted by the evidence. For example, in some cases, Commerce characterized FDI as having a \u201cpositive impact\u201d on the U.S. economy without providing sufficient support for this statement. (See app. I for a more detailed discussion of factors that, in our view, limited some aspects of Commerce\u2019s analysis of the possible effects of FDIUS on the U.S. economy.)", "The Commerce Department is the principal source of U.S. government data on FDIUS. Commerce\u2019s BEA obtains information on FDIUS through four survey questionnaires that require U.S. affiliates of foreign firms to report on a wide range of financial and operating data. (See app. II for a discussion of BEA surveys.) To ensure compliance with FDIUS survey reporting requirements, BEA has strengthened survey procedures and increased the number of staff devoted to survey follow-up.", "The BEA-Census and the BEA-BLS data-sharing efforts, initiated by the 1990 act, have generated data on U.S. affiliates of foreign firms at a greater level of industry specificity than was previously available. The data have enabled Commerce to provide a richer description of U.S. affiliates\u2019 activities and to draw more meaningful comparisons between their operations and those of other U.S. firms without imposing any additional burdens on survey respondents. However, certain restrictions and other factors related to the protection of business-confidential data continue to limit more extensive data sharing among U.S. government agencies. (See app. III for a more detailed discussion of the BEA, Census, and BLS data-sharing projects.)", "The Commerce Department\u2019s FDIUS reports and the data-sharing activities between BEA, Census, and BLS have largely fulfilled the purpose of the 1990 act by improving the quality and quantity of federal government data on FDIUS.

This act required the Secretary of Commerce to submit an annual report addressing the history, scope, trends, and market concentrations of FDIUS, as well as its effects on the U.S. economy. In addition, the act provided for an exchange of business-confidential data between the Bureau of the Census and BEA and authorized BLS to have access to selected business-confidential BEA data. The purpose of this data sharing, as specified by the 1990 act, is to improve the quality of U.S. government data on FDIUS and to enhance analysts\u2019 ability to assess the impact of that investment on the U.S. economy. BLS gives BEA access to publicly available macro-level, or aggregated, data on foreign-owned establishments generated from the BEA-BLS data link project.", "BEA data on foreign investment are collected on a consolidated firm or \u201centerprise\u201d basis and reported under the industry category of the firm\u2019s primary business and then linked with \u201cestablishment\u201d or plant-level data collected by Census and by BLS. Since Census and BLS data are collected on an \u201cestablishment basis\u201d\u2014i.e., from individual commercial plants\u2014the data are more likely to correlate to specific industry sectors. However, Census and BLS data do not identify foreign ownership. Linking BEA\u2019s enterprise data with Census\u2019 and BLS\u2019 establishment data enables Commerce to report on the operations of U.S. affiliates of foreign firms in over 800 individual industries at the establishment level, as opposed to only 135 industries at the enterprise level. The establishment industry categories are disaggregated according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. See figure 1 for an illustration of how one industry category within the manufacturing sector is disaggregated at the 2-, 3-, and 4-digit SIC levels.", "In addition to its three reports, Commerce published data from the first phase of the BEA-Census data exchange effort in June 1992. Commerce also published data from the BEA-Census data exchange effort in 1993, and again in 1994.

We relied on internal economists as well as an outside economist with expertise in FDIUS issues to carry out this evaluation. We also considered such factors as organizational structure, sufficiency of evidence for principal findings, coverage of the data requirements of the 1990 act, coverage of specific industry sectors, coverage of major investing countries, and use of relevant outside studies.

In an effort to address changing public concerns about FDIUS and conserve agency resources, Commerce took a different approach to each of its three reports, according to Commerce officials. The reports included discussion of all the data requirements in the act for which data existed, such as comparing U.S. affiliates of foreign firms\u2019 operations to those of other U.S. companies with respect to employment, exports and imports, and research and development (R&D) spending.

Commerce officials said these differences reflected the changing nature of public concerns about FDIUS and resource considerations within the agency. The August 1991 report highlighted the growth and characteristics of FDIUS in five industry sectors, including electronics, automotives (including automobile parts and components), steel, chemicals, and banking. It provided a description of the initial BEA-Census data link effort, which was not yet complete at the time of the report\u2019s publication.", "In our 1992 review of Commerce\u2019s 1991 FDIUS report, we recommended that Commerce\u2019s subsequent FDIUS reports (1) provide an analysis that clearly distinguishes between costs and benefits derived from FDI and those derived from all foreign investment in the United States, (2) make greater use of available government studies and private sector data, and (3) provide more focused analyses of publicly debated questions regarding the effects of FDI in the U.S. economy. We subsequently determined that Commerce had adequately addressed our recommendations in its June 1993 report.", "Commerce\u2019s June 1993 FDIUS report was organized by general issues of public policy concern rather than by industry sector. The report contained analyses of the implications of FDIUS for U.S. merchandise trade patterns, technology development and transfer, and corporate tax payment. It also presented a more detailed description of the operations of foreign-owned firms in the United States, as well as the results of the first phase of the data link project, based on data obtained through 1987 BEA and Census surveys. Further, the report included an extensive literature survey on the economic issues relating to FDIUS, such as technology transfer, exports and imports, and employment effects.", "The January 1995 report also highlighted general FDIUS issues of public policy concern rather than specific industry sectors. It included new data obtained through the BEA-BLS data link on occupational employment patterns in foreign-owned manufacturing establishments, and further analysis of the role of U.S. affiliates in U.S. merchandise trade. Commerce also reported the results of the comprehensive 1992 BEA benchmark survey of FDIUS and of ongoing BEA-Census and BEA-BLS data link projects. The primary factor that distinguished it from the 1993 report was that, with the exception of the introduction and chapter 6, all of the chapters of the 1995 report were reproductions of articles previously published in BEA\u2019s monthly Survey of Current Business or contained data previously released in BLS publications.

It also compared the operations of U.S. affiliates of foreign firms with those of other business enterprises in the United States with respect to employment, value added, productivity, R&D spending, exports and imports, profitability, taxes paid, and market share.", "The market share information was limited by Commerce\u2019s data aggregation and confidentiality requirements. To the extent possible with existing data, Commerce reported on U.S. affiliates of foreign firms\u2019 market concentration in various U.S. industries. Commerce relied primarily on sales data to estimate U.S. affiliates\u2019 market share, but also examined U.S. affiliates\u2019 share of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and employment. However, if Congress is concerned about the amount of foreign control exercised in specific product sectors, market sales data at a less aggregated level would be needed. According to Commerce officials, presenting more detailed sector data in these reports would likely compromise the confidentiality requirements of data collection agencies (see discussion in app. III).", "The one item called for in the law (section 3(c)(1)) but not addressed in the reports was information about investment incentives and services provided by state and local governments, including quasi-government entities. According to a BEA official, BEA attempts to collect this type of data through its survey of U.S. business enterprises newly acquired or established by foreign investors. However, a BEA official said that in many cases the data BEA receives are not complete. Therefore, the reliability of these data is questionable, and they are not published in Commerce\u2019s FDIUS reports.

The conclusion in chapter 8 of Commerce\u2019s 1995 report, with regard to the occupational employment patterns of foreign-owned manufacturing establishments, illustrates this problem. In the conclusion, the report stated that \u201con balance, foreign investment in high skill industries has a positive impact on the U.S. manufacturing labor market.\u201d However, the statistical data presented showed that foreign and U.S.-owned firms were actually similar in the occupational distribution of their employees. A similar problem appears in Commerce\u2019s discussion of technology transfer issues in chapter 6 of the 1993 report (see app. I).", "To reach a more definitive conclusion on the \u201cpositive impact\u201d of FDIUS, the analysis would require a comparison of the observed scenario to the scenario that would have occurred in the absence of FDI, sometimes called the \u2019counterfactual\u2019 scenario. While it is not possible to state with absolute certainty what would have happened (the counterfactual), this approach often highlights important assumptions about the cause and effect relationships between various factors.

Data at the 4-digit SIC level are sufficiently detailed to address some issues, such as the role of U.S. affiliates of foreign firms in U.S. employment and GDP, but other issues related to market control and technology transfer could be more effectively addressed using more narrowly defined industry categories.", "Nevertheless, because some FDIUS questions are so complex, definitive conclusions would be hard to draw even if less aggregated data were available. For example, it would be difficult to determine empirically whether foreign firms invest in the United States with the intent of acquiring U.S. technology. A fuller understanding of the technology strategies employed by foreign investors in the United States would require continued research and debate.

In addition, the Census Bureau within Commerce collects detailed information on the operations of nearly all U.S. businesses, both foreign and domestically owned. However, Census does not have systems established specifically to track FDIUS.", "Many other federal government entities collect data on foreign investment incidental to their overall missions.

To facilitate survey responses, the ISI system combines certain SIC industry categories based on typical company structures of U.S. affiliates.

By the end of November 1989\u20146 months after the May 31 reporting deadline\u2014BEA had received 68 percent of the large company reports in the 1988 annual survey, compared with 84 percent received by the same time in the 1987 survey and 92 percent in the 1986 survey. BEA officials told us that one of the factors that may have contributed to this decline in compliance was the rapid (39 percent) growth in the numbers of qualified large companies to which BEA sent surveys between the survey covering 1986 and the survey covering 1988.They said that BEA\u2019s survey follow-up procedures and staff resources at the time were not sufficient to manage the growing volume of potential reporters.", "Beginning with the annual survey covering the year 1989, BEA\u2019s International Investment Division (IID), together with Commerce\u2019s Office of the General Counsel (OGC), undertook a concerted effort to tighten procedures and ensure U.S. affiliates\u2019 compliance with the 1989 survey and subsequent surveys. For example, \u201crepeat offenders\u201d (those large companies that were late in reporting in both the 1988 survey and the 1989 survey) were sent a letter from Commerce\u2019s OGC in place of IID\u2019s standard follow-up letter. In addition, IID and OGC accelerated their telephone follow-up for late reporters. Further, Commerce carried out standard compliance procedures earlier in the processing cycle compared with previous years. A BEA official also told us that in fiscal year 1991 Congress appropriated increased funding to BEA for survey compliance efforts. As a result, BEA now has three full-time staff devoted primarily to FDIUS survey follow-up efforts. This official explained that, prior to the 1991 funding increase, each survey editor was expected to conduct his own follow-up work.", "In early 1990, BEA developed indicators to measure one key element of compliance\u2014the timeliness of reporting by large company respondents. The indicators show (1) the cumulative number of reports received by BEA, on a monthly basis, over the 11-month period following the annual survey mailing in March, and (2) the cumulative dollar value of the assets associated with those reporting companies, for the same period. Since BEA began implementing steps to address the reduced compliance with the 1987 and 1988 surveys, the timeliness of reporting on subsequent surveys has returned to acceptable levels, according to BEA officials. For example, the percentage of reports received within 6 months of the May 31 reporting deadline increased from 68 percent for the 1988 survey, to 92 percent for the 1989 survey (for which BEA first tightened its compliance procedures), and to 96 percent for the 1993 survey; while the cumulative value of the assets associated with those reporting companies increased from 69 percent for the 1988 survey, to 92 percent for the 1989 survey, and to 98 percent for the 1993 survey. Based on these data, BEA officials believe that their efforts to maintain high compliance rates have had a positive, measurable impact on the timeliness of reporting by large companies.", "BEA has established other systems to improve its surveys and data management processes, a BEA official told us. BEA has a continuous process to improve the quality of its survey forms, which includes proposing changes to the forms, soliciting feedback from survey users and respondents through a series of meetings and discussions, publishing a request for public comment on proposals, and finally, submitting proposals to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for formal review and clearance. This official said that BEA has also instituted an office-wide \u201cbest practices\u201d initiative to ensure the accuracy of the data it produces and tabulates.

Of this amount, an average of $300,000 per year was paid by BEA to Census, to reimburse Census for its costs associated with the project. The average annual budget for BLS to perform the BEA-BLS data link project was slightly less than $600,000 between 1991 and 1995.

While it is not possible to state with any certainty what would have happened in the absence of FDI, the counterfactual approach can highlight important assumptions about the cause and effect relationships between various economic factors.", "One example of where a counterfactual scenario would have been useful is in chapter 8 of Commerce\u2019s 1995 report, which addresses the occupational employment patterns of foreign-owned manufacturing establishments. In the conclusion of this chapter, the author stated that \u201con balance, foreign investment in high skill industries has a positive impact on the U.S. manufacturing labor market.\u201d However, the statistical data presented showed that foreign and U.S.-owned firms were actually similar in the occupational distribution of their employees. Without knowledge of U.S. labor market conditions in the absence of FDI, one cannot draw definitive conclusions about the positive impact of FDI on the U.S. labor market.", "An example of how this discussion of counterfactual scenarios can be used effectively appeared in chapter 6 of the 1995 report. The author pointed out that the trade deficits of U.S. affiliates of foreign firms amounted to more than half of the total amount of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in recent years, and that most of the U.S. affiliates\u2019 deficit was accounted for by wholesale trade affiliates rather than manufacturing affiliates. The author concluded that the overall \u201ceffect\u201d of those wholesale trade affiliates on trade flows was unclear: on the one hand, many of their imports probably would have been brought into the country by unaffiliated U.S. wholesalers, even in the absence of U.S. affiliates; on the other hand, U.S. affiliates may have allowed foreign parent companies to expand their exports to the United States.

Sometimes foreign firms locate in the United States simply to monitor the technology developments of other firms in this country. Even if R&D funds are dedicated to technology development, there is no guarantee that such spending will ultimately benefit the U.S. economy.", "In one instance in the 1993 report, the authors made two statements that seemed to be contradictory. On one hand, Commerce presented evidence to suggest that some foreign firms have used their affiliates to gain U.S.-developed \u201ccritical technologies\u201d and to displace U.S. firms. Commerce\u2019s evidence was based on several case studies of certain high-technology industries conducted by experts within and outside the Commerce Department. On the other hand, Commerce concluded from its own systematic data analysis that there was little evidence that foreign acquisitions of small, U.S. high-technology firms had resulted in large scale technology transfer abroad. Rather, Commerce said that the data suggest U.S. affiliates of foreign firms were contributing positively to U.S. R&D investment and technological development, and that the R&D spending patterns of U.S. affiliates were similar to those of domestic firms. In our view, the evidence Commerce cited to support its broad statement that U.S. affiliates have contributed to U.S. technological development was not sufficiently strong to support the overall conclusion, because Commerce\u2019s analysis did not include discussion of possible counterfactual scenarios.", "Due to the complexity of the technology issues and the limitations of the SIC data classification system, some questions cannot be conclusively answered at this time. For example, Commerce\u2019s effort to evaluate FDI\u2019s presence in sectors that engaged substantially in the development of critical technologies was hampered by the aggregated level of available data. To describe the activities of companies involved in the production of critical technologies, the data would have to be significantly disaggregated\u2014beyond the 3- or 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code levels.", "Neither the 4-digit SIC level nor the \u201cDOC-3\u201d data developed by Commerce is sufficiently detailed by industry to address questions about the activities of U.S. affiliates of foreign firms in U.S. critical technology sectors. Commerce used a modified version of the DOC-3 definition in its analysis. Based roughly on 3-digit SIC codes, this definition includes only broad industry groups such as \u201cindustrial chemicals and synthetics,\u201d \u201ccomputers and office machines,\u201d \u201celectronic components,\u201d \u201cinstruments and related products,\u201d and \u201cother transportation equipment.\u201d Some of the products included in the definition are actually low-technology products.
