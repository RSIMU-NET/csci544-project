Depending on their immigration status,  noncitizens may be eligible for one of three types of Social Security cards:  regular cards, those cards valid for work only with authorization from the  DHS, and nonwork SSN cards.  1.  Regular Social Security card: The first and most common type of  card is for individuals who are eligible to work. Individuals issued  these SSNs receive a Social Security card showing their name and SSN  without marked restriction. To be eligible for this card an individual  must be one of the following    U.S. citizen (whether foreign-born or not),   noncitizen lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence  (an immigrant),    noncitizen with permission from the DHS to work permanently in    member of a group eligible to work in the U.S. on a temporary basis  (e.g., with a work visa, certain authorized workers in an approved  exchange program).  2.  DHS-authorized work card: A much less common type of Social  Security card is issued to noncitizens who are eligible to work under  limited circumstances. They receive a card showing the inscription  \u201cVALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION.\u201d To be  eligible for these cards noncitizens must have DHS permission to work  temporarily in the U.S. SSA issues these cards to eligible workers, such  as certain foreign students and spouses and children of exchange  visitors.  3.  Nonwork card: The third type of card is for people not eligible to  work in the U.S. SSA sends recipients of these SSNs a card showing  their name, SSN, and the inscription \u201cNOT VALID FOR  EMPLOYMENT.\u201d To be issued these cards, noncitizens who are legally  in the U.S. and do not have DHS permission to work must have been  found eligible to receive a federally-funded benefit or are subject to a  state or local law that requires them to have an SSN to get public  benefits. Examples include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families,  Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Survivor benefits,  Medicaid, and Food Stamps.

We found that SSA has over the  years improved document verifications and developed new initiatives to  prevent the inappropriate assignment of SSNs to noncitizens. For example,  SSA requires third-party verification of all noncitizen documents, such as a  birth certificate, with DHS and the State Department before issuing an  SSN. SSA also requires field staff to visually inspect documents before  issuing an SSN. However, many field staff we interviewed at that time  were relying heavily on DHS\u2019s verification and neglecting SSA\u2019s standard  inspection practices, even though both were required. We found that SSA\u2019s  automated system for assigning SSNs was not designed to prevent issuing  SSNs if field staff bypass required verification steps. We also found that  SSA has undertaken new initiatives to shift the burden of processing  noncitizen SSN applications and verifying documents away from its field  offices. In late 2002, SSA began phasing in a new process for issuing SSNs  to noncitizens, called \u201cEnumeration at Entry\u201d (EAE). Through this  initiative, immigrants 18 and older can visit a State Department post  abroad to apply for an SSN at the same time they apply for a visa to come  to the U.S. The State Department and DHS authenticate the documents  and transmit them to SSA, which then issues the SSN. Also, SSA was  planning to expand the program over time to include other noncitizen  groups, such as students and exchange visitors. In addition, SSA  established a specialized center in Brooklyn, New York, which focuses  exclusively on enumeration and utilizes the expertise of DHS immigration  status verifiers and investigators from SSA\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General. More recently, SSA established a similar center in Las Vegas,  Nevada.", "At the time we did our field work for the 2003 report, SSA had not  tightened controls in two key areas of its enumeration process that could  be exploited by individuals seeking fraudulent SSNs: the assignment of  SSNs to children under age 1 and the replacement of Social Security cards.  SSA requires third-party verification of the birth records for U.S.-born  children age 1 and over, but calls only for a visual inspection of birth  documents for children under age 1. In our field work, we found that this  remains an area vulnerable to fraud. Working undercover and posing as  parents of newborns, our investigators were able to obtain two SSNs using  counterfeit documents. Since then the IRTPA was enacted and requires  SSA to independently verify any birth documents other than for purposes  of enumeration at birth.", "Until the passage of the IRTPA, SSA\u2019s policy allowed individuals to obtain  up to 52 replacement cards per year, leaving it vulnerable to misuse. While  SSA requires noncitizens applying for a replacement SSN card to provide  the same identity and immigration documents as if they were applying for  an original SSN, SSA\u2019s requirements for citizens were much less stringent.  Individuals could obtain numerous replacement SSN cards with relatively  weak or counterfeit documentation for a wide range of illicit uses,  including selling them to noncitizens.", "Our 2003 report contained six recommendations to SSA. As shown in table  1 below, SSA has implemented all, except one concerning enhancement of  its Modernized Enumeration System to prevent issuance of SSNs without  use of required verification procedures. In the interim, however, SSA now  requires staff to use a software tool that documents verification  procedures. Although SSA has implemented our recommendation  concerning an evaluation of the Enumeration at Entry program, the results  of the evaluations prompted the SSA\u2019s Office of Inspector General and  Office of Quality Assurance and Performance Assessment to recommend  several additional measures to correct errors during the early  implementation of the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New Procedures for Awarding Benefits to Non-Citizens Protect Against Abuse and Improve Coordination with Other Countries", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether noncitizens are eligible for SSA benefits, SSA has  implemented new procedures including some required by the SSPA.

Our recent reports on totalization agreements  identified two fundamental vulnerabilities in SSA\u2019s existing procedures  when entering into totalization agreements. First, our analysis  demonstrated that the agency\u2019s actuarial estimates for the number of  foreign citizens who would be affected by an agreement (and thus entitled  to U.S. Social Security benefits) have overstated or understated the  number, usually by more than 25 percent. As a result, depending on the  size of the foreign population covered by an agreement, the actual cost to  the Social Security trust fund from a given agreement could be greater or  smaller than predicted. In response to our recommendation to improve its  process for projecting costs to the trust fund from totalization agreements,  SSA responded that it cannot eliminate all variations between projected  costs and subsequent actual experience.", "Secondly, our work has shown that SSA\u2019s processes for entering into these  agreements have been largely informal and have not included specific  steps to assess and mitigate potential risks to the U.S. Social Security  system. For example, we found that SSA\u2019s procedures for verifying critical  information such as foreign citizens\u2019 earnings, birth, and death data were  insufficient to ensure the integrity of such information. Inaccurate or  incomplete information could lead to improper payments from the Social  Security trust fund. In response to our recommendations, SSA developed  several new initiatives to identify risks associated with totalization  agreements. For example, SSA developed a standardized questionnaire to  help the agency identify and assess the reliability of earnings data in  countries that may be considered for future totalization agreements. In  addition, SSA is conducting numerous \u201cvulnerability assessments\u201d to  detect potential problems with the accuracy of foreign countries\u2019  documents.

In  addition, a more systematic approach to verifying data from other  countries with which we have totalization agreements can help ensure  proper payments of benefits and prompt notice of the death of  beneficiaries. SSA will, however, continue to face challenges in its dealings  with noncitizens. Changes in immigration laws and shortcomings in the  enforcement of those laws make it difficult for SSA to identify noncitizens  who are eligible for SSNs and for benefit payments.
