The current estimated investment is $382 billion to develop and procure 2,457 aircraft. This report, prepared in response to a congressional mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, discusses (1) program cost and schedule changes and their implications on affordability; (2) progress made during 2010; (3) design and manufacturing maturity; and (4) test plans and progress.

Restructuring has consequences--higher up-front development costs, fewer aircraft in the near term, training delays, and extended times for testing and delivering capabilities to warfighters. Total development funding is now $56.4 billion to complete in 2018, a 26 percent increase in cost and a 5-year slip in schedule compared to the current baseline. DOD also reduced procurement quantities by 246 aircraft through 2016, but has not calculated the net effects of restructuring on total procurement costs nor approved a new baseline. Affordability for the U.S. and partners is challenged by a near doubling in average unit prices since program start and higher estimated life-cycle costs. Going forward, the JSF requires unprecedented funding levels in a period of more austere defense budgets. The program had mixed success in 2010, achieving 6 of 12 major goals it established and making varying degrees of progress on the others. Successes included the first flight of the carrier variant, award of a fixed-price aircraft procurement contract, and an accelerated pace in development flight tests that accomplished three times as many flights in 2010 as the previous 3 years combined. However, the program did not deliver as many aircraft to test and training sites as planned and made only a partial release of software capabilities. The short take off and landing variant (STOVL) experienced significant technical problems and did not meet flight test expectations. The Secretary of Defense directed a 2-year period to evaluate and engineer STOVL solutions. After more than 9 years in development and 4 in production, the JSF program has not fully demonstrated that the aircraft design is stable, manufacturing processes are mature, and the system is reliable. Engineering drawings are still being released to the manufacturing floor and design changes continue at higher rates than desired. More changes are expected as testing accelerates. Test and production aircraft cost more and are taking longer to deliver than expected. Manufacturers are improving operations and implemented 8 of 20 recommendations from an expert panel, but have not yet demonstrated a capacity to efficiently produce at higher production rates. Substantial improvements in factory throughput and the global supply chain are needed. Development testing is still early in demonstrating that aircraft will work as intended and meet warfighter requirements. Only about 4 percent of JSF capabilities have been completely verified by flight tests, lab results, or both. Only 3 of the extensive network of 32 ground test labs and simulation models are fully accredited to ensure the fidelity of results. Software development--essential for achieving about 80 percent of the JSF functionality--is significantly behind schedule as it enters its most challenging phase."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To sustain a focus on accountability and facilitate tradeoffs within the JSF program, GAO recommends that DOD (1) maintain annual funding levels at current budgeted amounts; (2) establish criteria for evaluating the STOVL's progress and make independent reviews, allowing each variant to proceed at its own pace; and (3) conduct an independent review of the software development and lab accreditation processes.

The JSF is the core of DOD\u2019s long term tactical aircraft  recapitalization plans as it is intended to replace hundreds of legacy  aircraft. Total U.S. planned investment in the JSF is about $385 billion to  develop and acquire 2,457 aircraft through 2035. With that many dollars at  stake amidst pressing warfighter requirements for this new 5th generation  capability, the Department has lately recognized numerous technical,  financial, and management shortcomings and continues to significantly  restructure the program, adding more time and money and making other  changes that we support.", "GAO has reported on JSF issues for a number of years. Appendix 2  summarizes key findings and recommendations from that body of work.  One recurring theme has been the \u201csingle step,\u201d or revolutionary,  acquisition strategy the JSF program adopted to develop and acquire full  combat capabilities on a very aggressive, risky schedule with substantial  concurrency, or overlap among development, testing, and production  activities. That strategy, coupled with a management environment that  was slow to acknowledge and address problems with needed changes, are  prime contributors to the relatively poor cost, schedule, and performance  outcomes experienced to date. Our March 2010 report discussed  additional cost and schedule pressures, unsatisfactory performance in  manufacturing and delivering aircraft, and concerns about not meeting  warfighter requirements on time and in quantity. We recommended that  (1) DOD complete an independent, comprehensive cost and schedule  estimate and establish it as the official program of record for planning,  budgeting, and congressional reporting purposes and (2) reassess  warfighter requirements to determine the minimum needs (both  capabilities and capacity) that can be achieved within realistic and  reasonable timeframes and, if necessary, defer some capabilities to future  increments. In addition, we suggested that Congress consider requiring  DOD to establish a \u201csystem maturity matrix,\u201d a management tool to better  measure the program\u2019s annual progress toward key objectives to improve  oversight and better inform future budget decisions.", "This is our second report required by law in which we (1) evaluate  program cost and schedule changes and their implications on affordability;  (2) identify progress made in 2010 against established goals; (3) assess  elements of design stability and manufacturing maturity and review  production results; and (4) report status of development testing and  technical challenges facing the program.  To conduct this work, we  evaluated DOD\u2019s restructuring actions and impacts on the program,  tracked cost and schedule changes, and determined factors driving the  changes. We reviewed program status reports, manufacturing data, test  plans, and internal DOD analyses.  We discussed results to date and future  plans to complete JSF development and move further into procurement  with DOD, JSF, and contractor officials including members of the  independent review teams. We toured aircraft and engine manufacturing  plants, obtained production and supply performance indicators, and  discussed improvements underway with contractors.  We conducted this  performance audit from May 2010 to March 2011 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The F-35 program is a joint, multinational acquisition to develop and field  an affordable, highly common family of stealthy, next-generation strike  fighter aircraft for the United States Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, and  eight international partners. The JSF is a single-seat, single-engine aircraft  incorporating low-observable (stealth) technologies, defensive avionics,  advanced sensor fusion, internal and external weapons, and advanced  prognostic maintenance capability. There are three variants. The F-35A  conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant will provide air-to-ground  attack capabilities to replace the Air Force\u2019s F-16 Fighting Falcon and the  A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft, and will complement the F-22A Raptor. The   F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft will be a multi- role strike fighter to replace the Marine Corps\u2019 F/A-18C/D Hornet and AV- 8B Harrier aircraft. The F-35C carrier-suitable variant (CV) will provide the  Navy and Marine Corps a multi-role, stealthy strike aircraft to complement  the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The JSF is DOD\u2019s largest cooperative  program. Our international partners are providing about $5.1 billion  toward development, and foreign firms are part of the industrial base  producing aircraft. DOD\u2019s funding requirements for the JSF assume  economic benefits from partner purchases in reducing unit costs for U.S.  aircraft.", "JSF concept development began in November 1996 with a 5-year  competition between contractors to determine the most capable and  affordable preliminary aircraft design. Lockheed Martin won the  competition and the JSF program entered system development and  demonstration in October 2001. Pratt and Whitney is the primary engine  manufacturer, while General Electric has been developing a potential  second source for the engine. System integration efforts and a preliminary  design review then revealed significant airframe weight problems  impacting key performance requirements. In March 2004, DOD rebaselined  the program, adding time and money for development and delaying key  milestones. The Navy and Marine Corps also reduced their planned  procurement by 409 jets, reducing the total U.S. buy to the current 2,457  quantity. The program was again rebaselined in March 2007 to reflect  additional cost increases and schedule slips and the procurement period  was extended by 7 years to 2034 with reduction in annual quantities.", "Because of continuing problems and poor outcomes, the Secretary of  Defense announced another comprehensive restructuring of the JSF  program in February 2010.  The restructuring followed an extensive  Department-wide review initiated in 2009 and considered the findings and  recommendations from three independent groups chartered to assess the  program: the Joint Estimating Team (JET) evaluated program execution  and resource requirements; the Independent Manufacturing Review Team  (IMRT) assessed contractor capabilities and plans for ramping-up and  sustaining production at maximum rates; and the Joint Assessment Team  (JAT) reviewed engine costs and affordability initiatives.  Key  restructuring actions included adding $2.8 billion for development,  extending flight testing by 13 months, adding flight test resources (one  new test jet and use of 3 production jets), reduced near-term procurement  by 122 aircraft, and review of the military services\u2019 capability need dates.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  stated that the department-wide review would continue under new  program management and cited 2010 as a critical year for assessing  progress against the new plans and the expected delivery of all test  aircraft, completion of hundreds of test flights, and meeting other key  milestones.  We supported these actions in our March 2010 report and  subsequent testimonies.  We noted the likelihood of additional cost  growth and schedule extensions as the restructuring continues.", "In March 2010, the Department declared that the program experienced a  breach of the critical cost growth statutory thresholds.  The Department  subsequently certified to Congress in June 2010 that the JSF program  should continue. Table 1 summarizes the evolution of JSF cost and  schedule estimates at key junctures in its acquisition history through the  current Nunn-McCurdy certification.  Since then, in January 2011, the  Secretary of Defense announced additional development cost increases  and further changes consequent to the ongoing restructure, but has not yet  established a new approved acquisition program baseline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Affordability Expectations Are Challenged as JSF Acquisition Costs Rise and Schedules Slip", "paragraphs": ["Ongoing JSF restructuring continues to add more cost and time for  developing, testing, and delivering aircraft to the warfighter.

Affordability for the  U.S. and our allies is challenged because unit prices are about double what  they were at program start and with new forecasts that the aircraft may  cost substantially more to operate and maintain over the life cycle than the  legacy aircraft they replace.

In January 2011, the Secretary of Defense  directed additional changes, stemming in large part from the results of a  comprehensive technical baseline review under new government and  contractor management.  Key program changes (1) added $4.6 billion to  the development program through completion for a total development  program estimate of $56.4 billion (an increase of 26 percent against the  current baseline and 64 percent from the original baseline at program  start); (2) extended the development test period to 2016 (a 4-year slip from  the current baseline); and (3) reduced near-term procurement quantities  by 124 aircraft in addition to the 122 aircraft cut announced in February  2010; and (4) lowered the annual  rate of increase for boosting future  production.", "Because of the lingering technical issues on the STOVL, the most complex  variant, the Secretary decoupled STOVL flight tests from the combined  test plan and scaled back STOVL production to only 3 in fiscal year 2011  and to 6 per year for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This represents a total cut  of 37 STOVL aircraft during this 3-year period compared to the fiscal year  2011 budget plans. In announcing these changes, the Secretary also noted  the STOVL\u2019s significant testing problems which include lift fan engine  deficiencies, and poor durability test results, which could require  redesigns and add weight to aircraft\u2019s structure and propulsion system.  While the Secretary decoupled STOVL from the flight test program, STOVL  was not further separated from the rest of the JSF program for  management and reporting activities.  It remains a part of the combined  JSF program for milestone decisions and cost, schedule, and performance  reporting.  Resolving STOVL problems and moving forward at an  affordable cost is essential to the Marine Corps\u2019 future plans, which  depend upon acquiring the STOVL in quantity to directly accompany,  protect, and provide firepower to its ground expeditionary forces.", "The recently submitted fiscal year 2012 Defense Budget reflects the  financial impacts from restructuring actions through 2016. Compared to  estimates in the fiscal year 2010 future years defense program for the same  5-year period, the Department increased development funding by   $7.7 billion and decreased procurement funding by $8.4 billion reflecting  plans to buy fewer aircraft.  Table 2 summarizes the revised development  and procurement funding requirements and annual quantities following  the Secretary\u2019s reductions. Even after decreasing near-term quantities and  lowering the ramp rate, JSF procurement still rapidly increases.  Annual  funding levels more than double and quantities more than triple during this  period. These numbers do not include the additional orders expected from  the international partners.", "Additional changes to cost and schedule are likely as restructuring  continues. At the time of this report, the Secretary had not yet granted new  milestone B approval nor approved a new acquisition program baseline.  Originally planned for November 2010, program officials now expect the  new acquisition program baseline in late 2011. Also, cost analysts are still  revising procurement funding requirements for the period fiscal year 2017  through completion of procurement in 2035. Accordingly, the net effect of  reducing near-term procurement quantities and deferring these aircraft to  future years is uncertain and depends upon the assumptions made about  future unit prices, annual quantities, and inflation. We expect total  procurement costs will be somewhat higher than the estimate submitted in  the Nunn-McCurdy certification (refer to table 1). Reduced quantities and  use of production aircraft in testing will also limit training activities for the  near-term and delay deliveries of new capabilities to the warfighters.   Officials now forecast that the completion of system development,  completion of initial operational testing, and the full rate production  decision will extend into 2018.  This represents slips of about 5 years in  these important milestones against the current program baseline approved  in 2007.", "The military services are evaluating the impacts from restructuring on  their initial operational capability (IOC) milestones, the critical need dates  when the warfighter must have in place the first increment of operational  forces available for combat.  In response to the initial set of restructuring  actions, the Air Force and Navy tentatively extended these milestones to  2016, but the Marine Corps slightly adjusted its IOC date by 9 months to  December 2012. It is all but certain that the Marine Corps will be delaying  its IOC date in the wake of the Secretary\u2019s STOVL actions. Air Force and  Navy dates may also be adjusted to reflect the newest developments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Requires Unprecedented Funding Levels Well into the Future", "paragraphs": ["Affordability\u2014both in terms of the investment costs to acquire the JSF  and the continuing costs to operate and maintain it over the life-cycle\u2014is  at risk. A key tenet of the JSF program from its inception has been to  deliver an affordable, highly common fifth generation aircraft that could  be acquired by the warfighters in large numbers. Rising aircraft prices  erode buying power and make it difficult for the U.S. and its allies to buy  as many aircraft as planned.  Quantity reductions could drive additional  price increases for future aircraft. Further, while the Department is still  refining cost projections for operating and supporting future JSF fleets,  cost forecasts have increased as the program matures and more data  becomes available. Current JSF life-cycle cost estimates are considerably  higher than the legacy aircraft it will replace; this has major implications  for future demands on military operating and support budgets and plans  for recapitalizing fighter forces. Defense leadership stated that the JSF  program lost focus on affordability and that restoring and maintaining that  focus is paramount to improving program outcomes.", "In light of continued cost growth, the program places unprecedented  demands for funding in the defense budget\u2014an annual average of almost  $11 billion for the next two decades. (This and other data in this paragraph  reflect the fiscal year 2011 budget submission.) During the peak years of  production, the average annual requirement is about $13 billion. The JSF  will have to annually compete with other defense and nondefense  priorities for the shrinking discretionary federal dollar amid continued  concerns about the national debt and long term fiscal pressures. The JSF  program has received more than $56 billion through fiscal year 2010. To  complete the acquisition program as currently planned, another             $272 billion will be required from 2011 through 2035. Figure 1 illustrates  the annual funding requirements outlined in the program\u2019s Selected  Acquisition Report released in April 2010. These funding levels do not  reflect the additional funding increases in the Nunn-McCurdy certification  and the Secretary\u2019s recent actions. DOD is in the process of establishing a  new acquisition program baseline which will likely project even higher  funding requirements.", "The JSF is the linchpin in DOD\u2019s tactical aircraft recapitalization plans,  replacing hundreds of legacy aircraft. Because of its sheer size and high  priority within the Department, even relatively modest cost growth on the  JSF can require the sourcing of billions of additional funds, largely from  other programs in DOD\u2019s acquisition portfolio. On the other hand, slips in  JSF schedules, cuts in annual procurement quantities, and deferred  delivery of operational aircraft can require additional monies be spent on  legacy aircraft, postponing planned retirements and sustaining fleets for  longer periods of time.  To mitigate projected shortfalls in tactical aircraft  inventories due to JSF perturbations, the Navy recently procured  additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and both the Navy and Air Force are  funding service life extension programs and adding new capabilities to  legacy aircraft.", "Furthermore, international partners\u2019 participation in the JSF program is  very important to maintaining affordability for all buyers. DOD budget  plans expect the partners to buy 223 aircraft costing $24.1 billion during  the fiscal year 2011-2016 period. However, JSF cost increases, schedule  delays, and internal issues may result in reduced or deferred foreign buys.   Some partners have already signaled plans to buy fewer aircraft, a  different mix of aircraft, or defer purchases to later years. On the positive  side, other countries have expressed interest in acquiring the JSF.", "Decisions made by the international community and its impact on JSF  affordability are largely beyond the program\u2019s direct control. However,  improving JSF program outcomes to lower costs and reassure buyers is  within DOD\u2019s and the contractors\u2019 control.", "The eight international partners have important stakes in the JSF program,  having provided about $5 billion in development funding, being counted  upon to procure hundreds of aircraft, and expecting their industries to  receive a significant portion of JSF manufacturing and supply business.   DOD\u2019s procurement cost estimates provided to the Congress have long  assumed that the eight partners will buy at least 730 JSF aircraft.  Unit  prices for U.S. quantities assume the economic benefit of these purchases.   If fewer are sold overseas, the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps (and the  American taxpayer) may have to pay more. Unit costs can be expected to  increase with smaller purchases due to diminished manufacturing  economies of scale and because fixed costs have to be spread over fewer  aircraft.", "Maintaining a strong focus on affordability necessitates having reliable and  complete cost data that provides accurate accounting reports, identifies  potential cost and schedule problems early, and produces sound estimates  of the cost to complete work. The JSF program has been hampered in this  regard because, for at least the past three years, the prime contractor has  not had an adequate and disciplined earned value management (EVM)  system in place to effectively track costs and control schedule. The prime  contractor was found deficient in meeting 19 of 32 required guidelines,  calling into question its ability to manage the escalating costs and complex  scheduling of the JSF program.  In October 2010, the Defense Contract  Management Agency (DCMA) withdrew the determination of compliance  for the prime contractor\u2019s EVM system due to longstanding non- compliance issues with specific guidelines that underpin a sound system.   To address these shortcomings, the contractor is developing new  processes, tools, training, and enforcement in order to achieve a fully  integrated and automated EVM system. Officials will reassess the earned  value system by March 2012\u2014more than four years after these problems  were first discovered to see if modifications needed have been made.", "EVM is an important, established tool that can provide objective product  status reports. DOD requires its use by major defense suppliers to  facilitate good insight and oversight of the expenditure of government  dollars, thereby improving both affordability and accountability.  JSF is  DOD\u2019s largest acquisition ever, so it is particularly critical to improve and  certify the contractor\u2019s EVM system as expeditiously as possible.  If not  improved, inaccurate performance reports and late notice of cost overruns  will likely continue to hinder timely decision making and corrective  actions.

Figure 3 depicts forecasted  and actual labor hour requirements for building 12 production- representative test jets. Total labor hours required to produce the test  aircraft increased over time.   The 2010 actual labor hours exceeded the  2007 budgeted hours by more than 1.5 million hours, a 75 percent increase.", "Manufacturing production aircraft is different from building test aircraft,  and some gains in learning as more aircraft are built can be expected to,  over time, reduce labor hour costs. However, the experience to date on the  test aircraft and initial production aircraft suggests that future costs for  building production aircraft may be higher than currently budgeted. The  costs on the first three low-rate production contracts have increased from  amounts negotiated at contract award and the completion dates for  delivering aircraft have been extended over nine months on average. We  are encouraged by DOD\u2019s award of a fixed price incentive fee contract for  lot 4 production and the prospects for the cost study to inform lot 5  negotiations, but we have not examined contract specifications.", "DOD began procuring production jets in 2007 and has now ordered 58  aircraft on the first four low-rate initial production lots. JSF contracts  anticipated the delivery of 14 production jets through 2010, but none have  been delivered. Delivery of the first two production jets (both CTOLs) has  been delayed several times since the contract was signed and is now  expected in April 2011. In addition, DOD expects to procure 32 more  aircraft in fiscal year 2011. Building a large backlog of jets on order but  undelivered is not an efficient use of federal funds, tying up millions of  dollars in obligations ahead of the ability of the manufacturing process to  produce.  We note that the Secretary used a similar line of reasoning to  reduce STOVL production.", "DOD does not yet know the full effect that restructuring actions will have  on future annual procurement funding requirements.  Cost analysts are  still calculating the impacts from deferring procurement of 246 aircraft  from the near-term to future years, lowering the ramp rate, and extending  the full-rate production decision.  Future funding requirements could be  even higher than projected and the quantities considered affordable by the  U.S. and allies could be reduced, further driving up unit costs.", "The Secretary\u2019s decisions to reduce near-term procurement quantities and  adopt a less-steep ramp up in future production were based on IMRT  findings. The Secretary chartered the IMRT to comprehensively review  JSF manufacturing capacity to assess the contractor\u2019s ability to achieve  planned production ramp-up and to sustain the predicted maximum  production rates.  The IMRT\u2019s October 2009 report made 20 specific  recommendations for corrective actions.  As of September 2010, officials  considered eight of the recommendations complete and three others on  track. Implementation of the remaining nine recommendations was  incomplete or behind schedule.", "The most significant incomplete recommendation is improving global  supply chain management.  The JSF already has an extensive number of  suppliers worldwide and those numbers will increase with future  workload shared among numerous domestic and foreign firms. The IMRT  cites the global supply chain as the critical manufacturing challenge facing  the program, requiring significant improvement in delivery performance  and responsiveness in order to achieve the program\u2019s eventual production  rate goal of 20 aircraft per month.  According to the prime contractor, the  global supply chain remains on the critical path and progress has been  made, but the global transportation plan and supply chain risk  management plan are incomplete. Another IMRT recommendation that  still needs to be addressed is the performance of a comprehensive  schedule risk assessment, now expected to begin in spring 2011. We  recommended this in our March 2009 report.  Schedule risk assessments  can provide keen insight into critical path activities, cost and schedule  interrelationships, and emerging risks.", "The primary F135 engine contractor faces similar challenges as it moves  deeper into production. All development engines and initial production  units have been delivered, but the costs to complete each of the first three  engine production contracts increased and deliveries slipped since  contract awards.  Officials said these delays have not been especially  troublesome to date because aircraft deliveries were even later.  The  contractor achieved the initial service release for the CTOL and CV engine,  meaning the engine configuration is qualified and ready to go into  production, but the STOVL\u2019s initial release was delayed until December  2010 due to qualification testing.  The JAT reviewed F135 program  performance, identified cost drivers, and made affordability projections.   JAT officials said the contractor\u2019s cost reduction efforts were credible but  largely dependent on receiving more government funding for affordability  initiatives and alternative sourcing arrangements.", "Our past work in best practices found that successful product  development programs reach a point at which they know that  manufacturing processes will efficiently produce a new product  conforming to cost, quality, and schedule targets before they begin  producing a system.  Reaching this point means more than knowing that  the product can be built; it means that critical manufacturing processes  are under control, such that the quality, volume, and cost are proven  acceptable. By these criteria, the JSF contractors\u2019 abilities to ramp-up to  greater rates of production have not yet been demonstrated. The aircraft  and engine manufacturers now have significantly more items in  production flow compared to prior years, but throughput capacity to  complete all work and deliver end items is constrained.  We determined  that the aircraft and engine contractors are making good faith efforts to  implement the recommendations of the IMRT and JAT and to make other  improvements to production capacity and flow.  The aircraft manufacturer  is reporting a decrease in out of station work, more efficient work stations,  improved quality, increased parts availability, and reduced span times.  Until improvements are fully implemented and demonstrated, the  restructuring actions to reduce near term procurement quantities and  establish a more achievable ramp rate was appropriate and will provide  more time to fully mature manufacturing and supply processes and catch  up with aircraft backlogs.

Improvements over time occur through  design changes or manufacturing process improvements. A key reliability  metric is mean flying hours between failure, defined as the number of  flying hours achieved divided by the number of failures incurred.   Reliability growth plans called for the STOVL to have achieved at least     1.9 flying hours between failures and for the CTOL 2.9 flying hours  between failures by this point in the test program.

Further analysis  may be necessary for the test point to be closed out. The majority of the  points were earned on airworthiness tests (basic airframe handling  characteristics) and in ferrying the planes to test sites.  According to a  senior level DOD test official, airworthiness and ferry test points should be  relatively easy to accomplish.

Officials reported that design and manufacturing defects and excessive  component failures caused prolonged maintenance periods that drove the  low fly rates. For instance, in the July to August 2010 period, STOVL test  aircraft were down for unscheduled maintenance more than half the time.  Further test delays will likely cause the program to miss critical future  milestones. STOVL initial at-sea testing will not start until October 2011  because of delays in clearing the vertical-landing envelope. STOVL-related  delays are also causing Marine Corps leadership to reassess its  requirements and will likely extend the date for achieving initial  operational capabilities, currently set in December 2012.", "Concerned that STOVL testing problems were negatively affecting the  other variants, the Department moved to decouple the STOVL testing and  placed the variant on a two-year probation period to work out problems  and get back on track.

Officials added more resources for development  testing, extended the flight test schedule, and reduced the overlap with  initial operational testing. More recently, officials revised the test plan  increasing the total number of test flights from 5,856 to 7,727, about one- third more. To increase capacity, the restructure added one carrier variant  test aircraft, an additional software integration line, and allowed the  program to utilize up to three production aircraft for development testing.   Compared to the previous test plan, officials assumed more ground time  for aircraft maintenance and planned modifications, as well as a more  measured ramp-up in the rate of flights per test aircraft.

Contracting officials told us  that early results are providing good correlation between ground and flight  tests.", "The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation reported that 50 percent  of the models will be accredited during the final year of flight testing, a  highly risky approach. Delays in accreditation add risks to not completing  future software blocks on time and for discovering defects late. More flight  testing may be needed to cover lab shortcomings, but is generally more  expensive, and could lead to more delays in completing development and  operational testing.  It could also require more production aircraft for a  longer period to supplement test assets, resulting in fewer systems at  training sites and operational bases.", "Contractor utilization of labs has increased markedly and the number and  integration of labs is impressive, but capacity may be constrained. Because  of development concurrency, there is overlap in scheduling the new  blocks and resources must be shared between blocks when rework on an  earlier block is required. If integration and test is delayed due to capacity  or conflict with an earlier block, lab officials said that expected  capabilities may not be delivered on time to meet flight test and training  dates. Mitigating strategies include adding people, lab capacity, software  test lines, and shifting capabilities to later blocks. The 2010 restructuring  added $250 million to increase integration lab capacity.  According to  program officials, the greater number of labs allows engineers to work  simultaneously on different development blocks, reducing bottlenecks  that may occur in testing.

Several blocks have grown in size and taken longer to  complete than planned.  Software defects, low productivity, and  concurrent development of successive blocks created inefficiencies,  taking longer to fix defects and delaying the demonstration of critical  capabilities.   In addition, program and prime contractor officials  acknowledge they do not include integration as a key tracking metric and  have been unable to agree on how to track it.

Each of the remaining three blocks\u2014providing full  mission systems and warfighting capabilities\u2014are now projected to slip  between 2 to 3 years compared to the 2006 plan. Defects and workload  bottlenecks delayed the release of full block 1 capabilities; the initial  limited release of block 1 software was flown for the first time in  November 2010. Software defects increased throughout 2010, but fixing  defects did not keep pace. Some capabilities were moved to future blocks  in attempts to meet schedule and mitigate risks.  For example, full data  fusion mission systems were deferred from block 2 to 3. Further trades  and deferrals may be needed. Rather than working all blocks concurrently,  focusing efforts on a more measured evolutionary approach could result in  more timely release of incremental capabilities to the testing, training, and  warfighter communities. Development and integration of the most  advanced capabilities could be deferred to future increments and  delivered to the warfighter at a later date.", "The recent technical baseline review identified software as a significant  challenge, slowing system development and requiring more time and  money.  Although officials are confident that such risks can be addressed,  the scale and complexity of what is involved remains a technically  challenging and lengthy effort.  Uncertainties pertaining to critical  technologies, including the helmet-mounted display and advanced data  links, add to challenges. Deficiencies in the helmet mounted display,  especially latency in transmitting sensor data, are causing officials to  develop a second helmet while trying to fix the first model.

However, restructuring comes  with a price tag\u2014higher up-front development costs, fewer aircraft  received in the near term, training delays, and prolonged times for testing  and delivering the capabilities required by the warfighter. Reducing near- term procurement quantities lessens concurrency, but the overlap among  development, testing, and production activities is still substantial and  risky.  Development and testing activities will now overlap 11 years of  production based on the latest extension in key milestones. Flight testing  and production activity are increasing and contractors are improving  supply and manufacturing processes, but deliveries are still lagging. The  challenge in front of the aircraft and engine contractors is improving the  global supply chain and accelerating manufacturing throughput to produce  quality products in economic quantities and on time.  Slowed deliveries  have built a growing backlog of jets on order but not delivered; this is not  a good use of federal funds, tying up millions of obligated dollars much  ahead of the ability of the manufacturing process to produce.

The program\u2019s size and priority is such that its  cost overruns and extended schedules are either borne by funding cuts to  other programs or else drive increases in the top line of defense spending,  the latter not an attractive option in a period of more austere budgets. Up  until now, JSF problems have been addressed either with more time and  money or by deferring aircraft procurement to be borne by future years\u2019  budgets.  It is past time to place some boundaries on the program such  that future difficulties can be managed within a finite budget by facilitating  trades within the JSF program and thereby minimizing impacts on other  defense programs and priorities.  Also, Department actions to limit STOVL  procurement, decouple it from development testing, and concentrate  efforts to resolve deficiencies are appropriate.  Given its criticality to the  Marine Corp\u2019s future tactical aviation plans, additional steps may be  needed to set the framework and criteria for the \u201cprobation period\u201d and to  sustain management focus on STOVL in order to better ascertain its  progress and inform future decisions.  Focused individual attention on  STOVL apart from the other two variants could allow each variant to  proceed through development and testing at its own pace.  Furthermore,  development testing is hampered both by the late delivery of software  increments and the lagging schedule for accrediting ground labs and  simulation models.  A comprehensive independent review of the software  development process and lab accreditation issues could enhance  management insight and identify opportunities for improvement in these  critical areas.

Even then, we would expect changes to be few and adopted  only after close scrutiny by defense leadership.  Approved changes  should be well supported, adequately documented, and reported to the  congressional defense committees.    2.  Establish criteria for the STOVL probation period and take additional  steps to sustain individual attention on STOVL-specific issues,  including independent F-35B/STOVL Progress Reviews with Senior  Leadership to ensure cost and schedule milestones are achieved to  deliver required warfighter capabilities. The intent is to allow each JSF  variant to proceed and demonstrate success at its own pace and could  result in separate full-rate production decisions.  3.  The Department should conduct an independent review of the  contractor\u2019s software development, integration, and test processes\u2014 similar to its review of manufacturing operations\u2014and look for  opportunities to streamline software efforts.

We recommend program delay  investing in production until  flight testing shows that JSF  performs as expected.", "DOD partially concurred but did  not delay start of production  because they believe the risk  level was appropriate.", "Congress reduced funding for  first two low-rate production  buys thereby slowing the ramp  up of production.", "Progress is being made but  concerns remain about undue  overlap in testing and  production. We recommend  limits to annual production  quantities to 24 a year until  flying quantities are  demonstrated.", "DOD non-concurred and felt  that the program had an  acceptable level of concurrency  and an appropriate acquisition  strategy.", "DOD implemented a Mid- Course Risk Reduction Plan to  replenish management  reserves from about $400  million to about $1 billion by  reducing test resources.", "We believe new plan actually  increases risks and that DOD  should revise the plan to  address concerns about  testing, use of management  reserves, and manufacturing.  We determine that the cost  estimate is not reliable and that  a new cost estimate and  schedule risk assessment is  needed.", "DOD did not revise risk plan  nor restore testing resources,  stating that they will monitor the  new plan and adjust it if  necessary. Consistent with a  report recommendation, a new  cost estimate was eventually  prepared, but DOD refused to  do a risk and uncertainty  analysis that we felt was  important to provide a range  estimate of potential outcomes.", "The program increased the  cost estimate and adds a year  to development but accelerated  the production ramp up.  Independent DOD cost  estimate (JET I) projects even  higher costs and further delays.", "Because of development  problems, we stated that  moving forward with an  accelerated procurement plan  and use of cost reimbursement  contracts is very risky. We  recommended the program  report on the risks and  mitigation strategy for this  approach.", "DOD agreed to report its  contracting strategy and plans  to Congress. In response to our  report recommendation, DOD  subsequently agreed to do a  schedule risk analysis, but still  had not done so as of February  2011. In February 2010, the  Department announced a  major restructuring of the JSF  program, including reduced  procurement and a planned  move to fixed-price contracts.", "The program was restructured  to reflect findings of recent  independent cost team (JET II)  and independent  manufacturing review team. As  a result, development funds  increased, test aircraft were  added, the schedule was  extended, and the early  production rate decreased.", "Because of additional costs  and schedule delays, the  program\u2019s ability to meet  warfighter requirements on  time is at risk. We recommend  the program complete a full  comprehensive cost estimate  and assess warfighter and IOC  requirements. We suggest that  Congress require DOD to  prepare a \u201csystem maturity  matrix\u201d\u2013a tool for tying annual  procurement requests to  demonstrated progress.", "DOD continued restructuring  actions and announced plans  to increase test resources and  lower the production rate.  Independent review teams  evaluated aircraft and engine  manufacturing processes. As  we projected in this report, cost  increases later resulted in a  Nunn-McCurdy breach. Military  services are currently reviewing  capability requirements as we  recommended.
