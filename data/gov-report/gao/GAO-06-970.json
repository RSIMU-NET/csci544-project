GAO views the continuing lack of compliance with FFMIA and the associated problems with agency financial systems to be significant challenges to improving the management of the federal government. For fiscal year 2005, auditors for five agencies provided negative assurance that agency systems substantially complied with FFMIA as allowed by the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) current audit guidance. This means that nothing came to their attention to indicate that agency financial management systems did not substantially comply with FFMIA requirements. GAO continues to believe that this type of reporting is not sufficient for reporting under the act. In addition, negative assurance may provide the false impression that the auditors are reporting that the agencies' systems are compliant. In contrast, auditors for the Department of Labor (Labor) provided positive assurance, which is an opinion, by reporting that Labor's financial management systems substantially complied with FFMIA requirements--a reporting practice that adds more value. Auditors have expressed concern about providing positive assurance because of the need to clarify the meaning of substantial compliance. In addition, some auditors stated that a change in OMB's guidance that permits negative assurance would be necessary for them to provide an opinion on FFMIA compliance.

To address this long- standing weakness, the Congress mandated financial management reform  within the federal government by enacting the Chief Financial Officers  (CFO) Act of 1990. The CFO Act laid the foundation for a comprehensive  reform of federal financial management by establishing a leadership  structure, requiring audited financial statements, and strengthening  accountability reporting. This act also requires agencies to implement  modern financial management systems in order to attain the systematic  measurement of performance; the development of cost information; and  the integration of program, budget, and financial information for  management reporting. The end goal of the CFO Act is to greatly enhance  the ability of managers to do their jobs by providing the full range of  financial information needed for day-to-day management.", "The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA)  was enacted on September 30, 1996, and builds on the foundation laid by  the CFO Act by highlighting the need for agencies to have financial  management systems that are able to generate reliable, useful, and timely  information needed to make fully informed decisions and to ensure  accountability on an ongoing basis. FFMIA requires the major departments  and agencies covered by the CFO Act to implement and maintain financial  management systems that comply substantially with (1) federal financial  management systems requirements, (2) applicable federal accounting  standards, and (3) the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger (SGL) at  the transaction level.

This series of legislation started with  the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), which the  Congress passed to strengthen internal controls and accounting systems  throughout the federal government, among other purposes. Issued  pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512 (c), (d), still commonly known as FMFIA, the  Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government provides the standards that are directed at helping agency  managers implement effective internal control, an integral part of  improving financial management systems. Internal control is a major part  of managing an organization and comprises the plans, methods, and  procedures used to meet missions, goals, and objectives. In summary,  internal control, which under OMB\u2019s guidance for FMFIA is synonymous  with management control, helps government program managers achieve  desired results through effective stewardship of public resources.", "Effective internal control also helps in managing change to cope with  shifting environments and evolving demands and priorities. As programs  change and agencies strive to improve operational processes and  implement new technological developments, management must  continually assess and evaluate its internal control to ensure that the  control activities being used are effective and updated when necessary.  While agencies had achieved some early success in identifying and  correcting material internal control and accounting system weaknesses,  their efforts to implement FMFIA had not produced the results intended  by the Congress.", "Therefore, in the 1990s, the Congress passed additional management  reform legislation to improve the general and financial management of the  federal government. This legislation includes the (1) CFO Act of 1990,   (2) Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, (3) Government  Management Reform Act of 1994, (4) FFMIA, (5) Clinger-Cohen Act of  1996, (6) Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, (7) Improper  Payments Information Act of 2002, and (8) Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) Financial Accountability Act of 2004. The combination of  reforms ushered in by these laws, if successfully implemented, provides a  solid foundation to improve the accountability of government programs  and operations as well as to routinely produce valuable cost and operating  performance information. These financial management reform acts  emphasize the importance of improving financial management across the  federal government.", "In particular, building on the foundation laid by the CFO Act, FFMIA  emphasizes the need for CFO Act agencies to have systems that are able to  generate reliable, useful, and timely information for decision-making  purposes and to ensure ongoing accountability. FFMIA requires the  departments and agencies covered by the CFO Act to implement and  maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with   (1) federal financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable  federal accounting standards, and (3) the SGL at the transaction level.  FFMIA also requires auditors to state in their CFO Act financial statement  audit reports whether the agencies\u2019 financial management systems  substantially comply with these three FFMIA systems requirements.

Specifically, this guidance called for auditors to  provide negative assurance when reporting on an agency system\u2019s FFMIA  compliance. On August 23, 2006, OMB issued Bulletin No. 06-03, Audit  Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, which superseded OMB  Bulletin No. 01-02. The new bulletin did not substantially revise OMB\u2019s  FFMIA audit guidance contained in Bulletin No. 01-02. Second, in OMB  Memorandum, Revised Implementation Guidance for the Federal  Financial Management Improvement Act (Jan. 4, 2001), OMB provides  guidance for agencies and auditors to use in assessing substantial  compliance. The guidance describes the factors that should be considered  in determining whether an agency\u2019s systems substantially comply with  FFMIA\u2019s three requirements. Further, the guidance provides examples of  the types of indicators that should be used as a basis for assessing whether  an agency\u2019s systems are in substantial compliance with each of the three  FFMIA requirements.

As detailed in appendix V, we have also issued a series of  checklists to help assess whether agencies\u2019 systems meet systems  requirements. The FAM guidance on FFMIA assessments recognizes that  while financial statement audits offer some assurance on FFMIA  compliance, auditors should design and implement additional testing to  satisfy FFMIA criteria. For example, in performing financial statement  audits, auditors generally focus on the ability of the financial management  systems to process and summarize financial information that flows into  annual agency financial statements. In contrast, FFMIA requires auditors  to assess whether an agency\u2019s financial management systems comply with  system requirements, accounting standards, and the SGL. To do this,  auditors need to consider whether agency systems provide reliable, useful,  and timely information for managing day-to-day operations so that agency  managers would have the necessary information to measure performance  on an ongoing basis rather than just at year end. Further, OMB\u2019s current  audit guidance calls for financial statement auditors to review  performance information for consistency with the financial statements,  but does not require auditors to determine whether this information is  available to managers for day-to-day decision making as called for by the  FAM guidance for testing compliance with FFMIA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed the fiscal year 2005 financial statement audit reports for the  24 CFO Act agencies to identify the auditors\u2019 assessments of agency  financial systems\u2019 compliance and the problems that affect FFMIA  compliance.

Based on their audit reports, we  identified reported problems that affect agency systems\u2019 compliance with  FFMIA. The problems identified in these reports are consistent with long- standing financial management weaknesses we have reported based on  our work at a number of agencies. However, we caution that the  occurrence of problems in a particular category may be even greater than  auditors\u2019 reports of FFMIA noncompliance would suggest, because  auditors may not have identified all instances of noncompliance with  systems requirements and included all problems in their reports.

In contrast, the number of CFO Act agencies receiving  unqualified opinions on their financial statements has increased  significantly since 1997, when FFMIA reporting began. In fiscal year 1997,  11 of the CFO Act agencies attained unqualified opinions on their financial  statements, while 19 agencies received unqualified opinions in fiscal year  2005. As shown in figure 3, the ability of federal financial management  systems to address FFMIA requirements has not advanced at the same  pace. In fiscal year 1997, 20 agencies were reported as having systems that  were not in substantial compliance with at least one of the three FFMIA  systems requirements. In fiscal year 2005, auditors for 18 of the CFO Act  agencies reported that the agencies\u2019 financial management systems do not  substantially comply with at least one of the three FFMIA requirements.", "Auditors\u2019 assessments for three agencies changed from fiscal year 2004 to  2005. For fiscal year 2005, auditors for OPM were able to provide negative  assurance that OPM\u2019s financial management systems, as a whole, were  substantially compliant with FFMIA\u2019s three requirements. Conversely,  auditors for Energy and GSA reported that those agencies\u2019 financial  management systems did not substantially comply with FFMIA  requirements in fiscal year 2005, but had not reported any FFMIA  compliance issues at those federal agencies in fiscal year 2004. At Energy,  the auditors indicated that Energy\u2019s systems problems stemmed from the  implementation of a new accounting system. At GSA, the auditors reported  recently identified internal control weaknesses over financial reporting. In  addition, consistent with the DHS Financial Accountability Act of 2004,  which added DHS to the list of CFO Act agencies, DHS\u2019s auditors reported  that the department\u2019s financial management systems did not substantially  comply with any of the three FFMIA requirements for fiscal year 2005.", "Figure 4 summarizes auditors\u2019 assessments of agencies\u2019 compliance with  the three requirements of FFMIA for fiscal years 1997 through 2005 and  suggests that the instances of noncompliance with FFMIA\u2019s three  requirements have remained fairly constant.

As we have previously reported, a number of CFO  Act agencies have restated certain of their financial statements over the  past few years to correct for material errors. Errors in financial statements  result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of  accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the  time the financial statements were prepared. Generally, these restatements  resulted from weaknesses in internal control over the processing and  reporting of certain transactions and inadequate audit procedures to  detect these errors. The auditors for the seven agencies that restated their  financial statements in fiscal year 2005 also reported that the agencies\u2019  financial systems had not met FFMIA requirements. Further, restatements  raise questions about the reliability of other information in previously  issued financial statements and indicate a continuing lack of improvement  in the underlying agency financial systems. Frequent restatements to  correct errors can undermine public trust and confidence in both the  entity and all responsible parties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Auditors Mostly Provide Negative Assurance on FFMIA Compliance", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, auditors for five agencies (Commerce, EPA, NSF, OPM,  and SSA) provided negative assurance that the agencies\u2019 systems were  compliant with FFMIA requirements. The auditor for one agency, Labor,  provided positive assurance on FFMIA compliance. From our perspective,  FFMIA requires auditors to provide positive assurance, which is an  opinion, because section 803 (b)(1) of FFMIA requires auditors to \u201creport  whether the agency financial management systems comply with the  requirements of .\u201d Auditors provide negative assurance when they  state that nothing came to their attention during the course of their  planned procedures to indicate that the agency\u2019s financial management  systems did not meet FFMIA requirements. Under generally accepted  government auditing standards, there are no requirements to perform  additional testing beyond that needed for a financial statement audit for an  auditor to give negative assurance. However, if financial statement users  are not familiar with the concept of negative assurance, which we believe  is generally the case, they may incorrectly assume that these five agencies\u2019  systems have been fully tested by the auditors and that the agencies have  achieved FFMIA compliance. In addition, testing that is not sufficient to  support an opinion also means that an area of noncompliance may be  missed; therefore, the number of problems in a particular category may be  even greater than auditors\u2019 reports of FFMIA noncompliance would  suggest, because not all problems are being included. Although OMB\u2019s  current audit guidance instructs auditors to test for compliance with  FFMIA, it does not provide guidance on the nature and extent of tests to  be performed. It only calls for auditors to provide negative assurance  when reporting whether an agency\u2019s systems are in substantial compliance  with the three FFMIA requirements. We did note greater attention to  assessing FFMIA compliance at the agencies we visited. Auditors at 8 of  the 12 CFO Act agencies visited prepared and used a separate audit  program to assess FFMIA compliance. Auditors stated that separate  FFMIA audit programs were developed to ensure consistency and to share  best practices among their audit teams.", "In fiscal years 2005 and 2004, auditors for Labor provided positive  assurance of Labor\u2019s financial management systems\u2019 compliance with  FFMIA requirements. For both years, Labor\u2019s Inspector General  contracted with an independent public accounting firm to conduct the  financial statement audit and included a provision to specifically perform  an FFMIA examination in accordance with American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants attestation standards. In general, providing positive  assurance of FFMIA compliance requires auditors to perform more audit  procedures than those needed to render an opinion on the financial  statements. While financial statement audits in general will offer some  assurance on FFMIA compliance, auditors should also design and  implement additional testing to satisfy the criteria in FFMIA. For example,  in performing financial statement audits, auditors generally focus on the  capability of the financial management systems to process and summarize  financial information that flows into agency financial statements. In  contrast, assessing FFMIA compliance involves determining whether an  agency\u2019s financial management systems comply with systems  requirements. To do this, auditors need to consider whether agency  systems provide complete, accurate, and timely information for managing  day-to-day operations. For fiscal year 2005, Labor\u2019s independent auditor  performed transaction testing, provided FAM Section 700 training to audit  team members, analyzed whether financial management systems provided  reliable and timely financial information for managing current operations  to senior management and program managers, and completed the audit  procedures provided in FAM 701A and associated Joint Financial  Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) checklists for each operating  division. The auditor estimated that the cost of the additional procedures  needed to provide positive assurance was between $50,000 and $80,000.  The efforts of Labor to perform the level of review necessary to provide  positive assurance of FFMIA compliance in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 are  noteworthy, and we look forward to other agencies adopting similar  auditing and reporting practices.", "Performing audit procedures designed to provide positive assurance of an  agency\u2019s financial management systems\u2019 compliance with FFMIA  requirements can identify weaknesses and lead to improvements that  enhance the performance, productivity, and efficiency of federal financial  management systems. It also provides a clear \u201cbottom line,\u201d whereas  negative assurance does not. Therefore, as we have discussed in prior  reports covering fiscal years 2000 through 2004, we continue to believe  that our prior recommendation for OMB to require agency auditors to  provide a statement of positive assurance when reporting an agency\u2019s  systems to be in substantial compliance with the three FFMIA systems  requirements is still appropriate. Given OMB\u2019s explicit instruction to  provide negative assurance, some auditors also indicated that a change in  OMB\u2019s guidance on FFMIA reporting would be necessary in order for them  to provide an opinion on FFMIA compliance.", "In a recent discussion with OMB officials, as well as OMB\u2019s comments on a  draft of this report and our prior FFMIA reports, OMB continues to  support the requirement for negative assurance of FFMIA compliance.  While OMB agrees that testing should occur, and its guidance on FFMIA  calls for it, it does not specify the nature and extent of audit procedures.  OMB officials continue to express the belief that the level of testing  needed for positive assurance may be too time-consuming and costly.  OMB officials said that different, more coordinated approaches toward  assessing an agency\u2019s internal controls and FFMIA compliance could  provide sufficient assurance on an agency\u2019s systems. We share concerns  about the added cost, but want to make our view quite clear that the focus  needs to be on the ultimate end goal of having financial management  systems able to routinely produce reliable, useful, and timely financial  information. Until such systems exist, the ability of federal managers to  effectively manage and oversee their major programs was and continues to  be restricted.", "In its comments, OMB emphasized that its PMA and financial management  line of business initiatives, along with the strengthened internal control  requirements incorporated into the revised OMB Circular No. A-123, are  helping agencies to identify and correct FFMIA deficiencies. We agree  these initiatives can drive systems improvements and support OMB\u2019s  leadership in this area. Our concern lies in the fact that the full value of  independent auditors\u2019 assessments of FFMIA compliance will not be fully  realized until auditors perform a sufficient level of audit work to be able to  provide positive assurance that agencies are in compliance with FFMIA as  called for in the act. When reporting an agency\u2019s financial management  systems to be in substantial compliance, positive assurance from  independent auditors will provide users with confidence that the agency  systems provide the reliable, useful, and timely information envisioned by  the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional FFMIA Guidance Needed", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, a number of auditors we interviewed  expressed a need for clarification on the definition of \u201csubstantial  compliance.\u201d In fiscal year 2005, auditors for 7 of the 12 agencies we  visited stated that additional guidance on the definition of substantial  compliance would be useful. As a result, we reiterate our previous  recommendation that OMB explore clarifying the definition of \u201csubstantial  compliance\u201d to meet the needs of the auditing community and to allow for  consistent application of the doctrine.", "In addition, 8 of the 12 independent auditors cited a need for additional  guidance to assist them in assessing whether agency systems substantially  comply with the three FFMIA requirements. For example, at SSA, the  auditors reported a need for clearer guidance from OMB on assessing  FFMIA compliance that is consistent with the GAO/PCIE FAM. Auditors  for other agencies we visited professed a need for (1) more clearly defined  and objective criteria to assist in their determination of FFMIA  compliance, (2) more specific guidance on testing and sampling  methodologies, and (3) additional guidance for assessing compliance with  certain accounting standards, such as the Statement of Federal Financial  Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 4, Managerial Cost Accounting  Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government.

The same six types of problems  have been cited by auditors in the fiscal years 2001 through 2004 audit  reports, although the auditors may not have reported these problems as  specific reasons for their systems\u2019 lack of substantial compliance with the  three FFMIA requirements. In addition, we caution that the occurrence of  problems in any particular category may be even greater than auditors\u2019  reports of FFMIA noncompliance would suggest because auditors may not  have identified all problems during the reviews.", "The CFO Act calls for agencies to develop and maintain integrated  accounting and financial management systems that comply with federal  systems requirements and provide for (1) complete, reliable, consistent,  and timely information that is responsive to the financial information  needs of the agency and facilitates the systematic measurement of  performance; (2) the development and reporting of cost management  information; and (3) the integration of accounting, budgeting, and program  information. OMB Circular No. A-127, Financial Management Systems,  requires agencies to establish and maintain a single integrated financial  management system that conforms to functional requirements issued by  the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO), formerly the Joint  Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP). More details on  the financial management systems requirements can be found in  appendixes I and II.", "The lack of integrated financial management systems typically results in  agencies expending major effort and resources, including in some cases  hiring external consultants, to develop information that their systems  should be able to provide on a daily or recurring basis. Agencies with  nonintegrated financial systems are also more likely to devote more time  and resources to collecting information than those with integrated  systems. In addition, opportunities for errors are increased when agencies\u2019  systems are not integrated.", "Auditors frequently mentioned the lack of integrated financial  management systems in their fiscal year 2005 audit reports. As shown in  figure 5, auditors for 13 of the 18 agencies with noncompliant systems  reported this to be a problem, compared with 12 of the 16 agencies  reported with noncompliant systems in fiscal year 2004. For example,  auditors for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  reported that HUD has not been in compliance with FFMIA, in part due to  the lack of an integrated financial management system, since fiscal year  1997, when reports under the act were first required. As a result, HUD has  had to rely on extensive ad hoc analyses and special projects to produce  account balances and disclosures. The auditors further reported that  HUD\u2019s most significant system challenges exist at the Federal Housing  Administration (FHA), which continues to conduct some day-to-day  business operations with legacy-based systems, thereby limiting its ability  to integrate the financial processing environment, although the auditors  noted that FHA is making progress in achieving compliance with federal  financial system requirements. Consequently, according to the HUD Office  of Inspector General, since HUD\u2019s existing core financial system could be  better integrated, more user-friendly, and less costly to maintain, HUD  management is proceeding with plans to develop and implement a modern  financial management system through the HUD Integrated Financial  Management Improvement Project.", "At DHS, auditors reported that the financial management systems for  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Coast Guard  lack appropriate integration. Specifically, DHS auditors reported that ICE  had not successfully integrated the accounting processes of the five DHS  components for which it became responsible in fiscal year 2004. Auditors  also noted that ICE continued to operate unreliable processes and  procedures that support accounting and financial reporting, resulting in  material errors, irregularities, and abnormal balances in the DHS  consolidated financial statements that existed for most of fiscal year 2004  and continued unresolved in fiscal year 2005. As a result, auditors reported  that ICE\u2019s financial systems were inadequate to process financial  transactions for the five DHS components. Further, auditors for the Coast  Guard reported that the financial reporting process was complex and  labor-intensive with a significant number of adjustments being made  outside the core accounting system. In addition, Coast Guard officials had  to perform a significant amount of manual review in order to integrate  data from three separate general ledger systems. As a result, the auditors  found that DHS was unable to prepare a consolidated financial statement  for fiscal year 2005 until November 2005 and that the consolidated  financial statement disclosures and notes contained critical errors and  inconsistencies that required material adjustments to correct."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Reconciliation Procedures", "paragraphs": ["A reconciliation process, whether manual or automated, is a necessary  and valuable part of a sound financial management system.

These weaknesses inhibit GSA management\u2019s ability to detect and prevent  budgetary accounting and reporting misstatements. Further, the auditors  noted that GSA continued to lack adequate controls for reconciling  intragovernmental balances. As a result, GSA has developed extensive  manual workarounds and used estimates to determine the break down of  revenue and receivables for DOD\u2014the largest customer of GSA\u2019s Federal  Acquisition Service.

Recent efforts to modernize  financial management systems have often exceeded budgeted costs,  resulted in delays in delivery dates, and not provided the anticipated  system functionality and performance. The key for federal agencies to  avoid the long-standing problems that have plagued financial management  system improvement efforts is to address the foremost causes of those  problems and adopt solutions that reduce the risks associated with these  efforts to acceptable levels. Our March 2006 report discusses in detail the  key causes of past financial management system implementation failures,  the significant governmentwide initiatives currently under way, and  actions that can be taken to improve the management and control of  agency financial management system modernization efforts. The report  also highlights some of the issues we identified with OMB\u2019s financial  management line of business initiative and includes actions that would  help reduce the risks associated with financial management system  implementation efforts.

While agencies anticipate that the new systems will provide reliable,  useful, and timely data to support managerial decision making, our work  and that of others has shown that has often not been the case. For  example, modernization efforts at Energy, HHS, DOD, and Treasury have  been hampered by agencies not following best practices in systems  development and implementation efforts (commonly referred to as  disciplined processes).", "According to Energy\u2019s independent auditor, Energy implemented a  new financial accounting system in April 2005, shortly after  reorganizing and consolidating its finance and accounting services  organization in October 2004. At the same time, Energy also adopted a  new chart of accounts in conjunction with the new accounting system.  Prior to 2005, Energy\u2019s auditors had consistently provided negative  assurance that the financial management systems were in compliance  with FFMIA; however, the reorganization and consolidation adversely  affected the financial accounting staffing levels and skills mix  throughout the department and Energy did not complete corrective  actions to address these weaknesses. As a result, in the process of  implementing the new system, Energy encountered a number of  problems involving data conversion, reconciliation, posting, and  reporting. Energy\u2019s auditor specifically noted problems in accounting  for obligations, monitoring budget execution and control, reconciling  integrated contractor trial balances with departmental records,  reconciling accounting system modules to the general ledger, resolving  various posting errors, and identifying and reporting intragovernmental  transactions. The auditor also noted that, after the implementation of  the new system, many reports needed for management, internal  control, and audit purposes were no longer available. These problems  hindered the department\u2019s ability to assure the accuracy and  completeness of data needed for audit testing and it was unable to  provide the accurate and supportable financial statements required for  audit. As a result, Energy\u2019s auditors issued a disclaimer on the fiscal  year 2005 financial statements and concluded that the financial  management systems did not substantially comply with federal  financial management systems requirements and federal accounting  standards.", "As part of its modernization effort, HHS developed plans to reduce the  number of financial management systems from five to two using the  Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). This system is  expected to integrate the HHS financial management structure to  provide more timely and consistent information and to promote the  consolidation of accounting services throughout HHS. On the basis of  our fiscal year 2004 review of UFMS, we reported that HHS had not  effectively implemented the best practices needed to reduce the risks  associated with the implementation of a new system. Specifically, we  reported that the UFMS implementation project was schedule driven  rather than event driven based on effectively implemented disciplined  processes, with limited time devoted to critical steps in the system  development life cycle. We also stated that data conversion and system  interface challenges were critical to the ultimate success of UFMS. In  April 2005, HHS deployed the core financial portion of UFMS at the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA). Subsequently, auditors at HHS reported  problems with the implementation process at CDC and FDA.  Specifically, they stated that HHS experienced significant challenges in  resolving issues with the system conversion and implementation,  including configuration issues, insufficient resources, inadequate  training, and limited report capability of financial and budget activity  within the system. Furthermore, the auditors noted that UFMS, as  currently configured, cannot produce financial statements. Therefore,  FDA and CDC used cumbersome processes to crosswalk the  unadjusted trial balance to the financial statements and to record  thousands of nonstandard accounting entries both prior and  subsequent to the UFMS conversion. For example, FDA recorded about  14,000 nonstandard accounting entries totaling an absolute value of  approximately $9.4 billion to create the September 30, 2005, financial  statements. In addition, CDC had to record (1) accounting entries  totaling an absolute value of approximately $11.3 billion either to its  financial statements or those of another HHS operating division;   (2) adjustments totaling an absolute value of about $24.4 billion, related  to conversion, data cleanup, corrections, account reclassifications, and  other adjustments to conform to UFMS processing; and (3) an  approximately $19.1 billion absolute value adjustment to the database  used to generate financial statements as a result of conversion  adjustments made in UFMS that could not be extracted into the  database. The auditors reported that HHS management continues to  develop and implement corrective actions to improve its  implementation of UFMS, develop internal controls, train personnel,  and develop necessary reports, policies, and procedures; however, they  noted that sustained efforts will be necessary to overcome the  seriousness of the weaknesses noted.", "According to DOD management, the department\u2019s inability to comply  materially with FFMIA is primarily the result of structural problems  related to legacy accounting systems that do not accurately account for  both budgetary and proprietary activities. Quite simply, according to  DOD management, the department does not have the systems and  accounting structures in place to achieve compliance with FFMIA. We  have reported that DOD has historically been unable to develop and  implement business systems on time, within budget, and with the  promised capability. For example, in September 2005, we reported  that the Department of the Navy spent approximately $1 billion for four  largely failed pilot Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system  efforts, without marked improvement in its day-to-day operations.  Although the pilots used the same ERP commercial off-the-shelf  software, inconsistencies in the design and implementation resulted in  them not being interoperable. Furthermore, if there had been effective  project management oversight of the pilot programs at the outset, there  would not have been a need to, in essence, start over. The Navy now  has a new ERP project under way, which early Navy estimates indicate  will cost another $800 million. While the new project, as currently  envisioned, has the potential to address some of the Navy\u2019s financial  management weaknesses, it will not provide an all-inclusive end-to-end  corporate solution for the Navy. For example, the current scope of the  ERP does not provide for real-time asset visibility of shipboard  inventory, which has been and continues to be a long-standing problem  within the department. Further, there are still significant challenges  and risks ahead as the project moves forward, such as developing and  implementing 44 system interfaces with other Navy and DOD systems  and converting data from legacy systems to the ERP system. In  addition, the Navy does not have in place the structure to capture  quantitative data that can be used to assess the effectiveness of the  overall effort and has not established an independent verification and  validation function.", "The ability to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the U.S.  government (CFS) has been a long-standing challenge for Treasury\u2019s  Financial Management Service. To address some of the internal control  weaknesses identified in our audit report, Treasury began developing  the Governmentwide Financial Report System (GFRS). The goal of this  new system is to directly link information from federal agencies\u2019  audited financial statements to amounts reported in the CFS. We  found that Treasury had not yet effectively implemented the  disciplined processes necessary to provide reasonable assurance that  GFRS will meet its performance, schedule, and cost goals. Specifically,  Treasury had not (1) developed a concept of operations or any other  document that adequately defines or documents the expected  performance of GFRS, (2) developed a detailed project plan and  schedule through completion of GFRS, (3) developed a budget   justification for GFRS as called for in OMB Circular No. A-11, and   (4) implemented the disciplined processes necessary to effectively  manage the GFRS project. These deficiencies have contributed to the  various usability problems encountered by its users. Going forward, it  will be important for Treasury to better mitigate its risks so that long- standing internal control weaknesses regarding the preparation of the  CFS can be eliminated and, more importantly, so that Treasury ends up  with a system that fully meets its and agencies\u2019 needs.", "In addition to the examples above, our March 2006 report summarizes  many of the agencies\u2019 financial management system implementation  failures that have been previously reported by us and agency inspectors  general.

Although there have been  subsequent requests by agencies and departments to become shared  services providers, as of September 2006, OMB has not designated any  new providers beyond the four original service providers previously  selected. According to OMB\u2019s Migration Planning Guidance that was  issued in September 2006, OMB has encouraged private sector providers  that can satisfy the shared services requirements to participate in the  procurement process for these services.

Until recently there were limited  tools and guidance available. In our March 2006 report, we found, for  example, that the requirements for agencies and private sector firms to  become shared service providers and the services that they must provide  have not been adequately documented or effectively communicated to  agencies and the private sector. In addition, OMB had not provided shared  service providers with standard document templates needed to minimize  risk, provide assurance, and develop understandings with customers on  topics such as service-level agreements and a concept of operations. We  made a number of recommendations to address these issues, and OMB has  been taking steps to address them. For example, in May 2006, OMB issued  an initial competition framework and draft Migration Planning Guidance  that was circulated to agencies and the public for comment and included  some of this important information.

An effective concept of operations  would describe, at a high level, (1) how all of the various elements of  federal financial systems and mixed systems relate to each other and   (2) how information flows from and through these systems. A concept of  operations would provide a useful tool to explain how financial  management systems at the agency and governmentwide levels can  operate cohesively. It would be geared to a governmentwide solution  rather than individual agency stove-piped efforts. Because the federal  government has lacked such a document, a clear understanding of the  interrelationships among federal financial systems and how the shared  service provider concept fits into this framework has not yet been  achieved.", "Standard business processes are critical to implementing the financial  management line of business and need to be defined and communicated to  all federal agencies. Standard business processes promote consistency and  provide the framework for agencies and shared service providers. OMB  officials recognize that standardization is important and are developing a  standard set of business processes in four areas: funds control, accounts  payable, accounts receivable, and financial reporting. As illustrated  previously in figure 6, OMB is also developing a common accounting code  that may help address some of this lack of standardization. According to  OMB officials, OMB also has other initiatives under way to develop  standard interfaces for feeder systems such as acquisitions. While these  are positive steps, there are numerous other areas where standardization  is important, such as inventory, supplies, and material management as well  as the loan management areas. Absent this standardization, shared service  providers have been designated without common business rules and  potential customer agencies continue to implement and operate individual  stove-piped systems that may require additional work to adopt these  processes.", "To maximize the success of a new system acquisition, organizations need  to consider the redesign of current business processes. As we noted in our  Executive Guide: Creating Value Through World-class Financial  Management, leading finance organizations have found that productivity  gains typically result from more efficient processes, not from simply  automating old processes. In the past, agencies have resisted change and  failed to develop transition plans, reengineer business processes, and limit  customization. Agencies may continue to resist change and this approach  for outsourcing their financial management systems because of the  perceived (1) loss of control of their own data, (2) potential increase in  costs with a decrease in the level of customer service and quality,   (3) inability of providers to meet specific user needs, (4) loss of control to  upgrade the system, and (5) negative effect on an agency\u2019s individual  employees. The shared service provider concept will still require that  agencies address long-standing human capital problems by incorporating  elements of strategic workforce planning such as aligning an  organization\u2019s human capital program with its current and emerging  mission and programmatic goals, and developing long-term strategies for  acquiring, developing, and retaining an organization\u2019s total workforce to  meet the needs of the future.", "A clear migration strategy for implementing the financial management line  of business will be crucial. However, OMB has not articulated a clear and  measurable strategy for achieving this goal. This is important because  there has been a historical tendency for agencies and units within agencies  to prefer internally developed processes and resist standardization. OMB\u2019s  general principle is that agencies should migrate to shared service  providers when it is cost effective to do so and they have maximized the  useful life and investment in the current system, which averages about 5 to  7 years. According to OMB\u2019s draft Migration Planning Guidance, it is  anticipated that within 10 years all agencies will have decided whether to  migrate their technology hosting and application management to a shared  service provider, or will have become a shared service provider  themselves. However, OMB does not plan to establish a specific migration  path or time table for agencies to move to a shared service provider. It is  not clear how this will impact the adoption of this initiative. Given the  pressures to reduce budgets, instilling discipline with respect to following  a clear migration path will be essential. Furthermore, without a clear  migration path, while some agencies may readily migrate to a shared  service provider to minimize the tremendous undertaking of implementing  or significantly upgrading a financial system, other agencies will likely  perpetuate the waste of taxpayer dollars previously described related to  failed system implementation efforts.", "Whether agencies move to a shared service provider or implement their  own systems, they must have disciplined processes (e.g., testing,  requirements management, and risk management) in place to achieve the  intended results within established resources on schedule. Effective  implementation and testing processes are still required to ensure that the  system delivers the desired functionality on time and within budget.  Agencies have frequently struggled to implement key best practices when  implementing commercial off-the-shelf financial management systems and  relied too heavily on JFMIP testing and certification. A standard set of best  practices will be needed to guide the migration from legacy systems to  new systems and shared service providers. The Migration Planning  Guidance is a good first step in stressing the importance of this standard  set of best practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Systems Integration Office Established and Priorities Identified", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with a December 2004 memorandum, JFMIP  responsibilities were realigned and the four JFMIP principals will  continue to meet at their discretion to discuss major financial management  issues.

The revisions to OMB Circular No. A-123  were intended to strengthen the requirements for conducting  management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting at  CFO Act agencies. One major revision requires CFO Act agency  management to annually provide a separate assurance statement on  internal control over financial reporting in its performance and  accountability report, along with a report on identified material  weaknesses and corrective actions.

As we point out in our recent  reporton this issue, because agencies are not uniformly ready for such  audits, specific criteria to ascertain when an agency should initially be  required to obtain an audit opinion on its internal control over financial  reporting are critical to ensuring that the internal control audits fully  contribute to the overarching goal of ongoing improvement in federal  agency internal control and accountability. Additionally, implementing a  multiyear cycle for an opinion on internal control over financial reporting  could assist in mitigating the cost of the requirement while still providing  an effective quality control mechanism for ascertaining that management\u2019s  assessment of its internal control is reliable. Although all of the benefits  associated with obtaining an audit opinion on internal control are not  quantifiable in monetary terms, it is clear that having set criteria as to  when an agency should initially be required to obtain an auditor opinion  on internal control over financial reporting would be a key oversight  mechanism for the Congress and ultimately the U.S. taxpayer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustained and Committed Leadership Is Key to Success for Financial Management Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Sustained leadership will be key to a successful strategy for moving  federal agencies towards consolidated financial management systems and  FFMIA compliance.

A key benefit of  providing positive assurance is that auditors will need to perform  additional audit procedures in order to have a strong basis for definitively  stating whether agencies\u2019 financial management systems substantially  comply with FFMIA\u2019s three requirements. We also reaffirm our other prior  recommendation for OMB to explore further clarification of the definition  of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d in its FFMIA guidance to encourage consistent  reporting among agency auditors. As we have stated in prior reports, the  auditors that we interviewed continue to express concerns about  providing positive assurance in reporting on agency systems\u2019 FFMIA  compliance due to a perceived need for a clearer definition of substantial  compliance.

As in previous years, OMB did not see the necessity of our  recommendation for agency auditors to provide a statement of positive  assurance when reporting agency systems to be in substantial compliance  with the requirements of FFMIA. While OMB commended Labor\u2019s auditors  for performing the additional level of audit work needed to provide  positive assurance of compliance with FFMIA and encouraged similar  efforts at other agencies, OMB stated that requiring a statement of positive  assurance would prove only marginally useful.", "OMB stated that the goals of its various initiatives\u2014the President\u2019s  Management Agenda (PMA), the Financial Management Line of Business  (FMLOB), and the strengthened internal control requirements  incorporated into the revised OMB Circular No. A-123, Management\u2019s  Responsibility for Internal Control\u2014align with the goal of FFMIA to  create the full range of information needed for day-to-day management.

For example, in preparing the PMA scorecard  assessments, OMB officials meet with agencies to discuss a number of  financial management issues and have systems demonstrations. Our  concern is that some of the information provided by this approach does  not come under audit scrutiny and may not be reliable. Similarly, internal  control assessments performed under Circular No. A-123 are based on  management\u2019s judgment and are subject to an opinion-level review by  independent auditors only in limited circumstances. From our perspective,  an opinion by an independent auditor on FFMIA compliance would  confirm whether an agency\u2019s systems substantially met the requirements  of FFMIA and provide additional confidence in the information provided  as a result of the PMA, FMLOB, and Circular No. A-123 initiatives.
