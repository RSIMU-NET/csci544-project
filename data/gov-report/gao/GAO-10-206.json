The Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and states also regulate different aspects of coal mining, including the filling of valley streams, under the Clean Water Act. Under SMCRA, mine operators must provide financial assurances sufficient to allow mines to be reclaimed. Under the Clean Water Act, the Corps may require financial assurances that the impact of mines on streams can be mitigated.

Under SMCRA, states have flexibility to require mine operators to provide a bond for the full cost of reclamation or participate in an alternative bonding system such as a bond pool, which may combine bonds, taxes on coal production, and other sources of funding. West Virginia relies exclusively on an alternative bonding system, while Tennessee exclusively uses a full-cost bonding system. The other two states, Virginia and Kentucky, rely on a combination of full-cost bonds and an alternative bonding system. Under the Clean Water Act, the Corps has discretion to require that mine operators provide assurances that funds will be available to mitigate the effects of burying streams with valley fills but it has not done so in the four states we reviewed. Instead, the Corps has relied on other mechanisms to ensure that mitigation will be completed satisfactorily, according to Corps officials. For example, some Corps officials said they rely on SMCRA financial assurances to ensure required mitigation. OSM, EPA, the Corps, and the four states' mining and environmental agencies are not required to monitor former mountaintop mines with valley fills for long-term environmental degradation after reclamation and mitigation are complete and financial assurances have been released. However, several of them, along with the U.S. Geological Survey, have conducted or funded analyses of conditions near reclaimed mine sites with valley fills that have shown environmental impacts. Specifically, analyses have shown that (1) reforestation efforts at some reclaimed surface coal mine sites needed improvement; (2) surface coal mine sites have contaminated streams and harmed aquatic organisms; (3) valley fills may affect water flow; and (4) mine operators have not always returned mine sites to their approximate original contour when required to do so under SMCRA. Federal and state agencies have taken some actions to respond to these findings, including adopting new guidelines for reforestation practices. Several federal laws may be available under limited circumstances to address long-term environmental problems at former mine sites. These laws include SMCRA; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also commonly known as Superfund; and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. For example, the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA or a state to require a permit if discharges are detected from a former surface mine, and CERCLA may authorize EPA to respond to certain pollution from former surface mines. According to the agencies, they have rarely or never needed to use these authorities. We provided a draft of this report to OSM, the Corps, EPA, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia for review and comment. The federal agencies generally agreed with the report, while the states were critical of what they perceived to be the message of the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Surface mining for coal in the mountainous areas of Appalachia\u2014a  process often referred to as mountaintop mining\u2014has generated  opposition in recent years because of its impact on landscapes, streams,  ecosystems, and communities. In mountaintop mining, before the  underlying coal can be extracted, the land is cleared of forests and other  vegetation. Explosives or other techniques are then used to break up the  overlying solid rock, creating dislodged earth, rock, and other materials  known as \u201cspoil.\u201d Some or most of the spoil is placed back on the mined- out area to return it to its approximate original contour. However, excess  spoil that cannot be safely placed back is often placed as \u201cfill\u201d in adjacent  valleys or hollows. In some cases, this excess fill buries the headwaters of  streams. (See fig. 1 for an example of a valley fill.)", "Mountaintop coal mines that produce valley fills have affected the land  and streams in the central Appalachian states of Kentucky, Tennessee,  Virginia, and West Virginia. According to federal and state estimates, from  1994 through 2003, surface mining had disturbed about 400,000 mostly  forested acres in these states and generated thousands of valley fills.  Furthermore, these valley fills buried 724 miles of headwater streams in  the four states from 1985 through 2001. Another 367 miles of streams in  the Appalachian region are expected to be affected by surface mines that  were approved for permits from October 2001 through June 2005. In  December 2009, we reported on characteristics of mining in the  mountainous areas of Kentucky and West Virginia, including the number  of valley fills approved in those states since 2000. Specifically, we  reported that Kentucky and West Virginia collectively approved nearly  2,000 fills to store at least 4.9 billion cubic yards of excess spoil in nearby  valleys.", "Surface coal mining is regulated by the Surface Mining Control and  Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). SMCRA created the Office of Surface  Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) in the Department of the  Interior to implement and enforce the act.

A state with an approved program is said to have \u201cprimacy\u201d for that  program. OSM has approved state programs for Kentucky, Virginia, and  West Virginia, and annually evaluates how well the state programs are  administered. OSM manages the mining program in Tennessee. One goal  of SMCRA\u2019s, among others, is to assure that mines are reclaimed as  contemporaneously as possible with surface coal mining operations and to  protect the environment from problems\u2014such as water quality  degradation\u2014that may result from mining. SMCRA requires the operator  to provide financial assurance, in the form of a performance bond, in an  amount sufficient to allow the relevant regulatory authority\u2014either OSM  or the state mining agency\u2014to reclaim the mine site if the operator does  not.", "Mountaintop coal mine operators may also be required to obtain permits  under the Clean Water Act. The Department of Defense\u2019s Army Corps of  Engineers (Corps), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state  agencies may all have a role in approving or overseeing permits issued  under the Clean Water Act for certain activities associated with surface  coal mine operations. For example, the Corps has the authority to issue a  permit to a mine operator who seeks to discharge spoil into a stream when  constructing a valley fill, and it may require the operator to compensate  for the loss of the stream through mitigation\u2014actions such as creating a  new stream or enhancing a degraded stream. The Corps also has the  authority to require an operator to provide financial assurances to ensure  a high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation project will be  successfully completed.", "In this context, you asked us to examine (1) the approaches OSM, the  states, and the Corps have taken to obtain financial assurances for surface  coal mines with valley fills; (2) the extent to which federal and state  agencies monitor and evaluate these mines after reclamation and  mitigation are complete; and (3) the federal laws agencies may use, and  have used, to address any latent environmental problems associated with  these mines that may occur after SMCRA or Clean Water Act financial  assurances have expired.", "This report focuses on the four Appalachian states of Kentucky,  Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia because these areas accounted for  nearly 83 percent of the surface coal production in Appalachia in 2008 and  more than 98 percent of recently-approved valley fills across the country.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed relevant federal and state laws,  regulations, and policy guidance on surface coal mining, financial  assurances, reclamation, and mitigation.

The permit process requires operators to submit detailed plans  describing the extent of proposed mining operations, how reclamation on  the mine site will be achieved, and the estimated per-acre cost of  reclamation. In reclaiming the mine site, operators must comply with  regulatory standards that govern, among other things, how the reclaimed  area is regraded, replanting of the site, and the quality of water flowing  from the site. (See app. II for selected details about these key reclamation  standards.) In general, an operator must reclaim the land to a use it was  capable of supporting before mining or an alternative post-mining land use  that the regulatory authority deems higher or better than the pre-mining  land use. Additionally, although the operator is generally required to  redeposit spoil on the mine site so that it approximates the original  contour of the site, the operator may in certain circumstances receive a  variance to this general requirement and leave the land flat or gently  rolling. In addition, a mountaintop removal operation is one that, by  definition, will not restore the area to its approximate original contour.  However, only specific types of post-mining land uses\u2014including  industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, or public uses\u2014are  allowed for mountaintop removal operations.", "SMCRA requires the operator to submit a bond in an amount sufficient to  ensure that adequate funds will be available for the regulatory authority\u2014 either OSM or a state with primacy\u2014to complete the reclamation if the  operator does not do so. The bond provisions of SMCRA apply generally  to all types of coal mines and do not include any requirements that are  specific to mines with valley fills. However, the bond amount for a  particular site cannot be less than $10,000 and must also be sufficient to  ensure the completion of the reclamation plan for that particular site if the  work had to be completed by the regulatory authority in the event of  forfeiture. In this report, we refer to a bond that is equal to the expected  cost to reclaim the entire site as a \u201cfull-cost bond.\u201d OSM has prepared  guidance for mine operators on how to calculate their bond amounts to  capture the likely costs of reclamation. Bond amounts can be adjusted as  the size of the permit area or the projected cost of reclamation changes.  When all reclamation standards identified in SMCRA and the operator\u2019s  permit\u2014including compliance with water quality standards\u2014have been  met, the bond is completely \u201creleased\u201d to the operator.", "The OSM regulations implementing SMCRA recognize three major types of  bonds: corporate surety bonds, collateral bonds, and self-bonds.", "A surety bond is a bond in which a surety company guarantees the  performance of the permittee\u2019s obligation to reclaim the mine site. If the  mining company does not reclaim the site, the surety company must pay  the bond amount to the regulatory authority or the regulatory authority  may allow the surety company to perform the reclamation instead of  paying the bond amount.", "Collateral bonds include cash; certificates of deposit; liens on real estate;  letters of credit; federal, state, or municipal bonds; and investment-grade  securities deposited directly with the regulatory authority.", "A self-bond is a bond in which the permittee guarantees its own  performance with or without separate surety. Self-bonds are available only  to operators who meet certain financial conditions. To remain qualified for  self-bonding, operators must, among other requirements, maintain a net  worth of at least $10 million, possess fixed assets in the United States of at  least $20 million, and have an \u201cA\u201d or higher bond rating.", "SMCRA also authorizes states to enact an OSM-approved alternative to a  full-cost bonding system as long the alternative achieves the same  objectives. One kind of alternative bonding system is known as a \u201cbond  pool.\u201d Under this type of system, the operator may post a bond\u2014e.g., a  surety bond or collateral bond\u2014for an amount determined by multiplying  the number of acres in the permit area by a per-acre assessment. The per- acre assessment may vary depending on the site-specific characteristics of  the planned mining operation and the operator\u2019s history of compliance  with state regulations. However, the per-acre bond amount may be less  than the estimated cost of reclamation. To supplement the per-acre bond,  the operator generally must pay a fee for each ton of mined coal and may  also be required to pay other types of fees. Funds are placed within a pool  and can be used to reclaim sites that participants in the alternative  bonding system do not reclaim. Under OSM regulations, all alternative  bonding systems must provide a substantial economic incentive for the  operator to comply with reclamation requirements and must ensure that  the regulatory authority has adequate resources to complete the  reclamation plan for any sites that may be in default at any time.", "Once bonds have been completely released to a mine operator, the  relevant regulatory authority may terminate its jurisdiction under  SMCRA. However, the regulatory authority may also revoke an operator\u2019s  permit if the operator fails to comply with the permit\u2019s provisions. Under  those circumstances, the operator may forfeit the bond to the regulatory  authority. The regulatory authority then becomes responsible for  reclaiming the land to the reclamation standards found in the operator\u2019s  permit. If the amount forfeited is insufficient to pay for the full cost of  reclamation, the operator remains liable for remaining costs. The  regulatory authority may complete reclamation and may sue the operator  to recover additional expenses. Failure to complete reclamation has other  serious consequences for mine operators\u2014SMCRA prohibits applicants  from obtaining future SMCRA permits if they have unabated violations of  law or regulations applicable to surface mining; state regulations  specifically note that bond forfeitures based on violations that are not  subsequently corrected disqualify operators from obtaining future permits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clean Water Act Provisions Also Regulate Aspects of Surface Coal Mining Operations", "paragraphs": ["The objective of the Clean Water Act is to restore and maintain the  chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters. Section  404 of the act allows the Corps to issue permits for the discharge of  material, including fill material, into waters of the United States at  specified disposal sites. Such permits are needed for the construction of a  valley fill. Section 404(c) authorizes EPA to deny or restrict the use of any  disposal site where it finds that the discharge will have unacceptable  adverse effects. Mining companies may be able to construct valley fills  under one of two types of permits issued by the Corps. First, the mining  company may be authorized to construct a valley fill under the Corps\u2019  \u201cnationwide permit\u201d for surface coal mining. A nationwide permit  provides coverage for substantially similar activities that are expected to  cause only minimal adverse environmental effects on an individual and  cumulative basis. Second, the Corps may issue an \u201cindividual permit.\u201d  Individual permits are issued on a case-by-case basis for activities that are  expected to have more than a minimal impact. Before issuing an individual  permit, the Corps must evaluate the operator\u2019s proposed activity for  several factors, including, but not limited to, its effects on environmental  values\u2014such as fish, wildlife, and water quality\u2014and safety issues, as well  as any proposed mitigation for the project.", "Under guidelines prepared by the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of  the Army acting through the Chief of Engineers, pursuant to section 404,  the Corps may issue permits to discharge fill material, if, at a minimum,  compliance with the guidelines is demonstrated. One aspect of compliance  is that the discharge does not cause or contribute to \u201csignificant  degradation\u201d of waters of the United States. Under these guidelines, an  operator would not be permitted to discharge fill materials into waters of  the United States if there is a practicable alternative to such a discharge  and would be required to minimize discharges that cannot be avoided. If  such discharges are unavoidable, the Corps can require as a condition of  the permit that the operator compensate for the loss or degradation of  regulated waters. In the case of valley fills that bury streams, such  compensatory mitigation could involve (1) creating a new stream, (2)  enhancing a degraded stream, or (3) preserving an existing stream. The  mitigation work may be done within the permitted area (on-site) or  outside of the permitted area (off-site). Mitigation may be performed by  the mine operator or a third party, such as a public or nonprofit entity,  under agreement with the Corps.", "The Corps\u2019 Clean Water Act implementing regulations and related policies  authorize the Corps\u2019 district engineers to require financial assurances  when approving section 404 permits in order to ensure a high level of  confidence that compensatory mitigation will be successfully completed.  The Corps allows financial assurances to be in the form of bonds, escrow  accounts, casualty insurance, letters of credit, legislative appropriations  for government sponsored projects, or other appropriate instruments,  subject to the approval of the district engineer. If assurances are required,  district engineers are to determine the amount based on factors such as  the size and complexity of the compensatory mitigation project, the  likelihood of success, the past performance of the project sponsor, and  any other factors they deem appropriate. Also, Corps district engineers  must release financial assurances once they determine that the operator  has demonstrated that a compensatory mitigation project has successfully  met its performance standards. Typically, the monitoring period to assess  the success of a compensatory mitigation project is 5 years but this period  may be extended for projects that take longer, such as stream restoration.", "The Corps\u2019 authority to require financial assurances to ensure  compensatory mitigation differs from the authority that mining agencies  have under SMCRA to require bonds for mine reclamation.", "While SMCRA explicitly calls for mining agencies to require all operators  to provide bonds, the Corps\u2019 Clean Water Act regulations authorize district  engineers to decide whether financial assurances are necessary on a  permit-by-permit basis. The district engineer may determine that financial  assurances are not necessary for a specific project if an alternate  mechanism is available to ensure a high level of confidence that the  compensatory mitigation will be provided and maintained.", "While SMCRA authorizes mining agencies to directly hold and use  financial assurances to ensure the required reclamation is completed if the  operator defaults on its reclamation obligations, the Corps does not have  statutory authority under the Clean Water Act to do so. In light of that  limitation, the Corps\u2019 regulations and policies stipulate that if a district  engineer does choose to require financial assurances, those assurances  must be payable to a third party\u2014such as a governmental or  nongovernmental environmental management organization\u2014that will  agree to hold the funds and complete the mitigation in accordance with  the Corps\u2019 instructions if the operator defaults on its obligations.", "In addition to needing a Clean Water Act section 404 permit to construct a  valley fill, mine operators need to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System, or section 402, permit if they discharge pollutants  from industrial point sources. Point sources are discrete conveyances  such as pipes. Section 402 permits, generally administered by the states  under EPA-approved programs, include limits on the amount of  pollutants\u2014such as suspended solids\u2014that mines can directly discharge  into bodies of water. Surface coal mines contain sediment ponds and  drainage ditches that collect runoff from all disturbed areas, including  water from the base or perimeter of valley fills or other locations that may  then flow into a stream. These flows may need to comply with point  source pollutant limitations specified in a section 402 permit. Section 402  permits also require that mine operators submit periodic discharge  monitoring reports to the regulatory authority, which is typically a state  agency.

According to EPA officials, a point source at a mining site could be, for  example, a ditch draining a sediment pond at the base of a valley fill. Mine  operators typically remove such point sources prior to receiving full bond  release. However, in some circumstances, sediment ponds and associated  drainage ditches may be authorized to remain on site if provisions for  ongoing maintenance of the pond are made.

States may be able to use information on impaired waters to  indirectly mitigate latent pollution associated with former surface coal  mine sites. Specifically, if the state determines that a water body is  impaired, it must eventually develop, for each pollutant causing an  impairment, a TMDL\u2014the amount of the pollutant that the water body can  receive, taking into account seasonal variations and a margin of safety,  and still meet the water quality standard applicable to that body of water.  To implement a TMDL, states allocate pollutant loadings among specific  sources, such as mines, and incorporate the loads into the state\u2019s water  quality management plans and section 402 permits. Thus, if a proposed  mine would cause a body of water to exceed its TMDL for a given  pollutant, the state may, among other things, impose stricter discharge  limits in that site\u2019s section 402 permit in order to achieve water quality  standards.

The Department of Defense said that, in general, it  believed the report is informative and provides a good discussion of the  issues involved in financial assurances for surface coal mining in  Appalachia.  The Environmental Protection Agency noted that the report  provides a factual presentation of issues associated with the review and  regulation of surface coal mining practices. The agency also noted that the  data presented in this and a December 2009 GAO report provide helpful  context for federal and state agencies as they continue to work together to  address both the near- and long-term consequences of surface coal mining  activities on the environment, water quality, and Appalachian coalfield  communities.", "The three state agencies\u2019 comments were critical of the draft report. For  example, Kentucky commented that it believed the report is overly broad  in its generalized statements, that terms and phrases are used  interchangeably so as to confuse the issues, and that the report is written  in a manner to misrepresent and sensationalize the issues. We do not agree  that the report misrepresents or sensationalizes the issues, and have  reviewed our use of terms\u2014such as mountaintop mining, mountaintop  removal mining, valley fills, and hollow fills\u2014to ensure that they are used  consistently and appropriately throughout the report.", "Virginia commented that the report appears to be based on an assumption  that there are post-bond release pollution discharges below valley fills, and  that it was concerned with our use of an EPA study (by Pond, Passmore, et  al.) to support the point that such discharges may occur. The state also  noted that pollution problems that may occur are likely to be site-specific.  We disagree with Virginia\u2019s characterization of our report because we did  not assume that there are post-bond release pollution discharges below  valley fills. In fact, our report notes that there is little monitoring of sites  after bond release, thereby making it difficult to assess post-bond release  conditions. Nevertheless, we recognize in the report that there is some  evidence, including in the EPA study, that such problems may occur. We  agree that problems, if they occur, are likely to be site-specific.", "West Virginia noted that all coal mines\u2014not just Appalachian mines with  valley fills\u2014are subject to SMCRA and the Clean Water Act. The state also  commented that the report seemed to imply that there is a bonding or  financial assurance problem in the four Appalachian states we reviewed  and that surface coal mines with valley fills are the only mines that have  the potential to cause environmental harm. West Virginia also commented  that the report implied that the monitoring period before bond release  should be longer. While we recognize that other types of coal mining are  subject to these laws and may affect the environment, our report focused  on surface coal mining with valley fills.  The four states we reviewed have  more than 98 percent of the recently approved valley fills across the  country. In addition, our report contained no conclusions about the  adequacy of the bonding programs in the four states or the length of the  monitoring period; instead, we attempted to present information on the  requirements of the relevant laws. Although West Virginia commented that  the report did not give full credit to the state for improvements it has made  in reforestation, approximate original contour, and surface water runoff  practices, it did not provide any additional information to support these  statements. The report does provide information on actions taken by the  state in these areas.", "We present the agencies\u2019 letters containing their general comments, along  with our responses to them, as necessary, in appendixes III through VIII.  The agencies, with the exception of EPA, also provided technical  comments that we incorporated into the report, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution for 30 days from the  report date.

The data on coal production is from the Energy Information  Administration and can be found at  http://www.eis.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/arc/table1.html. The data on valley  fills are based on permits approved from October 1, 2001, through June 30,  2005, as reported in Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining  Reclamation and Enforcement, Environmental Impact Statement:  Proposed Revisions to the Permanent Program Regulations  Implementing the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977  Concerning the Creation and Disposal of Excess Spoil and Coal Mine  Waste and Stream Buffer Zones, OSM-EIS-34 (2008). We also gathered  background data on valley fills approved in the four states from January 1,  2000, through various dates in mid-2008 to mid-2009. The data from  Kentucky and West Virginia are drawn from GAO-10-21, Surface Coal  Mining: Characteristics of Mining in Mountainous Areas of Kentucky  and West Virginia. Neither Virginia nor Tennessee maintained valley fill  data in electronic form.  State officials provided fill data for Virginia and  OSM officials provided fill data for Tennessee by reviewing hardcopy  permits issued since 2000. We interviewed state and OSM officials about  the reliability of the data they provided and compared their results to  OSM\u2019s 2008 environmental impact statement on excess spoil and stream  buffer zones. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To address each of the objectives, we obtained documents from and  interviewed officials at several federal and state agencies. These included  officials in the Department of the Interior\u2019s OSM in (1) headquarters; (2)  Appalachian Regional Office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and (3) field  offices in Lexington, Kentucky; Knoxville, Tennessee; Charleston, West  Virginia; and Big Stone Gap, Virginia. The OSM field office in Knoxville  manages the mining program in Tennessee. We also interviewed and  obtained information from officials in the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) headquarters and regional offices in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania (Region 3) and Atlanta, Georgia (Region 4); officials in the  U.S. Geological Survey; and officials in the Corps of Engineers  headquarters and district offices in Louisville, Kentucky; Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania; Nashville, Tennessee; Norfolk, Virginia, and Huntington,  West Virginia. Those five district offices are responsible for issuing and  enforcing the Clean Water Act section 404 permits to surface mines in the  states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Moreover, we  interviewed and obtained information from the following state agencies in  the four states we reviewed: the Kentucky Department for Natural  Resources; Kentucky Division of Water; Tennessee Department of  Environment and Conservation; Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals  and Energy; Virginia Department of Environmental Quality; and West  Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.", "To describe the approaches OSM, the states, and the Corps have taken to  obtain financial assurances for surface coal mines with valley fills, we  reviewed relevant sections of SMCRA and OSM\u2019s implementing regulations  and policy guidance to identify national requirements for financial  assurances associated with surface mining reclamation. We also reviewed  state mining laws in the three states that have primacy for administering  SMCRA\u2014Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia\u2014as well as those states\u2019  mining agency implementing regulations and policy guidance, to identify  the states\u2019 approaches to financial assurances for surface mining  reclamation established in accordance with the federal standards. We also  spoke with officials from OSM headquarters, the Appalachian Regional  Office, and field offices, as well as officials from the state mining agencies  in Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. We spoke with officials from the  OSM field office in Knoxville to discuss financial assurances in Tennessee  because these officials manage the mining program in that state. We also  reviewed section 404 of the Clean Water Act and the Corps\u2019 implementing  regulations and policy guidance to identify requirements and policy for  financial assurances associated with compensatory mitigation projects. In  addition, we contacted Corps officials in the headquarters and the five  district offices to identify the extent to which the Corps has included  financial assurance requirements in permits it has issued to surface mines  for valley fills. We also interviewed officials from the EPA to identify their  role and responsibility for overseeing section 404 permits.", "To examine the extent to which federal and state agencies monitor and  evaluate surface coal mines with valley fills after reclamation and  mitigation are complete, we obtained information from and interviewed  officials in OSM\u2019s Appalachian Regional Office and field offices, as well as  state officials at the mining agencies in Kentucky, Virginia, and West  Virginia to identify any routine monitoring and \u201cone-time\u201d evaluations that  these agencies have done of mine sites to assess the long-term  environmental impact of the reclamation after the SMCRA reclamation  bonds have been released. We also interviewed and obtained information  from officials in the Corps\u2019 five district offices to identify any routine  monitoring the Corps has done of mitigation projects after determining  that operators have completed their mitigation obligations or any specific  studies of completed surface coal mine mitigation projects. In addition, we  interviewed and obtained information from officials in EPA\u2019s Office of  Water in headquarters and regions 3 and 4; the U.S. Geological Survey; and  state water quality regulators in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West  Virginia regarding any monitoring or evaluation of the long-term  environmental impact of former surface mines with valley fills. Among the  11 federal and state agencies that we interviewed, none replied that they  had done routine monitoring of this nature, and most replied that they had  not done any \u201cone-time\u201d studies. The few agencies that replied they had  done one-time studies referred us primarily to studies completed as part of  the 2003 draft multiagency programmatic environmental impact statement  (PEIS). OSM\u2019s 2008 final environmental impact statement on proposed  regulations for excess spoil management also generally cited the 2003  draft PEIS as a source of information on the environmental impacts of  valley fills. The federal and state agencies that collaborated on the draft  PEIS conducted or funded more than 30 studies of the impacts of  mountaintop mining and associated valley fills and used them as support  for evaluating the impacts of various programmatic alternatives. With  these facts in mind, we relied heavily on the conclusions that the authors  of the draft PEIS drew concerning a number of environmental impacts,  including reforestation, water quality and impacts on aquatic organisms,  and water flow. We also cited more recent studies provided to us by  agency officials, such as a 2008 study by EPA Region 3 on water quality  and aquatic organisms near valley fills. Also, during the course of our  review, we learned from OSM officials about OSM\u2019s evaluation of mine  operators\u2019 compliance with approximate original contour policies in  Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. We reported the results of those  evaluations because of their relevance to the construction of valley fills.", "To examine the federal laws agencies may use, and have used, to address  any latent environmental problems associated with surface mines with  valley fills that may occur after SMCRA or Clean Water Act financial  assurances have expired, we analyzed SMCRA and the Clean Water Act  and identified provisions that provide mining agencies and water quality  regulators authority to address environmental problems on a former mine  site after SCMRA bonds have been released. We also interviewed officials  from OSM, state mining agencies, and state water quality regulators in the  four states we reviewed to learn the extent to which these authorities have  been used in the past to address any environmental problems that may  have occurred on or caused by a former mine site with valley fills. In  addition, we analyzed two other federal environmental laws\u2014the  Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act  (CERCLA, also known as Superfund) and the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act (RCRA)\u2014to identify provisions that may authorize or  require EPA to address environmental problems that may occur on or be  caused by a former surface mine after bonds have been released. We  interviewed officials from EPA\u2019s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency  Response to learn if CERCLA had been used in the past in that context. We  also we reviewed an EPA regulatory determination published in 2000 on  whether regulation of coal combustion residue was warranted under the  hazardous substance provisions of RCRA.", "We conducted this engagement from October 2008 to January 2010 in  accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that  are relevant to our objectives.

We do not agree that the report misrepresents or sensationalizes the  issues; however, we do agree that it is important to be accurate and  use correct terminology. Throughout the report we have strived to be  accurate and have been careful to consistently and accurately use  terms and phrases that are commonly used in regulation or the coal  mining literature. In its comment, the state did not provide specific  examples of what it believes are inaccurate facts or inappropriate  terms.  However, subsequent comments from the state referred to our  use of the terms mountaintop mining, mountaintop removal mining,  valley fills, and hollow fills.  We have reviewed our use of these terms  throughout the report to ensure that they are used consistently and  appropriately.  2.  The state is referring to our practice of holding \u201cexit conferences\u201d near  the end of our review. Our policy is to provide the agencies with  relevant program responsibilities\u2014typically federal agencies but in  this case a state agency\u2014with excerpted material from the draft  report. We call this document a \u201cstatement of facts.\u201d The purpose of  the exit conference is to obtain the agency\u2019s input regarding the  accuracy of the facts presented. The purpose is not to obtain  comments on the entire draft report; that step comes later in the  process. Therefore, the statement of facts that we sent to Kentucky  contained information describing laws, policies, and conditions that  pertained directly to the state. We understand that agencies are likely  to have additional comments on the full draft report\u2014as Kentucky did  in this instance\u2014but also believe that our process of holding exit  conferences to discuss the statement of facts followed by a request for  formal comments on the full report is a transparent one. 3.  We understand that Kentucky\u2019s regulations define both hollow fills and  valley fills, but not all states make this distinction in practice. Federal  and state regulations identify different types of fills, including valley  fills, head-of-hollow fills, and durable rock fills. These definitions differ  in their characteristics, including placement, slope, and material  composition. For ease of reading, we refer to all types of fills as valley  fills in this report. The term valley fill is not meant to indicate the size  of a particular fill or the type of stream affected\u2014ephemeral,  intermittent, or perennial. 4.  We agree with the state\u2019s specific comment and have clarified the  report accordingly. In our discussion of post-mining land use  requirements, we are referring specifically to mountaintop removal,  one type of mountaintop mining. For further clarity, we have added a  footnote that compares the requirements for mountaintop removal to  those for steep slope mining, another kind of mountaintop mining.  Throughout the rest of the report, however, we continue to use the  term mountaintop mining to refer generally to all types of coal mining  in mountainous areas. This usage is consistent with our previous  report mentioned by the state (GAO-10-21) that was also recently  reviewed by state officials. This usage is also consistent with the  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) 2003 draft Programmatic  Environmental Impact Statement on Mountaintop Mining/Valley Fills  in Appalachia.  5.  We agree that not all fills approved are ultimately constructed, and  make that point in the report. However, we do not believe that our  report overstates the miles of buried streams and did not modify the  report in response to this comment. The sources for the data that we  include in the report are the 2003 draft Programmatic Environmental  Impact Statement on mountaintop mining and valley fills and the  Office of Surface Mining\u2019s 2008 final environmental impact statement  on excess spoil and the stream buffer zone.  For example, the 2003  draft statement reported that 724 miles of streams were \u201cdirectly  impacted by valley fills (i.e., covered by fill).\u201d  6.  We disagree with the comment. While we understand that some state  regulations require termination of jurisdiction at bond release, the  federal regulations only state that the relevant regulatory authority  may terminate its jurisdiction under the Surface Mining Control and  Reclamation Act (SMCRA) at bond release. Therefore, we have not  revised the report in response to the comment. 7.  We disagree with the comment.  SMCRA does not specifically prohibit  applicants from obtaining future SMCRA permits if they have previous  bond forfeitures. SMCRA generally prohibits applicants from obtaining  future permits if they have unabated violations. However, in response  to the comment, we have added detail on the state regulations, which  do specifically note that bond forfeiture based on violations that are  not subsequently corrected disqualify operators from obtaining future  permits. 8.  We did not modify the report in response to this comment because the  background section of the report does include data on the differences  in recent surface coal mine production in the four states. Specifically,  the report notes that Kentucky produced about 51 million tons while  Tennessee produced less than 2 million tons in 2008.  9.  This paragraph summarizes the section that follows, and we do not  agree that an editorial change is needed. We believe that our  description of the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 practices is accurate on  the basis of information obtained from that agency.  10. The citations on which the findings are based are provided later in the  body of the report. We did not add citations to this summary  paragraph. However, we have deleted the word \u201ctentative\u201d from our  discussion of impacts on water flows. We believe that the documents  we cite, along with comments we received from the Department of the  Interior, support our characterization in the final draft of the report. 11. We do not agree that the EPA statements are largely editorial and  made no change to them. We believe that the EPA and U.S. Geological  Survey statements on inadequate monitoring are as germane to the  purpose of the report as the statements from state agency officials,  who believe monitoring is adequate. 12. We have clarified the footnote to indicate that the mix of amphibian  and reptile populations was affected by the presence of mining. 13. We have not modified our characterization of the West Virginia Flood  Advisory Technical Task Force report because we believe it is an  accurate summary of the task force report. However, we have  modified the report to include Kentucky\u2019s comment on its regulations  related to flood analysis and avoidance. 14.

We agree that  the contamination may not necessarily have been post-bond release,  and we agree that contamination problems are likely to be site  specific, when they occur. We did not revise the report in response to  this comment. 2.  The focus of this report was surface coal mining and not all activities  that may affect water quality. Therefore, while we agree that other land  disturbing activities may affect water quality in watersheds with  mining, we have not included a discussion of those activities. 3.  Points relating to hydrologic balance, such as effluent limitations, are  discussed throughout the report in general terms and more specifically  in Appendix II. We have added more detail on hydrologic balance  requirements to Appendix II in response to this comment. This  material is included in the appendix because, while we understand that  adherence to regulations designed to protect the hydrologic balance of  the mine site during the mining operation may help to minimize water  quality issues after bond release, we were asked to discuss  mechanisms available to address environmental problems after bond  release, when the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act\u2019s  hydrologic balance requirements would no longer apply. 4.  We have not modified the report in response to the state\u2019s comment  because we did not analyze the use of passive wetlands, or other  methods, for treating water after bond release.  5.  The state is correct that the 2003 draft programmatic environmental  impact statement was finalized in October 2005, and we have revised  footnote 2 to make that clear. The final version of the statement  incorporated the 2003 draft statement by reference. However, the 2005  final statement did not contain all of the material found in the draft  statement. For example, studies of the impacts of mountaintop mining  were in the appendixes of the 2003 draft, but not the 2005 final  statement.
