ASD is a group of complex developmental disorders characterized by difficulties with social interactions, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Districts provided these services as part of the planning for the transition to adulthood required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Fewer, though still a majority of, districts reported providing certain types of employment-related supports. For example, GAO estimates that 69 percent provided work experiences and 63 percent provided job coaching. While the majority of districts reported providing transition services to students with ASD, the services provided varied by factors such as the size and poverty level of the district, according to GAO's analysis of survey responses.", "Youth with ASD face key challenges transitioning from high school to adulthood, such as untimely transition planning by school districts, complex adult service systems, and lack of job opportunities, according to stakeholders. IDEA requires districts to begin providing transition services when students with disabilities reach age 16, with the option to start earlier. However, according to GAO's prior work and stakeholders GAO interviewed, providing discretion in this area may not serve some students well. School officials, advocates, and others report that earlier transition planning\u2014with age 14 commonly cited\u2014can have multiple benefits such as allowing more time to obtain important work and academic experiences; however, the Department of Education (Education) is not funding research on the appropriate age to begin transition planning. Unless Education, which administers IDEA, examines the merits of earlier transition planning, policymakers may not have critical information when considering changes to IDEA. Currently, about 32 percent of districts begin transition planning when students are older than age 14, according to GAO's analysis of survey responses.", "While the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) has facilitated collaboration across its member agencies, including Education, to support research for transition-age youth with ASD, it has missed opportunities to collaborate with relevant nonmember agencies. Specifically, the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2014 calls for the IACC to include in its strategic plan, as practicable, services for individuals with ASD. However, HHS has not regularly engaged certain federal agencies that provide services or financial assistance to transition-age youth with ASD, but are not IACC members, such as the Departments of Labor and Housing and Urban Development. These agencies are not part of working groups tasked with updating the current strategic plan nor has HHS invited them to join the IACC. As a result, IACC may continue to miss opportunities to leverage the knowledge of other agencies\u2014a leading practice for effective federal interagency collaboration\u2014as it works to fulfill its expanded responsibilities under the Act and improve the well-being of individuals with ASD."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to federal agencies, including one to Education to examine the merits and implications of amending IDEA to require earlier transition planning and one to HHS to enhance collaboration with non-IACC member agencies.

We selected these states to highlight a  mix of local areas with adult providers specifically involved with initiatives  to serve individuals with autism and those that are not, as well as a mix of  rural, suburban, and urban localities, and geographic dispersion. In two of  these states (Arizona and New Jersey), we conducted site visits and  phone interviews with local and state entities. As part of these local  interviews, we held five discussion groups with youth with ASD and family  members of youth with ASD who had exited high school within the last 5  years, and we conducted interviews with officials of school districts and  staff from postsecondary education institutions. We also met with public  high school special education teachers and multiple adult service  providers in each state. At the state level, we conducted interviews by  phone with representatives of state special education, developmental  disabilities, vocational rehabilitation, as well as behavioral health services  agencies. We also interviewed representatives of university centers of  excellence, parent training and information centers, the state  developmental disabilities council, and state disability advocacy  organizations. To gather additional information on service provision after  high school, we conducted phone interviews in South Carolina with adult  service providers and state agencies.

Education officials also stated they considered age 14 too early for some  middle school age students to begin transition planning because students  may lack the experience and educational development to make decisions  about future life choices.", "However, providing discretion in this area may not serve some students  well, according to stakeholders we interviewed. Based on our nationally  generalizable sample of public school districts, we identified at least 29  states that had one or more school districts that do not start transition  planning until the age of 16 or older. Our prior work and stakeholders  we interviewed also reported that starting transition planning at age 16  may be too late. For example, by age 16, students with ASD may be in  their junior year of high school, and many students interested in college  need to be positioning themselves to meet college admissions  requirements before that point. Consistent with findings from our school  district survey, an official from an organization representing school district  officials stated that it is good practice to begin conversations about  transition at or before the beginning of high school, to ensure that  students secure the coursework needed to meet graduation and other  requirements, and that most districts already do so. In addition, research  has shown that some of the most typically at-risk students\u2014low-income  youth and African-American youth\u2014receive transition planning later than  other youth. Although Education funds research on transition planning  for students with disabilities, Education currently does not fund research  evaluating the appropriate age to begin transition planning.", "Education guidance specifically identifies taking an appropriate  preparatory curriculum in high school as critical for success in  postsecondary education, stating that students with disabilities need to  make high school curriculum choices that support the goal of  postsecondary education. Early planning also allows more time to ensure  that youth obtain the work, community, and academic experiences  needed to successfully transition to adult life. For example, one district  reported that it lowered its transition planning age to 14 so that youth had  more time to gain valuable work experience by sampling different types of  jobs in the community. Further, lowering the IDEA transition age could  expose students to employment-related services sooner because  transition services and pre-employment transition services through the  VR program are provided to students with disabilities using the IDEA  transition age requirements.", "The 2004 IDEA reauthorization increased the age of the transition  services requirement for students with ASD, as well as for youth with  other disabilities, from age 14 to age 16. The legislative history of the  2004 reauthorization of IDEA does not fully explain why this change was  made. During the 2006 public comment period for the current IDEA  regulations on transition services, many commenters disagreed with  changing the transition age from 14 to 16, and a few specifically  requested that Education consider beginning transition services before  age 16. In 2013, public commenters responding to the Federal Partners  in Transition\u2019s (FPT) national online dialogue identified lowering the  transition age as a top idea for addressing regulatory or legislative  barriers for youth. The Advisory Committee on Increasing Competitive  Integrated Employment for Individuals with Disabilities, which was  established to help advance competitive employment opportunities for  individuals with intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, or other  significant disabilities, also recommended that Congress amend IDEA to  lower the transition age for all students with significant disabilities to begin  at 14 or earlier. Panelists we spoke to for our prior work also suggested  that transition planning should start earlier\u2014as early as middle school\u2014 and cited research noting that any gaps or loss of services during the  transition from a school-based support system to adulthood could have  long-lasting detrimental effects on youths\u2019 health, employment,  educational attainment, and family stability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Families, Service Providers, and Advocates Reported That Adult Systems and Services Are Often Difficult to Navigate and Access Navigating Service Systems", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders, including parents, service providers, and advocates, cited  challenges in navigating the transition from the public school system to  adult service systems and accessing needed services.", "According to parents and other stakeholder, youth with disabilities,  including those with ASD, and their families often face challenges  navigating the complex adult service systems after exiting from school,  which is consistent with our prior work (see fig. 6). For example, about  70 percent of school districts surveyed identified \u201clack of assistance  navigating the (adult) service systems\u201d as a challenge for youth with ASD  trying to obtain needed services and supports once they leave high  school. Further, many district officials and teachers we interviewed  expressed doubts that students with ASD would be able to obtain the  necessary services and supports outlined in their final transition plan after  they exit the school system.", "Stakeholders and parents in two of our five discussion groups reported  that parents often are not aware of, or do not know how to access, the  adult services available to them after exiting the school system. As one  provider and parents we spoke with explained, parents of young adults  with ASD may not have the time or knowledge needed to successfully  navigate the multiple adult care agencies and paperwork, due to other  responsibilities such as full-time jobs or additional children. Parents and  family members in all five discussion groups described some of these  difficulties navigating adult systems. For example, in one discussion  group, a parent of a young adult reported that she had to work with nine  different state agencies to obtain needed services, including housing and  behavioral management services, and she only learned how to do so by  speaking with other parents and following email listservs. In another  discussion group, a family member reported that her sister was assigned  to at least three service coordinators from the state developmental  disabilities agency before receiving a coordinator who was willing to  research and follow up on services that aligned with her needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Access and Availability of Adult Services", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the challenge of navigating a complex system of services,  parents, providers, and experts we interviewed described the challenge of  access and availability of adult services, which affect the ability of youth  with ASD to attain their goals for adulthood. Specific concerns we heard  include: waiting lists for services, lack of service options available, lack of  trained providers, and cost of services.", "Waiting lists. Developmental disabilities councils in all three states in our  review cited waiting lists as a challenge to receiving services. Specifically,  South Carolina and New Jersey had waiting lists for at least some  developmental disabilities services, and Arizona had a waiting list for VR  services. According to an Arizona official, the state groups individuals on  the list using three \u201cpriority groups\u201d; however, two of the three groups  have been effectively closed since 2009 because of resource  constraints. In South Carolina, state officials reported that individuals  will likely face a waiting list once they are determined eligible for  developmental disabilities services. While waiting lists in this state are  operated on a first come first serve basis, officials estimated that  individuals can wait up to 3 years to receive services. Youth with ASD  who exit the school system and then go without services for a period of  time may experience detrimental effects in the future, such as losing  progress made on skill development, according to stakeholders and our  recent work. Parents in four of five discussion groups also reported  waiting lists for housing. One parent reported that there is currently a 10-  to 12-year wait for supportive housing. Parents in our discussion groups  noted that the lack of housing options in general was particularly  concerning since parents may become unable, either through aging or  poor health, to care for their children with autism.", "Lack of service options. While there are multiple adult service systems  available, parents in discussion groups, multiple providers, and our recent  work cited lack of service options available to young adults with ASD and  their families. Family members in one discussion group reported that  adult service programs sometimes combine groups with very different  needs\u2014that is, by serving low-needs and high-needs individuals at the  same time\u2014which could be challenging for both groups, or they combine  a wide range of ages together for services. In addition, a lack of providers  can limit service options in rural areas. For example, in South Carolina, a  hospital closure in a rural area meant that individuals had to travel further  to get health care, and in some parts of the state there is only one state  developmental disabilities provider available. Our recent work also  highlighted the need for youth with autism to receive timely access to  services and supports, including having enough service providers to meet  the demand. Further, as roundtable panelists in our recent work also  noted, girls and minority students are diagnosed with ASD at a later age  than other youth, on average, which could delay needed services while in  school. A lack of service options may be a challenge for transition-age  youth with disabilities more broadly\u2014in 2015, the FPT highlighted as a  policy priority the need to expand service opportunities, such as  internships and other training options, for transition-age youth with  disabilities.", "Lack of trained providers. According to multiple adult service providers  and parents, there are few providers trained to work with young adults  with ASD. As one health provider explained, doctors may not receive  training, in medical school or otherwise, on how to correctly interpret and  manage potentially disruptive behaviors in an adult patient with ASD  during an exam, including proper use of sedation as needed. Further, in  2015 the FPT identified supporting professional development for service  providers, including job coaches and health care providers, as a policy  priority to improve transition outcomes for youth with disabilities seeking  competitive employment. In 2016, the federal Advisory Committee on  Increasing Competitive Integrated Employment for Individuals with  Disabilities also reported that service providers needed more training to  support individuals with significant disabilities seeking competitive  employment.", "Similarly, in our review, multiple advocates and providers reported that  vocational and other service providers need more training on how to work  with young adults with ASD. Providers, as well as a state VR official and  an advocacy group, also noted that VR counselors may have a  disincentive to learn how to work with individuals with ASD because these  young adults may need more assistance to attain and sustain  employment. Multiple providers also reported difficulties with retaining  staff, at times due to low rates of state payments for providers\u2019 services,  which can contribute to lower staff salaries overall. Our recent work also  noted that youth with autism may have difficulty developing new  relationships with service providers and can be negatively affected by  high turnover rates.", "Cost of services. Parents of young adults with ASD and providers also  reported that the cost of services can be a challenge as youth transition to  adult life. For example, a rural provider reported that youth may wait 6 to  18 months to receive a diagnosis, a qualifying requirement for that state\u2019s  developmental disabilities services, and teachers in one district observed  that some families pay as much as $6,000 to have an examination for the  diagnosis. Because autism is highly individualized, young adults with ASD  frequently require an individualized program of services that can be  expensive, according to one provider. The IACC has also highlighted  research on the costs associated with certain services provided to  individuals with ASD, such as vocational services. This issue was also  identified by our roundtable participants. Panelists in our prior work  reported that low- and middle-income youth with ASD whose families  cannot afford to pay for services out-of-pocket may not always be able to  rely on public programs to help them pay for their adult services.  Parents in two of our discussion groups noted that needed adult services  can be beyond the family\u2019s ability to pay. For example, one parent and  our prior work reported that moving from school services to adult services  can feel like falling off a cliff. Another parent reported that the primary  autism-specific provider in her area does not accept state developmental  disability funding or regular insurance, and most families cannot afford to  pay out-of-pocket. One advocate also noted that local transitional living  programs\u2019 costs are higher than what the families she worked with could  cover. Several providers noted that state reimbursement rates did not  align with actual provider expenses. Cost of services may also contribute  to some of the challenges previously mentioned, such as lack of service  options and trained providers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Youth Face Lack of Employment Opportunities and Related Supports, According to Districts Surveyed and Others", "paragraphs": ["After young adults with ASD transition to adult life, they may encounter  challenges similar to other young adults with disabilities, such as securing  employment, housing, and transportation. We estimate that a majority of  school districts consider a lack of employment options to be a top  challenge to providing transition services across youth with ASD with    low-, moderate-, and high-intensity service needs (ranging from 73 to 88  percent, respectively). In addition, we estimate that over one-quarter of  school districts also reported that both job coaching and work  experiences were difficult to provide to individuals with ASD.", "Similarly, stakeholders we interviewed reported that youth with ASD face  unique challenges to securing employment. For example, teachers at one  high school told us that there are limited opportunities to provide work  experiences for youth with ASD due to potential employers\u2019 lack of  exposure to autism, fears around the extent of job-related supports   needed, and lack of financial incentives for employing youth with autism  or other disabilities. Some stakeholders said that employers may not  understand that individuals with ASD can be valuable employees or know  how to create an environment where they can thrive. The employers we  interviewed that have specific efforts to hire individuals with ASD  highlighted the importance of educating managers about ASD and how  best to interview, support, and utilize an employee with ASD. Similarly,  panelists in our prior work also discussed providing employers with  information about hiring and working with autistic employees, as a  support associated with successful employment of individuals with  autism.", "In addition to securing work, stakeholders reported that youth with ASD  face challenges to obtaining the supports needed to sustain employment,  such as reliable transportation and job coaching. For example, one state  official noted that transportation may be a challenge to maintaining  employment for individuals with ASD, particularly in rural and suburban  areas, due to limited public transportation options. Our prior work also  noted that limited access to reliable transportation to and from  employment programs and services providers, especially in rural areas,  was a major challenge for students with disabilities. Similarly, an  estimated 69 percent of school districts identified lack of transportation as  a factor that would negatively affect the ability of youth with ASD to obtain  needed services and supports. Stakeholders also reported that eligibility  and timely access to job coaching was another challenge. Our prior work  also noted that while some programs may teach youth with ASD how to  interview for a job, youth also need to learn about navigating the social  aspect of employment and may require ongoing support in this area."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Collaborative Efforts Have Missed Opportunities to Enhance Support of Transition-age Youth with Autism", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Has Not Regularly Engaged Key Federal Agencies That Support Youth with Autism", "paragraphs": ["The IACC, managed by HHS, has facilitated collaboration across its  member federal agencies on research related to individuals with ASD,  including transition-age youth, but it has not regularly engaged several  key federal agencies that serve transition-age youth with ASD. In  particular, the IACC has collaborated on transition-age issues for youth  with autism by inviting researchers to present their findings related to  transition-age youth during meetings and including research related to  this population in its strategic plan and portfolio analysis (for more  information on research needs related to transition-age youth, see app.  II). However, IACC has missed opportunities to collaborate with non- member federal agencies to report on and monitor services and supports  activities for individuals with ASD, which Congress has called for IACC to  include in its annual strategic plan and monitoring activities. HHS  officials reported that the IACC plans to begin including some services  and supports information in its next strategic plan, which it expects to  release in early or mid-2017. However, HHS officials told us that the  IACC has not engaged certain key federal agencies with responsibility for  serving or providing financial assistance to populations including  transition-age youth with ASD to gather their input on the content of the  plan, nor has it invited such agencies to serve on the committee. The  Autism CARES Act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to include other federal agencies that serve individuals with ASD  as members of the IACC. While, according to HHS officials, the IACC  welcomes engagement with agencies interested in focusing attention on  issues related to autism, they said that the department would not reach  out to federal agencies for potential membership unless such agencies  expressed interest and that few agencies have done so. For example,  when we asked SSA officials if they had considered requesting  membership on the IACC, they told us that although they had not  previously considered it, as of January 2017, they were planning to do so.   On April 26, 2017, the IACC announced SSA as a new member.  Similarly, when we asked DOL officials the same question, they told us  they had not previously considered it, but that in the future they would  look for additional opportunities to work with the IACC. They further stated  that the agency will contact the IACC to determine interest in working on  employment issues.", "DOL, HUD, and SSA manage programs and research that serve or  provide financial assistance to populations including transition-age youth  with disabilities, including youth with ASD, which potentially provides  those agencies with experience, expertise, and unique viewpoints that  could benefit the work of the IACC. For example, DOL provides grants to  states through the Disability Employment Initiative to improve effective  and meaningful participation of transition-age youth and adults with  disabilities in the workforce system. Additionally, in 2014 SSA completed  the Youth Transition Demonstration evaluation which sought to identify  and test the most promising service strategies to enhance work incentives  for helping youth with disabilities maximize their economic self-sufficiency  as they transition to adulthood. In past strategic plans, the IACC  specifically identified research needs related to employment, community  housing, and Social Security programs, which are areas within DOL,  HUD, and SSA\u2019s purview. Further, during an IACC working group  conference call in November 2016, some members of an IACC working  group tasked with updating the lifespan and transitions area for the  strategic plan suggested that HHS invite representatives of federal  agencies who serve transition-age youth and adults to join the IACC to  better inform development of the strategic plan. However, thus far there  have been no representatives from DOL, HUD, or SSA on any of the  working groups tasked with updating the current IACC strategic plan.", "There is precedence for these agencies collaborating in support of youth  with disabilities.

One of the leading federal practices for  effective collaboration stresses the importance of ensuring that all  relevant participants are included in collaborative activities as efforts can  be limited when they do not have the right agencies fully engaged.  Unless HHS finds ways to regularly engage certain non-member federal  agencies that serve or provide financial assistance to populations  including individuals with ASD, including transition-age youth, the IACC  may miss the opportunity to leverage the knowledge of other agencies as  it works to fulfill its expanded responsibilities under the Autism CARES  Act.

Further, although this report focuses on transition-age youth  with ASD, stakeholders we interviewed indicated that earlier transition  planning would likely be beneficial for other students with disabilities.

The  survey included questions about services and supports school districts  provided to students aged 16 to 21 with ASD in special education during  the 2015-16 school year to assist in their transition to adult life. We also  asked questions about services provided, the types of challenges in  providing services, and the level of difficulty in providing services with  regard to students with low-, moderate-, and high-intensity service  needs. Further, we asked about the age at which transition services and  supports are included in the students\u2019 individualized education programs  (IEP) and the age it would be most beneficial to begin including these  services in their IEPs. We also asked about perspectives on the factors  that may negatively affect students once they exit school in obtaining  services to assist with transitioning to adult life.

We used the LEA Universe database from the  Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Common Core of Data (CCD) for  the 2013-14 school year to build the sampling frame of 12,955 LEAs. We  selected a stratified random sample of 606 LEAs. We stratified the  sampling frame into 13 mutually exclusive strata based on LEA size,  urban classification, and poverty classification. We further stratified the  LEAs classified as being in a city by charter status. We selected the  largest 100 LEAs with certainty and determined the minimum sample size  needed to achieve precision levels of plus or minus 10 percentage points  or fewer, at the 95 percent confidence level, for six sub-population  estimates based on three urban classifications (city, suburban, and  town/rural) and three classifications of poverty (high-, medium-, and low- poverty districts). We then increased the sample size within each stratum  for an expected response rate of 70 percent.", "We defined the three urban classifications based on the National Center  for Education Statistics (NCES) urban-centric locale code, ULOCAL.

We received valid responses from  414 (70 percent) of the remaining 588 eligible sampled LEAs. The  weighted response rate, which accounts for the differential sampling  fractions within strata, is 71 percent. The survey was in the field from May  to August 2016. To obtain the maximum number of responses to our  survey, we sent reminder emails to nonrespondents and contacted  nonrespondents over the telephone.", "We conducted an analysis of our survey results to identify potential  sources of nonresponse bias using two methods. First, we examined the  response propensity of the sampled LEAs by several demographic  characteristics. These characteristics included poverty, urbanicity and  race. Our second methodology consisted of comparing weighted  estimates from respondents and nonrespondents to known population  values. The results of this nonresponse bias analysis showed no  significant differences in response propensities or between known  population values and estimates for nearly all of the characteristics we  examined. Based on these results and the 71 percent weighted response  rate, we determined that weighted estimates generated from these survey  results are generalizable to the population of eligible LEAs and are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We took steps to minimize non-sampling errors, including pretesting draft  instruments and using a web-based administration system. During survey  development, we met with officials from eight school districts to explore  the feasibility of responding to the survey questions. We then pretested  the draft instrument from March to April 2016 with officials in 11 school  districts in a range of city, suburban, and rural districts. In the pretests, we  asked about the clarity of the questions and the flow and layout of the  survey. Based on feedback from the pretests, we made revisions to the  survey instrument. To further minimize non-sampling errors, we used a  web-based survey, which allowed respondents to enter their responses  directly into an electronic instrument. Using this method automatically  created a record for each respondent in a data file and eliminated the  errors associated with a manual data entry process.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Because each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 7  percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As  a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals  in this report will include the true values in the study population. All  percentage estimates presented in this report from this survey have a  margin of error of plus or minus 11.8 percentage points or fewer, unless  otherwise noted.", "To analyze differences we identified in the percentages of LEAs providing  services between size, socioeconomic, and urban factors, we compared  weighted survey estimates generated for different levels of these  subgroups and conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to  confirm statistical significance while controlling for other factors. We  estimated models independently for each of the 17 services in the survey  and controlled for poverty status, urbanicity, LEA size, charter school  status, racial composition, and the interaction between school LEA size  and urbanicity. To account for the stratified random sample design and  the unequal probabilities of selection, we used SAS PROC  SURVEYLOGISTIC and included the final sampling weights and strata  boundaries.
