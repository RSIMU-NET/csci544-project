As you know, home health care is an important Medicare benefit enabling beneficiaries with acute-care needs, such as recovery from hip replacement, and chronic-care conditions, such as congestive heart failure, to receive care in their homes rather than in more costly settings, such as nursing homes and hospitals. However, home health care has attracted much attention because of the publicized abuses of certain providers.", "Periodically, we have reported on Medicare\u2019s vulnerabilities with regard to oversight of the home health benefit. Today, I would like to provide a synopsis of this work as a prelude to the specific problems identified by the case that my colleague in our Office of Special Investigations is about to discuss. In doing so, I will focus on (1) the general nature of beneficiary eligibility criteria, which opportunists exploit to provide excessive services; (2) diminished Medicare contractor review and audit effort, which makes it less likely that abusers will be caught; (3) weaknesses in Medicare\u2019s home health provider certification process; and (4) new tools the Congress provided to strengthen oversight of the home health benefit. My remarks are based on our issued and ongoing work on Medicare\u2019s home health services. (See Related GAO Products list at the end of this statement.)", "In brief, several historical factors have produced an environment that, until recently, has enabled improper billing and cost-reporting practices to grow unchecked. First, legislation and coverage policy changes in response to court decisions in the 1980s made it easier for beneficiaries to obtain home health coverage and harder for Medicare claims reviewers to deny questionable claims. Second, from 1989 until recently, the volume of claims reviews and cost-report audits plummeted, reducing the likelihood that improprieties would be detected. Third, because of the laxity of Medicare\u2019s survey and certification process, agencies with no experience or proof of capability were certified as providers. Moreover, home health agencies were unlikely to be terminated or penalized even when they were cited repeatedly for providing substandard care or otherwise failed to comply with conditions of participation.", "Recent legislation has enhanced the Health Care Financing Administration\u2019s (HCFA) ability to improve its oversight of the home health benefit. In 1995, a multiagency government effort known as Operation Restore Trust launched a new anti-fraud-and-abuse campaign, targeting home health services, among others, for investigation. The following year, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), P.L. 104-191, provided dedicated funding to finance, in part, the investigative efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of the Inspector General and other federal agencies. A year later, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) mandated reforming Medicare\u2019s method of paying for home health services and contained additional provisions designed to tighten the use and oversight of the home health benefit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare statute divides benefits into two parts: (1) \u201chospital insurance,\u201d or part A, which covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, and certain home health care services, and (2) \u201csupplementary medical insurance,\u201d or part B, which covers physician and outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, and ambulance and other medical services and supplies. Part B can also cover home health services under certain conditions.", "In 1996, Medicare paid approximately $18 billion for both part A and part B home health services. By fiscal year 1998, Medicare\u2019s home health spending is estimated to total nearly $22 billion, representing a 700-percent increase from 1989 when spending was $2.7 billion. During this period, coverage requirements changed so that more beneficiaries qualified for home health services. In addition, advances in medical technologies and changes in practice patterns resulted in more beneficiaries needing these services. The number of home health agencies certified to care for Medicare beneficiaries has also grown rapidly since 1989\u2014from 5,700 to more than 10,000 in September 1997."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare\u2019s Coverage of the Home Health Benefit", "paragraphs": ["part-time or intermittent basis.

They carry out these responsibilities through medical reviews of claims. HHS\u2019 Office of the Inspector General has emphasized the importance of medical reviews. In the Office\u2019s sampling of claims\u2014which included not just home health but all Medicare services\u2014it found that 99 percent of the improper payments the Office identified appeared to be correct on the surface and were detected only through medical record reviews. their reviews on providers that have unexplained utilization patterns.

The net effect of the changes was that home health care became available to more beneficiaries, for less acute conditions, and for longer periods of time.", "The benefit was legislatively liberalized in 1980 when limits on the number of services and cost-sharing requirements were eliminated. When prospective payment for hospital services was initiated in 1983, the use of home health services was expected to increase significantly because of incentives for hospitals to discharge patients more quickly. However, HCFA\u2019s relatively stringent interpretation of coverage criteria and emphasis on medical record review kept home health growth in check.", "Then in 1989, coverage rules relaxed following a court case brought in 1988 that challenged HCFA\u2019s interpretation that individuals had to satisfy both the part-time and intermittent criteria to qualify for the home health benefit (Duggan v. Bowen). HCFA was obliged to revise its coverage guidelines to allow individuals to qualify by satisfying either criterion, which, as we reported in 1996, enabled home health agencies to increase the frequency of home visits. The requirements were also changed so that patients qualified for skilled observation by a nurse or therapist if a reasonable potential for complications or possible need to change treatment existed. The skilled observation, in turn, qualified the beneficiary for home health aide visits. The benefit also allowed maintenance therapy when therapy services were required to simply maintain function; previously, patients had to show improvement from such services to be covered.", "Medicare Home Health Benefit: Congressional and HCFA Actions Begin to Address Chronic Oversight Weaknesses An individual does not have to be bedridden. . . . the condition of these patients should be such that there exists a normal inability to leave home, and, consequently, leaving their homes would require a considerable and taxing effort. If the patient does in fact leave the home, the patient may nevertheless be considered homebound if the absences from the home are infrequent or for periods of relatively short duration or are attributable to the need to receive medical treatment.", "In our interviews for the 1996 study, HCFA and intermediary officials said that few denials were made on the basis that the beneficiary was not homebound. In particular, the \u201cinfrequent\u201d and \u201cshort duration\u201d language qualifying permissible absences from the home would likely result in the reversal of homebound-criterion-based denials at the reconsideration or appeals level.

In 1985, legislation more than doubled funding for contractors to conduct claims reviews, enabling intermediaries to review over 60 percent of the home health claims processed in 1986 and 1987. By 1995, however, when payment safeguard funding for medical review of all Medicare-covered part A services had substantially declined (from $61 million in 1989 to $33 million in 1995), RHHIs reviewed about 1 percent of home health claims. As a result of decreased review, agencies were less likely to be caught if they abused the home health benefit. During this period, however, the number of home health agencies participating in Medicare increased by more than a third, and the volume of home health claims processed more than tripled.

Until recently, there was little screening of those seeking Medicare certification. We found that the initial survey of an applicant occurred too soon after the agency began operating, offering little assurance that the agency was providing or capable of providing quality care. For example, Medicare certified an agency owned by an individual with no home health experience who turned out to be a convicted drug felon and who later pled guilty with an associate to having defrauded Medicare of over $2.5 million.", "Rarely were new home health agencies found to fail Medicare\u2019s certification requirements, which call for agencies to (1) be financially solvent, (2) comply with antidiscrimination provisions in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and (3) meet Medicare\u2019s conditions of participation. Home health agencies self-certify their solvency, agree to comply with the act, and undergo a very limited survey that few fail. Until less than a year ago, HCFA had been certifying about 100 new home health agencies each month. Once certified, it was unlikely that home health agencies would be terminated from the program or otherwise penalized, even when they had been repeatedly cited for not meeting Medicare\u2019s conditions of participation or for providing substandard care.", "From September 15, 1997, until January 13, 1998, the Administration placed a moratorium on admitting new agencies into the Medicare program. The moratorium was intended to stop the admission of untrustworthy providers while HCFA strengthened its requirements for entering the program. HCFA used this period of time to develop new surety bond regulations (as mandated by BBA), capital requirements to ensure adequate operating funds, and procedures to better scrutinize the integrity of home health agency applicants.

In addition to earmarking funds for anti-fraud-and-abuse activities, the legislation offers specific civil and criminal penalties against health care fraud as well as opportunities to improve detection capabilities. For example, HIPAA makes health care fraud a separate criminal offense and establishes fines and other penalties for federal health care offenses. BBA stiffens the exclusion penalties for individuals convicted of health care fraud. It also establishes civil monetary penalties for such offenses as contracting with an excluded provider, failing to report adverse actions under the new health care data collection program, and violating the antikickback statute.", "With respect to the home health benefit in particular, BBA targets historical abuses. For example, in an egregious case of home health fraud that our Office of Special Investigations reported on in 1995, the HHS Inspector General charged ABC Home Health Care with billing Medicare for items that were solely for the owner\u2019s or his family\u2019s personal use, including condominium utility expenses, maid services, and automobile lease payments. BBA mandates the elimination of cost-based reimbursement and its replacement by a prospective payment method. Under this method, home health providers will be expected to deliver care for a fixed payment, thus breaking the link in the future between the home health agency\u2019s costs and Medicare\u2019s payments. level of care in favor of those who would be less expensive to treat. The adjuster would not only protect access to care but would also help ensure that Medicare was paying agencies more appropriately.", "Base-rate development: Because HCFA intends to use historical data on cost of services to calculate a base rate of an episode of care, it must take care to avoid incorporating the inflated costs identified in the cost reports of problem home health agencies. For example, in 1995 we reported on a number of problems with payments by intermediaries for surgical dressing supplies, indicating that excessive costs are being included and not removed from home health agency cost reports. We have suggested at several hearings that HCFA audit thoroughly a projectable sample of home health agency cost reports so that the results could be used to adjust HCFA\u2019s cost database to help ensure that unallowable costs are not included in the base for setting prospective rates.", "Until October 1999, when the law requires prospective payment for home health services to be implemented, Medicare will continue to reimburse for home health services on a cost basis.
