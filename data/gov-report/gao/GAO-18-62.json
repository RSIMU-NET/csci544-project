This report describes:(1) DHS's risk assessment practices in 3 of 16 critical infrastructure sectors and private sector representatives' views on the utility of this risk information, and (2) how this risk information influences DHS's strategic planning and private sector outreach.", "GAO selected 3 of 16 sectors\u2013Critical Manufacturing; Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste; and Transportation Systems\u2013to examine based on their varied regulatory structures and industries. GAO reviewed DHS guidance related to infrastructure protection, the QHSR and DHS Strategic Plan, and plans for the selected critical infrastructure sectors. GAO interviewed DHS officials responsible for critical infrastructure risk assessments, and the owner and operator representatives who serve as chairs and vice-chairs of coordinating councils for the 3 selected sectors. Information from the 3 sectors is not generalizable to all 16 sectors but provides insight into DHS's risk management practices.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to DHS and relevant excerpts to the council representatives interviewed during this review.

In limited circumstances, DHS generates risk assessments that both incorporate all three elements of risk and cover individual or multiple subsectors.", "Threat : DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis assesses threats\u2014natural or manmade occurrences, entities, or actions with the potential to cause harm, including terrorist attacks and cyberattacks\u2014and disseminates this information to critical infrastructure owners and operators. For example, the Transportation Security Administration provides threat intelligence to mass transit security directors and others through joint classified briefings.", "Vulnerability : DHS officials provide various tools and work directly with owners and operators to assess asset and facility vulnerabilities\u2014physical features or operational attributes that render an asset open to exploitation, including gates, perimeter fences, and computer networks. For example, DHS officials conduct voluntary, asset-specific vulnerability assessments that focus on physical infrastructure during individual site visits.", "Consequence : DHS officials also assess consequence\u2014 the effect of occurrences like terrorist attacks or hurricanes resulting in losses that impact areas such as public health and safety, and the economy\u2014to better understand the effect of these disruptions on assets.", "These assessments help critical infrastructure owners and operators take actions to improve security and mitigate risks. Six private sector representatives told GAO that threat information is the most useful type of risk information because it allows owners and operators to react immediately to improve their security posture. For example, one official from the Transportation Systems sector said that government threat information is credible and is critical in supporting security recommendations to company decision-makers.", "DHS uses the results of its risk assessments to inform the department's strategic planning and to guide outreach to infrastructure owners and operators. Critical infrastructure risk information is considered within DHS's strategic planning. Specifically, according to DHS officials, risk information informs the Department's Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR)\u2014a process that identifies DHS's critical homeland security missions and its strategy for meeting them. DHS also uses risk information to guide outreach to critical infrastructure owners and operators. For example, DHS officials annually prioritize the most critical assets and facilities nationwide and categorize them based on the severity of the estimated consequences of a significant disruption to the asset or facility. DHS officials then use the results to target their assessment outreach to the infrastructure owners and operators categorized as higher risk. DHS officials also told GAO that they use risk information after an incident, such as a natural disaster, to quickly identify and prioritize affected infrastructure owners and operators to help focus their response and recovery assistance outreach."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s critical infrastructure (CI) includes physical and cyber assets  and systems that are so vital to the United States that their incapacity or  destruction could have a debilitating impact on national security, public  health and safety, or the economy. CI provides the essential services\u2013\u2013 such as transportation, water, and energy\u2013\u2013that underpin American  society, and protecting CI assets and systems is a national security  priority. The risk environment for CI ranges from natural disasters to  cyberattacks by foreign malicious actors. Additionally, while companies  have increasingly sought to gain efficiencies by connecting their physical  and cyber business systems, the convergence between these systems  creates new opportunities for potential cyber attackers to access these  systems. Because the majority of CI is owned and operated by the private  sector, it is vital that the public and private sectors work together to  protect these assets and systems.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) coordinates the overall  federal effort for national CI protection. As part of its CI protection  responsibilities, DHS is to conduct CI risk assessments and integrate  relevant information and analyses to identify priorities for protective and  support measures to be implemented by DHS, other federal agencies,  state and local government agencies and authorities, the private sector,  and other entities.", "DHS developed the first version of the National Infrastructure Protection  Plan (NIPP) in 2006 and updated it in 2009 and 2013. The NIPP  describes a voluntary partnership model as the primary means of  coordinating government and private sector efforts to protect CI. It  provides a framework for developing and implementing a coordinated  national effort to protect CI within 16 distinct sectors. The sectors vary in  structure, with some sectors, such as the chemical and nuclear sectors,  having more regulatory oversight governing their respective security  issues in addition to the voluntary partnership model. Other sectors, such  as commercial facilities and critical manufacturing, have less regulatory  oversight, according to DHS officials.", "As part of the partnership structure, each sector has a designated Sector- Specific Agency (SSA), a federal department or agency that serves as the  lead coordinator for security and resilience programs and activities for  their respective sector. Each sector also has a government coordinating  council (GCC), consisting of representatives from various levels of  government, and a sector coordinating council (SCC) consisting of owner- operators of these critical assets or members of their respective trade  associations. According to the NIPP, SCCs serve as principal  collaboration points between the government and private sector owners  and operators for CI security and resilience policy coordination and  related sector-specific activities. For example, the NIPP calls for the  individual sector-specific agencies, working with relevant sector  representatives, to develop sector-specific plans to, among other things,  describe how the sector will identify and prioritize its critical assets,  including cyber assets, and define approaches the sector will take to  assess risks and develop programs to protect these assets.", "Focusing on cyber infrastructure, DHS\u2019s National Cybersecurity and  Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) provides a central place for  federal and private-sector organizations to coordinate efforts to address  cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks. The NCCIC\u2019s mission is to  reduce the likelihood and severity of incidents that may significantly  compromise the security and resilience of the nation\u2019s critical information  technology and communications networks.", "Due to the cyber-based threats to federal systems and critical  infrastructure, the persistent nature of information security vulnerabilities,  and the associated risks, we continue to designate information security as  a government-wide high-risk area in our most recent biennial report to  Congress, a designation we have made in each report since 1997. In  2003, we expanded this high-risk area to include, the protection of critical  cyber infrastructure. While DHS has made progress in this area,  challenges remain. For example, we reported in November 2015 that  while SSAs had taken actions to mitigate cyber risks for their respective  CI sectors, most SSAs had not developed metrics to measure and report  on the effectiveness of their mitigation activities. We also reported that  DHS needed to assess whether its efforts to share information on cyber  threats, incidents, and countermeasures with federal and non-federal  entities are useful and effective.", "Over the last several years, DHS has taken actions to assess  vulnerabilities at CI facilities and within groups of related infrastructure,  regions, and systems. We reported in September 2014 that DHS offices  and components had conducted or required thousands of vulnerability  assessments of CI from October 2010 to September 2013, and that DHS  needed to enhance integration and coordination of these efforts. DHS  concurred with the six recommendations in our report, including our  recommendation that it take steps to better coordinate vulnerability assessments both within DHS and other CI partners, as appropriate. DHS  has taken steps to address this particular recommendation, which are  discussed later in this report.", "Given the importance of CI to the nation\u2019s economy and well-being, you  requested that we review DHS\u2019s efforts to assess risks to CI. This report  addresses the following questions:  1.  What are DHS\u2019s risk assessment practices in selected CI sectors and  what are private sector representatives\u2019 views on the utility of this risk  information?  2.  How, if at all, does CI risk information influence DHS\u2019s strategic  planning and private sector outreach?", "To address our first objective, we reviewed agency documents and  interviewed relevant officials to identify DHS\u2019s physical and cyber risk  assessment practices for 3 of the 16 CI sectors: Critical Manufacturing;  Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste; and Transportation Systems.  We selected these three sectors because they were sectors for which  DHS serves as the SSA or the co-SSA. DHS\u2019s Office of Infrastructure  Protection is the lead component within DHS for the Critical  Manufacturing and nuclear sectors, and DHS shares SSA responsibilities  with the Department of Transportation for the Transportation Systems  sector. These three sectors also have varying levels of federal regulation.  Specifically, we chose the Critical Manufacturing sector because  according to DHS, the majority of the assets in this sector are privately  owned and operated by companies that have minimal interaction with the  federal government and other regulatory entities and includes the  manufacturing industries that are the most crucial for the continuity of  other critical sectors and has significant national economic implications.  Additionally, we selected the nuclear sector because all of the facilities in  the sector are subject to federal security requirements, which allowed us  to observe how a regulatory environment may affect DHS\u2019s provision of  risk information to CI owners and operators. We also included the  Transportation Systems sector because portions of it are regulated and  DHS regularly conducts sector-wide complete risk assessments for this  sector. The information gathered from these three selected sectors is  not generalizable to all 16 sectors but does provide insight into how  DHS\u2019s risk assessment information is used for a variety of CI. We  reviewed laws and guidance regarding DHS\u2019s roles and responsibilities  relating to physical and cyber CI risk assessment practices including the  Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, and Presidential Policy  Directive/PPD-21 (PPD-21). We also examined DHS\u2019s National  Infrastructure Protection Plan, DHS\u2019s Risk Management Fundamentals,  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  Cybersecurity Framework to identify common practices for generating  risk-related information.", "To characterize the risk information DHS distributed to CI owners and  operators in the three selected sectors, we identified the products and  activities associated with each risk element\u2014threat, vulnerability, and  consequence. Additionally, to identify cybersecurity products and services  distributed by DHS, we reviewed our previous work on DHS\u2019s NCCIC to  categorize NCCIC products and services. We interviewed DHS officials  from the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Office  of Policy, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), and the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to discuss DHS\u2019s roles and  responsibilities related to assessing risks for CI. We also interviewed the  SCC chair and vice-chair from each of the three selected sectors to  determine how DHS risk assessment information may be used by owners  and operators, for a total of six SCC representatives. The information  gathered from interviews with these private sector representatives is not  generalizable to each of their respective sectors but provides insights into  how the asset owners use risk information provided by DHS.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed and analyzed DHS  planning products, such as the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review  (QHSR) and strategic plans for the individual CI sectors, to determine  which documents included elements that capture CI risk data for strategic  decision-making purposes. We examined DHS policies and guidance  related to administering risk assessments and obtained information from  NPPD officials to determine how DHS may use risk information when  prioritizing outreach activities within the three selected sectors. We also  reviewed our past work on DHS strategic planning and DHS\u2019s actions to  address open recommendations and interviewed DHS\u2019s Office of Policy  to discuss the next iteration of the QHSR due to be released in fiscal year  2018.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to October 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In general, an SSA is a federal department or agency  responsible for, among other things, supporting the security and  resilience programs and related activities of designated CI sectors. DHS is designated as the SSA or co-SSA for 10 of the 16 CI sectors, and has  assigned its SSA duties to multiple entities including the Office of  Infrastructure Protection, TSA, Coast Guard, and Federal Protective  Service. For our three selected sectors, DHS\u2019s Sector Outreach and  Programs Division (SOPD), within the Office of Infrastructure Protection,  serves as the SSA for the Critical Manufacturing and nuclear sectors.  DHS\u2019s TSA and the U.S. Department of Transportation serve as co-SSAs  for the Transportation Systems sector. Other federal agencies or  departments external to DHS serve as the SSAs for the remaining 6  sectors for which DHS is not designated as the SSA or co-SSA.

For example, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in its role as the regulatory agency for  the nuclear sector, conducts threat assessments to help protect against  acts of radiological sabotage and to prevent the theft of special nuclear  material. Additionally, pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security  Act of 2002, DHS must use risk management in specific aspects of its  homeland security efforts.

For example, facilities may make use of  automated building control systems to control certain processes or  functions, such as security, lighting, or heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning (HVAC). These control systems increase efficiency and  optimize operational performance by reducing the need for manual  controls and adjustments. Building control systems and the devices  within them are often configured with connections to the Internet. These  Internet connections allow the systems to be accessed remotely for  control and monitoring and, for example, to receive software patches and  updates.

Three of the six representatives  reported that DHS generally provides threat information in a timely  manner. For example, SCC representatives from the nuclear sector told  us that timely threat information from DHS was helpful in clarifying  erroneous reports circulating about the terror attacks in Belgium being  aimed at nuclear sites in that region. According to these SCC  representatives, working with DHS to gather credible information in a  timely fashion was very valuable to their sector because it allowed owners  and operators within their sector to determine whether they needed to  implement certain protocols to ensure that they were not vulnerable to  similar attacks. The remaining three representatives told us that delays in  receiving threat information from DHS decreased the value of this  information. For example, one representative noted that he believes  DHS\u2019s process for vetting threat information before it is shared with his  sector prevents the agency from disseminating valuable threat  information in a timely manner. Another representative shared an  example where the threats referenced in one of the products distributed  by DHS had already been identified and addressed. However, the sixth  representative emphasized that despite delays in receiving information  from DHS, government threat information is very credible and a major  resource often used by security managers proposing security upgrades to  their respective chief executive officers.

The survey contains more than 100  questions used to gather information on such  things as physical security, security forces,  security management, information sharing,  and protective measures. The IST results  inform owners and operators of potential  vulnerabilities facing their asset or system and  recommend measures to mitigate those  vulnerabilities.

These assessments focus on  physical infrastructure and are generally asset-specific and conducted  during site visits at individual assets. They are used to identify security  vulnerabilities and identify potential risk mitigation strategies for owners  and operators to address over time. One tool PSAs use in conducting CI  assessments is the Infrastructure Survey Tool to assess facilities that  agree to voluntarily participate. According to NPPD officials, vulnerability  assessments take longer to develop than threat assessments, and the  vulnerabilities identified are typically more static than threats, which are  constantly evolving. PSAs store the collected assessment data on DHS\u2019s  Infrastructure Protection Gateway, an information sharing platform  intended for use by DHS and its homeland security partners, including CI  owners and operators, for access to infrastructure protection tools and  information in support of incident preparedness and response efforts.  Table 2 in appendix I summarizes the physical vulnerability assessments  DHS conducts for the three selected sectors.", "In September 2014, we reported that the vulnerability assessment tools  and methods that different DHS offices and components used varied with  respect to the areas of vulnerability assessed. For example, we found  that while all of the assessment tools we reviewed considered perimeter  security, approximately half of these tools (6 of 10) included an  assessment of cybersecurity. We also found that DHS had not  established guidance on what areas should be included in a vulnerability  assessment. We recommended, among other things, that DHS review its  vulnerability assessments to identify the most important areas of  vulnerability to be assessed, and establish guidance. DHS agreed with  our recommendation and in July 2016 reported that IP had taken steps to  collect and evaluate information on the various vulnerability assessment  tools and methods used by DHS offices and components. More  specifically, IP identified six security areas to incorporate into DHS  assessment tools and methods. DHS reported in August 2016 that DHS  offices and components received guidance for the areas and the specified  levels of detail to be incorporated into existing assessment tools.", "As a result of addressing this recommendation, we believe that DHS is  better positioned to collect and analyze assessment data to enable  comparisons and determine priorities between and across CI sectors.  DHS is also taking additional steps to address related recommendations  from our September 2014 report that remain open. For example, we  recommended that DHS develop and implement ways it can facilitate  data sharing and coordination of vulnerability assessments to minimize  the risk of potential duplication or gaps in coverage. As of September  2017, in response to this recommendation, DHS officials reported they  were coordinating with stakeholders and developing features in an online  portal to better facilitate information vulnerability assessment data  sharing. We will continue to monitor the status of DHS\u2019s efforts to address  these recommendations.", "In addition, in July 2017, DHS officials reported that they were finalizing a  strategy intended to identify ways that vulnerability assessment data can  be used by not only CI owners and operators but DHS and other  government stakeholders to improve their own decision-making.  According to these officials, DHS held workshops with over 120  stakeholders from NPPD as well as senior officials from other designated  sector-specific agencies and federal departments who identified the need  for DHS to provide more vulnerability assessment data related to lifeline  facilities\u2014such as water and wastewater treatment plants and train  stations.

CS&C also maintains the National Cybersecurity Assessment and  Technical Services team which offers cybersecurity scanning and testing  services that identify vulnerabilities within stakeholder networks and  provides risk analysis and remediation recommendations. The CSA  program also provides cyber assessment services for CI owners and  operators through on-site vulnerability assessments for cyber systems.  CSAs offer the Cyber Infrastructure Survey Tool, an assessment of  essential cybersecurity practices instituted by critical infrastructure  organizations to protect their critical IT services as well as the Cyber  Resilience Review which evaluates an organization\u2019s operational  resilience and cybersecurity practices.

For example, one SCC representative told us that the risk  scores associated with individual vulnerability assessments are of value  to the CI owners and operators of the infrastructure for which that  assessment was administered. However, this representative also  mentioned that these scores have limited value beyond the individual  asset because risks differ greatly between companies, rendering sector- wide or regional vulnerability assessments less useful. Another SCC  representative told us that because the membership of their respective  sectors is so broad and diverse, it is difficult for members to discern the  value of high-level aggregated vulnerability data\u2013\u2013especially from  organizations with very different business models. However, another SCC  representative indicated that DHS could offer aggregated vulnerability  assessment data to all CI stakeholders for the purpose of developing  broader situational awareness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Conducts Consequence Assessments as Part of Its Infrastructure Survey Tool", "paragraphs": ["While DHS\u2019s IST is used to assess vulnerabilities for CI, the tool also  includes a consequence module intended to allow DHS to assess facility  criticality in terms of potential loss of life and economic impact.

Both TSA and  the Coast Guard regularly conduct complete risk assessments within the  Transportation Systems sector. However, according to a senior OCIA  official, NPPD receives very few requests for complete risk assessments.  Our review of available assessment documentation found that among our  three selected sectors, DHS has conducted complete risk assessments  for the Transportation Systems sector but not the other two sectors. For  example, the Transportation Systems Sector Security Risk Assessment is  TSA\u2019s annual report to Congress on transportation security. It assesses  risk by establishing risk scores for various attack scenarios within the  sector, including for domestic aviation; examines risks to individual  transportation modes; and compares them to risks within and across  modes. Table 6 in appendix III describes the assessment in more detail.", "Also within the Transportation Systems sector, the Coast Guard\u2019s  Maritime Security Risk Analysis Model (MSRAM) serves as the primary  tool for assessing and managing security risks for all of the vessels,  barges, and facilities regulated by the Coast Guard under the Maritime  Transportation Security Act of 2002. Since its development and  implementation in 2005, MSRAM has provided the Coast Guard with a  standardized way of assessing risk to maritime infrastructure, referred to  in the analysis model as targets that can include chemical facilities, oil  refineries, hazardous cargo vessels, passenger ferries, and cruise ship  terminals. For example, a scenario related to cruise ships identified using  this analysis model could include a boat bomb or an attack by a hijacked  vessel. MSRAM is designed to allow comparison between different  targets at the local, regional, and national levels with the goal of reducing  risk by prioritizing security activities and resources.", "To prioritize and assess security risks at U.S. ports and facilities, the  Coast Guard uses MSRAM to calculate risk using threat judgments  provided by the Coast Guard Intelligence Coordination Center. The  Center provides threat probabilities for MSRAM based upon judgments  regarding specific intent, capability, and geographic preference of terrorist  organizations to deliver an attack on a specific type of maritime target  class\u2014for example, a boat bomb attack on a ferry terminal. To make  these judgments, Center officials use intelligence reports generated  throughout the broader intelligence community to make qualitative  determinations about certain terrorist organizations and the threat they  pose to the maritime domain. At the sector level, Coast Guard MSRAM  users are required to use the threat probabilities provided by the Center  to ensure that threat information is consistently applied across ports.", "MSRAM users at the sector level also assess the vulnerability of targets  within their respective areas of responsibility and assess the  consequences of a successful attack on these targets. Vulnerability and  consequence factors included in the MSRAM assessment can be found in  table 7 in appendix III.", "According to one NPPD official, various sector councils have requested  analysis of certain risk elements, such as vulnerabilities or consequences,  as opposed to complete risk assessments. For example, councils have  asked for analysis of vulnerabilities and consequences due to potential  failures within their sector\u2019s respective systems and the potentially  cascading effects of these failures on systems beyond their own span of  control. This official noted that these requests provide the opportunity for  OCIA to develop analytic products that companies within these sectors  can then use as part of the risk assessments they conduct for  themselves, as well as analytic products more broadly related to  homeland security risks.", "SCC representatives from our three selected sectors told us that  complete risk assessments are of limited utility for CI owners and  operators because complete assessments take a long time to produce,  often involve risk scenarios that are not likely to occur, or generates  results that are so broad that they may not be applicable to individual  assets. For example, according to one SCC representative, the diversity  among the members of his sector, including size and sophistication of  operations, is the primary reason that conducting a complete risk  assessment for their sector would not be helpful for individual companies.  Similarly, another SCC representative told us that the private sector does  not operationalize information from complete risk assessments because  the assessments do not add practical value and some of the scenarios  evaluated in the assessments are not applicable to many of the  companies within their sector.", "TSA and NPPD officials provided explanations of the utility of complete  risk assessments, particularly for government decision-making purposes.  For example, TSA officials told us that they believe the Transportation  Systems Sector Security Risk Assessment data gathering methodology for identifying risk inputs adds the most value in the assessment process  for CI owners and operators in the Transportation Systems sector.  According to these officials, the data gathering process is extensive and  involves a substantial number of industry experts who are brought  together to analyze potential threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences  across the five transportation modes for which TSA is responsible. The  officials added that this elicited risk information allows TSA to better  allocate resources across the multiple transportation modes. According to  one senior OCIA official, NPPD is best suited to execute complete risk  assessments that are intended to focus on broad risks to CI and are not  specific to individual CI assets. For example, NPPD is providing risk  information for the execution of the 2018 Homeland Security National  Risk Characterization (HSNRC), which evaluates the full range of risks  addressed by DHS.

We also found  that while the QHSR risk assessment described a wide range of  homeland security challenges and was a valuable step toward using risk  information to prioritize and select risk management activities, DHS did  not document how its various analyses were synthesized to generate  results, thus limiting the reproducibility and defensibility of the results. We  found that without sufficient documentation, the QHSR risk assessment  results could not easily be validated or the assumptions tested, hindering  DHS\u2019s ability to improve future assessments. In addition, the QHSR  described homeland security hazards, but did not rank those hazards or  provide prioritized strategies to address them. We reported that  comparing and prioritizing risks helps identify where risk mitigation is  most needed and helps justify cost-effective risk management options.  Thus, we recommended that future QHSR risk assessment reflect key  elements of successful risk assessment methodologies, including being documented, reproducible, and defensible.
