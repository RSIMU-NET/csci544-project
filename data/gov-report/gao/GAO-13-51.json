The estimates were: well-documented since they identified data sources and methodologies; accurate since they accounted for inflation and were checked for errors; and mostly comprehensive since they included the work planned and identified key assumptions. However, the estimates were not fully credible in part because they did not assess the extent to which the total costs could change if additional work is done or more aircraft are included in the programs. Another factor affecting the credibility of the estimates is that they have not been compared to an independently developed estimate. GAO's past work has shown that such an independent cost estimate is one of the best validation methods since an independent cost estimate tends to be higher and more accurate than a program office estimate. Air Force and Navy officials told GAO that they use Department of Defense and military department guidance that allows for some variation in how the estimates are developed depending on the dollar value and maturity of the program. However, these programs--which are critical to maintain fighter capability and capacity as current inventory ages--total almost $5 billion and the costs will increase if program quantities and scope increase.

Also, the Air  Force identified some cost drivers, which are the items that have the  greatest effect on the estimated cost, such as labor rates. While the  Air Force estimates exhibited many characteristics of a high-quality  estimate, they had two shortcomings that lessened the estimates\u2019  credibility. First, the analysis did not include an estimate of the total  costs that may occur if more than 300 aircraft are included in the  programs up to the potential maximum of 650 aircraft. Second, the  estimates were not compared to an independently developed  estimate.", "Regarding the first shortcoming, best practices state that a credible cost  estimate should include an assessment of how the cost estimate may  change in response to changes in key program assumptions. This is  known as a sensitivity analysis. Such an analysis helps decision makers  identify areas that could significantly affect a program\u2019s cost, such as  changes in program quantities. According to Air Force officials, the  service may choose to upgrade and extend the service life of additional  aircraft if there are further delays in F-35 production.

Air Force officials  explained that they did not assess the range of costs that may result from  expanding the number of aircraft in the program up to the maximum of  650 since the program is currently approved for only 300 aircraft.  However, without an assessment of how much the total cost may  increase as the aircraft quantity increases, the estimate lacks  transparency on the full range of possible costs, which could be  significant. For example, we calculated that the cost to upgrade and  extend the service life of all 650 aircraft could total $5.53 billion.", "The second major shortcoming is that the Air Force did not compare the  estimates to independently developed cost estimates. Having an  independent estimate is considered one of the best and most reliable  estimate validation methods since an independent estimate is an  objective assessment of whether the program office estimate is  reasonable and can be achieved. Further, our past work has shown that  an independent estimate tends to be higher and more accurate than a  program office estimate. Air Force officials explained that it is likely the  Air Force Cost Analysis Agency will be requested to develop a formal  independent cost estimate for upcoming program reviews, but the  decision to require an independent estimate has not yet been made.  Further, the program review for the capability-upgrade program will not be  held for a year\u2014it is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of fiscal  year 2013. Until the Air Force obtains an independent cost estimate,  decision makers will not have the assurance that the programs\u2019 estimated  cost can be relied upon for making budgeting and trade-off decisions.

Navy officials explained that they will decide on  an aircraft-by-aircraft basis whether to do this work when the aircraft is  inspected just prior to beginning service-life extension. Navy officials told  us that if an aircraft needs a lot of this type of work, the Navy may decide  not to extend the service life of that particular aircraft, but rather substitute  another one in its place. Given the uncertainties, the costs associated  with this additional work are not included in the Navy\u2019s $2.19 billion  estimate nor are they included in the Navy\u2019s spending plans through fiscal  year 2017.

In many respects, the Air Force and Navy cost estimates we  evaluated were developed in accordance with some best practices.  Specifically, we found the estimates to be well-documented and accurate  and mostly comprehensive. However, the Air Force and Navy did not  follow some important best practices and as a result did not clearly  identify the potential total costs that may result as the programs evolve.  For example, without an analysis that includes the potential for increases  in the number of aircraft in the program or that clearly identifies the cost  for additional work that may be required on some of the aircraft, decision  makers are not aware of how much total costs could increase if these  events occur. Further, unless the services reconcile the program cost  estimate with an independent cost estimate, there is an increased risk  that the actual costs will exceed the estimate.

However, Air Force officials explained  during our review that data from testing are available throughout the  testing period and that they could use this information to update cost  estimates before testing is completed in 2016.  Until the Air Force  completes analyses to show the potential range of costs, decision makers  will continue to lack crucial data on how much total costs could increase  as they make resource and trade-off decisions.", "Regarding the second recommendation for improving future updates of  the Air Force cost estimates by obtaining an independent review of the  updated cost estimates, DOD agreed, stating that the Air Force Cost  Analysis Agency had reviewed the estimates for the Air Force\u2019s fiscal  year 2014 budget development process and that, if further cost  assessments are warranted, the Air Force would submit the estimates for  an independent review.  An independent review of cost estimates is  important because a program that has not been reconciled with an  independent estimate has an increased risk of proceeding underfunded  since an independent estimate provides an objective and unbiased  assessment of whether the program estimate can be achieved.  As the  Air Force updates its cost estimates for these $2.61 billion programs, up- to-date, independently validated cost estimates would provide decision- makers assurance that the programs\u2019 estimated cost can be relied upon  as they assess program affordability.", "Regarding the two recommendations for improving future updates of the  Navy cost estimates, DOD concurred but did not explain when or what  specific actions it intends to take to implement these recommendations.   We are encouraged that the department agrees these are important, valid  steps to take and further believe that it is important for the Navy to  implement these recommendations in a timely manner to facilitate review  and implementation of these programs since the programs are estimated  to cost $2.19 billion and could increase an average of $5.64 million per  aircraft.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, and  the Secretary of the Navy.

To identify the Air Force\u2019s  and the Navy\u2019s estimated costs to upgrade and extend the service life of  F-16s and F/A-18s, we obtained the services\u2019 cost estimates for these  programs and obtained any updates to these estimates. The Air Force  updated its initial estimate to support development of the fiscal year 2013  budget. The Navy\u2019s cost estimate was reported to Congress in May 2011.  All of the cost estimates from these sources were converted to fiscal year  2013 dollars using the indexes published by the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) in the National Defense Budget Estimates for  Fiscal Year 2013, commonly referred to as the \u201cGreen Book\u201d.", "To assess the extent to which the cost estimates exhibited characteristics  of a high-quality cost estimate, we compared how the estimates were  developed to the cost estimating best practices outlined in the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide.  The guide is a compilation of best  practices that federal cost-estimating organizations and industry use to  develop and maintain reliable cost estimates that management can use  for making informed decisions. The guide describes 19 best practices for  developing a comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible  cost estimate\u2014the four characteristics of a high-quality cost estimate. We  analyzed the extent to which the Air Force and Navy cost estimates met  each of these four characteristics and assigned each a rating of not met,   The overall rating  minimally met, partially met, substantially met, or met.for each characteristic was based on the average rating of the best  practices for each characteristic. We also held detailed discussions with  service officials and reviewed program documentation to identify key  factors that could affect the potential total costs such as changes in  aircraft quantities or additional work to maintain aircraft mission  effectiveness that may not have been included in the estimates. We  shared with program officials our cost guide, the criteria against which we  evaluated the program\u2019s estimated cost, as well as our preliminary  findings. When warranted, we updated our analyses on the basis of the  agency response and additional documentation that was provided to us.  Finally, we corroborated our analyses in interviews with service officials  responsible for developing the cost estimates.", "We conducted our work at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; Office of the Chief of Staff of  the Air Force, Directorate of Force Application; Ogden Air Logistics  Center at Hill Air Force Base; F-16 System Program Office at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base; Air Combat Command; Air Force Cost Analysis  Agency; Air Force Fleet Viability Board; Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Navy for Air Programs; Headquarters United States  Marine Corps; Naval Air Systems Command; and the Naval Center for  Cost Analysis.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2011 to November 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
