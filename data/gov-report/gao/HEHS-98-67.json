However, the extent and scope of these reforms vary, and gaps in protections remain within and among states. Furthermore, self-funded employer group plans, which cover about 40 percent of all employees enrolled in a group health plan, are beyond the purview of state regulation and thus exempt from these reforms.", "To provide minimum standards of protection for coverage sold in all states and insurance markets, the Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which the president signed on August 21, 1996. HIPAA is considered by some to be the most significant federal health insurance legislation in over a decade. It sets standards for access, portability, and renewability that apply to group coverage\u2014both fully insured and self-funded\u2014as well as to individual coverage. Federal regulatory jurisdiction for the law is shared among three agencies.", "Because of the scope and complexity of this law, its implementation has been a complicated undertaking, and various concerns and challenges emerged during the first year. To assist your Committee in its oversight of the implementation process and in its consideration of possible technical amendments to the statute, you asked us to monitor the implementation process and keep your Committee informed of these concerns and challenges as they arise. As requested, we reviewed the implementation of HIPAA, concentrating on issues affecting issuers of health coverage, including employers and insurance carriers; state insurance regulators; and federal regulators.", "In addition, we reviewed efforts undertaken by federal agencies to address some of the concerns and challenges that have arisen.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed the statute and regulations, and interviewed representatives of the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Labor. With these officials, we discussed the federal interagency process to develop regulations and the measures agencies have taken to ensure compliance. We visited Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, and Missouri and met with representatives of insurance departments, health carriers, employers, and consumer organizations. We also interviewed representatives of several national organizations, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), the Health Insurance Association of America, the American Association of Health Plans, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.", "We conducted our work between May and December 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. While we did not verify in detail all data obtained from carriers, HHS, and NAIC, we did review the consistency of the data with our own interview results and the views of experts in the field, cross-checked some data, and concluded that using the data was reasonable for our purposes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Title I of HIPAA contains standards for health insurance access, portability, and renewability, which apply to group (both self-funded and fully insured) and individual insurance market coverage. While some of the standards, such as guaranteed renewal of insurance coverage, apply equally to coverage offered in all markets, other standards do not. For example, HIPAA requires all products carriers offer in the small group market to be sold to any small employer that applies, but it does not extend the same requirement to the large group or individual markets.Similarly, HIPAA requires that certain individuals leaving group coverage be guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market\u2014\u201cgroup to individual guaranteed access.\u201d However, no similar guarantees of access exist for people in the individual market who have coverage today but might lose it in the future. (App. I contains a summary of HIPAA access, portability, and renewability standards by market segment.)", "Three federal agencies\u2014Labor, HHS, and the Treasury\u2014are required to jointly develop and issue implementing regulations for HIPAA. Each agency has somewhat different responsibilities for ensuring compliance. Labor is responsible for ensuring that group health plans comply with HIPAA standards. This is an extension of its current regulatory role under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Treasury also enforces HIPAA requirements on group health plans, but does so by imposing an excise tax under the Internal Revenue Code. HHS is responsible for enforcing HIPAA provisions with respect to insurance carriers in the group and individual markets in states that do not already have similar protections in place and do not pass appropriate laws and substantially enforce them. This represents an essentially new role for that agency.", "The implementation of HIPAA is ongoing, in part, because the implementing regulations were on an interim final basis. Therefore, further guidance needed to finalize the regulations has not yet been issued. In addition, specific HIPAA provisions have varying effective dates. Although most of the provisions became effective on July 1, 1997, group-to-individual guaranteed access standards in 36 states and the District of Columbia were allowed to take effect as late as January 1, 1998. Finally, although all provisions are now in effect, individual group plans do not become subject to the law until the start of their plan year beginning on or after July 1, 1997. For some collectively bargained plans, this may not be until 1999 or later.", "During the first year of implementation, federal agencies, the states, and issuers have taken various actions in response to HIPAA. The federal agencies issued interim final regulations by the April 1, 1997, statutory deadline. Many considered this task to be a significant undertaking, and states and the insurance industry were generally pleased with the open and inclusive nature of the process. More regulations and guidance are expected to be issued in 1998. The agencies also conducted various educational outreach activities. For example, Labor sponsored a series of informational seminars for employers held in several large cities, created informational literature, and provided guidance on its Web page. HHS consulted with state insurance regulators at quarterly meetings of NAIC, held informational meetings for insurance industry representatives in at least two states where it will play an enforcement role, and also maintains a Web page containing information on HIPAA. Also during the first year, state legislatures have enacted laws to enforce HIPAA provisions locally, and state insurance regulators have written regulations and prepared to enforce HIPAA provisions.

The first, which HIPAA specifies and which has become known as the \u201cfederal fallback\u201d approach, requires all issuers who operate in the individual market to offer eligible individuals at least two health plans. (This approach became effective on July 1, 1997.) The second approach, the so-called \u201calternative mechanism,\u201d grants states considerable latitude to use high-risk pools and other means to ensure guaranteed access. (HIPAA requires states that adopt this approach to have it implemented no later than Jan. 1, 1998. ) Among the 13 states that are using the federal fallback approach, carrier marketing activities and high premium prices may limit consumers\u2019 ability to take advantage of this guarantee. Some carriers initially attempted to discourage consumers from applying for products with guaranteed access rights, and some are charging premiums 140 to 600 percent of the standard rate. In addition, widespread consumer misunderstanding of HIPAA guarantees of individual market coverage and the restrictions placed on those guarantees has also contributed to access problems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Use Federal Fallback Approach or an Alternative Mechanism to Guarantee Access", "paragraphs": ["Under HIPAA, guaranteed access to coverage is restricted to eligible individuals who, among other criteria, had at least 18 months of coverage without a break of more than 63 days and with the most recent coverage obtained under a group health plan. Recognizing the controversial nature of this requirement and that many states had already passed reforms that could be modified to meet or exceed these requirements, HIPAA gave states the flexibility to implement this provision by using either the federal fallback or the alternative mechanism approach.", "Under the federal fallback approach, carriers have three options for offering eligible individuals guaranteed access to coverage. A carrier may offer (1) all of its individual market plans, (2) only its two most popular plans, or (3) two representative plans\u2014a lower-level and a higher-level coverage option\u2014which are explicitly subject to some mechanism for risk spreading or financial subsidization. Thirteen states use the federal fallback approach.", "In the 36 states and the District of Columbia that use an alternative mechanism, which was to become effective no later than January 1, 1998, the law allows a wide range of approaches as long as certain minimum requirements are met. For example, an eligible individual must have a choice between at least two different coverage options. Twenty-two of these states chose a state high-risk insurance pool to provide group-to-individual guaranteed access rights. Appendix II summarizes the different options states have chosen to provide group-to-individual guaranteed access rights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Marketing of HIPAA Guaranteed Access Products May Have Discouraged Individuals From Applying", "paragraphs": ["Some initial carrier marketing practices may have discouraged HIPAA eligibles from enrolling in products with guaranteed access rights. After the federal fallback provisions took effect on July 1, 1997, many consumers complained to state insurance regulators that carriers did not disclose the fact that a product with HIPAA guaranteed access rights existed or, when the consumers specifically requested one, they were told that the carrier did not have such a product available. One state regulator we visited said that some carriers told consumers HIPAA products were not available because the state had not yet approved them. However, the regulator had notified all carriers that such products were to be issued starting July 1, 1997, regardless of whether the state had yet approved them.", "Soon after July 1, some carriers had also refused to pay commissions to insurance agents who referred HIPAA eligibles. In two of the three federal fallback states we visited, insurance regulators told us that some carriers were advising agents against referring HIPAA-eligible applicants, or paying reduced or no commissions. Because consumers often use insurance agents to access the individual insurance market, an economic incentive to steer individuals away from guaranteed access products could significantly reduce consumer access to them. Several states have challenged this practice under state fair marketing practice laws. HHS officials looked into reports of such practices and learned of about 10 carriers that had reduced or eliminated agent commissions for HIPAA eligibles. Responding to pressure from state insurance regulators, two of these carriers have resumed paying commissions, and the other eight, according to the officials, appear to be wavering. Since finding these initial 10, HHS officials have not heard of other carriers refusing to pay agent commissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Pricing of HIPAA Guaranteed Access Products Can Result in Substantially Higher Rates", "paragraphs": ["Premiums for products with guaranteed access rights may be substantially higher than standard rates. In several of the 13 federal fallback states, anecdotal reports from insurance regulators and agents suggest that rates range from 140 to 600 percent of the standard rate. Rates charged by several individual market carriers in the three federal fallback states we visited ranged from 140 to 400 percent of the standard rate, as indicated in table 1. Carriers charge higher rates, in part, because they believe HIPAA-eligible individuals will, on average, be in poorer health and hence would likely have higher medical costs. In addition, carriers that do not charge higher premiums to HIPAA eligibles could be subject to adverse selection. That is, once a carrier\u2019s low rate for eligible individuals became known, agents would likely refer unhealthy HIPAA eligibles to that carrier.", "We also found that these carriers typically evaluate the health status of applicants and offer healthy individuals access to their standard products. Although these products may include a preexisting condition exclusion period, they may cost considerably less than the HIPAA product and therefore are likely to draw healthy individuals away from HIPAA products. Unhealthy HIPAA-eligible individuals may have access to only the guaranteed access product, and some of them may be charged an even higher premium on the basis of their health status.", "Carriers permit or even encourage healthy HIPAA-eligible individuals to enroll in standard plans. According to one carrier official, denying these individuals the opportunity to enroll in a less expensive product for which they are eligible would be contrary to the consumers\u2019 best interests. Moreover, the practice of encouraging healthy HIPAA-eligible individuals to enroll in standard products may lead to further rate increases for HIPAA guaranteed access products in the future. According to an official from one large insurance carrier, a spiral might ensue as higher premiums induce the better health risks to disenroll from HIPAA products, leaving a pool of poorer risks and spurring insurers to further raise premiums.", "Finally, HIPAA regulations explicitly impose a risk-spreading requirement under only one of the three options carriers have to provide coverage to HIPAA-eligible individuals. If carriers choose to develop two new products to be offered to eligible individuals, they must include some method of risk spreading or a financial subsidization mechanism. Under the other two options, the regulations are silent about rates. In fact, the preamble to the regulations expressly acknowledges that HIPAA does not place limits on the premiums insurers may charge. This, some state regulators contend, permits issuers to charge substantially higher rates for products with guaranteed access in the federal fallback states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Widespread Consumer Misunderstanding of HIPAA Group-to-Individual Guaranteed Access Rights May Foster Dissatisfaction and Diminish Access", "paragraphs": ["HIPAA\u2019s group-to-individual guaranteed access rights are limited to eligible individuals and are subject to several other restrictions.

After HIPAA was enacted, insurance regulators in several states received numerous calls from individuals, including the uninsured, who misunderstood their rights and expected to have guaranteed access to insurance coverage. One state reported receiving consumer calls at the rate of 120 to 150 a month beginning shortly before most HIPAA provisions became effective on July 1, 1997. About 90 percent of these calls related to the group-to-individual guaranteed access provision, about half of which were complaints about the lack of access to coverage in the individual market. Similarly, an official from one large national insurer told us that many consumers believe the law covers them when it actually does not. One insurance agent suggested that perhaps only 10 percent or fewer of all individuals actually know that HIPAA exists, much less fully understand the protections it offers.

For example, in states that used the federal fallback approach, eligible individuals needed to be aware that the provision became effective on July 1, 1997, and that coverage must be offered by all carriers in the state that operate in the individual insurance market. In states that chose an alternative mechanism, eligible individuals needed to know that the provision had until January 1, 1998, to take effect and also needed to be aware of which method the state chose to provide guaranteed access to coverage in order to exercise their group-to-individual guaranteed access right.", "Consumer misunderstanding of these restrictions can hamper or limit access to products for eligible individuals. For example, individuals who are unaware of the 63-day limit on coverage interruptions may wait until medical care is necessary before applying for coverage, only to find that coverage is unavailable, according to one regulator. A regulator told us that individuals coming from group coverage have waited beyond 63 days to apply for individual coverage and thus have lost their portability rights. Another insurance regulator said that some consumers lost their guarantee to individual coverage because they left group coverage before January 1, 1998, believing HIPAA guaranteed access rights to be in place.

However, because of resource constraints, the agency is unable to put much effort into consumer education.

While issuers generally have complied with this requirement, some suggest that a more limited requirement, such as issuing the certificates only to consumers who request them, would serve the same purpose for less cost. Issuers are also concerned that HIPAA\u2019s guaranteed renewal requirement may have negative consequences for certain populations, including individuals eligible for Medicare. Finally, issuers are concerned that certain HIPAA provisions create opportunities for individuals to abuse protections afforded to group coverage enrollees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issuers Comply, but Still Cite Requirement to Provide Certificates as Burdensome and Largely Unnecessary to Prove Prior Coverage", "paragraphs": ["HIPAA requires issuers of health coverage to provide certificates of creditable coverage to enrollees whose coverage terminates. The certificates are intended to document an individual\u2019s period of coverage so that a subsequent health issuer can credit this time against the preexisting condition exclusion period of the new coverage. Early indications suggest that issuers generally appear to be complying with this requirement. Moreover, none of the health carrier officials with whom we met were unable to issue the certificates once systems were put into place to generate them. Likewise, state insurance regulators we visited had received few complaints from consumers who were unable to obtain a certificate of coverage, and they therefore do not consider issuer compliance with the certification requirement a significant concern.", "Nevertheless, as we reported in our September 2, 1997, correspondence,concerns about HIPAA\u2019s certification requirement remain:", "Some issuers suggest that information needed for certificates can be difficult to obtain. For example, certificates must include information on each dependent covered under the policy, such as the date they were first covered and how long the coverage was in effect. Since changes in the number or status of dependents in a family\u2014as a result of events such as births, deaths, and marriages\u2014are fairly common in a large group plan, issuers may have a difficult time keeping abreast of all these changes. They believe that maintaining and updating records could be time-consuming and expensive. To address such concerns, federal agencies provided issuers a transition period ending June 30, 1998, during which certain dependent information need not be included in certificates.", "Issuers are also provided additional time to issue a certificate when a dependent\u2019s cessation of coverage is not known to the issuer.", "Some regulators have also raised concerns that the certification requirement will create an added administrative burden for state Medicaid agencies. Medicaid recipients tend to enroll and disenroll in the Medicaid program frequently as their income and employment status change. This volatility in enrollment will increase the volume of certificates issued by the Medicaid program. In addition, Medicaid agencies have had a difficult time maintaining accurate addresses for recipients and expect a large volume of certificates to be undeliverable, according to NAIC. In the preamble to the interim final regulations, federal agencies requested comments on how the certification process might be adapted to the special circumstances of Medicaid agencies and other entities.", "Finally, issuers contend that certificates may not be necessary to prove creditable coverage in all cases and that issuance on demand would serve the same purpose at a lower cost. In fact, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association estimates that consumers ultimately will not use as many as 90 percent of all certificates issued to prove creditable coverage. For example, several issuers, as well as a state regulator, pointed out that portability reforms passed by most states have worked well without a similar certification requirement. Where proof of prior coverage was needed, issuers asked for documentation of prior coverage from the applicant and, if unavailable, simply called the prior issuer to confirm that coverage. Also, many group health policies do not contain clauses with preexisting condition exclusions and therefore do not need certificates from incoming enrollees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guaranteed Renewal Requirements May Have Negative Consequences", "paragraphs": ["HIPAA regulations explicitly state the circumstances under which an individual\u2019s health coverage may not be renewed or may be canceled, such as for nonpayment of premiums or fraud. Issuers are concerned that the omission of other circumstances, such as the attainment of Medicare eligibility age and ceasing to meet eligibility criteria for targeted population insurance programs, may affect both issuers and consumers adversely.", "Commonly cited as problematic is the renewal of comprehensive coverage for individual market enrollees who become eligible for Medicare. When individuals reach the age of Medicare eligibility, issuers have typically terminated individuals\u2019 comprehensive coverage and offered Medicare supplemental coverage instead. HIPAA\u2019s requirement to automatically renew this comprehensive coverage may have a number of drawbacks.", "First, individuals risk losing their 6-month open enrollment window for Medicare supplemental coverage. If individuals choose to retain comprehensive coverage rather than obtain Medicare supplemental coverage, they may permanently lose their right to enroll in a supplemental policy without preexisting condition exclusions in the future. This could have a significant impact on some consumers, since individual market coverage is often more expensive than Medicare supplemental coverage. In addition, many states do not permit issuers to coordinate their coverage with that provided by Medicare. Thus, some consumers may pay for duplicate coverage. Finally, NAIC is concerned that renewing coverage for Medicare eligibles could have a deleterious effect on the individual insurance market. Premiums for all individuals could increase if large numbers of older and less healthy individuals remain in that market. Because of these consequences, several state insurance regulators require issuers to notify enrollees of the implications of renewing their coverage once they become eligible for Medicare.", "HIPAA\u2019s guaranteed renewal requirements may also preclude issuers from canceling the coverage of individuals enrolled in insurance programs targeted for low-income populations once these individuals exceed eligibility criteria. Since carriers might be prohibited from canceling coverage once an enrollee\u2019s income exceeds the eligibility threshold, a program\u2019s limited slots could be filled by otherwise ineligible individuals. Similarly, under children-only insurance products, issuers could be required to renew coverage for those who have reached adulthood. Several issuers and their representative organizations have expressed concern about such implications of the guaranteed renewal requirement and have asked the federal agencies to revise regulations to provide appropriate exceptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issuers Concerned That HIPAA Creates Opportunities for Individuals to Abuse Certain Consumer Protections", "paragraphs": ["Issuers cite two provisions in HIPAA that consumers could potentially abuse. First, HIPAA requires group health plans to give new enrollees or enrollees switching plans during an open enrollment period full credit for a broad range of prior health coverage, regardless of the deductible level of that coverage. Since the law does not recognize differences in the deductible levels, issuers and regulators are concerned that where given a choice of health coverage options, individuals may enroll in inexpensive, high-deductible plans that may have limited benefits while healthy and then switch to plans with comprehensive, first-dollar coverage when they become ill. Likewise, a small employer could move all its employees from a high- to a low-deductible plan once a single employee becomes ill.", "Second, issuers are concerned that certain enrollment rights under HIPAA create the opportunity for abuse. Under certain circumstances, HIPAA permits an individual who initially declines coverage under the employer\u2019s group plan to later obtain coverage under the plan without waiting for the specified open enrollment period or being penalized as a late enrollee. The circumstances under which this special enrollment period is allowed include the loss of other health coverage as well as family changes that affect the status of dependents, such as marriage, birth, and adoption. Issuers suggest that since individuals essentially control some of the circumstances that create these special enrollment periods, some may forgo coverage until medical care is needed and then create the circumstances that trigger an open enrollment period. For example, an unmarried couple could avoid the expense of health coverage, knowing they could obtain access to their employers\u2019 group coverage if necessary later by marrying. Citing a related example, a Health Insurance Association of America official noted that individuals could also misuse HIPAA\u2019s prohibition against including pregnancy as a preexisting condition. For example, nothing would prevent an employee from avoiding the expense of health coverage until medical care for pregnancy became necessary. The employee need merely enroll as a late enrollee to immediately obtain full coverage for maternity benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Insurance Regulators Cite Lack of Sufficient Clarity or Detail in Some HIPAA Regulations as Hindering Implementation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["State regulators have encountered difficulties implementing HIPAA provisions in instances where federal regulations lacked sufficient clarity or detail.

Specifically, some regulators are concerned that the lack of clarity may result in varying interpretations and confusion among the multiple entities involved in implementation. For example, Colorado insurance regulators surveyed carriers in that state to determine how they interpreted regulations pertaining to group-to-individual guaranteed access. The survey results indicated that issuers had a difficult time interpreting the regulations and were applying the regulations differently.", "Such regulatory ambiguities can have critical consequences for consumers and have created some situations in which the intent of the statute may have been thwarted, according to NAIC. For example, as discussed earlier, partly because of the inconsistency in the risk-spreading requirement for products available to HIPAA-eligible individuals in the individual markets of federal fallback states, rates for these products in some states range from 140 to 600 percent of standard rates. As a result, many regulators believe this outcome raises a question about whether those leaving group coverage are provided with meaningful access under HIPAA to coverage in the individual insurance market.", "The following are examples of other regulatory provisions for which state insurance regulators have sought further federal guidance or clarification.", "Plan design as preexisting condition exclusion period. One of HIPAA\u2019s key goals is to provide portability of coverage to those who change jobs or lose group coverage. To achieve this objective, the regulations limit the extent to which issuers can exclude preexisting conditions from coverage. However, the regulations do not contain guidance about whether an issuer may structure the benefits of a plan in a way that effectively excludes certain preexisting conditions. For example, according to NAIC, some health plans have established waiting periods of up to a year during which certain conditions or procedures, such as organ transplants, are excluded from all enrollees\u2019 coverage. Requiring such waiting periods effectively excludes such preexisting conditions from coverage and, according to regulators, is contrary to the statutory intent to provide portability of coverage.", "Treatment of late enrollees. State regulators believe HIPAA is unclear about whether late enrollees are eligible for coverage. Although the regulations explicitly define \u201clate enrollees\u201d as individuals who enroll for group coverage any time after the date on which they were initially eligible (or subsequently eligible under a special enrollment period), the preamble to the regulations indicates that issuers are not required to accept late enrollees. Regulators believe that certain distinctions, such as an 18-month preexisting waiting period for late enrollees versus 12 months for on-time enrollees, would not have been made if late enrollees were not intended to be covered. Accordingly, NAIC has asked that HHS interpret the statute to explicitly require the acceptance of late enrollees.", "Market withdrawal as exception to guaranteed renewability. Regulators believe that the HIPAA provision that allows issuers who cease offering coverage throughout the individual and group markets to not renew the coverage of an individual or a group creates uncertainties that may affect their ability to regulate insurance. Regulators believe the interim regulations leave three key questions unanswered. First, must an issuer who withdraws from the market also not renew existing coverage, or does it have the discretion to maintain existing coverage but not write new coverage? Second, must the issuer also cease to issue all other types of health policies, such as limited-benefit or specified-disease policies? And finally, must the issuer terminate all coverage at once, or can it terminate each policy on its respective anniversary date?", "Nondiscrimination provisions in group plans.

First, the agencies were required to issue a number of complex regulations within a relatively short period of time. The statute, signed into law on August 21, 1996, required that implementing regulations be issued within fewer than 8 months, on April 1, 1997. Implicitly recognizing this challenge, the Congress provided for the issuance of regulations on an interim final basis. This time-saving measure helped the agencies to issue a large volume of complex regulations within the statutory deadline, while also providing the opportunity to add more details or further clarify the regulations based on comments later received from industry and states. Therefore, some regulatory details necessarily had to be deferred until a later date.", "Furthermore, agency officials point out that in developing the regulations, they sought to balance states\u2019 need for clear and explicit regulations with the flexibility to meet HIPAA goals in a manner best suited to each state. For example, under group-to-individual guaranteed access requirements, states were given several options for achieving compliance. While the multiple options may have contributed to confusion in some instances, the controversial nature of the requirement suggested to agency officials that a flexible approach was in the best interests of states. Officials said that many state officials requested that minimal detail be included in the federal regulations.

In the group markets, two states had not passed laws to implement small-group guaranteed access, and four states had not passed laws to implement guaranteed renewal and limits on preexisting condition exclusion periods in the large-group markets. In addition, these preliminary data do not include HIPAA\u2019s certificate issuance requirement, and anecdotal evidence suggests that many states have not incorporated this requirement into state statutes.

To carry out this function, the office asked for 11 new full-time positions but, as of December 1997, was authorized to hire only 4. Three of the four positions have been filled through outside hires, and one was filled through an internal promotion. Two additional staff were rotated from other units to assist in HIPAA-related activities. Even fewer resources are devoted to HIPAA enforcement in the two other regions, Boston and San Francisco.

Although the office had received authorization for two additional staff, none had yet been hired.

Importantly, these new standards apply to both fully insured and self-funded coverage. However, implementation of the standards is complicated. It requires three federal agencies, state legislatures and insurance regulators, and issuers of health coverage to coordinate their efforts. Further complicating implementation, the issuance of federal regulations has been on an interim final basis. Moreover, different HIPAA provisions have become effective and group plans have become subject to the law on different dates. Nevertheless, implementation has moved forward. For example, federal agencies issued interim final regulations within the deadline set by HIPAA, using a process widely commended for being open and inclusive. As might be expected, however, the process has raised certain concerns and posed challenges to those charged with implementing this new law.", "Some challenges are likely to recede or be addressed in the near term. What could be called \u201cearly implementation hurdles,\u201d especially those related to the clarity of federal regulations, may be resolved during 1998. Federal agencies issued supplemental guidance on December 29, 1997, and expect to provide further regulatory guidance during 1998 to states and issuers, who consider certain regulations\u2014relating to nondiscrimination, late enrollment, and special enrollment periods\u2014to be ambiguous. Moreover, as states and issuers gain experience in implementing HIPAA standards, the intensity of their dissatisfaction may diminish. For example, while still criticizing the cost and administrative burden of issuing certificates of creditable coverage, issuers seem able to comply. (Now that the start-up burden of putting procedures in place is largely behind them, issuers we visited seemed to find the day-to-day process of issuing these certificates to be manageable.)", "Various participants involved in implementing HIPAA have pointed to several potential unintended consequences, but whether these possibilities will be realized is difficult to predict. These concerns are necessarily speculative in nature because HIPAA\u2019s insurance standards have not been in effect long enough for evidence on these potential problems to accumulate. First, for example, evidence is not yet available to determine whether large numbers of Medicare eligibles will remain in the individual market for health insurance (and consequently push up premiums there). The same is true for whether good health risks will select high-deductible plans, leaving the sicker individuals in low-deductible plans, or whether consumers will abuse special enrollment periods to obtain coverage. Second, possible changes in the regulations or the HIPAA statute may further affect whether a concern becomes a reality. However, uncertainty over whether the changes will be made or will rectify the potential unintended consequences makes more difficult any assessment of these possibilities.", "Finally, two implementation difficulties are substantive and likely to persist unless measures are taken to address them. First, among the 13 federal fallback states, some consumers are finding it difficult as a result of high premiums to obtain the group-to-individual guaranteed access coverage that HIPAA requires. This situation is likely to continue unless HHS interprets HIPAA to provide for more explicit risk-spreading requirements or states adopt explicit risk-spreading requirements of guaranteed access to coverage for HIPAA eligibles. In addition, if consumer education about HIPAA coverage guarantees in the individual market continues to be spotty or absent, consumers will likely continue to be discouraged by the limited nature of HIPAA protections. Similarly, some will probably continue to be at risk of losing those protections. Second, HHS\u2019 regulatory role could expand as the status of state efforts to adopt and implement HIPAA provisions becomes clearer in 1998. HHS\u2019 current enforcement capabilities could be inadequate to handle the additional burden unless further resources become available.", "As additional health plans become subject to the law, and as the remaining regulations and guidance are issued, new problems of implementation may emerge.
