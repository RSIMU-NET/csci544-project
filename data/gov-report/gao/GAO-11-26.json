The law capped the number of H-1B visas issued per fiscal year at 65,000. Since then, the cap has fluctuated with legislative changes. Congress asked GAO to assess the impact of the cap on the ability of domestic companies to innovate, while ensuring that U.S. workers are not disadvantaged. In response, GAO examined what is known about (1) employer demand for H-1B workers; (2) how the cap affects employer costs and decisions to move operations overseas; (3) H-1B worker characteristics and the potential impact of raising the cap; and (4) how well requirements of the H-1B program protect U.S. workers. GAO analyzed data from 4 federal agencies; interviewed agency officials, experts, and H-1B employers; and reviewed agency documents and literature."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In most years, demand for new H-1B workers exceeded the cap: From 2000 to 2009, demand for new H-1B workers tended to exceed the cap, as measured by the numbers of initial petitions submitted by employers who are subject to the cap. There is no way to precisely determine the level of any unmet demand among employers, since they tend to stop submitting (and the Department of Homeland Security stops tracking) petitions once the cap is reached each year. When we consider all initial petitions, including those from universities and research institutions that are not subject to the cap, we find that demand for new H-1B workers is largely driven by a small number of employers. Over the decade, over 14 percent of all initial petitions were submitted by cap-exempt employers, and only a few employers (fewer than 1 percent) garnered over one-quarter of all H-1B approvals. Most interviewed companies said the H-1B cap and program created costs, but were not factors in their decisions to move R&D overseas: The 34 H-1B employers GAO interviewed reported that the cap has created some additional costs, though the cap's impact depended on the size and maturity of the company. For example, in years when visas were denied by the cap, most large firms reported finding other (sometimes more costly) ways to hire their preferred job candidates. On the other hand, small firms were more likely to fill their positions with different candidates, which they said resulted in delays and sometimes economic losses, particularly for firms in rapidly changing technology fields. Limitations in agency data and systems hinder tracking the cap and H-1B workers over time: The total number of H-1B workers in the U.S. at any one time--and information about the length of their stay--is unknown, because (1) data systems among the various agencies that process such individuals are not linked so individuals cannot be readily tracked, and (2) H-1B workers are not assigned a unique identifier that would allow for tracking them over time--particularly if and when their visa status changes. Restricted agency oversight and statutory changes weaken protections for U.S. workers: Elements of the H-1B program that could serve as worker protections--such as the requirement to pay prevailing wages, the visa's temporary status, and the cap itself--are weakened by several factors. First, program oversight is fragmented and restricted. Second, the H-1B program lacks a legal provision for holding employers accountable to program requirements when they obtain H-1B workers through a staffing company. Third, statutory changes made to the H-1B program have, in combination and in effect, increased the pool of H-1B workers beyond the cap and lowered the bar for eligibility. Taken together, the multifaceted challenges identified in this report show that the H-1B program, as currently structured, may not be used to its full potential and may be detrimental in some cases. This report offers several matters for congressional consideration, including that Congress re-examine key H-1B program provisions and make appropriate changes as needed. GAO also recommends that the Departments of Homeland Security and Labor take steps to improve efficiency, flexibility, and monitoring of the H-1B program. Homeland Security disagreed with two recommendations and one matter, citing logistical and other challenges; however, we believe such challenges can be overcome. Labor did not respond to our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The current H-1B program, which permits U.S. employers to hire foreign  workers in specialty occupations, was authorized in 1990.

However, since then, the cap has fluctuated with  legislative changes, reaching a peak of 195,000 in fiscal years 2001 to 2003.  Today, the cap is set at 65,000 and continues to be a topic of debate.  Proponents of raising the H-1B cap argue that doing so would allow  companies to better fill an important and growing gap in the supply of U.S.  workers, especially in the science and technology fields. Opponents of  raising the cap argue that there is no skill shortage, that the H-1B program  displaces U.S. workers and undercuts their pay, and that the cap is an  essential tool to protect U.S. workers. Others argue that the skill criteria  for the H-1B visa should be revised to better target foreign nationals whose  talents are undersupplied in the domestic workforce.", "This report responds to a congressional request that GAO assess the  impact of the current H-1B visa cap on the ability of domestic companies  to develop modern technology and perform innovative research and  development (R&D) while ensuring that U.S. workers are not unfairly  disadvantaged or displaced by H-1B visa holders.

The American  Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 increased the  cap to 115,000 for fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000. The American  Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 (AC21) further  increased the limit to 195,000 for fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2003.  In fiscal year 2004, the cap reverted to its original level of 65,000.", "Over this period, statutory changes also allowed for certain categories of  individuals and companies to be exempt from or to receive special  treatment under the cap. In 2000, AC21 exempted all individuals being  hired by institutions of higher education, as well as nonprofit and  government-research organizations, from the cap. More recently, the H-1B  Visa Reform Act of 2004 allowed for an additional 20,000 visas each year  for foreign workers holding a master\u2019s degree or higher from an American  institution of higher education to be exempted from the numerical cap  limitation.

Initial petitions are those filed for a foreign national\u2019s first-time  employment as an H-1B worker and are valid for a period of up to 3 years.  Generally, initial petitions are counted against the annual cap.  Extensions\u2014technically referred to as continuing employment petitions\u2014 may be filed to extend the initial petitions for up to an additional 3 years.  These extensions may be filed for extended employment; sequential  employment (when an H-1B worker changes employers within his or her 6- year time period); or for concurrent employment (when an H-1B worker  intends to work simultaneously for a second employer). Extensions do not  count against the cap. While working under an H-1B visa, an H-1B worker  may apply for legal permanent residence in the United States. After filing  an application for permanent residence, H-1B workers are eligible to  obtain additional 1-year visa extensions until their green card is issued.  To obtain such extensions, the green card application must be  employment-based (i.e. not a green card sponsored by a family member).

In the  H-1B program, only those employers that are designated as H-1B-dependent  or willful violators are subject to any type of labor market test.

However, the number of initial petitions submitted  annually is likely to be an underestimate of demand for two reasons. First,  employers subject to the cap may stop submitting initial petitions once  they know the cap has been reached.

In addition, foreign nationals seeking to found new  companies in the United States can face a unique set of difficulties. Two  lawyers we spoke with whose firms work with many emerging technology  companies in Silicon Valley described cases in which entrepreneurs  attempting to establish very early-stage technology start-ups were unable  to obtain H-1B or other work visas for themselves and either relocated the  project abroad or had to abandon the start-up."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Interviewed Companies Said the Cap Had Little Effect on R&D or Offshoring Decisions; However, Certain IT Services Firms Differed", "paragraphs": ["When asked about how the H-1B cap affected their decisions on where to  locate their R&D activities and other operations, 15 of the 28 companies  who responded to these questions said the H-1B cap was not an important  factor in their decisions on the location of these activities. The 20 firms we  spoke with that conducted R&D were in a variety of industries\u2014including  semiconductor and electronics manufacturing, pharmaceutical companies,  software publishing and financial services\u2014and 7 of these 20 were in the  manufacturing sector. Several firms that conducted R&D reported that  their H-1B workers were essential to this work in the United States.  Furthermore, access to skilled labor from around the world was very  important to a number of the firms we interviewed; 15 of the companies  we spoke with had R&D centers or labs overseas, and 8 of these firms told  us that these centers or labs had been set up largely to access the skilled  workforce in that country. However, only four said the H-1B cap was an  important determinant in the creation of these overseas centers.  Respondents from several of the multinational companies we spoke  with\u2014whether headquartered in the United States or not\u2014regarded their  firms as global entities, and five said that their decisions to expand  overseas are primarily driven by the pursuit of new markets.

One large IT services firm that  had both an onshore staffing component and offshore outsourcing  component noted that in years when the H-1B cap prevented hiring all  the foreign workers sought, the company could locate a larger portion of  the work project overseas. Two IT staffing firms we spoke with\u2014firms  that place H-1B workers at the worksites of client companies\u2014said their  U.S. business relies heavily on the H-1B program because H-1B visa  holders are more willing to relocate around the country, and one noted  that H-1Bs accept lower wages than U.S. workers.", "Several executives at IT staffing firms we interviewed noted that, since  issuance of a January 2010 Homeland Security memo, Homeland Security  is more aggressively enforcing a requirement that staffing firms be able to  provide evidence of an employer-employee relationship with the H-1B  worker they sponsor by, for example, having a contract with their clients  in place. Executives from staffing firms told us they often cannot have a  contract in place because they provide labor on short notice to their client  firms. As a result of the increased enforcement of this provision,  executives at one staffing firm told us that they no longer hired H-1Bs for  their staffing business, and executives at several other staffing firms  reported that they had ceased hiring new H-1B workers, hiring instead  only foreign nationals already in the country with a current H-1B visa.  Executives at some companies who already had an offshore location  reported expanding the portion of their work conducted overseas, and  others reported that they had either opened an offshore location to access  labor from overseas or were considering doing so.", "Some researchers have noted that some IT services firms that conduct  offshore outsourcing and employ large numbers of H-1B workers offer  engineering and R&D services. Although 3 of the 10 IT services firms we  spoke with described themselves as conducting R&D, 2 of the 3 noted that  this R&D involved innovation while on-the-job. Some experts we spoke  with also noted that learning and technological innovation is often  attained on the job or through informal collaboration, as opposed to  through formal R&D efforts.

Further, eight firms\u2014of all sizes and  across a range of industries\u2014complained that the number of requests for  additional evidence from Homeland Security increased significantly in  recent years. Relatedly, in prior work, we suggested that Congress  consider streamlining the H-1B approval process by eliminating the  separate requirement that employers first submit an LCA to Labor for  review and certification, since another agency (USCIS) subsequently  conducted a similar review of the LCA. Three years after our  recommendation, in 2003, USCIS was moved under the newly formed  Homeland Security; however, Congress has not taken action to streamline  the process.", "Inconsistencies in the adjudication process: Executives at several  companies we spoke with provided examples of what they viewed as  inconsistencies in the adjudication process. For example, one company  executive noted that the petitions it sends to one of Homeland Security\u2019s  two processing centers are often processed more efficiently than the  petitions it sends to the other processing center. Another executive noted  that at times, \u201cdecisions on approving or denying the H-1B visa  applications seem arbitrary.\u201d This executive provided an example of a  USCIS adjudicator who decided that the project for which the company  sought an H-1B worker did not require \u201cspecialty education,\u201d but the  executive felt that if the adjudicator had contacted the client firm, they  could have easily seen that a specialist was required. Other firms noted  that some adjudicators ask for evidence that seems unnecessary. For  example, an immigration lawyer at a multinational pharmaceutical  company said that agency requests for evidence do not always appear to  be \u201cthoughtful,\u201d and cited a Request for Evidence that demanded a review  of the qualifications of an applicant who had received a science degree  from Oxford University.", "Adjudication process not customized for different employers:  Several companies we spoke with complained that the adjudication  process is the same for all H-1B employers, irrespective of the employer\u2019s  track record with the H-1B program. For example, the Immigration Policy  Manager for a large, household-name Fortune 100 company recounted  being asked to provide photographic evidence of its headquarters as part  of the Request for Evidence in the petition review process. As another  example, the Chief Executive Officer of a small software application  developer who had been using the H-1B program for over 10 years  recounted the frustration of interviewing 60 U.S. candidates before finding  3 candidates through international hiring, and then facing a vetting process  that questioned his effort to hire a U.S. citizen. At the same time,  Homeland Security staff we spoke with reported having to review large  stacks of paperwork to adjudicate a single petition.", "Experts we spoke with suggested that Homeland Security consider  creating a risk-based adjudication process whereby businesses are ranked  on their experience with the program and past compliance issues. Such a  process could permit well-vetted businesses with a strong track-record of  H-1B regulatory compliance access to a streamlined process for petition  approval and reduced requests for evidence, thus reducing the burden to  firms of providing evidence, and would permit Homeland Security  investigators to focus their investigative efforts efficiently.", "Rigidities in the lottery system: Several company executives, industry  representatives, and academic researchers we spoke with cited examples  of what they viewed as rigidities in the lottery system, especially in years  when the H-1B cap is hit early. Several industry representatives told us  that the lottery process does not allow their clients to rank their top  choices; as a result, firms do not necessarily receive approval for the most  desired H-1B candidates. Several companies we spoke with also raised the  issue that the annual allotment period does not allow firms to make their  hiring decisions in response to business needs throughout the year,  especially during years when the cap is hit early in the year. Some  company executives and researchers we spoke with suggested the  following:    a more efficient system would permit employers to rank their applications  so that they are able to hire the best qualified worker for the job in highest  need; and  to allow more flexible hiring of H-1B workers, Homeland Security consider  distributing the allocation of H-1B permits throughout the year (such as  quarterly) rather than annually.", "Visas for emerging technology companies: Entrepreneurs and venture  capital firms we interviewed said that program rules can inhibit many  emerging technology companies and other small firms from using the H-1B  program to bring in the talent they need, constraining the ability of these  companies to grow and innovate in the United States. For example, for the  earliest stage ventures, when the person who needs the H-1B visa is the  entrepreneur, there is sometimes no \u201cfirm\u201d in existence yet that can meet  legal criteria for employing H-1Bs. While it is not necessarily the role of the  H-1B program to provide work visas for foreign entrepreneurs, several  parties we spoke with discussed the risk of the United States losing its  advantage in high-tech entrepreneurship if U.S. immigration policy  undermines the ability and interest of new entrepreneurs to move to high- tech communities like Silicon Valley. Some venture capital firms and  businesses we spoke with suggested that, in order to promote the ability of  entrepreneurs to start businesses in the United States, Congress should  consider creating a visa category for entrepreneurs, available to persons  with U.S. venture backing.", "Agency officials expressed reservations about the feasibility of GAO\u2019s past  recommendation and the suggestions from experts and company  executives on improving the application process. Homeland Security  officials believed that Labor would be better suited to review the LCA  because Labor has specialized knowledge about the computation of  prevailing wages. Labor officials, however, conceded that their review of  the LCA is limited by statute, as discussed above. In regard to the potential  adoption of a customized adjudication process, Labor officials noted that a  strong track record of compliance with program rules does not guarantee  future compliance. Homeland Security officials also noted that  establishing a system for employers to rank their submitted petitions in  order of priority might increase the likelihood of fraud if it also increased  incentives for employers to submit applications for hypothetical workers  in order to capture a larger proportion of those selected for the lottery.  State officials raised questions about the logistics required for allocating  H-1B petitions throughout the year\u2014for example, whether or how  employers would be permitted to resubmit petitions after receiving a  denial in one quarter, and whether such a system might result in more  employers being denied access to H-1B workers during peak seasons.", "Homeland Security officials also noted two efforts currently under way to  streamline the application process for prospective H-1B employers.  Homeland Security is in the process of developing a product that would  allow it to use data from a private data vendor to automatically download  certain data on employers and update those data over time so that in the  future, employers may not have as heavy a burden in filing their petitions.  This product is currently being tested. Second, Homeland Security is  currently preparing a proposed rule, which is being reviewed and  considered within the agency, to allow employers to submit requests for   H-1B slots before submitting an LCA. This rule would spare employers that  were not chosen in the lottery from having to file an LCA and could also  reduce workloads for Labor.

Data on the annual cohort of people approved to  be H-1B workers (referred to as \u201capproved H-1B workers\u201d in this report)  offer some information on the characteristics of likely H-1B workers,  including their countries of birth, occupations, and education levels."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limitations in Agency Data Systems Hinder Tracking the Cap and H-1B Workers Over Time, Though Homeland Security Is Working to Improve Its Systems", "paragraphs": ["Although Homeland Security generally tracks the flow of likely H-1B  workers into the United States on an annual basis, it cannot determine the  size of the cumulative H-1B workforce because several agencies or  departments manage data on this population over time, and the systems  that capture the data are not easily linked. H-1B petition approvals are  captured in Homeland Security\u2019s CLAIMS 3 data system, as are changes in  visa status for approved H-1B workers who are already residing in the  country at the time of approval. However, visas for H-1B workers living  abroad at the time of approval are captured by a data system that is  administered by State and not linked to CLAIMS 3. Further, information on  visa holders who actually enter or exit the United States is tracked via  Homeland Security\u2019s United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator  Technology (US-VISIT) program, which is not systematically linked to  CLAIMS 3. Because these data systems do not use a unique, person-centric  identifier for H-1B workers, Homeland Security cannot determine, for  example, how many approved H-1B workers living abroad actually  received an H-1B visa and/or ultimately entered the country. Similarly,  Homeland Security does not track H-1B workers after their visas expire,  and cannot readily determine if and when H-1B workers apply for or are  granted legal permanent residency, leave the country, or remain in the  country on an expired visa. The fact that electronic records from different  systems are not linked also results in unnecessary duplication of efforts.  For example, according to State officials, while State has some capacity to  query Homeland Security\u2019s CLAIMS 3 database, its consular posts cannot  import data from CLAIMS 3 to their own data system, so State contractors  re-enter information from CLAIMS 3 manually into State\u2019s data system.", "Further, although Homeland Security is responsible for tracking the number  of H-1B petitions approved under the cap and the number of H-1B visas  issued, it does not maintain precise information on this. To implement the  statutory cap on H-1B visas, Homeland Security must take the necessary  steps to maintain an accurate count of the number of aliens subject to the  annual cap who are issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status  by the Immigration and Nationality Act. However, according to Homeland  Security officials, the department\u2019s current processes do not allow them to  determine precisely when approvals reach the number set by the cap.  Instead, they stop accepting initial petitions for new H-1B workers that are  subject to the cap when they estimate that the number of approved petitions  is approaching the mandated limit. In fiscal year 2005, Homeland Security\u2019s  Office of Inspector General found that USCIS exceeded the 65,000 cap limit  by about 7,000 approved petitions and recommended the agency maintain  more precise control over the number of H-1B visas issued. Although the  recommendation was closed by the Office of Inspector General in 2006,  Homeland Security officials concede they still cannot precisely count, in an  ongoing manner, petitions accepted under the cap despite several changes  in how the agency accepts, monitors, controls, and forecasts receipts for  submitted petitions subject to the cap. Further, officials noted that as long  as the process of submitting and adjudicating H-1B petitions remains the  same, they are unlikely to be able to provide a precise count of petitions  accepted under the cap.", "The capability to better track the cumulative H-1B workforce and petitions  accepted under the annual cap may develop with the eventual completion  of Homeland Security\u2019s program to modernize business processes and  information systems, although challenges remain. Homeland Security\u2019s  \u201cTransformation Program\u201d is a multiprogram, multiyear effort, ongoing  since 2005, that includes a plan to implement an electronic I-129 petition,  with a unique identifier for each H-1B worker. Using this identifier,  Homeland Security would likely be able to share data with State and other  external partners. Homeland Security officials reported, for example,  that they are currently working with agencies that include Justice and  State to create a cross-reference table of agency identifiers for individuals  applying for visas. Ultimately, the table would capture each record for th e  same person and employer from all partner agency programs, such that  records for a specific individual can be merged under one unique person- centric identifier. When this occurs, it will be possible to identify who is the United States at any one point in time under any and all visa program USCIS plans to develop internal guidance for the electronic I-129 petition  over the next 2 years.

One reason for this  increase may be the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004, which allowed for an  additional 20,000 approvals each year for foreign workers holding a  master\u2019s degree or higher from an American institute of higher education.  Since then, the proportion of approved H-1B workers who graduated with  a master\u2019s degree from an American institution of higher education  increased from 29 to 36 percent of all approved workers\u2014including initial  petitions and visa extensions.", "These findings are consistent with previously discussed findings that there  has been an increase in the number of approved H-1B workers receiving  advanced degrees from U.S. universities, as well as those who are already  residing in the United States at the time of H-1B visa approval.

On the one hand, if the H-1B program  successfully provides needed skills for the U.S. economy, economic theory  suggests that the program should contribute to long-run economic growth,  which is beneficial for all workers. For example, additional skilled labor  could increase innovation and productivity, potentially leading to  improved competitiveness of U.S. businesses, higher wages in aggregate,  and lower prices on goods and services purchased by American  consumers. On the other hand, certain groups of U.S. workers may  experience lower wages and employment as a result of the inflow of H-1B  workers. Furthermore, changes in the wages and employment of both U.S.  workers and H-1B workers reflect both changes in demand for labor and  changes in the supply of labor, making it difficult to determine the effect  that changes in the number of H-1B workers would have on outcomes for  U.S. workers.", "Although demand for H-1B workers seemed to fluctuate in concert with  broad economic indicators, relationships still cannot be inferred. As  shown in figure 12, the number of submitted H-1B petitions has generally  followed overall employment growth in the U.S. economy.

At the same time,  wage rates and employment levels for U.S. workers generally rise during  periods of economic growth. Therefore, the number of H-1B petitions  tends to rise when wages and employment for U.S. workers are rising  (although the number of approvals is limited by the H-1B cap), and to fall  when wages and employment for U.S. workers are falling. However, this  relationship does not reveal what the wage rates and employment rates of  U.S. workers would have been in the absence of H-1B workers.", "Due to these complex economic relationships, coupled with limitations in  data on the total H-1B workforce discussed previously, we did not attempt  to forecast the impacts of prospective changes in the H-1B cap on the U.S.  labor force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employment and Earnings Picture Was Mixed for Professions Absorbing H- 1Bs", "paragraphs": ["While GAO did not attempt to forecast the impacts of prospective changes  in the H-1B cap, we examined 10 years of retrospective data on the  employment, unemployment, and earnings of U.S. workers in the three  occupations that absorbed the largest proportion of H-1B workers relative  to the stock of U.S. workers in these occupations.

A  comparison of median annual salaries reveals that for systems analysts,  programmers, and other computer-related workers\u2014the largest of the  three occupational categories we examined\u2014H-1B workers tended to earn  less than U.S. workers; however, some of the salary gap appears to be  explained by differences in ages, which may reflect differences in the  extent of their work experience. As shown in table 1, which summarizes  the median reported earnings of H-1B and U.S. workers by age and  occupation, among systems analysts, programmers, and other computer- related workers, differences in median reported earnings between H-1B  workers aged 20 to 29 and U.S. workers of the same age were not  statistically significantly different, and the same was true for workers aged  30 to 39; however, H-1B workers aged 40 to 50 had median reported  earnings that were significantly lower than the median earnings of U.S.  workers in this occupation. Among electronics and electrical engineers,  we did not find significant differences in median earnings of approved   H-1B workers and U.S. workers, overall and within the age groups we  examined.

Several researchers and labor advocates have stated that technology  companies seek to replace older, American IT workers with cheaper,  younger workers that are freshly supplied through the H-1B program in  order to lower costs, and that IT companies have no incentive to retain  and retrain older workers with the latest skills, since the H-1B program  provides ready access to young workers with cutting-edge training. While  companies could use any young, skilled workers to lower their labor costs  in this manner, advocates argue that the H-1B program facilitates the  practice of displacing older IT workers because it provides an inflow of  new workers in IT fields that is much larger than would otherwise be  available to U.S. employers. The analysis presented here does not provide  a test of this theory because it does not identify what the wages of older  U.S. IT professionals would have been in the absence of the H-1B program,  nor does it account for the myriad factors affecting wage, for which we  lack data.", "Three researchers we spoke with expressed concern about the  disincentives that U.S. students face in entering science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. For example, one  disincentive is the duration of postdoctoral positions. Data show that since  the 1960s, postdoctoral positions\u2014which are generally exempt from the H- 1B cap\u2014have increased in length, with the largest increase in biological  sciences. One researcher posited that the increasing length of  postdoctoral positions, especially in the biomedical fields, is due in part to  the presence of large numbers of foreign nationals who are willing to work  in these low-paid positions for many years. For foreign nationals, these  postdoctoral positions may offer an entr\u00e9e into the U.S. labor market, and  the salaries may also compare well to the opportunities available in their  home countries.", "Testimonial evidence also suggests that U.S. software programmers,  particularly those seeking IT consulting jobs, may have been detrimentally  affected by the significant presence of H-1B workers and, in particular, by  the presence of certain staffing companies. One labor advocate we spoke  with stated that staffing companies that farm out H-1B IT workers to other  companies are abundant in the Northeast region of the country, and their  presence has dramatically reduced the availability of jobs for U.S. software  programmers in that region. Labor investigators we spoke with also noted  the concentration of H-1Bs in the IT consulting industry, particularly in the  Northeast region.

Although the Secretary of Labor has authority to initiate  investigations, Wage and Hour reported that it had never initiated an  investigation under this authority.

In 2009, only 664 out of 51,980  companies approved to hire new or extending H-1B workers had complaints  against them. According to agency officials, H-1B workers are likely to be  reluctant to file complaints against employers for fear that the company might  be disbarred, which in turn could result in the complainant and fellow H-1B  workers at the company losing their jobs and potentially having to leave the  United States. Further, investigators told us that even after an H-1B worker  files a complaint, the H-1B worker may not cooperate in the investigation for  fear of similar repercussions. In these instances, investigators are sometimes  unable to complete the investigation. The relatively small number of H-1B- related complaints in 2009 nevertheless resulted in Labor requiring companies  to pay over $10 million in unpaid wages to 1,202 workers and $739,929 in civil  monetary penalties (see table 3).", "Labor\u2019s ability to enforce worker protections under the program is also  hampered by obstacles cited by officials at both headquarters and in Wage  and Hour\u2019s Northeast Regional Office, which receives the greatest number  of H-1B complaints:  First, with the introduction in June 2009 of the automated \u201ciCERT\u201d system  maintained by Employment and Training, Wage and Hour stated that they  can no longer access the database of LCAs. Prior access had allowed  investigators to quickly assess the accuracy of the attestations made by an  employer. Without this access, officials stated that they must request the  LCA from the employer, which can increase the time and resources  required to conduct an investigation. Employment and Training reported  that improved access to the iCERT System is under development and  planned for implementation in April 2011.", "Second, Wage and Hour has limited ability to persuade employers to  cooperate with investigations. The fine it can levy against employers for  not cooperating is far less than the potential penalty for a finding of  noncompliance with the terms of the program. Investigators noted that  when employers do not cooperate, it can take them months to obtain the  requested paperwork, which essentially stalls the time-sensitive  investigation.", "Third, Wage and Hour lacks subpoena authority to obtain such records  directly from the employer. In contrast, Wage and Hour, as well as  Employment and Training, have subpoena power for other labor  protection programs they administer, such as under the Fair Labor  Standards Act and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker  Protection Act. According to Wage and Hour officials, subpoena power  increases cooperation from companies and is the most effective way to  speed up investigations, since companies could face harsh penalties, such  as debarment, for not cooperating. The Department of Justice also has  subpoena power for its investigations related to the H-1B program.  Justice officials we spoke with noted that while they rarely have to invoke  subpoena power in their investigations, generally employers are aware of  the subpoena power and are therefore more likely to comply with Justice\u2019s  requests for records.", "Homeland Security\u2019s Directorate of Fraud Detection and National  Security. In its capacity to investigate immigration fraud, FDNS has  recently introduced some proactive enforcement for the H-1B program  through several random investigations into temporary visa programs.  Through a Benefit Fraud and Compliance Assessment (BFCA), Homeland  Security examined 246 H-1B petitions for possible violations. The BFCA  found that 21 percent of H-1B petitions involved fraud or technical  violations. Examples of fraud include cases in which businesses listed on  the LCA and I-129 did not exist; educational degrees were found to be  fraudulent; signatures were forged on supporting documents; and H-1B  workers were performing duties or receiving payment significantly  different from those described in the applications.", "As a result of the high rate of fraud identified in the BFCA, Homeland  Security launched what it calls its Administrative Site Visit and Verification  Program\u2014an ongoing initiative to visit work sites of H-1B-hiring companies  considered to be at a higher risk for abusing the program, according to  officials. During fiscal year 2010, USCIS oversaw 14,433 H-1B site  inspections, which resulted in 1,176 adverse actions. Such actions can  include the revocation or denial of benefits, and may involve referral of a  case for criminal investigation.

Justice officials explained that  the low number of charges they receive is likely because U.S. workers are  often unaware that an employer intends to or did hire an H-1B worker. For  example, although employers are supposed to post a public statement  declaring their intention to hire an H-1B worker, the statement might be  posted in a lunch room where it may or may not be seen by affected  employees. Further, Labor investigators reported that many of the  companies they investigate do not comply with requirements to post  notice. In contrast, Labor requires applicants for other temporary visa  programs, such as the H-2A program, to display such postings on a  centralized Web site that is managed by Labor. Justice officials noted that  the lack of a centralized Web site makes it difficult for U.S. workers to  learn that U.S. employers are hiring H-1B workers and also for Justice to  monitor the compliance of companies with antidiscrimination law,  especially those operating offshore.", "Justice informally shares information on a periodic basis with Labor and  Homeland Security when it receives information about potential abuse  that does not fall under its jurisdiction.

As  previously noted, some staffing companies complete and submit to Labor  an LCA as the employing company, but then contract the H-1B worker out  to another employer. At times, that employer may contract the H-1B  worker out again, creating multiple middlemen according to officials (see  fig. 13). Regardless of where the H-1B worker is ultimately employed,  Wage and Hour officials told us that only the staffing company, as the  employer who has petitioned for the visa and made the attestations to  comply, is technically accountable and ultimately liable for complying  with program requirements. They explained that the contractual  relationship itself does not transfer the obligations of the contractor for  worker protection to any subsequent employers. Especially in instances in  which multiple middlemen are involved, it is difficult to expect the staffing  companies themselves to be accountable for the actions of an employer up  to three or four employers removed.", "Wage and Hour investigators reported that a large number of the  complaints they receive were related to the activities of staffing  companies. In fact, investigators from the Northeast region\u2014the region  that receives the highest number of H-1B complaints (see fig. 14)\u2014said  that nearly all of the complaints they receive involve staffing companies  and that the number of complaints are growing. However, the precise  number of complaints related to staffing companies is not known because  Labor does not track this information in its complaint data. The most  frequent type of violation resulting from a complaint is that the employer  failed to pay the required wage rate. Other frequent violations identified as  a result of complaints include the failure of the employer to post notice  that they intend to hire an H-1B worker and the failure to comply with the  attestations made in the LCA (see table 4).", "Complaints received by Wage and Hour pertaining to staffing companies  generally relate to the payment of H-1B workers, according to  investigators. Officials told us that the most common complaint associated  with staffing companies pertained to unpaid \u201cbenching\u201d\u2014when a staffing  company does not have a job placement for the H-1B worker and does not  pay them. In these instances, a staffing company sometimes asks the H-1B  worker to conduct their own job search or to take an unpaid leave until  the company identifies a client. For example, one investigator described  how one employer maintained a house for its unemployed H-1B workers,  and instructed them to conduct their own Internet searches for a job  placement. In another case, Wage and Hour found that a staffing company  forced employees to go on leave when it did not have jobs for them and  boarded them in a guesthouse while they were unemployed. At times,  employees are unaware of their right to receive payment during these  \u201cbenched\u201d time periods which, according to one complainant, lasted as  long as 13 months. Investigators said that the problem of unpaid benching  has become more severe with the economic downturn as staffing  companies have fewer jobs in which to place H-1B workers. Instead, they  may \u201cstockpile\u201d the workers in anticipation of an economic recovery.", "In investigating complaints related to staffing companies, investigators  often identify additional violations of the attestations on the LCA. For  example, Labor officials noted that in 90 percent of their investigations  related to staffing companies, the hiring company did not post notice of  the filing of the LCA indicating the intention to hire an H-1B worker. In  some instances, according to these officials, the subsequent employer may  not even know that the contracted worker is an H-1B worker, much less  be aware of any requirements associated with the visa\u2014such as the  requirement for employers to post notice of their filing of an LCA. In  addition, in some instances workers procured by staffing companies were  either not working for the employer listed or not performing the duties  described on the LCA.", "Some attempts have been made to control the use of staffing companies in  other visa programs and in the H-1B program. For example, the L-1 Visa  Reform (Intracompany Transferee) Act of 2004 essentially barred staffing  companies\u2014whose main revenue source is providing labor-for-hire\u2014from  receiving L-1 visas. However, according to experts we interviewed, some  staffing companies avoided this legal restriction by differentiating  themselves from staffing companies by describing themselves as \u201cIT  solutions\u201d companies. In addition to providing labor-for-hire, such  companies sell the development of a product, and therefore are not barred  from the use of L-1 visas. Additionally, in January 2010, Homeland Security  issued a memo on determining when there is a valid employer-employee  relationship between a staffing company and an H-1B worker for whom it  has obtained an H-1B visa. Whether there is such a relationship depends  largely on the right of a staffing company to control the manner and means  by which the H-1B nonimmigrant works.

This pay grade is designated for jobs needing a basic  understanding of duties and the ability of the worker to perform routine  tasks that require limited judgment. In comparison, 6 percent of approved  applicants whose wages were reported on the LCA were paid within the  top pay grade designated for workers that requires sufficient experience  and a high level of independent judgment.

The initial temporary nature of the  program and the annual cap were key tools to protect U.S. workers. Over  its history, however, Congress has made numerous changes to the  program, including broadening the eligibility requirements and allowing  for exemptions to the cap and for H-1B workers to pursue long-term  residency. The result is that, today, the number of H-1B workers approved  to enter the United States each year greatly exceeds the numeric limit  established by the cap, and the majority of applicants are categorized as  entry-level. Moreover, a substantial proportion appears to remain in the  country beyond the 6-year visa period in pursuit of permanent residency.  Homeland Security, faced with challenges in administering a program  managed in part by four different federal agencies, has difficulty tracking  the cap and cannot readily determine how many H-1B workers are  currently in the United States or how many stay after their visas expire.  Lack of information on the total H-1B workforce makes it impossible to  understand the long-term impact of the program and leaves the program  vulnerable to fraud and abuse\u2014a known issue in this program.", "Restrictions on agencies\u2019 abilities to enforce program requirements and  coordinate with one another widen the risk of fraud and abuse, and  undermine efforts to enforce worker protections. Restrictions on sharing  and leveraging information between and within federal agencies likely  inhibit the pursuit of worker allegations of abuse and allow some labor  abuses to go undetected. The involvement of staffing companies, whose  share of H-1B workers is not precisely known but is likely not trivial,  further weakens enforcement efforts because the end-user of the H-1B  worker is not liable for complying with labor protection requirements.", "At the same time, many members of the business community we  interviewed cited their own frustrations with the ability of this program to  serve their needs for high-skilled labor. The one-size-fits-all application  process wastes business and government resources in compiling and  reviewing paperwork on well-vetted companies with years of experience  in the program. The lottery system does not permit companies to prioritize  their candidates, and as a result, coveted H-1B slots may not be allocated  to companies\u2019 top candidates. The annual application cycle hinders  flexibility in hiring, prompting some companies to prematurely petition for  candidates instead of holding out for better ones in years when the cap is  hit early. Moreover, start-up companies, which some argue are the  backbone of innovation in the United States, cannot use the H-1B visa for  their employees until their company is fully established.", "In an era when companies are competing in a global market for cutting- edge skills, the H-1B program plays an important role. As currently  structured, however, the program may not be used to its full potential and  may be detrimental in some cases. Some improvements can be made  through executive actions by the agencies overseeing the program.  However, balancing the needs of the economy for high-skilled foreign  labor and protecting the employment and wages of current U.S. workers is  a policy matter for Congress. Certainly there are no easy solutions, but  data we present suggest that the program may continue to fall short and  raise difficult policy questions. Such questions include the appropriateness  of the current qualifications for H-1B workers, the use of H-1B visas as a  bridge to permanent residence, the involvement of staffing companies in  the H-1B program, and exemptions from the cap.

However,  in our review of the department\u2019s memorandum of agreement and letter of  intent with State that discuss such exchanges, we did not find specific  references to improving cap management with State\u2019s visa data. Further,  Homeland Security added that data to be exchanged with State may only  slightly improve cap management because State\u2019s data (1) do not include  individuals already in the United States who are seeking to change their  visa status, and (2) will be too old to assist Homeland Security with cap  management, since it is typically months after Homeland Security  approves petitions that State issues visas to individuals residing outside of  the United States.", "We understand that, for individuals already residing in the United States,  Homeland Security does not depend on State, but has its own data on  changes in visa status for approved H-1B workers. We also acknowledge  that for individuals residing outside of the United States, there is some lapse  in time between Homeland Security\u2019s approval of an H-1B petition and  State\u2019s issuance (or decision not to issue) a visa. Nevertheless, we maintain  that possessing timely and accurate information on petitions and visas that  count against the cap for all individuals\u2014both within and outside the United  States\u2014could provide a more reliable basis for ongoing monitoring with  respect to the annual visa cap. Improved tracking would in turn provide  Homeland Security the information it needs to reduce the potential for  exceeding the visa cap and ensure that, in high-demand years, only 65,000  visas are issued. In response to Homeland Security\u2019s comments, we clarified  our recommendation with respect to the steps it should take, including the  importance of incorporating better tracking mechanisms in the business  rules to be developed for the new electronic petition system.", "With regard to our recommendation that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  explore options for increasing the flexibility of the application process for  H-1B employers within its statutory authority, Homeland Security raised  several concerns about the feasibility of our suggested options and noted  one initiative under way that may expedite the application process for  employers. We continue to believe that additional efforts are warranted to  more fully explore the potential benefits and costs of these options.", "Homeland Security said it believes that current law does not allow the  department to exempt petitioners with track records of H-1B compliance  from evidentiary requirements. However, we believe there may be  additional opportunities to streamline the application process for  businesses by not requiring them to resubmit evidence that they have  already provided, without exempting petitioners from evidentiary  requirements. Homeland Security noted its own initiative\u2014the Validation  Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) system\u2014is intended to reduce  the need for petitioners to submit certain documentation by providing the  department with the means to verify the petitioners\u2019 information through  an independent source, but acknowledged in its technical comments that  the system will not necessarily reduce the burden of providing supporting  documentation for petitioners in the immediate future.", "Homeland Security noted that implementation of a beneficiary ranking  process would be extremely complicated and resource intensive and  would decrease flexibility for employers. We continue to believe that such  obstacles could be surmountable through technology. For example,  petitioner-level electronic accounts\u2014as planned in the electronic petition  system slated for 2012\u2014could allow employers to manage, and possibly  change, their rankings without necessarily decreasing their flexibility.  Homeland Security also stated that implementing a quarterly cap  allocation is neither warranted nor feasible. Again, we believe that  distributing the annual cap in allotments throughout the year might be  feasible with an electronic petition system. For example, quarterly  allocations of visas could be administered by creating an electronic queue  whereby petitions that were not selected in one lottery round would have  priority in the next. An automated cap management system that combines  electronic tracking and queuing might reduce, for federal managers  themselves, the level of complexity involved in managing the program.  Homeland Security also expressed concern that a ranking system might  encourage petitioners to over-submit petitions in an attempt to increase  their chances of obtaining H-1B workers. The department is, nevertheless,  considering a similar option that would allow petitioners to request visa  slots prior to submitting an LCA. Whether or not petitioners would over- submit in response to either option is a matter that we believe should be  further studied or tested. In summary, we believe that Homeland Security\u2019s  ongoing Transformation Project\u2014currently in its development phase\u2014 affords the opportunity to explore creative and thoughtful solutions to the  challenges of administering the H-1B program. Such an examination could  weigh the potential costs and risks associated with the options we  outlined against their potential benefits in savings for taxpayers and  petitioners\u2014with the ultimate goal of supporting legitimate business  needs while not compromising worker protections.", "Homeland Security disagreed with our asking Congress to consider  transferring the review of the LCA from Labor to U.S. Citizen and  Immigration Services, citing internal lack of expertise in wage and labor  determinations and Labor\u2019s role in enforcing labor violations. While we  recognize Labor\u2019s expertise, Labor officials told us that, unless its legal  authority is expanded to allow for verification of employer attestations,  the Employment and Training Administration\u2019s review can only ensure  that employers have completed the form\u2019s questions and check-box  questionnaire and that there are no obvious inaccuracies. We maintain that  such a limited review could be readily subsumed in Homeland Security\u2019s  petition adjudication process because it too reviews the LCA. We are not  recommending that Labor\u2019s enforcement role, carried out by its Wage and  Hour Division, be transferred to Homeland Security. Further, we do not  believe that Labor\u2019s enforcement efforts would be compromised by  transferring the LCA approval process to Homeland Security, especially in  light of challenges Wage and Hour faces with gaining access to LCA  information from the Employment and Training Administration, as  identified in this report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Homeland  Security, Labor, and State, the Attorney General, appropriate  congressional committees, and other interested parties.

An H-1B visa might be used, but the beneficiary would not be in the ADIS  system for several reasons. First, the ADIS system became fully  operational in January 2004; those who were already in the United States  at the time they submitted their H-1B petition (such as students enrolled in  U.S. universities) and did not enter or exit the country after January 2004  may not have been entered in the ADIS system. In addition, some  beneficiaries who entered the United States by land may have entered the  country without going through an official border station where they  submit an I-94 form. Finally, a beneficiary\u2019s record may not be in the ADIS  system due to data quality problems. For example, if an H-1B beneficiary  changed their name through marriage and subsequently had an I-485  submitted on their behalf, US-VISIT may at times be unable to link the   I-485 submission to the H-1B beneficiary due to the name change.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2009 through January  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
