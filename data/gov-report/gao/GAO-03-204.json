Job Access grantees used various approaches to provide transportation for this purpose, such as expanding existing bus service, adding new areas to be served by an existing fixed transit route, or enhancing the frequency of the service. The program has met its goal of encouraging collaboration among transportation, human service, and other community-based agencies in Job Access service design, implementation, and financing. However, most of the program's services are not financially sustainable. For example, 12 percent of Job Access grantees indicated that they could continue their services after the end of program funding, while 41 percent reported they would likely terminate or decrease services, and 47 percent were uncertain about their ability to continue those services. DOT has not evaluated the Job Access program or reported to the Congress, as TEA-21 requires. The department therefore is missing an opportunity to provide timely information to the Congress that could assist it in deciding whether to reauthorize the program in 2003. GAO has several concerns about DOT's plans to evaluate the Job Access program. For its evaluation, DOT initially planned to use one performance measure--employment sites served. However, using a methodology that is based on this measure would yield limited information because it only partially addresses the program's goal of providing transportation to low-income people and does not address other program goals and criteria. Federal Transit Administration (FTA) program officials informed GAO that they also plan to use other performance measures, but they did not provide sufficient detail for GAO to comment on the quality of their evaluation. Moreover, the final report's date of issuance and its contents are uncertain because the report has yet to be reviewed and approved by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, and the Office of Management and Budget.

One important factor in welfare  recipients\u2019 finding and keeping work is their access to adequate  transportation. In 1998, the Congress found that while three-fourths of  welfare recipients lived in central cities or rural areas, two-thirds of new  jobs were located in the suburbs. Public transportation facilities, such as  buses or subways, often offer limited or no access to many of the places  where jobs are located. As a result, the Transportation Equity Act for the  21st Century (TEA-21) authorized up to $750 million for fiscal years 1999  through 2003 for the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Job Access and  Reverse Commute (Job Access) Program. The program attempts to fill gaps  in transportation services that constitute barriers to low-income people  accessing job opportunities. The program provides grants to transit  agencies, local human service agencies, and others. DOT\u2019s two major goals  for the program are to (1) provide transportation and related services to  urban, suburban, and rural areas to assist low-income individuals,  including welfare recipients, with access to employment and related  services, such as child care and training, and (2) increase collaboration  among such parties as transportation providers, human service agencies,  employers, and others in planning, funding, and delivering those services.  Since TEA-21 expires at the end of fiscal year 2003, the Congress will soon  be making decisions regarding the possible reauthorization of the Job  Access Program.", "TEA-21 requires that we report on the implementation of the Job Access  Program. To date, we have issued six reports on the Program from May  1998 through December 2001, and we also testified on the Program in April  2002 before the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, House Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure.

We  selected these experts on the basis of our review of transit and welfare  reform literature and referrals from HHS, Labor, DOT, and national  associations, such as the Community Transportation Association of America (CTAA). We also visited and documented activities at 14 locations  where Job Access projects were being implemented. We judgmentally  selected these locations to obtain a nationwide geographic dispersion of  existing projects; different sizes (large urban, medium-size urban, and  small cities/rural areas) of the areas served by Job Access projects; and  various types of services funded by Job Access grants. Moreover, to  address the first objective of our study, we monitored DOT\u2019s efforts to  evaluate the effectiveness of the program and report to the Congress by  June 2000, as required by TEA-21.

Also, under the TANF Program, states provide cash assistance to needy  families with children and provide parents with job preparation; work; and  support services, including transportation benefits. The 1996 act gave  states flexibility in designing their programs to best provide those benefits  and services.   HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families manages the  TANF Program and has provided about $16.5 billion annually for states to  use to assist needy families to become self-sufficient, including about $800  million annually for transportation benefits. In addition, Labor\u2019s  Employment and Training Administration administers programs authorized  under WIA, with about $4 billion in fiscal year 2002 appropriations to  provide individuals with job training and placement services. The WIA- sponsored programs also provide transportation services to take their  clients to program-supported services, such as job training and placement.

Many low-income  people and welfare recipients do not have access to cars and existing  public transportation systems cannot always bridge the gap between where  low-income people live and where jobs are located. In addition, many  entry-level jobs require shift work in evenings or on weekends, when public  transportation services are either limited or unavailable. When the Job  Access Program was established, $750 million was authorized from fiscal  years 1999 through 2003 for the Program. Appropriations have totaled $375  million through fiscal year 2002, with $75 million appropriated in each of  the fiscal years 1999 and 2000, and $100 million and $125 million  appropriated for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, respectively.", "The Job Access Program was established to close gaps in transportation  services for low-income people in places where and at times when such  transportation was not available. The program addressed these gaps by  funding, through grants, new transportation and related services and  expanding existing services to help low-income people access employment  opportunities and related support services. TEA-21 identified a variety of  factors for DOT to consider in funding Job Access projects, such as the  need for Job Access services as evidenced by the percentage of the  population in the area receiving welfare benefits; the demonstrated  collaboration between the grantee and other stakeholders, such as other  transportation and human service agencies; and the extent to which an  applicant identified long-term financing strategies that would support the  Job Access services after the end of the grant. Job Access grantees are  required to provide at least 50 percent matching funds from other sources,  which may include federal sources of funds available for transportation  services, such as the TANF or WIA programs.", "DOT has consistently used two goals that it synthesized from TEA-21 as the  primary criteria for evaluating, selecting, and funding Job Access projects  to be funded through program grants. Those goals are that Job Access  projects and services funded should  provide transportation and related services to urban, suburban, and  rural areas to assist low-income individuals, including welfare  recipients, with access to employment and related services, such as  child care and training, and   increase collaboration among such parties as transportation providers,  human service agencies, employers, and others in designing, funding,  and delivering those transportation services.", "In selecting Job Access projects, DOT also considered the extent to which  the projects would be financially sustainable after the end of Job Access  Program funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT\u2019s Evaluation Has Been Delayed and May Not Address Significant Aspects of the Job Access Program", "paragraphs": ["DOT has not reported to the Congress on the results of an evaluation of the  Job Access Program, as TEA-21 required.

Another 47  percent of the grantees responded that they were uncertain about their  ability to continue their services. The remaining 12 percent reported that  they would continue their projects at the same or expanded levels after the  end of their Job Access funding.

To date, we have issued a report on transportation  and welfare reform efforts in May 1998, before the program was  established, and five other reports on the program: in December 1998,  November 1999, December 2000, August 2001, and December 2001.", "In May 1998, we reported that the proposed Job Access Program would aid  the national welfare reform effort by, among other things, providing  additional resources to transport welfare recipients to work. We  recommended that the Department of Transportation (DOT) (1) establish  specific objectives, performance criteria, and goals for measuring the  program\u2019s progress; (2) require grantees to coordinate transportation  strategies with local job placement and other social service agencies; and  (3) work with other federal agencies to coordinate welfare-to-work  activities. TEA-21 reflected these recommendations and required  appropriate action by DOT.", "Our December 1998 report was the first to be completed in response to the  TEA-21 mandate that we periodically review and report on the  implementation of the Job Access Program. We reported on DOT\u2019s  preliminary steps and strategy for implementing the Job Access Program,  noting that DOT\u2019s overall plan for implementing the program included  distributing grant funds to as many areas throughout the United States as  possible, subject to grant funding limits of $1 million for large urban areas  and $150,000 for rural areas. DOT announced that it would use several  criteria for selecting projects to fund, including a project\u2019s effectiveness in  serving a demonstrated regional need; the degree of local coordination  with other regional stakeholders demonstrated by the prospective grantee  in designing and identifying funding for a project; and the project\u2019s financial  plans and sustainability after the end of Job Access funding. An  application\u2019s compliance with these factors would be weighted for each  factor, and DOT said that it would also award bonus points for innovative  approaches to providing Job Access services. DOT also considered the  geographic dispersion of projects in making award decisions. We noted  that DOT made important efforts in attempting to establish communication  channels with various federal welfare reform agencies through its role in a  policy council that involved the White House and other agencies in  formulating interagency policy decisions about the Job Access Program.  DOT also formulated \u201cJoint Guidance\u201d with the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Labor (Labor) on how the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program and Welfare-to- Work Program funds could be used as matching funds to help pay for Job  Access projects. Regarding evaluation of the Job Access Program, DOT  initially established four types of data it would collect from grantees in  assessing the performance of Job Access grants and the Job Access  Program: (1) the number of new and expanded transportation services  (including data on service frequency, hours, and miles); (2) the number of  jobs made accessible by the Job Access project; (3) the number of people  using the new service; and (4) the level of collaboration achieved. We  agreed that these were good measures for monitoring Job Access projects,  but DOT still needed to measure the program\u2019s overall success by  establishing programwide goals or benchmarks against which the  cumulative data on new routes, new system users, and newly accessible  jobs could be compared.", "In November 1999, we reported on the implementation of the pProgram in  fiscal year 1999, its first year. We found that DOT had implemented our  second and third recommendations in carrying out TEA-21. Specifically,  DOT had required grantees to coordinate transportation strategies with  local job placement and other social service agencies and had worked with  other federal agencies to coordinate welfare-to-work activities. DOT also  had taken preliminary steps to implement our first recommendation that it  establish specific objectives, performance criteria, and goals for measuring  the program\u2019s progress. However, we also found that DOT\u2019s process for  selecting Job Access grant proposals was not consistent in fiscal year 1999,  and the basis for some selections was unclear.", "Our December 2000 report examined DOT\u2019s implementation of the  Program in fiscal year 2000. We found that DOT had taken steps to improve  its process for selecting Job Access proposals. For example, to promote  greater consistency in the evaluation and selection of grantees, DOT  developed a standard format for reviewing Job Access proposals and  provided more detailed guidance to its reviewers. Almost 90 percent of the  fiscal year 1999 Job Access grantees that responded to our survey were  satisfied with the goals and intent of the program. However, 51 percent  said that satisfying various standard FTA grant requirements took too  long\u2014about 9 months, on average. As a result, about one-third of  respondents reported experiencing problems in obtaining matching funds.  In addition, seven projects were withdrawn (about 4 percent of Job Access  projects) for various reasons, including, in one case, the loss of matching  funds. In this report, we note that DOT had implemented our  recommendation that it develop specific objectives, performance criteria,  and measurable goals for its Job Access Program evaluation. DOT  developed a goal to increase new employment sites by 4,050 in fiscal year  2000, and 8,050 in fiscal year 2001, and it had requested specific data from  the grantees.", "Our August 2001 report provided our preliminary observations on (1)  DOT\u2019s proposal to use a formula for allocating grant funds to the states, (2)  the status of obligations for the Job Access Program, and (3) DOT\u2019s plans  for reporting on the program to the Congress. First, DOT had proposed a  change to the Job Access Program beginning in fiscal year 2002, under  which it would allocate funding to the states via a formula, instead of to  individual grantees. DOT proposed this change in response to language in  the conference reports accompanying DOT\u2019s appropriations acts for fiscal  years 2000 and 2001 that designated Job Access funding for specific states,  localities, and organizations. Second, as of August 7, 2001, DOT had  obligated 94 percent of the funds for fiscal year 1999, 67 percent of the  funds for fiscal year 2000, and 20 percent of the funds for fiscal year 2001.  Third, DOT officials had missed the June 2000 deadline for a status report  to the Congress but expected to report instead in September 2001.", "Our December 2001 report primarily addressed DOT\u2019s response to language  in conference reports that accompanied its fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year  2001 appropriations statutes. The conference reports designated specific  grantees that were to receive Job Access funding; these grants involved up  to three-quarters of the appropriated funding for the Job Access Program in  a fiscal year. DOT elected to award grants to the designated parties in a  noncompetitive fashion; however, in doing so, it was not in compliance  with the provisions of the authorizing legislation\u2014TEA-21\u2014because the  act called for a competitive grant selection process. To address this finding,  we recommended that DOT implement a competitive selection process for  all prospective grantees, including those that were designated by language  in conference reports. As a result of our recommendation, DOT announced  that it would implement a competitive selection process for all grantees\u2014 congressional designated and otherwise.", "On April 17, 2002, we testified on the Job Access Program before the  Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, House Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure. We emphasized the need for DOT to  evaluate the program as directed by TEA-21. We noted that, at the time of  our testimony, DOT had no estimated date for issuing the required report.

In  addition, through our discussions with program officials, transportation  and welfare reform experts, and national associations, we identified  prospective measurements of program success and discussed the  availability and appropriateness of those measurements for an evaluation  of the Job Access Program.", "In responding to our second objective, we examined the services delivered  by Job Access projects in assisting low-income people access jobs and job- related services. Specifically, we followed up on our previous findings,  observations, and recommendations from our reports; reviewed the  agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to solicit, evaluate, and select Job Access grantees  in fiscal year 2002; and examined DOT\u2019s ongoing implementation of  existing grants and projects. Our November 1999 report contained an  analysis of project data regarding the transportation-related services  delivered by all 181 projects selected in fiscal year 1999. Those projects  constitute over 80 percent of the projects that are still operating today. We  used this information to supplement our discussion of the types of services  funded through Job Access grants.", "As part of the work for our second objective, we assessed whether the Job  Access Program was increasing collaboration in the design, financing, and  delivery of the services of Job Access projects\u2014a program goal. We  addressed the issue of collaborative project design, financing, and delivery  in our survey of 173 Job Access grantees selected in fiscal years 1999 and  2000 that are still implementing Job Access projects. We also examined  how the implementation of individual Job Access projects has been  integrated into the transportation and human service efforts of states and  local communities by observing the interactions between grantees,  metropolitan planning organizations, transit agencies, and human service  agencies, such as those in the Albany, New York, area; the Washington,  D.C., metropolitan area; the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, area; the San  Francisco Bay area; and the Louisville, Kentucky, area.", "Meeting our second objective also required that we assess whether the Job  Access Program was meeting a criterion for FTA\u2019s selection of Job Access  projects\u2014whether the projects could achieve financial sustainability of  their services after program funding terminates. Our previous work on the  Job Access Program showed that many projects might not be sustained if  their Job Access funding terminated; therefore, our survey of Job Access  grantees included questions about the likelihood of Job Access projects  retaining their matching funds and continuing to operate. We also inquired  about the prospects for projects\u2019 financial sustainability with the grantees  we selected for site visits and discussed financial sustainability with Job  Access Program officials, national associations, and welfare reform and  transportation experts.", "Finally, as part of our second objective, we examined the use of federal  funds from other programs as matching funds for Job Access projects. Job  Access Program regulations require that grantees obtain at least 50 percent  of their project funding from non-DOT sources, which may include funding  from federal sources such as the TANF Program and the Workforce  Investment Act (WIA)-sponsored programs of Labor. We therefore  reviewed policies affecting coordination and cost-sharing in federal  programs, which included Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87,  and we contacted DOT, HHS, and Labor officials about their efforts to  refine the interagency \u201cJoint Guidance\u201d regarding matching funds for Job  Access Program grants.", "In addition, we selected and utilized three broad methodologies that  addressed both objectives of our study.
