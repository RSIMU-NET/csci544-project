The Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954,commonly known as Public Law (P.L.) 480, established the legal framework for U.S. food aid. The title I program is one of the three food aid programs authorized under P.L. 480 and is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Under the title I program, U.S. agricultural commodities are sold on long-term credit terms at below-market-rate interest to developing countries.", "Numerous acts, including the most recent amendments in the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act have revised the goals and provisions of P.L. 480. The P.L. 480 legislation and its amendments have always consisted of a composite of multiple and sometimes competing objectives. While the emphasis among the various P.L. 480 program objectives has shifted over time to reflect the changing needs of domestic farm policy and emerging foreign policy developments, the importance of the title I program as a U.S. export program and U.S. food aid program has diminished significantly since the program\u2019s inception in 1954. Title I commodity exports, which once represented a significant share of the total value of U.S. food aid and U.S. agricultural exports, have declined dramatically\u2014representing about 14 percent of the total value of U.S. food aid and less than 1 percent of U.S. agricultural exports in fiscal year 1993.", "For this review, we assessed the impact of title I assistance on (1) broad-based, sustainable development in recipient countries and (2) long-term market development for U.S. agricultural goods in those countries. In addition, we evaluated the effect of the 1990 act on the interagency coordination of the title I program, the content of development plans included as part of title I agreements with recipient countries, and the process for selecting and funding countries for title I assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "P.L. 480 Food Aid Consists of Three Programs", "paragraphs": ["The P.L. 480 legislation, as amended, authorizes international food assistance under three different programs: government-to-government concessional loans that offer long-term, low-interest-rate credit (title I program); donations (title II program); and grants (title III program). Specifically, the three P.L. 480 programs are intended to provide the following types of assistance:", "Title I (trade and development assistance) authorizes concessional loans to developing countries that are short of foreign exchange and have difficulty meeting their food needs through commercial channels. The 1990 act gives priority to countries that are experiencing the greatest need for food, are undertaking economic development measures, and have demonstrated a potential to become commercial agricultural markets for U.S. exports. This type of food aid program is unique to the United States: no other country offers a food assistance program using long-term, low-interest concessional loans (i.e., repayment terms of 10 years or more and interest rates below prevailing market rates).", "Title II (emergency and private assistance programs) authorizes donations of agricultural commodities to provide emergency feeding programs and carry out activities to alleviate the causes of hunger, disease, and death.", "Title III (food for development) authorizes grants of agricultural commodities to be (1) used for food distribution programs and the development of food reserves or (2) sold and the proceeds used for economic development purposes. The 1990 act targets title III aid for least-developed countries. Before the 1990 legislative changes, the title III program forgave debt incurred under title I if the recipient governments used the local currencies generated from the sale of title I commodities to finance mutually agreed-upon development projects.", "Under the 1990 act, before an agricultural commodity can be considered for export under any one of the P.L. 480 programs, the domestic supply of that commodity in the United States must be in excess of what is needed to meet domestic consumption requirements, provide adequate surplus for domestic reserves, and meet anticipated export opportunities. Each fiscal year, the Secretary of Agriculture announces a P.L. 480 \u201cdocket\u201d that lists the types and amounts of agricultural commodities available for sale or donation under the three P.L. 480 programs. Agricultural commodities typically sold under the title I program are bulk commodities (i.e., wheat, rice, corn, and cotton) and semiprocessed commodities (i.e., vegetable oil, wheat flour, and tallow).", "Commodities typically donated under title II and III assistance include those exported under the title I program as well as legumes (e.g., beans, peas, and lentils) and soyproducts. According to officials from USDA, several commodities that are regularly on the P.L. 480 docket represent planned production for export rather than an accidental byproduct of U.S. farmers\u2019 overproduction during a year. For example, USDA considers the P.L. 480 programs at the outset of the fiscal year when it sets production goals and establishes acreage reduction programs to remove farm land from production for price-supported crops, such as wheat, corn, rice, and cotton.", "The total volume of U.S. agricultural goods exported and the total amount of program funds allocated for titles I, II, and III in fiscal year 1993 are presented in table 1.1. Countries are not restricted to receiving one type of U.S. food aid and can participate in more than one food aid program simultaneously. For example, many title I and title III recipients also receive title II assistance. Appendix I lists the countries that participated under each of the P.L. 480 programs and the value of the agricultural commodities exported in fiscal year 1993.", "In addition to encompassing expenditures for agricultural commodities, the P.L. 480 programs also include expenditures for ocean freight, or the cost of shipping title I commodities to recipient countries. Cargo preference provisions require that at least 75 percent of the P.L. 480 commodity tonnage be shipped on U.S. flag ships rather than on generally less expensive foreign flag vessels. The cost to the U.S. Treasury to ship title I commodities during fiscal year 1993 was $58.3 million (see table 1.1). Ocean freight expenditures are lower under the title I program than the other P.L. 480 programs because the U.S. government reimburses the recipient countries only for the amount by which the cost to ship on U.S. vessels exceeds the cost to carry the same commodities on vessels of other countries. In comparison, the ocean freight expenditures are higher for commodities donated under the title II and III programs because the U.S. government pays for the entire ocean freight costs via U.S. or foreign flag vessels.", "Although title I assistance is a concessional loan program in which recipients are expected to pay back the amount of the loan plus interest, according to officials at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the U.S. government never fully recovers the cost of the loans. In other words, the outlays for the commodities are greater than the present value of the expected returns, which include expected principal payments plus interest. Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508, 1990), USDA and OMB must estimate the subsidy rate for program loans to determine the total budgetary cost of the title I concessional loans. The composite subsidy rate for all of the individual title I concessional loans in fiscal year 1993 was approximately 64 percent, according to USDA officials. Therefore, even though title I is a loan program, the actual cost of the fiscal year 1993 title I concessional loans to the U.S. Treasury is estimated to be $223 million on the basis of $332.8 million in title I loans made to recipients for commodity purchases during that fiscal year. In other words, OMB expects the U.S. Treasury to get back, on average, $.36 for every $1.00 loaned under the 1993 title I program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Manages the Title I Concessional Loan Program", "paragraphs": ["As part of its program management responsibilities, USDA directs the selection of title I recipients and the amount of money they receive under the program. In fiscal year 1993, 22 countries imported title I commodities from the United States in amounts ranging from $5 million to $40 million (see table 1.2 for title I allocations for fiscal years 1992 to 1994). In addition, 8 of the 22 title I recipients in fiscal year 1993 also received title II assistance, and 1 country, Sri Lanka, also received title III assistance. Several of the recipients were countries of the former Soviet Union and were first-time participants of the program in fiscal year 1992. While USDA hopes to transform title I recipients into commercial importers, their \u201cgraduation\u201d from the program can be a long and uncertain event. For example, 6 of the 22 recipients in fiscal year 1993 have been in the program for 20 years or more.", "The main impact of the 1990 legislative changes on title I allocations was to shift several former recipients of title I assistance to the newly revised title III program. However, events since the 1990 act have spurred even greater changes in the allocation of title I assistance. Egypt, one of title I\u2019s largest and longest-term recipients, did not use approximately $100 million of its fiscal year 1992 allocation and subsequently dropped out of the program in fiscal year 1993. In 1991, Egypt\u2019s financial picture vastly improved, in large part as the result of U.S. and allied debt forgiveness following the 1991 Gulf War. The unused $100-million program allocation represented about 25 percent of title I\u2019s total program value for that year. At the same time, countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had become more important participants in U.S. assistance programs. During fiscal years 1992 and 1993, USDA was able to initiate title I programs in many of these countries using title I funds that may have otherwise been allocated to Egypt.", "Once a country is selected to participate in the title I program, USDA negotiates title I agreements with recipient government officials to determine the types and quantities of commodities the country will import. Under the title I program, countries purchase commodities selected from the P.L. 480 docket with concessional credit provided by the U.S. government. The concessional terms include a maximum 30-year period for repayment, with a maximum 7-year grace period and interest rates below prevailing market rates. USDA also negotiates with the recipient country to include a statement in the title I agreement describing how the assistance provided will be integrated into the country\u2019s overall development and food security plans (see app. III for development plans for our seven case-study countries in fiscal year 1992 title I agreements)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Importance of Title I Program Have Changed", "paragraphs": ["While the emphasis among the various P.L. 480 goals has shifted over time to accommodate changing U.S. farm and foreign policy interests, the domestic and international conditions that engendered the inception of the U.S.\u2019 food aid program in 1954 have altered even more so. An increase in donations of food aid by other countries and the creation of new USDA market development programs designed to expand U.S. exports have significantly reduced the importance of the title I program as a worldwide food aid program as well as its importance as a U.S. agricultural export and surplus disposal program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Title I Goals Have Shifted Over Time", "paragraphs": ["According to the literature we reviewed on the history of the P.L. 480 legislation, when P.L. 480 was enacted in 1954 its goals were to move large amounts of U.S. surplus agricultural commodities to needy countries and serve U.S. foreign interests as well as develop future markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. At the time, the United States was the primary producer of agricultural commodities worldwide, there was a shortage of international purchasing power after World War II, and there was a great humanitarian need for food aid. Most U.S. food aid was sold to foreign governments through title I loans, but some was donated for disaster relief, economic development, and feeding programs. All countries, except some communist nations, were eligible to participate in the title I program.", "Although none of the original goals of the P.L. 480 legislation were abandoned, amendments in 1966 reoriented the goals of the P.L. 480 program toward combating world hunger. The 1966 amendments required that recipient countries sign self-help contracts as part of every title I agreement to encourage the countries to improve their domestic agricultural and food production. Amendments in 1968 expanded the use of loan repayments in local currency for self-help contracts and development programs. Title I loan repayments in local currencies were phased down between 1966 and 1971, emphasizing long-term credit sales for dollars and for convertible local currencies.", "In the early 1970s, agricultural prices soared as worldwide agricultural production stagnated and worldwide demand for agricultural products expanded. Demand increased because of strong economic growth in developing countries and rising commercial imports by the Soviet Union. The amount of U.S. surplus commodities drastically diminished, and Congress did not raise title I program appropriations to cover the increased costs of providing food aid. Amendments to the P.L. 480 legislation in 1973 and 1974 attempted to direct the distribution of P.L. 480 funds, including title I, to serve the most needy countries. Ultimately, the amendments required that 75 percent of the title I concessional sales go to countries designated by the United Nations as most seriously affected by food shortages.", "Amendments in 1977 shifted the emphasis of the food aid program to promoting the self-sufficiency of recipient countries. Recipient governments were encouraged to use proceeds from local sales of title I commodities for agricultural and rural development projects under a revised title III program. The focus of P.L. 480 shifted again in the 1981 amendment, when social development objectives became paramount. Recipient countries were urged to use local currency proceeds from the sale of title I commodities to support literacy and health programs for the rural poor. These development objectives were retained in the 1985 amendments to P.L. 480.", "By the late 1980s, both U.S. foreign assistance funds and U.S. farm surpluses to help meet global food aid needs were becoming more scarce. Under the 1990 amendments to P.L. 480, the focus of the food aid programs shifted again. Currently, the goal of P.L. 480, including title I, is to promote U.S. foreign policy by enhancing the food security of developing countries through the use of agricultural commodities and local currencies to (1) combat world hunger and malnutrition and their causes; (2) promote sustainable economic development, including agricultural development; (3) expand international trade; (4) develop and expand export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities; and (5) encourage the growth of private enterprise and democratic participation in developing countries. Food security was defined in the 1990 act as \u201caccess by all people at all times to sufficient food and nutrition for a healthy and productive life.\u201d", "While the 1990 act emphasized food security\u2014an economic development and food assistance issue\u2014it also assigned title I program management responsibilities to USDA, whose international responsibilities are foreign market development for U.S. agricultural goods, rather than to the Agency for International Development (AID), which is an international economic development agency. The 1990 act removed the requirement that 75 percent of title I commodity sales go to countries that were defined as those with the lowest income, allowing USDA more flexibility in selecting title I recipients.

Although the United States remains a world leader in providing food assistance, title I\u2019s share of both total world food aid and U.S. agricultural exports has decreased substantially since the inception of the P.L. 480 programs. During the 1950s and 1960s, the United States provided about 90 percent of world food aid, and title I represented around 80 percent of U.S. food aid. As other countries began to increase their food aid donations in the 1970s, the U.S. share of world food aid decreased, to about 50 percent by 1980 and continued to decrease to about 43 percent by 1992.

Our seven-case study countries were: Egypt and Morocco (northern Africa), Sri Lanka and the Philippines (East Asia), El Salvador and Guatemala (Central America), and Jamaica (the Caribbean). We selected these seven case-study countries in four geographic regions because they represented a variety of title I recipients in terms of program size, mix of USDA and AID programs, and length of title I participation. In fiscal year 1992, these seven countries received 51 percent of the total title I program funds.", "To assess the impact of title I assistance on long-term economic development and market development in our case-study countries as well as other recipient countries, we conducted interviews with and obtained documents from officials with USDA and its Economic Research Service (ERS), AID, OMB, the State Department, the World Bank, and U.S. commodity groups in Washington, D.C. In each country we visited, we interviewed U.S. and host government officials; representatives from U.S. commodity groups; and other parties, such as foreign food aid donors, importers, and exporters. We also reviewed literature that evaluated title I\u2019s long-term impact on economic development, agricultural development, and commercial trade in recipient countries.", "To estimate the maximum foreign exchange savings made possible when a country imports title I commodities and to estimate the relative importance of these foreign exchange savings to broad-based, sustainable economic development, we calculated title I aid as a percentage of a recipient\u2019s total imports for the 15 title I recipients in fiscal year 1991\u2014the most recent year for which complete international financial statistics were available. We reported this information for each country, arranged by group according to their foreign exchange shortage. To measure foreign exchange shortage, we used a country\u2019s international nongold reservesexpressed in number of weeks of imports these reserves would cover. We also calculated title I aid as a percentage of a country\u2019s total food imports to determine the size of title I\u2019s contribution to a country\u2019s food import needs. In addition, we reviewed past and current development statements contained in title I agreements and discussed them with USDA, AID, and recipient government officials in the seven countries we visited.", "Using USDA\u2019s and the United Nations\u2019 trade database, we attempted a statistical analysis to determine whether there was any relationship between title I and commercial imports from the United States for major title I recipients, past and present. Our regression analysis, however, was not successful because of problems with the data, i.e., missing data, incompatible data sets, differences in reporting periods, inconsistencies between figures reported by the United States and other countries, differences in classification, and double counting of transshipments through other countries.", "Because we were unable to conduct a regression analysis, we based our conclusions regarding the relationship between title I and a country\u2019s commercial imports on evidence drawn from literature we reviewed; an analysis of trade data from the International Wheat Council for our case-study countries for crop years July 1, 1980, through June 30, 1992 (the one data set we found that was complete and consistent for more than a decade); and information we collected from documents and interviews with officials from USDA and U.S. commodity groups in Washington, D.C., and in our seven case-study countries. Unless otherwise noted, we reported dollar values covering periods of 5 years or longer in 1993 dollars. In addition, we assessed title I\u2019s contribution to developing or expanding markets for U.S. agricultural products in South Korea, a former title I recipient considered by USDA to be a best-case example of title I\u2019s market development success.

The primary way that the title I aid can contribute to BBS development in a recipient country is by helping the country save its scarce foreign exchange to invest in projects that promote long-term sustainable economic development. Foreign exchange savings occur when title I imports displace commercial imports. Our analysis indicated, however, that even if the maximum possible foreign exchange savings occurred, title I\u2019s potential contribution to sustainable economic development would still be minimal because the program is small in relation to the country\u2019s overall development needs. There are some cases, though, in which title I assistance may have made a meaningful short-term contribution to the food supply in some recipient countries. However, this assistance is not considered a contribution to BBS development.", "The recipient government\u2019s sale of the title I commodities to the private sector in-country generates revenues, called \u201clocal currencies,\u201d that the recipient government can use to cover budgetary expenses. These revenues, however, are not an infusion of additional resources to the country since they are generated from the sale of the title I commodities within the local economy. Instead, the local currencies are a shift of money from the private to the public sector.", "The title I program is also intended to promote BBS development through the title I agreements in which countries agree to undertake certain development activities in exchange for receiving title I assistance. However, the results of our review indicated that the title I program provided the United States with relatively little leverage to induce recipient countries to undertake additional BBS development activities or policy reforms. The leverage was limited because the dollar value of the title I aid was small compared to the countries\u2019 basic development requirements as well as to the total assistance provided by other world donors. Moreover, other competing program objectives dilute whatever leverage might have been associated with the provision of title I assistance. Although economic and agricultural development is one of P.L. 480\u2019s objectives, a chief criticism of title I assistance has been that it may have a disincentive effect on local farmers and local food production, according to the studies we reviewed. Any disincentive effect, however, may be diminished to the extent that food aid imports displace commercial imports rather than domestic production.", "The title I program contains legislative requirements that impede the program\u2019s ability to achieve its BBS development objectives through foreign exchange savings.

For example, the analysis of commercial and concessional wheat imports in Sri Lanka from 1955 to 1981 strongly suggested that food aid had substituted for commercial purchases. The author concluded that P.L. 480 food aid imports clearly resulted in foreign exchange savings for Sri Lanka.", "We also compiled trade data from the International Wheat Council on wheat imports for six of our seven case-study countries for crop years July 1, 1980, through June 30, 1992, to help assess the impact of title I assistance on U.S. commercial imports. While we could not conclude that title I concessional sales had displaced U.S. commercial sales of wheat in Egypt, it appears that title I wheat had, to varying degrees, displaced U.S. commercial sales of wheat in the other five case-study countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Morocco, and Sri Lanka). For any of our case-study countries, however, we could not define with certainty the extent to which title I aid had displaced commercial imports because many other factors affected the importation and domestic production of wheat. To be more precise, for example, we would have to know what each country would have imported and produced in the absence of the title I assistance.", "On the basis of our analysis of wheat import statistics, El Salvador and Guatemala provide the clearest examples of displacement of commercial imports by title I assistance. In both El Salvador and Guatemala, the United States had been the dominant supplier of wheat since the 1950s. Until the early 1980s, when Guatemala and El Salvador first imported wheat under title I programs, these countries had generally imported wheat from the United States on a commercial basis. After the introduction of title I aid, both the volume and share of commercial wheat purchases declined greatly, even as total U.S. wheat exports to these countries increased.", "For Morocco, the interpretation of import statistics is more complicated due to the volatility of, as well as the reduction in, the volume of total U.S. wheat imports. However, in at least one of the many years of title I assistance, it appears that title I concessional sales replaced U.S. commercial wheat sales to Morocco. For crop years July 1, 1990, through June 30, 1992, the total volume of U.S. sales of wheat to Morocco declined by nearly 50 percent, whereas the volume of title I wheat sales increased by 72 percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Foreign Exchange Savings Make Minimal Contribution to BBS Development", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which foreign exchange savings can contribute to BBS development largely depends on the value of these foreign exchange savings relative to the country\u2019s total economic needs. Imports represent one component of the resources that a country regards as vital to its developmental needs. On the basis of our analysis of fiscal year 1991 recipients, it appears that even if 100 percent of the title I assistance displaced the equivalent in a country\u2019s commercial imports, the foreign exchange savings that title I provides could satisfy only a fraction of a country\u2019s total imports. Consequently, title I\u2019s potential contribution to BBS development is limited. However, despite its small size, title I may constitute a significant percentage of some of the countries\u2019 food imports, which indicates that title I aid could be making a meaningful contribution to these countries\u2019 food supply in the short term. In addition, title I could be quite important to those countries that are severely restricted in their ability to pay for commercial imports due to a critical foreign exchange shortage.", "To determine the extent to which the maximum foreign exchange savings made possible by the title I program could potentially contribute to a country\u2019s BBS development, we compared the value of title I aid to the country\u2019s total imports. A country\u2019s imports include, but are not limited to, those goods the country finds necessary for its development that are currently available only from abroad and that the country must purchase with its scarce foreign exchange. To highlight the relative scarcity of the countries\u2019 foreign exchange situation, we grouped the 15 title I recipients for fiscal year 1991 according to their foreign exchange position (see table 2.1). A general rule of thumb is that a developing country is experiencing a shortage of foreign exchange if it has less than approximately 3 months of reserves to cover its current rate of imports. We used nongold international reserves, expressed in terms of the number of weeks of imports these reserves covered, to measure a country\u2019s foreign exchange status.", "Our analysis indicated that even if 100 percent of the title I imports had displaced commercial imports, title I\u2019s maximum foreign exchange savings represented a very small portion of a country\u2019s total import requirements and, therefore, did not meaningfully enhance the recipient\u2019s capacity to import. Consequently, the potential foreign exchange savings, at best, could make only a minimal contribution to BBS development. Data were available for 14 of the 15 recipient countries in fiscal year 1991. In all of these countries, title I assistance as a percent of the value of the countries\u2019 total imports was 4 percent or less, generally much less. For eight of the recipients, title I represented 1 percent or less of the value of the country\u2019s total imports (see table 2.1).", "Although our analysis of potential foreign exchange savings showed that title I\u2019s contribution to BBS development was limited, our research indicated that title I assistance could contribute significantly, in some cases, to helping a country meet its food import requirements in the short run. Food import data were available for 12 of the 15 fiscal year 1991 title I recipient countries. For six of these countries, title I constituted a significant portion, about 7 to 13 percent, of the countries\u2019 total food imports. For El Salvador, this figure was 24.7 percent (see table 2.1). While a short-term increase in the supply of food may help relieve hunger, achieving food security requires long-term solutions to the problems of food availability, accessibility, and utilization in developing countries. Food security is a long-term, broad-based economic development issue.", "In addition, title I may have enabled some countries that were experiencing critical shortages of foreign exchange (i.e., reserves available that covered less than 1 month of imports) to acquire food that they otherwise would not have been able to purchase. Five of the 15 fiscal year 1991 title I recipients were experiencing a critical shortage of nongold reserves (see table 2.1). Since these countries were so restricted in their ability to pay for commercial imports, the title I imports were probably in addition to their usual commercial imports. Consequently, the title I assistance probably did not result in foreign exchange savings that then could be invested in long-term BBS development.

In theory, this transfer of resources enables the recipient government to gain control over additional domestic spending power that it would not have otherwise had to help support activities that could contribute to BBS development. Ultimately, any contribution that local currencies can make to BBS development depends on their investment in activities with long-term, broad-based, and sustainable benefits.", "In practice, there are many difficulties associated with ensuring the effective use of these local currencies. It is difficult for USDA or anyone else to say whether the currencies were actually dedicated to the projects specified in the title I agreements because these local currencies are owned and usually controlled by the recipient country\u2019s government. Ensuring that the local currencies are invested in BBS development activities is further complicated by the fact that money is fungible and difficult to track. This condition is also aggravated by inadequate accounting and control systems in some recipient countries.

The program generally provides USDA with little leverage to direct the recipient governments to undertake additional reforms or projects because the program\u2019s value is small relative to the countries\u2019 overall development needs and the total assistance that other donors provide.

In addition, the agreements must include a statement about how the recipient country intends to encourage private sector competition and participation.

For example, the 1992 title I agreement in Morocco specified that the government would support two agronomic research institutes, an activity that AID had already included as part of its title I agreements from fiscal years 1988 to 1990. In Jamaica, the fiscal year 1992 title I agreement encouraged the country to work toward meeting the criteria necessary to become eligible for debt forgiveness under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, a program established by the United States in 1990 to promote economic liberalization and growth in Latin American and Caribbean countries.

In their fiscal year 1992 title I agreements, El Salvador and Guatemala pledged to eliminate \u201cprice bands\u201d for certain commodities. Price bands institute tariffs to protect farmers from agricultural imports. Eliminating this policy was in keeping with USDA\u2019s objectives to promote trade liberalization and reduce trade barriers that discriminate against U.S. products. The countries entered into similar agreements for fiscal year 1993. However, El Salvador dropped out of the title I program in fiscal year 1994 because its government did not want to pursue these particular reforms, according to State Department officials. Although the country was initially allocated funds for title I assistance in fiscal year 1994, the funds were never made available to the country because the United States and El Salvador failed to reach an agreement. For El Salvador and Guatemala, their agreements in fiscal year 1992 also supported another USDA activity in-country that was designed to protect the United States from pests and diseases that could be imported into this country.", "We found that all 22 of the title I agreements for fiscal year 1992 contained some reference to how the local currency proceeds generated from the sale of title I commodities should be allotted to support the reforms or projects cited in the agreement. For 5 of the 22 countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Sierra Leone, and Suriname), the fiscal year 1992 agreements required that some portion of the local currency sale proceeds be deposited into special accounts designated to support activities specified in the title I agreements. In Sierra Leone and Guatemala, it was the U.S. Ambassador rather than USDA who insisted that the sales proceeds be assigned to specific accounts, according to USDA officials.

For example, in fiscal year 1991, total title I assistance distributed among the 15 recipients amounted to $395.2 million, while total official development assistance (ODA) from the entire world to these countries was $10.8 billion. Representatives from the World Bank and a prominent international food policy research group told us that it would not be reasonable for countries to undertake major reforms with wide-ranging economic consequences in exchange for the relatively small amount of assistance provided through the title I program.", "The dollar value of title I assistance overstates its economic value to the recipient country. As a result, the leverage provided by title I assistance as indicated by its dollar value is likely to be significantly less than the figure suggests. There are several reasons why the recipient country may not place the same dollar value on the title I commodity as does the United States: (1) the title I assistance is a loan that needs to be repaid, not a cash grant; (2) the recipient government may sell the commodity in-country for a price lower than its purchase price; (3) the program restrictions on shipping and reexporting title I commodities may further reduce its value to the recipient country; (4) the recipient country may be buying something (quality or quantity) other than what it actually would have preferred; and (5) the title I price per metric ton may exceed prices for similar commodities available through other USDA programs and suppliers.", "USDA\u2019s ability to use title I assistance as leverage to influence BBS development in-country may also be limited because other title I objectives, such as promoting U.S. agricultural exports or U.S. foreign policy, sometimes take priority in shaping title I programs, according to AID and USDA officials both in Washington, D.C., and in our seven case-study countries. We reported similar conclusions in past reports on title I assistance. For example, if policy reforms are particularly sensitive, negotiations can be lengthy, and the long negotiation process may be contrary to U.S. farm interests who are concerned about signing agreements as early as possible to move commodities, according to AID officials. The AID officials believed that whatever leverage title I might provide exists only before the agreements are signed.

These studies concluded that title I assistance has the potential to negatively affect local agriculture in particular situations. However, the agricultural policy environment of the recipient country is also very important in determining whether and to what extent food aid creates a disincentive for local agricultural production. To the extent that food aid displaces commercial imports, any disincentive effect on local food production due to an increase in the food supply putting downward pressure on food prices diminishes since the same food aid cannot simultaneously result in foreign exchange savings and be additional to commercial imports. The disincentive effect underscores a difficulty in the title I program.

Food aid can create disincentives to local production, in a direct manner, if it increases the availability of a commodity to the point where the additional title I imports put downward pressure on local food prices. Food aid can also discourage local agricultural production indirectly by enabling a government to neglect its own agricultural sector and/or postpone making policy reforms needed to enhance domestic food production. Disincentive effects can affect domestic production of those commodities that are imported under title I as well as those commodities that may act as substitutes for locally grown products; e.g., importing wheat could lead to consumer demand for bread rather than for locally grown corn-based foods. P.L. 480 responds to the possibility that the program may create disincentives by requiring that USDA conduct a Bellmon determination before signing a title I agreement. The legislation also requires that USDA consult donor organizations, such as the World Bank and IMF, to ensure that title I aid will not create a disincentive to domestic production or marketing.", "The literature on the disincentive issue, while inconclusive, indicates that disincentive effects are possible with food aid. The literature emphasizes a case-by-case approach involving a thorough understanding of in-country commodity markets and agricultural policy environments. For example, according to one study, wheat, the principal commodity imported by Sri Lanka under title I, was not produced in Sri Lanka to any significant extent in the 1970s. Therefore, title I aid could have had no direct disincentive effect on domestic wheat production. However, because of the possible substitutability between rice and wheat, it could have been possible that consumers may have substituted bread for rice, thereby causing the demand for rice and its production to decrease. The study, however, suggested that this situation did not occur. Rice production generally remained constant, then increased, during the 1970s, though it is arguable that rice production would have increased even more in the absence of title I wheat.

Government policies can try to insulate local agricultural production from responding to the changing supply and price conditions as a result of receiving title I aid. Conversely, government can create agricultural distortions through its food policies, which may dwarf any disincentives that food aid may cause. Even if title I assistance increases the overall availability of a commodity, it still may not adversely affect producers or consumers if the government provides price support or direct subsidies, though this may cause repercussions elsewhere in the domestic or international economy. A government might pursue a food policy, perhaps partially financed from the revenue from the sale of food aid, to protect producers and/or benefit consumers by letting consumer prices fall while keeping producer prices at a higher level. For example, one study, which analyzed the grain sector in Brazil from 1952 to 1971, showed that P.L. 480 wheat imports had a positive effect on grain production. This circumstance was due primarily to the government\u2019s wheat import and domestic price support programs whereby revenues gained from wheat imports were used to support domestic grain producers.", "While a price system such as Brazil\u2019s may, at times, reduce the negative effects of food aid on producers or consumers, it may also backfire and lead to further distortions. For example, according to the study on Brazil, title I imports displaced commercial wheat imports, thus disrupting international wheat markets. Government intervention in Egypt, a country that had been a major recipient of title I assistance for decades, provides an example of how food aid and government policy interact to affect local agricultural production. Egypt\u2019s wheat policy from 1950 through the early 1980s reflected the government\u2019s objective to make bread, a commodity considered critical to Egypt\u2019s political stability, cheap and readily available. To ensure wheat supplies and thereby keep the price of bread low, the Egyptian government encouraged both imports and local production of wheat. This strategy, in turn, supported the government\u2019s policy of subsidizing retail sales of bread by supplying wheat to the predominantly state-owned mills at a low price. However, this policy resulted in an abundant supply of wheat flour with title I wheat shipments constituting an important component of this supply. This policy also contributed to other policies that acted as disincentives to farmers: the producer price of wheat was allowed to decline relative to other crops (maize, rice, and cotton) and relative to world market prices. This system had a direct disincentive effect on domestic wheat production. Egypt\u2019s elaborate food subsidy program is currently under revision as part of Egypt\u2019s commitment to ongoing structural economic reform, including agricultural pricing reform. This reform includes a price liberalization policy aimed at having most prices in the economy determined by market forces by 1995.", "Aside from the impact of deliberate government intervention in the marketplace, other factors could overshadow food aid\u2019s potentially adverse effect on a country\u2019s agricultural production. In circumstances of war, political strife, or natural disasters, it would be difficult to disentangle title I\u2019s role, if any, in contributing to the decline in agricultural production. For example, the agricultural sector of El Salvador, a country that has received substantial amounts of title I assistance since 1980, has suffered from civil war over the past decade. Resources for agricultural production, especially for cotton, coffee, and livestock, became military targets of the guerrillas. As a result, most crop production declined in the 1980s.

According to a USDA official, the agency adjusted the 5-year commercial import average to zero because its analysis indicated that Honduras was unlikely to import any wheat commercially due to economic hardships facing the country. USDA set the UMR for wheat at zero for fiscal years 1983 through 1986, even though Honduras had been expected to import 51,000 metric tons of wheat commercially in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 according to the prior year\u2019s UMR analyses.

These programs enable the U.S. exporters to meet price competition in world agricultural markets when domestic agricultural prices are higher than world prices. These programs are designed to help counter the effects of other countries that subsidize their exports.", "Export credit guarantees. Two USDA General Sales Manager programs (GSM-102 and GSM-103) offer short- and intermediate-term credit guaranteed by the U.S. government to countries with foreign exchange constraints.

For example, the maximum repayment period is 3 years for GSM-102 and 10 years for GSM-103, compared to title I\u2019s maximum repayment period of 30 years with a maximum 7-year grace period. In addition, the interest rates under the GSM programs are not concessional, whereas title I\u2019s interest rate is set below prevailing market rates.", "Unlike price reduction programs that subsidize export sales, such as EEP, the contract sales price billed by USDA for title I commodities is the U.S. market price for that commodity and grade, which is frequently higher than world-market prices. Oftentimes, EEP is used in conjunction with the GSM programs so that certain U.S. agricultural exports can be purchased at competitive discount prices using U.S. government credit guarantees. Title I sales are not combined with EEP discounts. Because no discounts are allowed, recipients usually pay more on a price-per-tonnage basis for a title I commodity than they would if the commodities were purchased under one of the price reduction programs. For example, in fiscal year 1992, Egypt purchased wheat through title I at $141 per metric ton and through EEP at $110 per metric ton. In some cases, countries may choose to buy a certain commodity under a price reduction program because of its lower price-per-unit basis even though the cost of the commodity exported under the title I program is cheaper in the long-term since the cost is discounted over a long repayment period at below market rate of interest. However, multilateral development institutions discourage developing countries from incurring long-term debt for nondurable consumption goods, such as food. In addition, some countries forgo the benefits of the title I concessional loan, preferring the flexibility of commercial financing instead, according to USDA officials.", "Country participation and the amount exported under each U.S. export assistance program vary from year to year depending on factors such as the availability of agricultural commodities, favorable credit terms and credit guarantees, the country\u2019s import needs and foreign exchange constraints, the export activity of competitor countries, and the foreign policy considerations of the United States.

Representatives from USDA and the American Soybean Association explained that, without the support of the title I program, users may return to less expensive, low-protein soymeal from China and India. In addition, a crushing plant was reopened in the Philippines, allowing the country to process raw soybeans. As a result, U.S. exports of high-protein soymeal will face increasing competition for market share, according to USDA officials.", "Other attempts by the United States in our case-study countries to differentiate title I commodities and entice buyers with concessional credit have not been successful. According to USDA officials in Egypt, they tried to diversify the country\u2019s title I imports in fiscal year 1992 by offering an additional $10 million in title I assistance for U.S. soybean oil.

For example, according to USDA officials and representatives from a U.S. commodity group in Egypt, in fiscal year 1993 the United States was able to transform its concessional sales of wheat into a commercial market share with the help of USDA\u2019s EEP, which subsidizes export sales. These officials believe the title I program helped the United States to establish a market share for wheat in Egypt by offering concessional sales to a country that had a critical shortage of foreign exchange. In fiscal year 1992, after Egypt\u2019s foreign exchange reserves greatly improved due to significant debt forgiveness following the 1991 Gulf War, the country began using its foreign exchange to purchase U.S. wheat under EEP, where the price per ton was lower than under the title I program.", "Wheat exports to Egypt under the title I program dropped from $108 million in fiscal year 1991 to $40 million in fiscal year 1992; at the same time, U.S. wheat exports to Egypt increased from $120 million to $462 million under EEP. In fiscal year 1993, Egypt did not participate in a title I program and imported all of its U.S. wheat under EEP.

According to these USDA officials, title I concessional sales have helped the United States maintain a market presence that it otherwise might not have for corn and rice. Jamaica has imported corn through the title I program since 1972 and rice since 1981. Jamaica also imported wheat under the title I program during fiscal years 1978-1992. USDA officials told us that the title I program helped the United States to maintain its status as a primary supplier of wheat to Jamaica, competing with Canada for market share. However, U.S. market share has dropped since Jamaica stopped importing title I wheat in fiscal year 1993. On the basis of preliminary statistics, the U.S. share (volume) dropped from 66 percent in June 1992 to 57 percent in June 1994.

Jamaica is ineligible for GSM programs due to arrearages in its repayment schedule, and EEP cannot be activated unless the United States perceives unfair trading practices from European competitors.", "According to USDA and foreign government officials in Morocco, U.S. exports of vegetable oil under the title I program and EEP have helped the United States to maintain a share of Morocco\u2019s vegetable oil market. The country\u2019s import decisions are largely determined by price, according to the Moroccan government officials. These officials told us that although Moroccan oil refiners prefer soybean oil, a large portion of its vegetable oil imports comes from the European Union, which supplies less-expensive rapeseed oil. According to Moroccan government officials, the United States would need to export vegetable oil under EEP if the title I program were discontinued to compete with price-competitive rapeseed exports from the European Union and soybean oil exports from Argentina and Brazil.", "Although the United States still remains the primary supplier of cotton, wheat, and corn for South Korea, U.S. market shares established through concessional sales declined once title I assistance ended in 1981. Typical of trade in bulk and semiprocessed products, South Korea\u2019s buying decisions are largely influenced by price. For example, the market for feed corn in South Korea is extremely sensitive to price. The U.S. market share declined from nearly 100 percent in fiscal year 1980 to 36 percent in fiscal year 1986 due to increased competition for feedgrains, a feed corn substitute, and to other corn exporters such as Argentina, South Africa, and Thailand, according to USDA officials. The U.S. share of South Korea\u2019s corn imports increased substantially in the late 1980s due to a reduction in feedgrain and corn supplies from competitor countries.

At that time, the South Korean government gradually relinquished control of grain procurement decisions, and the market became increasingly sensitive to price and different wheat qualities.

However, cargo preference requirements, which are designed to support the U.S. merchant marine industry, can be obtrusive and undermine market development efforts. These requirements may also lead importers to believe that U.S. exporters provide inferior service. Cargo preference provisions require that at least 75 percent of food aid tonnage be shipped on U.S. flag ships.

However, since very few U.S. flag ships were obtainable from the West Coast, the countries were unable to purchase this desired commodity. Instead, they were forced to purchase different varieties of wheat located where U.S. flag ships were available. According to a Guatemalan purchasing agent, the Guatemalan government sells the title I wheat to a private group of Guatemalan millers, which sells its products at market value in-country. To minimize their commodity costs, the millers want to purchase less expensive, high-quality western white wheat. However, Guatemala\u2019s agent explained that because of cargo preference requirements, when Guatemala puts together a purchasing plan for title I wheat to present to USDA, it must first consider the availability of U.S. flag ships, not what types of wheat it wants to buy. USDA officials stated that they believe that recipient countries that have had this type of unfavorable experience with the title I program are not likely to purchase agricultural products from the United States on a commercial basis in the future.", "To comply with cargo preference requirements, some title I recipients have not been able to purchase a title I commodity at its lowest cost because U.S. flag ships were not available. This situation forces the recipient to purchase less of the commodity at a more expensive price. Our review of the impact of cargo preference rules on food aid programs found that, for a 1992 title I wheat purchase, Tunisia was unable to take advantage of the four lowest offers that specified particular loading ports, because U.S. flag ships were not available at these ports. Eventually, Tunisia was forced to purchase wheat offered at the seventh and eighth next-lowest price\u2014and these prices were from $3.82 to $3.95 higher per metric ton for the almost 55,000 metric tons Tunisia finally purchased.", "Food aid recipients are sometimes not able to purchase the title I commodities at their lowest price, even if a U.S. flag ship is available, because the vessel may not be the appropriate type or size to transport the commodity. For example, in a 1992 title I purchase, Estonia wanted to place both its corn and wheat purchases on one U.S. flag ship. However, the only U.S. flag ship that offered to carry these cargos was too large to be accommodated at the U.S. loading facilities that offered the lowest wheat prices. To use this U.S. flag ship, Estonia purchased higher-priced wheat from a supplier with loading facilities that could accommodate this ship.", "We also reported in June 1993 testimony that cargo preference requirements have forced USDA to transport title I corn on U.S. tankers, leading to excessive kernel breakage. This breakage, in turn, results in increased instances of insect infestation, mold growth, or other damage. Rather than export title I corn via bulk carriers, albeit foreign-owned, U.S. tankers were used to help meet the criteria that 75 percent of the title I export volume be transported using U.S. flag ships. Another problem, according to USDA officials, involves unloading a tanker at a developing country\u2019s port where appropriate equipment for unloading the grain may not be readily available. Furthermore, the tanker may be too large to enter the foreign port and may have to discharge its cargo to smaller vessels while at sea, increasing the amount of grain breakage and subsequent spoilage.

Since commodities are not placed on the P.L. 480 docket because of their market potential, many commodities available for export under the title I program face narrow market opportunities. USDA has had little success exporting certain items on the P.L. 480 docket, such as legumes, soyproducts, peanuts, dry nonfat milk, and butter/butteroil, under the title I program.

While these provisions are intended to ensure that title I commodities are not used to increase the commercial exports of the recipient countries, they limit USDA\u2019s ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

However, we determined that the amount of foreign exchange relief derived from title I assistance was small and thus its contribution to BBS development was limited. Paradoxically, title I\u2019s primary assistance to market development comes through its contribution to long-term economic development, which occurs with the foreign exchange savings that can take place only if title I exports displace commercial sales.", "While title I may help the U.S. maintain a market presence by offering concessional financing to developing countries with foreign exchange constraints, these concessional market shares will not necessarily transform into commercial market share once the title I program is discontinued. Many of the commodities exported under the title I program are price sensitive such that price has a greater influence on purchasing decisions than a commodity\u2019s unique characteristics or quality. Unless the United States could offer exports with competitive prices and financing, the United States would more than likely lose market share for these price-sensitive commodities when title I export assistance is discontinued.", "In the short term, the title I program moves U.S. agricultural commodities. However, as discussed in chapter 1, the importance of title I as an export program has diminished substantially since the program\u2019s inception. The title I program once represented a significant share of total value of U.S. agricultural exports, but its importance decreased as new USDA programs were created to support the export of U.S. agricultural goods.", "Requirements such as cargo preference provisions, commodity eligibility criteria, and reexport restrictions are built into the title I program to serve stated as well as unstated objectives. These requirements impede the program\u2019s ability to act as a useful market development tool. The title I program does not manifest many of the attributes associated with a successful market development program. A successful program would normally not contain requirements that restrict USDA\u2019s ability to respond to customer needs and that impose confining conditions on the buyer. A successful market development program would normally offer a wide range of products selected for their long-term market potential. Also, the products\u2019 availability under the program would be certain from year to year so as to create a consumer preference and establish the United States as a consistent supplier."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Management Improvements Have Not Eliminated Structural Barriers to Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["The 1990 act streamlined program management by eliminating the interagency administration of the title I program and simplifying the implementation requirements overseas.

DCC was comprised of five agencies (USDA, AID, OMB, and the Departments of State and the Treasury). DCC working-level groups met on a biweekly basis to plan and approve the P.L. 480 programs as they operated in each country. No one agency had lead responsibility, and decisions were reached by consensus. DCC members\u2019 interests usually reflected the P.L. 480 objective that most closely agreed with their agency\u2019s views. In 1990, we found that, when differences of opinion arose among agencies over the proposed P.L. 480 objectives or policies with respect to a particular country, the DCC decision-making process was cumbersome and time-consuming and would cause delays in the negotiation and signing of a country agreement.", "The role of the interagency body in managing the P.L. 480 programs changed substantially when the 1990 act assigned USDA direct program responsibility for the title I program and AID direct responsibility for titles II and III. In February 1991, DCC was replaced by the Food Assistance Policy Council (FAPC), which is an interagency body consisting of senior representatives from USDA, AID, the State Department, and OMB. FAPC oversees rather than administers the P.L. 480 programs. A presidential executive order established FAPC to (1) ensure policy coordination of the assistance provided under the Agricultural Trade Development Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-480), as amended, and the Food for Progress Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1736o); (2) advise the president on appropriate policies under the act; and (3) coordinate the decisions on allocations and other policy issues.", "Once actively involved in administrating the P.L. 480 programs, the role of the interagency body, FAPC, is now primarily limited to approving the country selection and program allocations proposed by USDA and AID. FAPC meets annually to review and approve the initial program allocations. Midyear changes to the P.L. 480 program allocations are generally made by the responsible agency after consultation with individual member agencies. FAPC also serves as the \u201ccourt of last resort\u201d for interagency disputes that cannot be resolved directly among the agencies involved. Since February 1991, FAPC has met about 10 times on an ad hoc basis to respond to a variety of interagency issues. For example, in September 1993, an FAPC meeting was convened to address the impact of potential congressional budget cuts on the P.L. 480 programs and discuss a food aid strategy for countries of the former Soviet Union. FAPC also met on another occasion to discuss the transfer of P.L. 480 funds between the title I and title III programs.", "Overall, the officials from the four agencies believed the level of interagency competition was reduced substantially when program responsibility for the three titles was divided between USDA and AID. The officials agreed that FAPC has a much simpler review and approval process than DCC and that the interagency process is much less time-consuming.

In general, USDA and recipient government officials in our seven case-study countries expressed their satisfaction with the new title I program, often citing its reduced administrative burden. Before the 1990 act when AID managed the title I program, many factors complicated the agency\u2019s efforts to negotiate and implement title I agreements in the recipient country. AID and recipient governments often engaged in lengthy negotiations to develop self-help measures that were \u201cspecific and measurable\u201d and in addition to activities already undertaken by the country.", "When proposed self-help measures or the use of sales proceeds were especially controversial, the negotiation of the title I agreement tended to delay its signing and implementation. As discussed in chapter 2, we and AID\u2019s Office of the Inspector General found that AID representatives in-country were not adequately monitoring adherence to title I self-help measures and use of the commodity sales proceeds. In addition, a number of recipient countries resented the increasing U.S. government auditing and monitoring requirements for these local currencies that were not owned by the United States, according to a 1990 planning document prepared by USDA.", "Under the 1990 act, many of these implementation requirements were simplified. In part, the provisions of the title I program were revised in recognition of the difficulties in negotiating and administering development activities supported by local currencies owned by the recipient government. Presently, USDA does not have to negotiate specific and measurable development activities as part of the title I agreements. Instead, the 1990 act requires only that the title I agreements contain a statement on how title I assistance and the commodity sales proceeds will be integrated into the overall development plans of the country to improve its food security. As described in chapter 2, most of the agreements in our seven case-study countries for fiscal years 1991 and 1992 contained general and broadly worded development statements that did not specify measurable outcomes.", "In addition, the 1990 act does not require USDA to monitor a country\u2019s (1) use of the local currency generated from the sale of title I commodities and (2) progress on its development plans. Overall, we found that USDA did not extensively monitor the title I agreements in our seven case-study countries.

According to a USDA official, while USDA posts overseas attempt to collect these reports on a timely basis, the program does not provide enough leverage to motivate recipients to submit them. This is especially true once the country has dropped out of the title I program. For the 22 recipients in fiscal year 1992, only 11 submitted reports, 3 of which were on time; the others were late by 6 to 19 months.

That portion of the loan, which is repaid to USDA in local currency, is never repaid to the U.S. Treasury.", "To begin the section 104 program, USDA solicited project proposals from its post overseas, eventually collecting proposals from three posts to include with its fiscal year 1993 budget submission. These proposals, however, were not included in USDA\u2019s final and approved fiscal year 1993 budget submission. OMB officials raised questions about whether USDA would be able to manage a local currency program and whether some of the proposals would meet the market development criteria. OMB officials were also concerned that the section 104 program would increase the subsidy cost of the title I program because the program is essentially a grant program within a credit program. Since no repayments are made to the U.S. Treasury under section 104, there would be an increase in the total subsidy value. This circumstance would require a parallel increase in the budget authority for the title I program. In addition to these concerns, a hiring freeze imposed on USDA during the budget negotiation process caused USDA to reconsider its ability to adequately manage a section 104 program. According to officials at USDA and OMB, staff resources at USDA in Washington, D.C., and overseas were already being stretched because USDA had assumed responsibility for two additional food aid programs (Food for Progress and section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949). On the basis of these events and concerns, the section 104 program was not put in place.", "Some of the USDA officials in two of our seven case-study countries, Egypt and the Philippines, stated that they would like to undertake market development activities in-country using local currencies generated through a section 104 program. However, we interviewed other USDA officials overseas who raised concerns that the problems associated with administering a local currency program may exceed its potential benefits. In one of our case-study countries, Egypt, representatives from a U.S. trade association told us that they declined an opportunity to submit a section 104 proposal because it anticipated tremendous administrative troubles based on their past experience with similar programs. Most USDA and AID officials we met with overseas believed that it would be very difficult for USDA to administer such a program, given its current level of staff resources abroad. Also, at embassies in our two case-study countries that submitted section 104 proposals, the Deputy Chiefs of Mission believed that USDA did not have the administrative capabilities to manage a local currency program in-country. These officials preferred that AID, with its expertise and prior experience, manage any local currency programs in-country.", "In its budgets submission for fiscal year 1996, USDA requested $10 million to support proposed section 104 projects related to technical cooperation. Unlike in its fiscal year 1993 budget submission, USDA did not solicit section 104 proposals from its posts overseas; instead, the proposed projects were developed by USDA officials in Washington, D.C., and expected to be administered by headquarters officials. According to an OMB official, USDA\u2019s final budget for fiscal year 1996 did not include the proposed section 104 projects for reasons similar to those given when the proposed projects were not included in USDA\u2019s final budget for fiscal year 1993."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Competing Objectives Hinder Development of an Effective Program Strategy", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of the P.L. 480 legislation are intended to support U.S. foreign policy and U.S. trade interests, as well as humanitarian and BBS development objectives overseas.

These conflicts may result in title I aid being provided to a country to accomplish one objective at the expense of achieving progress on other objectives.", "According to the 1990 act, a developing country is considered to be eligible for title I assistance if it has a shortage of foreign exchange earnings and difficulty in meeting all of its food needs through commercial channels. The act further directs USDA to give priority to countries that demonstrate the greatest need for food; are undertaking measures for economic development purposes to improve food security and agricultural development; alleviate poverty; and promote broad-based, equitable, and sustainable development; and demonstrate potential to become commercial markets for competitively priced U.S. agricultural commodities.", "In general, the universe of potential title I recipients is based on per capita gross national product (GNP) criteria. In fiscal year 1993, developing countries with a per capita GNP greater than $635 in 1991 were considered eligible for title I assistance. Those countries with a per capita GNP of $635 or less met the poverty criterion of the World Bank\u2019s Civil Works Preference List and were considered eligible for title III assistance in fiscal year 1993. Although per capita GNP is used as a cutoff for determining which countries will receive title I or title III assistance, there is nothing to prohibit USDA from providing title I aid to countries eligible for title III assistance.", "Once the list of potential title I recipients was established, USDA\u2019s country selection process gave priority to market development considerations. USDA selected its candidates for title I assistance on the basis of a separate and internal planning exercise nicknamed \u201cspigots.\u201d First, USDA estimated the amount of commodities that countries expect to import in the coming year and then identified the various USDA export programs available to assist with these exports, such as GSM-102, GSM-103, EEP, and P.L. 480 food aid programs. On the basis of its \u201cspigots\u201d exercise, USDA estimated the amount of title I assistance needed to help meet export goals in eligible countries. In its estimates, USDA also considered how much assistance went to which recipients in the preceding year, collected input from its attaches overseas, and assessed the amount by which a country may be behind in its title I payments, if any. In general, USDA\u2019s allocation process focused on moving commodities rather than developing new markets for title I commodities.", "The State Department and AID also have influenced the selection of title I recipients. The recommendations of these two agencies for title I allocations sometimes coincide with USDA\u2019s. For example, both USDA and the State Department supported title I programs for countries of the former Soviet Union; however, their recommendations were based on fulfilling different objectives. The State Department intends to provide title I assistance to support foreign policy objectives, while USDA hopes to support market development objectives. On the other hand, there have been occasions when an agency\u2019s primary objective has hampered progress on other title I objectives. For example, U.S. foreign policy and economic development objectives in Central America prompted the State Department\u2019s and AID\u2019s support for title I assistance to Honduras despite USDA concerns about displacing commercial sales. Until fiscal year 1993, the State Department also succeeded in allocating title I assistance to Sierra Leone even though USDA argued that Sierra Leone, a country with little market development potential, was eligible for title III grants.", "According to USDA officials, foreign policy considerations have also influenced program allocations to Jordan, where title I aid was intermittent between fiscal years 1966 and 1993 because of its political alignments in the Middle East. Further, according to USDA officials, title I assistance to Pakistan was reinstated in fiscal year 1993 after a 2-year suspension because of U.S. concerns over the country\u2019s nuclear armament capabilities. While the on-again off-again nature of title I assistance in response to foreign policy considerations is contrary to sustaining important components of a successful market development strategy (i.e., demonstrate a long-term commitment and be a consistent supplier), the over-arching goal of the 1990 act\u2014to promote U.S. foreign policy objectives\u2014is being fulfilled.", "In addition to the market development and economic development objectives and foreign policy considerations, another objective of the food aid program is to combat hunger and malnutrition and their causes. \u201cDemonstrating the greatest need for food\u201d is one of the conditions a country must demonstrate to receive priority when USDA selects countries for title I assistance. Using a 1992 food security index developed by AID,we determined that title I assistance in fiscal year 1993 went to eight countries considered \u201cborderline\u201d or \u201cmost food insecure\u201d (see table 4.1). The amount allocated to these countries represented about 44 percent of the $332.8 million in title I funds allocated that year. However, at least 37 percent of the title I funds went to eight countries considered \u201crelatively food secure.\u201d Food security data were not available for the six countries of the former Soviet Union that received 20 percent of all title I funds in fiscal year 1993 (listed in table 4.1 as \u201cstatus unknown\u201d). With the exception of Tajikistan, it is likely that these countries would be considered \u201crelatively food secure\u201d because of their relatively higher per capita GNPs. For example, estimated 1992 GNP per capita statistics for these five countries of the former Soviet Union ranged from $1,230 to $2,930 compared to those title I recipient countries considered relatively food secure, whose per capita GNP ranged from $1,030 to $1,960. Therefore, as much as 53 percent of the title I funds may have gone to countries considered \u201crelatively food secure.\u201d Several USDA officials told us that they believed that donations under the title II or III programs are more appropriate for delivering food aid to countries for humanitarian purposes than the title I concessional sales program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While the 1990 Agricultural Development and Trade Act streamlined program management and simplified implementation requirements overseas, the revised structure of the title I program did not improve the program\u2019s ability to accomplish its objectives.

The program\u2019s central goal is to enhance the food security of the developing world. This goal requires long-term solutions to food availability, accessibility, and utilization in developing countries. We found that the primary way in which title I can contribute to sustainable economic development in recipient countries is by helping the country save foreign exchange to invest in projects that promote long-term economic development.
