However, shortfalls remain in how defects are analyzed and reported. For example, contractors manage, track, and report defects differently due to a lack of guidance from NOAA. Without consistency among contractors, it is difficult for management to effectively prioritize and oversee defect handling. In addition, more than 800 defects in key program components remained unresolved. Until the program makes progress in addressing these defects, it may not have a complete picture of remaining issues and faces an increased risk of further delays to the GOES-R launch date.", "As the GOES-R program approaches its expected launch date of March 2016, it faces a potential gap of more than a year during which an on-orbit backup satellite would not be available. This means that if an operational satellite experiences a problem, there could be a gap in GOES coverage. NOAA has improved its plan to mitigate gaps in satellite coverage. However, the revised plan does not include steps for mitigating a delayed launch, or details on potential impacts and minimum performance levels should a gap occur.

Geostationary satellites can  maintain a constant view of the earth from a high orbit of about 22,300  miles in space.", "NOAA operates GOES as a two-satellite system that is primarily focused  on the United States (see fig. 1). These satellites provide timely  environmental data about the earth\u2019s atmosphere, surface, cloud cover,  and the space environment to meteorologists and their audiences. They  also observe the development of hazardous weather, such as hurricanes  and severe thunderstorms, and track their movement and intensity to  reduce or avoid major losses of property and life. The ability of the  satellites to provide broad, continuously updated coverage of atmospheric  conditions over land and oceans is important to NOAA\u2019s weather  forecasting operations.", "To provide continuous satellite coverage, NOAA acquires several  satellites at a time as part of a series and launches new satellites every  few years (see table 1).

NOAA expects that the  GOES-R series will significantly increase the clarity and precision of the  observed environmental data. In addition, the data generated by the  satellites are to be both developed and transmitted more quickly.", "Since its inception, the GOES-R program has undergone several  changes in cost and scope. As originally envisioned, GOES-R was to  encompass four satellites hosting a variety of advanced technology  instruments and providing 81 environmental products. The first two  satellites in the series (called GOES-R and GOES-S) were expected to  launch in September 2012 and April 2014. However, in September 2006,  NOAA decided to reduce the scope and technical complexity of the  GOES-R program because of expectations that total costs, which were  originally estimated to be $6.2 billion, could reach $11.4 billion.  Specifically, NOAA reduced the minimum number of satellites from four to  two, cancelled plans for developing an advanced instrument (which  reduced the number of planned satellite products from 81 to 68), and  divided another instrument into two separate acquisitions. The agency  estimated that the revised program would cost $7 billion and kept the  planned launch dates unchanged.", "Subsequently, NOAA made several other important decisions about the  cost and scope of the GOES-R program. In 2007, NOAA established a  new program cost estimate of $7.67 billion and moved the launch dates  for the first two satellites to December 2014 and April 2016. Further, to  mitigate the risk that costs would rise, program officials decided to  remove selected program requirements from the baseline program and  treat them as contract options that could be exercised if funds allowed.  These requirements included the number of products to be distributed,  the time to deliver the remaining products (product latency), and how  often these products would be updated with new satellite data (refresh  rate). For example, program officials eliminated the requirement to  develop and distribute 34 of the 68 envisioned products, including low  cloud and fog, sulfur dioxide detection, and cloud liquid water. Program  officials included the restoration of the requirements for the products,  latency times, and refresh rates as options in the ground system contract  that could be acquired at a later time. Program officials later reduced the  number of products that could be restored as a contract option (called  option 2) from 34 to 31 because they determined that two products were  no longer feasible and two others could be combined into a single  product.", "In late 2009, NOAA changed the launch dates for the first two satellites to  October 2015 and February 2017. More recently, NOAA restored two  satellites to the program\u2019s baseline, making GOES-R a four-satellite  program once again. In February 2011, as part of its fiscal year 2012  budget request, NOAA requested funding to begin development for two  additional satellites in the GOES-R series\u2014GOES-T and GOES-U. The  program estimated that the development for all four satellites in the  GOES-R series\u2014GOES-R, GOES-S, GOES-T, and GOES-U\u2014would  cost $10.86 billion through 2036, an increase of $3.19 billion over its 2007  life cycle cost estimate of $7.67 billion for the two-satellite program.", "In August 2013, the program announced that it would delay the launch of  the first two satellites in the program, due in part to the effects of  sequestration.

In addition, appendix II provides more information  on defect trends for these components.", "Program officials noted that in some cases, due to time concerns, lower- priority defects which have been determined to not have a major effect on  performance are not closed until later in the testing process. Also,  program officials have stated that they are having difficulty in closing  defect-related incident reports due to insufficient manpower.

These  forecasts\u2014such as those for severe storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes\u2014 can have a substantial impact on our nation\u2019s people, infrastructure, and  economy. Because of the importance of GOES satellite data, NOAA\u2019s  policy is to have two operational satellites and one backup satellite in orbit  at all times. This policy proved useful in December 2008 and again in  September 2012, when the agency experienced problems with one of its  operational satellites, but was able to move its backup satellite into place  until the problems had been resolved.", "However, NOAA is facing a period of up to 17 months when it will not  have a backup satellite in orbit. Specifically, in April 2015, NOAA expects  to retire one of its operational satellites (GOES-13) and to move its  backup satellite (GOES-14) into operation. Thus, the agency will have  only two operational satellites in orbit\u2014and no backup satellite\u2014until  GOES-R is launched and completes an estimated 6-month post-launch  test period. If GOES-R is launched in March 2016, the earliest it could be  available for operational use would be September 2016. Figure 9 shows  the potential gap in backup coverage, based on the launch and  decommission dates of GOES satellites.", "During the time in which no backup satellite would be available, there is a  greater risk that NOAA would need to either rely on older satellites that  are beyond their expected operational lives and may not be fully  functional, request foreign satellite coverage, or to operate with only a  single operational satellite. Agency officials stated that the risk of a gap  may be reduced, because NOAA satellites have historically remained in  operation longer than their expected life. While many satellites outlive  their expected lifespans, the current GOES satellites are operating with  reduced functionality, and one has experienced two major outages.  Without a full complement of operational GOES satellites, the nation\u2019s  ability to maintain the continuity of data required for effective weather  forecasting could be compromised. This, in turn, could put the public,  property, and the economy at risk.", "Any delay to the GOES-R launch date would extend the time without a  backup to more than 17 months.

In September  2013, we reported on weaknesses in the contingency plans for NOAA\u2019s  satellites. At that time, we compared NOAA\u2019s plans to 17 best practices  associated with three main areas: identifying failure scenarios and  impacts, developing contingency plans, and validating and implementing  contingency plans. We reported that while NOAA identified failure  scenarios, recovery priorities, and minimum levels of acceptable  performance, the satellite contingency plan contained areas that fell short  of best practices, such as working with the user community to account for  potential reductions in capability under contingency operations.  Furthermore, the agency did not identify alternative solutions or timelines  for preventing a GOES-R launch delay.", "In February 2014, NOAA released a new satellite contingency plan in  response to these recommendations. This plan improved in comparison  to many, but not all, of the best practices. Specifically, the plan improved  in 6 areas and stayed the same in 4 areas.

They explained that options  for preventing a delay vary greatly over time based on issues that occur  during the satellite\u2019s development. They further stated that the program\u2019s  monthly presentations to NOAA management provide a summary of  current threats to the launch date and strategies to mitigate those threats.  For example, NOAA is considering whether or not to remove or delay  selected ground system functions to post-launch, and the program  provides monthly updates on this issue.", "While actively managing the program to avoid a delay is critical, it is also  important that NOAA management and the GOES-R program consider  and document feasible alternatives for avoiding or limiting such a launch  delay. This will allow stakeholders throughout NOAA to be aware of,  respond to, and plan for the potential implementation of each alternative,  not only the small number of alternatives the program is actively  considering in any given month.

Costs are  increasing faster than expected for key program components and  contractor data is often inconsistent from month to month. Until the  agency ensures its contractor cost data are consistent, it will be more  difficult for managers and program officials to make financial projections  and assess reserve needs and usage.", "As the GOES-R program progresses through its testing and integration  phase, it is essential that it is able to appropriately handle defects that  arise during testing. While NOAA and its contractors have implemented a  defect management process which is successful in many areas, there are  shortfalls in how the program defines defects, monitors trends, and  reports on defects and defect metrics. In particular, NOAA has not  established a standard set of metric information for all defects, including  the dates on which defects were identified and resolved, or an indication  of a defect\u2019s severity. Also, NOAA did not clearly define the type of issue  that constitutes a defect. Furthermore, multiple defects remain open on  some program components, including several that have remained open  for more than six months. Until the program addresses these shortfalls  and reduces the number of open defects, it may not have a complete  picture of remaining issues and faces an increased risk of further delays  to the GOES-R launch date.", "NOAA could experience a gap in satellite data coverage if GOES-R is  delayed further and one of the two remaining operational satellites  experiences a problem. NOAA has made improvements to its satellite  contingency plan, but the plan still does not sufficiently address mitigation  options for a launch delay, potential impacts, or minimum performance  levels.

To ensure that the program\u2019s schedule data were consistent  and reliable, we compared milestone data over several months and  contacted agency officials to corroborate events that occurred over the  course of our engagement. We analyzed earned value management  (EVM) data to compare levels of cost variance over time for key program  components, and calculated earned value management metrics using  program cost performance reports. To ensure that the program\u2019s cost  data were reliable, we compared formulas from the GAO Cost Guide to  the program\u2019s EVM approach. We also compared EVM data across a  series of monthly program cost performance reports. In doing so, we  found inconsistencies in the monthly EVM data for selected components,  and reported on those inconsistencies in this report. However, the data  were sufficient for our purpose of assessing overruns because these  inconsistencies were small in comparison to cost variances. We assessed  recently enacted and potential changes in functionality for key program  components. We also interviewed program officials regarding changes in  schedule milestones, cost performance and reserve funding, and  functionality.", "To assess efforts to identify and address issues discovered during  integration and testing, we identified best practices in defect management  from leading industry and government organizations. We compared  NOAA policy documents and defect management artifacts by the GOES  program, its contractors, and an independent NOAA mission assurance  group to the best practices. We selected three components, which are  critical to the program\u2019s mission requirements, and evaluated recent test  results and defects. Specifically, we identified two recent tests for each  component and analyzed artifacts associated with defects identified  during those tests. We compared the defects against each best practice  to determine if NOAA and its contractors fully implemented, partially  implemented, or did not implement the best practices. The agency and  contractor had to meet all aspects of the best practice to achieve a fully  implemented score, some aspects to achieve a partially implemented  score, and no aspects to achieve a not implemented score. To identify the  program\u2019s recent performance in closing and managing defects, we  analyzed basic defect trend information\u2014such as number of defects  opened and closed, and defect severity\u2014for each of several program  components. We developed charts to demonstrate defect trends. To  ensure the data were reliable, we compared defect data from individual  defect reports to agency trend charts, and sought corroboration from  agency and contractor officials.
