While airports currently receive enough funding to cover FAA's estimate of their planned capital development costs, a declining surplus in the trust fund that helps to support development and the need to spend up to $5 billion over the next 5 years for security-related capital improvements make the financial outlook for the next 5 to 8 years uncertain. Runway development, the principal means of increasing capacity, is now taking 10 to 14 years to complete, in large part because of time-consuming environmental reviews and community concerns. Providing air service for small communities is also becoming more difficult as costs increase and passenger ticket revenues decline. Intermodal alternatives may hold promise. Efforts to improve the efficiency of the national airspace system by modernizing the air traffic control system face challenges despite actions taken by the Congress and the administration to eliminate the cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls that have plagued FAA's modernization efforts. Overall, FAA is improving its management of the air traffic modernization program and has implemented some systems, but key projects continue to experience problems. To enhance aviation safety, FAA and the aviation industry have undertaken an initiative to reduce the fatal accident rate, and FAA is working to strengthen its safety inspections of airlines' operations. Interagency coordination of aviation safety and aviation security activities has emerged as a challenge with the transfer of aviation security responsibilities from FAA to the Transportation Security Administration. FAA faces challenges in implementing controls over its costs. Although it has partially implemented a new cost accounting system that enables it to track 70 percent of its air traffic services costs, this system lacks internal controls over $3.1 billion in labor costs, according to the Department of Transportation's Inspector General.

Much has changed since the Wendell H.  Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21)  reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) programs 3  years ago. At that time, as you know, air traffic was increasing, and  concerns about congestion and flight delays were paramount. Since then,  the downturn in the nation\u2019s economy, the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001, and, most recently, the war in Iraq have taken a heavy toll on  aviation. Flights that were once filled are now being canceled for lack of  business, and major air carriers are in serious financial difficulty.  Furthermore, as the federal budget deficit has increased, competition for  federal resources has intensified. Analysts nonetheless expect the demand  for air travel to rebound, and the nation\u2019s aviation system must be ready to  accommodate the projected growth safely and securely. The current  slowdown in the economy and in the aviation industry has created a  window of opportunity to prepare for this growth without the pressures of  congestion and flight delays. My statement today focuses on the  challenges that the Congress, the administration, and FAA face in  increasing aviation capacity, efficiency, and safety, and maintaining  controls over costs. My statement is based primarily on our published  reports, as well as our ongoing work for this Committee discussed in the  scope and methodology section at the end of the statement.", "Increasing capacity and service in the national airspace system poses  several challenges for the Congress and the administration during this  reauthorization process. Chief among them is deciding how much of  airports\u2019 planned capital development should be funded to increase  capacity and service, as well as improve the efficiency and safety of the  national airspace system. Funds for airports\u2019 capital development have  increased over the last 5 years, in part because of increases in the federal  grant funding provided to airports under the Airport Improvement  Program. Current funding levels are sufficient to cover much of the  estimated cost of planned capital development. However, future funding  levels may be affected by changes in the allocation of Airport  Improvement Program grant funds and by projected decreases in the  Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which supports the Airport Improvement  Program and other FAA accounts. Other challenges include building  runways expeditiously to increase capacity and providing air service to  small communities. Runway development now takes 10 to 14 years,  primarily because of time-consuming environmental reviews and  community concerns. Two federal programs, the Essential Air Service and  the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot programs, help bring  air service to small communities, but the costs of this service are  increasing while passenger ticket revenues are declining. The  administration is proposing an approach to streamline the environmental  reviews required for runway development, and intermodal alternatives,  such as rail or bus service, could provide access to the national air  transportation system for some small communities.", "Efforts to improve the efficiency of the national airspace system by  modernizing its principal component, the air traffic control system, face  ongoing challenges despite actions taken by the Congress and the  administration to eliminate the cost overruns, schedule delays, and  performance shortfalls that have plagued FAA\u2019s air traffic modernization  program and led us to designate this program as high risk. These actions  include granting FAA acquisition and human capital flexibilities in 1996  and creating a new, three-component structure to improve the oversight,  management, and operation of the air traffic control system in 2000. Our  work has shown that FAA has responded to these actions to varying  degrees, but more remains to be done. Overall, FAA is improving its  management of the air traffic modernization program and has  implemented some systems, but key projects continue to experience cost,  schedule, and performance problems. Additionally, FAA has used its  acquisition flexibilities to establish an acquisition management system and  its human capital flexibilities to fully or partially implement human capital  reform initiatives. The acquisition management system has provided FAA  with a structured management approach for selecting and controlling its  investments, and the human capital reform initiatives are affording  opportunities for FAA to manage its workforce more efficiently. However,  in implementing both of these reforms, FAA has not yet incorporated  important processes or elements for evaluating the results of its efforts,  modifying these efforts as necessary, and holding its managers  accountable. Finally, one of the three components of the new structure for  improving the performance of the air traffic control system has been  implemented. The oversight component, the Air Traffic Services  Subcommittee, has been meeting since January 2001 and emphasizing  performance management, but without the management and operating  components, the new structure is not yet functioning as intended.  Completing the implementation of, and continuing to improve, these  efforts will be important to enhancing the efficiency of the air traffic  control system.", "Important steps have been taken to enhance aviation safety, but some  challenges remain. Safer Skies, an initiative designed by FAA and the  aviation industry to reduce the nation\u2019s fatal aviation accident rate by 80  percent by 2007, is the centerpiece of these efforts to improve aviation  safety. This initiative began in 1998, and many preventive actions are  under way but have not yet been fully implemented. Another key effort to  improve aviation safety is FAA\u2019s Air Transportation Oversight System,  which was redesigned to provide more effective inspections of the nation\u2019s  airline operations. In reporting on this system in 1999, we noted that it  incorporated important features to ensure that airlines have systems to  control risks and prevent accidents, but that it had encountered startup  problems with data collection and program guidance. Many of these  problems were not yet fully resolved when the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Inspector General reported on the inspection system last  year. Finally, because of the often vital link between aviation safety and  aviation security, it will be critical for FAA to ensure that aviation safety is  maintained as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Transportation  Security Administration implements new security enhancements.", "With the decline in revenues to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund\u2014the  principal source of funding for most of FAA\u2019s operations, facilities and  equipment, and grant programs\u2014it is especially important that FAA  control or reduce costs, run its programs efficiently, and detect and  prevent fraudulent activities. FAA, however, faces challenges in  implementing controls over its costs. For example, during fiscal year 2000,  weaknesses in the internal controls over FAA\u2019s purchase card program  contributed to $5.4 million in improper purchases by FAA employees and  over $630,000 in purchases that were considered wasteful or questionable.  In addition, FAA has partially implemented a new cost accounting system  that enables it to track 70 percent of its air traffic services costs; however,  according to the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General, this  system lacks internal controls over $3.1 billion in labor costs. The  Inspector General further noted that a portion of this system, if  implemented as designed, could provide workforce data that would be  helpful in determining how many controllers are needed and where. These  data would assist FAA in planning for the anticipated retirement of large  numbers of air traffic controllers in the near and long term."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts to Increase Aviation Capacity and Service Face Funding and Other Challenges", "paragraphs": ["During this reauthorization period, the Congress and the administration  face several key challenges in attempting to increase the capacity of the  national airspace system and expand service to small communities.

According to FAA\u2019s estimate, which includes  only projects that are eligible for Airport Improvement Program (AIP)  grants, such as runways, taxiways, and noise mitigation and noise  reduction efforts, the total cost of airport development will be about $46  billion, or over $9 billion per year, for 2001 through 2005. FAA\u2019s estimate is  based on the agency\u2019s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, which  FAA published in August 2002. ACI\u2019s estimate includes all of the projects  in FAA\u2019s estimate, plus other planned airport capital projects that may or  may not be eligible for AIP grants. Projects that are not eligible for AIP  funding include parking garages, hangars, and expansions of commercial  space in terminals. ACI estimates a total cost of almost $75 billion, or  nearly $15 billion per year, for 2002 through 2006. Neither ACI\u2019s nor FAA\u2019s  estimate includes funding for the terminal modification projects that are  needed to accommodate the new explosives detection systems required to  screen checked baggage. ACI estimates that these projects will cost about  $3 billion to $5 billion over the next 5 years.", "Although there is a difference of $6 billion a year between FAA\u2019s and ACI\u2019s  estimates of planned development costs, both estimates cover projects for  every type of airport. As table 1 indicates, the estimates are identical for all  but the large- and medium-hub airports, which are responsible for  transporting about 90 percent of the traveling public. For these airports,  ACI\u2019s estimate of planned development costs is about twice as large as  FAA\u2019s.

In 1998, we  reported that large- and medium-hub airports could fund about 79 percent  of their planned capital development and smaller airports could fund  about 52 percent of their planned capital development if they continued to  receive funding at prior years\u2019 levels. In 2003, the funding ability of both  groups of airports increased. As shown in figure 1, large- and medium-hub  airports could fund about 80 percent of their planned capital development,  an increase of 1 percentage point, while smaller airports could fund about  73 percent of their planned capital development, an increase of 21  percentage points, assuming the continuation of prior years\u2019 funding  levels.", "The primary reason why smaller airports are able to fund 73 percent of  their planned development in 2003, rather than the 52 percent we reported  in 1998, is that they have benefited significantly from the increases in AIP  grants, which are a larger source of funding for smaller airports than for  larger airports. In addition, smaller airports have received an increasing  share of AIP grants because of statutorily required changes in the  distribution of AIP grants. For example, in AIR-21, the Congress increased  the funding for two grant categories that primarily or exclusively benefit  smaller airports\u2014the state apportionment fund and the small airport  fund\u2014and created general aviation entitlement grants, which also benefit  smaller airports. The Senate\u2019s and the administration\u2019s reauthorization  proposals continue to support increases in the amount of AIP grant  funding awarded to smaller airports.

In recent fiscal years, airports obtained most of their funding  for planned capital development from bonds, AIP grants, and passenger  facility charges. Because the Trust Fund is the source of funding for AIP  grants, its financial condition is important to the ability of airports to fund  capital development, and decreases in its revenues could reduce the  amount of funding for airport planned capital development.

As  you know, the Trust Fund is the source of funding not only for AIP grants  but also for other FAA accounts, including facilities and equipment;  research, engineering, and development; and most operations. Revenues  to the Trust Fund come from several types of taxes, including passenger  ticket and fuel taxes. Although projections made in November 2002  indicate that the Trust Fund will be able to meet its traditional obligations  over the next 10 years, the financial outlook for the next 5 to 8 years is  uncertain, in part, because passenger traffic has decreased with the  slowdown in the economy. Current estimates indicate that between fiscal  year 2003 and fiscal year 2007, the Trust Fund\u2019s 2002 uncommitted balance  of about $4.8 billion will decline by about $4 billion, leaving a balance of  less than a billion dollars. In addition, if revenues fall short of current  projections, the Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance may be zero. Under  this scenario, AIP grants and other FAA accounts supported by the Trust  Fund could potentially receive less funding, and the Congress and the  administration would have to decide how to offset the potential decreases.", "As figure 2 shows, from 1999 through 2002, revenues to the Trust Fund  have declined, while expenditures from the fund have increased. Revenues  fell from about $11 billion in 1999 to almost $10 billion in 2002, a decrease  of almost 10 percent. During the same period, expenditures increased from  about $8 billion to about $12 billion, an increase of about 47 percent. As a  result, the uncommitted balance (surplus) has fallen by nearly 35 percent,  from $7 billion in 1999 to almost $5 billion in 2002.", "The major reason for the decline in Trust Fund revenues was a drop in  passenger ticket tax revenues, which fell by nearly $1.2 billion from 1999  to 2002. The increase in Trust Fund expenditures from 1999 through 2002,  amounting to almost $4 billion, can be attributed primarily to increases in  funding for FAA operations and AIP grants, which accounted for about 47  percent and about 34 percent of the total increase, respectively.", "In addition, the administration is proposing actions that would further  reduce the Trust Fund balance over the next several years. Specifically,  the President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget request would increase the  percentage of FAA operations funded by the Trust Fund from 75 percent  to 79 percent.

In  December 2002, FAA published the most recent version of its Operational  Evolution Plan, a 10-year plan to increase the capacity and efficiency of  the national airspace system, primarily by building runways. Figure 3  illustrates how capacity will be increased at one airport through runway  construction.", "If successfully carried out, FAA\u2019s Operational Evolution Plan would  substantially increase capacity and improve efficiency. However, FAA  faces several challenges in implementing the plan. First, the success of the  plan depends on adequate funding and on the consensus of FAA\u2019s aviation  industry partners. Yet according to the most recent version of the plan, the  timing and implementation of some activities may be in jeopardy because  of the current economic situation and the uncertain viability of some  industry participants. For example, the plan calls for the airline industry to  invest $11 billion in new equipment for aircraft. FAA is currently reviewing  the ability of the airlines to make this investment. Second, as noted, the  plan relies heavily on runway development to increase capacity, but the  most recent version of the plan reports mixed results in building new  runways. While the plan indicates that one new runway will be built during  the next 10 years, it points out that another runway has been canceled and  the construction of six additional runways has been delayed because of  local situations.", "In January 2003, we reported that airports spent about 10 years planning  and building recently completed runways and expect to spend about 14  years on runways that are not yet completed. We also reported that  several external factors affect how much time is spent planning and  building runways, and several airports with unfinished runway projects  identified significant challenges that had delayed the completion of their  projects. While many airports believed that completing the environmental  review phase was a significant challenge and is an issue that warrants  immediate attention, airports also faced obstacles that some said were as  onerous as the environmental review phase. They identified significant  challenges in reaching agreement with community interest groups during  the planning phase and in mitigating the potential impact of aircraft noise  on the surrounding community. Although there may be no single solution  to resolving all of the issues involved in planning and building runways,  the federal government and airport authorities are taking some action. For  example, the Senate\u2019s and the administration\u2019s reauthorization proposals  call for streamlining the environmental review of transportation  infrastructure projects.", "Recognizing that building new runways is not always a practicable way to  increase capacity at some airports, we identified three alternatives to  building runways in our December 2001 report:    Find ways to manage and distribute demand within the system\u2019s existing  capacity at busy airports such as LaGuardia, by, for example, limiting the  number of takeoffs and landings during peak periods or limiting the ability  of general aviation aircraft to use especially congested airports (under  current law, all aircraft have equal access to even the largest airports).  Airports are restricted in using pricing to reflect the scarcity and  congestion of airspace.", "Add capacity by using nearby airports that have available capacity.", "Examine other modes of intercity travel, such as high-speed rail, where  metropolitan areas are relatively close, to form an integrated, intermodal  transportation network.", "Accordingly, we recommended that the Department of Transportation  (DOT) begin a more extensive evaluation of initiatives, including  intermodal solutions and a dialogue with transportation stakeholders, as a  basis for developing a comprehensive blueprint for addressing the nation\u2019s  long-term transportation needs. DOT has recognized the need for more  and better long-range planning on the potential use of such measures and  agreed with our recommendation.

The  reauthorization process provides an opportunity for the Congress to  clarify the federal strategy for helping small communities acquire the  commercial air service they desire. Currently, the challenges that small  communities have long faced in obtaining or retaining commercial air  service are increasing as many U.S. airlines try to stem unprecedented  financial losses through numerous cost-cutting measures, including  reducing or eliminating service in some markets. Small communities feel  such losses disproportionately because they may have service from only  one or two airlines. For them, reductions can mean no air service at all.", "The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, authorized under the Airline  Deregulation Act of 1978, guarantees that small communities served  before deregulation will continue to receive a certain level of scheduled air  service. Its costs have more than tripled since fiscal year 1995, and  indications are that without changes to the program, the demand for  subsidies will soon exceed the program\u2019s $113 million appropriation for  fiscal year 2003. At the same time, aggregate passenger levels at EAS- subsidized airports continue to fall. Often fewer than 10 percent of a  community\u2019s potential passengers use the subsidized local service; the rest  choose to drive to their destination or drive to a larger airport that offers  lower fares or more frequent service to more destinations. In 2000, the  median number of passengers on each EAS-subsidized flight was three.  The administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2004 would  substantially reduce the federal subsidy for small community air service  and require communities that wish to retain the service to help subsidize  it. Specifically, the budget proposal would reduce federal EAS funding  from $133 million in 2003 to $50 million in 2004, alter the eligibility criteria  for funding, and require nonfederal matching funds. Consistent with its  budget proposal, the administration\u2019s reauthorization proposal would  restructure the EAS program to direct its resources to the small  communities with the greatest need to maintain access to national air  transportation service. The Senate bill proposes to reauthorize funding for  the program at current levels.", "The Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program, authorized  as part of AIR-21, provides grants to communities to enhance local air  service. In fiscal year 2002, 180 communities requested over $142 million  in air service development grants, and $20 million was appropriated. In  March 2003, we reported that the program funded some innovative  approaches. For example, Mobile, Alabama, received about $450,000 to  provide ground-handling services to an airline, and Caspar, Wyoming,  received $500,000 to purchase and lease back an aircraft to an airline to  ensure service to the community. The program also funded the same types  of projects that many small communities have undertaken in recent years,  such as evaluations of marketing activities and the use of financial  incentives to encourage airlines to either start or enhance service.  According to our analysis of similar approaches used by about 100 small  communities, financial incentives offered the most promise for attracting  new or additional service. However, the additional service typically ended  with the incentives. The sustainability of such improvements in air service  over the longer term appeared to depend on the community\u2019s size and  ability to demonstrate a commitment to that air service, either by  providing a profitable passenger base or through direct financial  assistance. As you know, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget  proposal would eliminate the funding for this pilot program. It is too soon  to determine how effective the various types of initiatives funded through  this program might prove to be.

Problems in implementing the  Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System are indicative of the  problems that have plagued the modernization program.

Initially FAA anticipated very little software  development, planned to install STARS in 172 facilities at a cost of $940  million, and expected implementation to begin in 1998 and end in 2005. In  1999, FAA modified its acquisition approach (from off-the-shelf software  to a combination of customized and off-the-shelf software) and increased  to 188 the number of facilities scheduled to receive STARS. Then the  agency concluded that it did not have adequate funding to deploy STARS  to 188 facilities, and in March 2002, it received approval to deploy STARS  at 74 facilities that had frequent equipment failures, were new, or had the  digital radar needed to operate STARS.", "FAA does not yet know to what extent its estimate of STARS\u2019s remaining  development costs is reliable because, as we reported in January 2003,  FAA lacks accurate, valid, current data on the STARS program\u2019s remaining  costs and progress. Without such data, FAA is limited in its ability to  effectively oversee the contractor\u2019s performance and reliably estimate  future costs. Although FAA has adopted clear procurement management  policies and procedures, it did not consistently apply this guidance in  managing the STARS contract. For example, the development cost  estimate is based on the contractor\u2019s projections, which FAA had not yet  independently analyzed as its guidance directs.

Figure 6 summarizes our analysis of  FAA\u2019s progress in implementing initiatives in each of these areas.", "While FAA has fully or partially implemented the initiatives in each of its  three broad reform areas, it has not fully incorporated elements that are  important to effective human capital management into its overall reform  effort. These elements include data collection and analysis, performance  goals and measures, and links between reform goals and program goals.  Furthermore, as we reported in February 2003, FAA has not developed  specific steps and time frames for building these missing elements into its  human capital management and for using these elements to evaluate the  effects of its personnel reform initiatives, make strategic improvements,  and hold the agency\u2019s leadership accountable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Structure for Improving the Performance of the Air Traffic Control System Has Not Been Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, AIR-21 and an executive order established a new structure to  accelerate the modernization and improve the performance of the air  traffic control system. This structure was to consist of (1) a five-member  board, called the Air Traffic Services Subcommittee (Subcommittee), to  oversee the air traffic control system, (2) a chief operating officer to  manage the air traffic control system, and (3) a new performance-based  organization, to be known as the Air Traffic Organization, to operate the  air traffic control system. Under the act, the Subcommittee provides  oversight by, among other things, reviewing and approving strategic plans,  large contracts, and budget requests for the air traffic control system.", "The Subcommittee has been meeting since January 2001, but a chief  operating officer has not yet been appointed, and FAA is waiting for an  appointment before putting the new air traffic organization in place. To  date, the Subcommittee has focused on bringing performance  management, accountability, and a more businesslike structure to the air  traffic control system, and it has taken some specific actions, including  reviewing and approving performance metrics, a budget, and three large  procurements that FAA initiated. However, without a chief operating  officer or a performance-based organization, the new structure is not  functioning as intended.", "FAA and other stakeholders have suggested reasons for the difficulties in  implementing the new structure and have proposed changes to AIR-21 that  they believe would address these reasons. For example, they have noted  that the Subcommittee\u2019s authority to approve the budget request for the  air traffic control system challenges the administration\u2019s prerogative to  submit a budget request reflecting its priorities, and they have cited  uncertainties in the responsibilities and reporting relationships of the chief  operating officer, the FAA Administrator, and the Subcommittee that, they  say, have made it difficult to hire a chief operating officer. To address  these issues, the administration\u2019s reauthorization proposal would (1)  eliminate the Subcommittee\u2019s approval authority, making the  Subcommittee an advisory body, and (2) designate the FAA Administrator  as the chair of the Subcommittee, thereby strengthening the  Administrator\u2019s authority over, and accountability for the performance of,  the chief operating officer. While these changes would eliminate the  challenge that the Subcommittee\u2019s approval authority poses to the  administration\u2019s prerogatives; would clarify the lines of authority between  the chief operating officer, the FAA Administrator, and the Subcommittee;  and could make it easier to hire a chief operating officer, they would also  limit the power of the Subcommittee. The Senate\u2019s reauthorization  proposal would also designate the FAA Administrator as the chair of the  Subcommittee, but it would retain the Subcommittee\u2019s approval authority.

Safer Skies is  intended to reduce the fatal accident rate for commercial aviation by 80  percent and to reduce the number of fatal accidents for general aviation to  350 a year by 2007. Because many preventive actions have not yet been  fully implemented, it may be too early to assess their effectiveness.

The FAA Administrator has noted that  perhaps the greatest support the agency can provide to the industry is a  robust safety oversight role that will not waver in difficult times. FAA\u2019s  new inspection program, the Air Transportation Oversight System, is  central to this oversight role. This program, which was implemented in  1998, aims to ensure not only that airlines comply with FAA\u2019s safety  requirements but also that they have operating systems to control risks  and prevent accidents. Figure 7 shows an FAA inspector inspecting an  aircraft for compliance with FAA\u2019s safety requirements.", "We reported in 1999 that FAA had not completed many critical steps, such  as developing guidance for inspectors and creating databases to use in  prioritizing inspection resources, before implementing the new inspection  system in 1998. As a result, the agency\u2019s ability to conduct effective  inspections remains limited. FAA has begun to address some of the  problems that we identified with the guidance and the databases.  However, according to a 2002 review by the DOT Inspector General, many  of the problems that we identified persist, and the program\u2019s  implementation remains inconsistent because FAA has not established  strong oversight and accountability procedures. This situation limits  FAA\u2019s ability to conduct more systematic, structured inspections; analyze  the resulting data to identify safety trends; and target its resources to the  greatest aviation safety risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aviation Safety and Security Require Close Coordination between FAA and TSA", "paragraphs": ["Some key efforts under way to improve aviation security require  interagency coordination between FAA and TSA because they could also  affect aircraft safety. While TSA is responsible for most issues related to  aviation security, FAA retains responsibility for those related to aviation  safety, including approving the initial aircraft design, structural  modifications, and procedures for emergency evacuation and the  transportation of hazardous cargo. For example, strengthening cockpit  doors to increase cockpit security during flights was one of the  government\u2019s earliest responses to the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Because the modifications could increase the weight of the doors and  change the way they are attached to the aircraft, FAA has been certifying  these modifications to ensure that they will not cause decompression  during flight or affect the aircraft\u2019s structural integrity. In addition, new  security procedures require that the cockpit door remain locked during  flight and that access to the cockpit be restricted to the flight crew. As a  result, senior flight attendants will no longer carry keys to the cockpit, and  FAA is approving changes to the procedures for rescuing the flight crew in  an emergency.", "FAA is also responsible for the safe transport of dangerous materials  onboard aircraft. Dangerous goods are chemical (including infectious)  substances (or anything containing such substances) that pose a threat to  public safety or the environment during transportation. When these goods  are properly packaged, labeled, and stowed onboard, they can be  transported safely, but when they are not, they can pose significant threats  to people and property. TSA is responsible for screening all passengers  and property, including cargo, that will be carried aboard an aircraft. If,  during the screening of passengers or baggage, TSA discovers dangerous  goods that are not properly packaged or labeled, TSA will need to  coordinate and share information with FAA, which is responsible for  enforcing any regulatory violations.", "In addition, aircraft crashes could fall under the jurisdiction of either FAA  or TSA, depending on whether they were the results of accidents (FAA) or  deliberate acts (TSA). It will be important for the two agencies to work  together closely during the initial stages of crash investigations. To  facilitate coordination on these and other security issues that affect  aviation safety, TSA and FAA signed a memorandum of agreement on  February 28, 2003. In addition, on March 4, 2003, the Secretary of  Transportation agreed to assign a senior official within the Office of the  Secretary to serve as DOT\u2019s primary liaison to TSA.

Moreover, as we  mentioned previously in this statement, revenues to the aviation Trust  Fund, which is the source of funding for most of FAA\u2019s operations,  facilities and equipment, and grant programs, have declined in recent  years while outlays have increased. It is, therefore, especially important  that FAA control or reduce costs, run its programs efficiently, and detect  and prevent fraudulent activities. We and DOT\u2019s Inspector General have  reported that improvements are needed in these areas.", "For example, in March 2003, we reported that weaknesses in FAA\u2019s  purchase card controls resulted in instances of improper, wasteful, and  questionable purchases, as well as missing and stolen assets. These  internal control weaknesses included inadequate segregation of duties  (i.e., the cardholder requested the purchase, placed the order, and picked  up or received the goods without any other review or approval), lax  supervisory review and approval, missing purchase documents, inadequate  training, and insufficient program monitoring activities, all of which  created an environment vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. During  fiscal year 2000, these weaknesses contributed to $5.4 million in improper  purchases by FAA employees and over $630,000 in purchases that were  considered wasteful or questionable because they were missing a receipt  to show what was actually purchased. To reduce the likelihood of  improper and wasteful purchases, we recommended a number of actions  to strengthen the internal controls over FAA\u2019s purchase card program,  such as developing detailed procedures that specify the type and extent of  review or approval that is expected. FAA agreed with our  recommendations.", "In addition, DOT\u2019s Inspector General reported in January 2003 that FAA  needs to contain increases in its operating costs and improve its internal  controls over costs. Over the past 6 years, FAA\u2019s operations budget,  which is 73 percent personnel costs, increased by over 41 percent, from  $5.3 billion in fiscal year 1998 to $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2003. The  Inspector General noted that FAA has made extensive use of its human  capital flexibilities to substantially increase salaries, but has done little to  reduce operating costs. FAA has improved its ability to track its costs by  partially implementing a new cost accounting system that the Congress  directed it to develop in 1996. The new system, which FAA expects to be  fully operational by the end of 2003, now tracks 70 percent of the  personnel, overhead, and other costs related to air traffic services.  However, DOT\u2019s Inspector General has reported problems with the labor  distribution system, which is part of the cost accounting system and is  used to account for and distribute air traffic controller labor costs of about  $3.1 billion annually to specific facilities and functions. The Inspector  General noted that the system omitted important internal controls needed  to ensure that the time worked by air traffic controllers would be  accurately recorded in the accounting system and paid from the proper  account. The Inspector General brought these deficiencies to the attention  of FAA, and the Administrator agreed to correct them. The Inspector  General further noted that the system as designed could provide  workforce data that would help determine how many controllers are  needed and where. These data would assist FAA in planning for the  anticipated retirement of large numbers of air traffic controllers in the  near and long term.  Congressional oversight is important to ensure that  FAA follows through and corrects the problems that we and the Inspector  General have identified so that FAA can spend its resources on projects  and services that will provide the greatest return on the public\u2019s  investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This statement is based primarily on issued reports that are listed under  Related GAO Products.
