For monitoring, we developed this list of leading  practices based on our review of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010;  OMB\u2019s Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit  Requirements for Federal Awards; GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government (Greenbook); and others. The list of leading  practices for monitoring includes developing monitoring plans; collecting,  reviewing, and analyzing monitoring data; and establishing roles and  responsibilities of personnel responsible for monitoring.", "For evaluation, we developed a list of leading practices based on the  American Evaluation Association\u2019s (AEA) 2016 An Evaluation Roadmap  for a More Effective Government (AEA Roadmap) and Preface to  Evaluators\u2019 Ethical Guiding Principles. The list of leading practices for  evaluation include developing evaluation plans; ensuring evaluator independence; developing staff skills regarding evaluation and use of  evidence; and establishing roles and responsibilities of personnel  responsible for evaluation. To perform these analyses, two analysts  assessed if the Guidelines incorporated specific GAO leading practices.  The analysts worked iteratively, comparing notes and reconciling  differences at each stage of the analysis. In addition, GAO staff  independent of the two analysts reviewed the final analysis, and made  modifications as appropriate. We also interviewed relevant OMB officials  in Washington D.C. involved in developing the memorandum and inquired  about specific requirements and plans to ensure the implementation of  these Guidelines.", "To address our second objective, we examined U.S. agency M&E policies  against the requirements noted in the OMB Guidelines. We identified the  six major agencies administering the most foreign assistance funds. The  six agencies are the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),  the Department of State (State), the Millennium Challenge Corporation  (MCC), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Defense  (DOD). We asked these agencies to identify or provide all relevant  policies and guidance relating to foreign assistance M&E, including,  where appropriate, standard operating procedures or other guidance.  For USDA, we reviewed the Foreign Agricultural Service\u2019s food  assistance; for HHS, the President\u2019s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief;  and for DOD, security cooperation programs. To perform these analyses,  two analysts assessed agency M&E policy documents against the  requirements in the OMB Guidelines. We identified requirements as  phrases that included the following language \u201crequired,\u201d \u201cmust,\u201d  \u201cmandatory,\u201d or \u201cshould.\u201d The analysts worked iteratively, comparing  notes and reconciling differences at each stage of the analysis. In  addition, other GAO staff independent of the two analysts reviewed the  final analysis, and made modifications as appropriate. We also  interviewed relevant OMB staff and agency officials in Washington D.C.  involved in developing and implementing the M&E policies and inquired  about specific requirements, and plans to ensure their M&E policies are  implemented.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
