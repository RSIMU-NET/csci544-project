Efforts to revise the curriculum requirements for AMT Schools  are ongoing through the rulemaking process, and FAA is also currently  updating the testing standards for mechanics.", "The curriculum requirements for AMT Schools have remained largely  unchanged for several decades despite numerous attempts to update  them as aviation technology has evolved. The minimum requirements are  established in regulation and list the subjects that AMT Schools must  include in their training curriculum for individuals to be eligible to take  FAA\u2019s mechanic tests. FAA officials, employers, and AMT School  officials we interviewed said the current curriculum requirements do not  emphasize commonly used modern aircraft technologies, such as  avionics and composite materials. Because the curriculum requirements  are established in federal regulation, FAA has attempted several times to  revise them through the rulemaking process. Table 1 provides selected  changes or actions relating to these requirements.", "FAA officials noted several challenges to updating the AMT School  curriculum requirements, including competing demands at the department  level, the extent of comments FAA has received from stakeholders in  response to proposed changes, and the amount of time required to  coordinate with internal stakeholders during the review process. We  previously reported on factors that affect the amount of time needed to  issue a rule for selected agencies, which included similar challenges such  as the complexity of an issue, agency management priorities, and the  amount of review required at different phases of the rulemaking  process.", "In October 2015, FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)  with the stated goal of updating the existing AMT School curriculum and  providing an efficient means of changing specific course items by  including them in each school\u2019s operations specifications (see fig. 6).  This would eliminate the need to go through the federal rulemaking  process to update the curriculum. As part of its ongoing efforts to revise  the curriculum requirements for AMT Schools through the rulemaking  process, FAA issued a supplemental NPRM in the April 2019 Federal  Register that expanded the scope of the NPRM it issued in October 2015  (see fig. 6). Comments on the supplemental NPRM were due in June  2019. As of October 2019, FAA officials said they were in the process of  reviewing the comments.", "In a separate effort outside of the rulemaking process, FAA is currently  updating the testing standards for mechanics. The standards were last  revised in 2015. FAA has acknowledged that current mechanic testing  standards are also outdated. As a result, aviation stakeholders have  stated that the mechanic tests include outdated or irrelevant questions.  For example, the practical test may include projects on wood airframes  and fabric coverings, which are not common to modern commercial  aircraft. FAA has stated that the revised testing standards will provide a  comprehensive framework for the mechanic tests and serve as a guide  for reviewing and revising the oral and written test questions and the  practical projects.", "FAA officials said two offices within the agency are responsible for  updating AMT School training curriculum requirements and mechanic  testing standards and that these offices have been coordinating efforts to  align the two. FAA\u2019s efforts to modernize the curriculum requirements  for AMT Schools and its efforts to update the mechanic testing standards  started on slightly different paths, in part due to differences in when the  working groups were formed and recommendations to address these  issues were made (see fig. 7).", "As of October 2019, FAA had not issued a final rule for modernizing AMT  School curriculum requirements as required by the FAA Reauthorization  Act of 2018, and it was still in the process of updating testing standards.  FAA officials have indicated that they have informed the appropriate  committees in Congress that the proposed schedule for issuance of a  final rule is in October 2020 and said that the revised mechanic testing  standards would likely be finalized after the publication of the final rule  amending the curriculum requirements for AMT Schools. An FAA official  noted that any delay in finalizing the rule would likely result in a  corresponding delay to finalizing the testing standards. Delaying the  release of the updated mechanic testing standards could result in the  prolonged use of outdated or irrelevant questions on the mechanic tests.  FAA officials said that once finalized and implemented, the updated  curriculum requirements for AMT Schools and the mechanic testing  standards for individuals should be mostly aligned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["A sufficient supply of aviation maintenance workers is critical to  maintaining a safe and robust aviation system and meeting the growing  demand for air travel. Current training and skills requirements for these  workers are also important because of changing flight technology. Both  the federal government and other industries benefit from having a  professional, trained, and qualified workforce, and addressing aviation  workforce needs is a shared responsibility among these different  stakeholders. As the federal agency responsible for certificating aircraft  mechanics and repairmen, FAA maintains certain demographic  information on these individuals that could shed light on the  characteristics and employment of these personnel. However, without  strategically using or analyzing the data it has along with data other  stakeholders collect, FAA will not have certain information it needs to  target its resources or measure and improve progress toward its aviation  workforce goals. It may also miss the opportunity to provide other  stakeholders with valuable information for supporting these workers.  Other agencies and stakeholders may also assist FAA in understanding  and promoting the development of the aviation maintenance workforce.

However, because these data combine information  for certificated and non-certificated workers, it is difficult to know the  extent to which any hiring difficulties represent demand for certificated  workers, specifically. In addition, the indicators should be viewed with  appropriate caveats.
