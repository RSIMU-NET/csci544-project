Since these programs began, much has changed and continues to change in the arenas of medicine, technology, the economy, and societal views and expectations of people with disabilities. These changes have generally enhanced the potential of people with disabilities to work as well as the kinds of jobs that are available. Moreover, these programs have grown. In 2001, SSA provided $73.2 billion in cash benefits to 8.8 million working-age adults. With such an extensive cash outlay and such a large beneficiary population, it is important to use updated scientific and economic information to evaluate claims for disability benefits.", "Today I will discuss the results of our examination of SSA\u2019s efforts to update the disability criteria the agency uses to make eligibility decisions for DI and SSI benefits. I will focus my remarks on (1) the scientific advances, economic changes, and social changes that have occurred in recent years that relate to the disability criteria used in DI and SSI eligibility decisions, (2) the extent that DI and SSI disability criteria have been updated to reflect these changes, and (3) the implications of fully incorporating scientific advances, economic changes, and social changes into the DI and SSI disability criteria and program design. To develop this information, we reviewed agency documents, SSA\u2019s advisory board reports, our prior reports, and other literature. In addition, we interviewed agency officials and several experts in the field.", "In summary, first we found that scientific advances, changes in the nature of work, and social changes have generally enhanced the potential for people with disabilities to work. Medical advancements, such as organ transplantations, and assistive technologies, such as advances in wheelchair design, have given more independence to some individuals. At the same time, a service- and knowledge-based economy has opened new opportunities for people with disabilities, while social changes, reflected in the Americans with Disabilities Act, have fostered the expectation that people with disabilities can work and have the right to work. Second, we found that DI and SSI disability criteria have not kept pace with these advances and changes. Depending on the claimants\u2019 impairment, decisions about an individual\u2019s eligibility for disability benefits can be based on both medical and labor market criteria. SSA is in the midst of an effort to update the medical portion of the disability criteria, but the pace is slow. However, even if the criteria were fully updated, the program as currently designed does not require SSA employees to consider the possible effect that treatments or assistive technologies could have on a claimant\u2019s ability to work, unless a physician has already prescribed the treatment. Moreover, with respect to the labor market portion of the disability criteria, SSA is using outdated information about the types and demands of jobs in the economy.", "Finally, regarding the implications for incorporating the advances and changes into the programs\u2019 disability criteria, some steps can be taken within the existing program design and some would require more fundamental changes.  Within the context of the current statutory and regulatory framework, SSA will need to continue to update the medical portion of the disability criteria and vigorously expand its efforts to examine labor market changes.  However, in addition, policymakers and agency officials could look beyond the traditional concepts that underlie the DI and SSI programs to re-examine the core of federal disability programs\u2014including eligibility standards, the benefits structure, and return-to-work assistance\u2014with a focus on taking advantage of the medical, economic, and social changes. This would include maximizing opportunities to work in today\u2019s environment, while providing financial support when and where it is needed. To do so, they need critical information on various policy options, including what works, what needs to be fundamentally re-oriented, and the cost of such changes. To this end, approaches taken from the private disability insurers and other countries offer useful insights."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Established in 1956, DI is an insurance program that provides benefits to workers who are unable to work because of severe long-term disability. In 2001, DI provided $54.2 billion in cash benefits to 6.1 million disabled workers. Workers who have worked long enough and recently enough are insured for coverage under the DI program. DI beneficiaries receive cash assistance and, after a 24-month waiting period, Medicare coverage. Once found eligible for benefits, disabled workers continue to receive benefits until they die, return to work and earn more than allowed by program rules, are found to have medically improved to the point of having the ability to work, or reach full retirement age (when disability benefits convert to retirement benefits). To help ensure that only eligible beneficiaries remain on the rolls, SSA is required by law to conduct continuing disability reviews for all DI beneficiaries to determine whether they continue to meet the disability requirements of the law.", "SSI, created in 1972, is an income assistance program that provides cash benefits for disabled, blind, or aged individuals who have low income and limited resources. In 2001, SSI provided $19 billion in federal cash benefits to 3.8 million disabled and blind individuals age 18-64. Unlike the DI program, SSI has no prior work requirement. In most cases, SSI eligibility makes recipients eligible for Medicaid benefits. SSI benefits terminate for the same reasons as DI benefits, although SSI benefits also terminate when a recipient no longer meets SSI income and resource requirements (SSI benefits do not convert to retirement benefits when the individual reaches full retirement age). The law requires that continuing disability reviews be conducted for some SSI recipients for continuing eligibility.", "The Social Security Act\u2019s definition of disability for adults under DI and SSI is the same: an individual must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) has lasted or is expected to last at least 1 year or to result in death and (2) prevents the individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity. Moreover, the definition specifies that for a person to be determined to be disabled, the impairment must be of such severity that the person not only is unable to do his or her previous work but, considering his or her age, education, and work experience, is unable to do any other kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy.", "SSA regulations and guidelines provide further specificity in determining eligibility for DI and SSI benefits. For instance, SSA has developed the Listing of Impairments (the Medical Listings) to describe medical conditions that SSA has determined are severe enough ordinarily to prevent an individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity. SSA has also developed a procedure to assess applicants who do not have an impairment that meets or equals the severity of the Medical Listings. The procedure helps determine whether an applicant can still perform work done in the past or other work that exists in the national economy. While not expressly required by law to update the criteria used in the disability determination process, SSA has stated that it would update them to reflect current medical criteria and terminology. Over the years, SSA has periodically taken steps to update its Medical Listing. The last general update to the Medical Listing occurred in 1985.", "In 2000, the most common impairments among DI\u2019s disabled workers were mental disorders and musculoskeletal conditions (see fig.1). These two conditions also were the fastest growing conditions since 1986, increasing by 7 and 5 percentage points, respectively.", "In 2000, the most common impairments among the group of SSI blind and disabled adults age 18-64 were mental disorders and mental retardation (see fig. 2).

Following World War II and the Korean Conflict, advancements in technology, including computers and automated equipment, reduced the need for physical labor. The goods-producing sector\u2019s share of the economy\u2014mining, construction, and manufacturing\u2014declined from about 44 percent in 1945 to about 18 percent in 2000.

Some jobs require standing for long hours, and other jobs, such as office work, require social abilities. These characteristics can pose particular challenges for some persons with certain physical or mental impairments. Moreover, other trends\u2014such as downsizing and the growth in contingent workers\u2014can limit job security and benefits, like health insurance, that most persons with disabilities require for participation in the labor force.

By 1994, the proposed changes to 5 of these 7 body systems were finalized. The agency\u2019s efforts to update the Medical Listings were curtailed in the mid-1990s due to staff shortages, competing priorities, and lack of adequate research on disability issues.", "SSA resumed updating the Medical Listings in 1998. Since then, SSA has taken some positive steps in updating portions of the medical criteria it uses to make eligibility decisions, although progress is slow. As of early 2002, SSA has published the final updated criteria for 1 of the 9 remaining body systems not updated in the early 1990s (musculoskeletal) and a portion of a second body system (mental disorders). SSA also plans to update again the 5 body systems that were updated in the early 1990s. In addition, SSA has asked the public to comment on proposed changes for several other body systems. After reviewing the schedule and timing for the revisions, SSA recently pushed back the completion date for publishing proposed changes for all remaining body systems to the end of 2003. The revised schedule does not list target dates, with one exception, for submitting changes for final clearance to the Office of Management and Budget.", "SSA\u2019s slow progress in completing the updates could undermine the purpose of incorporating medical advances into its medical criteria. For example, the criteria for musculoskeletal conditions\u2014a common impairment among persons entering DI\u2014were updated in 1985. Then, in 1991, SSA began developing new criteria and published its proposed changes in 1993 but did not finalize the changes until 2002; therefore, changes made to the musculoskeletal criteria in 2002 were essentially based on SSA\u2019s review of the field in the early 1990s. SSA officials told us that in finalizing the criteria, they reviewed the changes identified in the early 1990s and found that little had taken place since then to warrant changes to the proposed criteria. However, given the advancements in medical science since 1991, it may be difficult for SSA to be certain that all applicable medical advancements are in fact included in the most recent update."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Changes Have Been Made, Treatment Advances and Assistive Technologies Are Not Fully Considered in Decision- Making", "paragraphs": ["SSA has made various types of changes to the Medical Listings thus far.

The statutory and regulatory design of these programs limits the role of treatment in deciding who is disabled. Unless an individual has been prescribed treatment, SSA does not consider the possible effects of treatment in the disability decision, even if the treatment could make the difference between being able and not being able to work. Thus, treatments that can help restore functioning to persons with certain impairments may not be factored into the disability decision for some applicants. For example, medications to control severe mental illness, arthritis treatments to slow or stop joint damage, total hip replacements for severely injured hips, and drugs and physical therapies to possibly improve the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis are not automatically factored into SSA\u2019s decision making for determining the extent that impairments affect people\u2019s ability to work. Additionally, this limited approach to treatment raises an equity issue: Applicants whose treatment allows them to work could be denied benefits while applicants with the same condition who have not been prescribed treatment could be allowed benefits.", "As with treatment, the benefits of innovations in assistive technologies\u2014 such as advanced prosthetics and wheelchair designs\u2014have not been fully incorporated into DI and SSI disability criteria because the design of these programs does not recognize these advances in disability decision making.

The O*NET, for example, does not contain SSA-needed information on the amount of lifting or mental demands associated with particular jobs. The agencies have discussed ways that O*NET might be modified or supplemental information collected to meet SSA\u2019s needs, but no definitive solution has been identified. Absent such changes to the O*NET, SSA officials have indicated that an entirely new occupational database could be needed to meet SSA\u2019s needs, but such an effort could take many years to develop, validate, and implement.

Whereas the programs currently are grounded in assessing and providing benefits based on individuals\u2019 incapacities, fully incorporating recent advances and changes could result in SSA assessing individuals with physical and mental conditions with a focus on their capacity to work and then providing them with, or helping them obtain, needed assistance to improve their capacity to work. Moreover, reorienting programs in this direction is consistent with increased expectations of people with disabilities and the integration of people with disabilities into the workplace, as reflected in the Americans with Disabilities Act. We have recommended in prior reports that SSA place a greater priority on work, design more effective means to more accurately identify and expand beneficiaries\u2019 work capacities, and develop legislative packages for those areas where the agency does not have legislative authority to enact change. However, for people with disabilities who do not have a realistic or practical work option, long-term cash support would remain the best option.", "In reexamining the fundamental concepts underlying the design of the DI and SSI programs, approaches used by other disability programs may offer some valuable insights. For example, our prior review of three private disability insurers shows that they have fundamentally reoriented their disability systems toward building the productive capacities of people with disabilities, while not jeopardizing the availability of cash benefits for people who are not able to return to the labor force. These systems have accomplished this reorientation while using a definition of disability that is similar to that used by SSA\u2019s disability programs.  However, it is too early to fully measure the effect of these changes.  In these private disability systems, the disability eligibility assessment process evaluates a person\u2019s potential to work and assists those with work potential to return to the labor force. This process of identifying and providing services intended to enhance a person\u2019s productive capacity occurs early after disability onset and continues periodically throughout the duration of the claim. In contrast, SSA\u2019s eligibility assessment process encourages applicants to concentrate on their incapacities, and return-to-work assistance occurs, if at all, only after an often lengthy process of determining eligibility for benefits. SSA\u2019s process focuses on deciding who is impaired sufficiently to be eligible for cash payments, rather than on identifying and providing the services and supports necessary for making a transition to work for those who can. While cash payments are important to individuals, the advances and changes discussed in this testimony suggest the option to shift the disability programs\u2019 priorities to focus more on work.", "Reorienting the DI and SSI programs would have implications on their core elements\u2014eligibility standards, the benefits structure, and the access to and cost of return-to-work assistance. We recognize that re-examining the programs at the broader program level raises a number of profound policy questions, including the following:   Program design and benefits offered - Would the definition of disability change? Would some beneficiaries be required to accept assistance to enhance work capacities as a precondition for benefits versus relying upon work incentives, time-limited benefits, or other means to encourage individuals to maximize their capacity to work? What can SSA accomplish through the regulatory process and what requires legislative action?", "Accessibility and cost - Are new mechanisms needed to provide sufficient access to needed services? In the case of DI and SSI, what is the impact on the ties with the Medicare and Medicaid programs? Who will pay for the medical and assistive technologies and will beneficiaries be required to defray costs? Would the cost of providing treatment and assistive technologies in the disability programs be higher than cash expenditures paid over the long-term? Will net costs show that some expenditures could be offset with cost savings by paying reduced benefits?"], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
