In 2016,  USAID contracted for an independent assessment of all of its CBSI  activities. Since USAID implements CBSI in conjunction with other U.S.  agencies, such as State, one of the objectives within the assessment was  to determine the degree to which USAID\u2019s activities were complementary  with those of other U.S. agencies and whether there were instances of  overlap.

The assessment concluded that there was a potential for  overlap between USAID and INL and recommended that USAID and INL  take several actions to strengthen information sharing and coordinate and  align activities. This coordination is important since overlap or unintended  competition between INL\u2019s and USAID\u2019s CBSI activities has been  documented on at least one occasion.

We have previously reported that effective program monitoring of foreign  assistance requires quality data for performance reporting. Specifically,  leading practices for monitoring of foreign assistance activities include  development of objectives and relevant performance indicators,  procedures for assuring quality of data on performance indicators, and  submission of performance reports.", "According to INL officials, in the absence of a centrally available data  management system, program monitoring data is collected and  maintained at each embassy. As a result, compiling and providing  program monitoring data is time-consuming. For example, when we  requested a list of all completed and ongoing INL-funded CBSI activities  from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, INL responded that it would take  several months to compile that information.", "Further, INL officials told us that they cannot ensure the reliability of their  program monitoring data because of questions about the comparability of  data collected across embassies. During the course of our work, INL  officials at headquarters and overseas told us that program monitoring is  conducted differently in every embassy, and program monitoring data is  not defined or recorded in a standardized manner. These variations can  result in discrepancies in how program performance data is defined and  collected. For example, INL officials explained that in order to collect drug  seizure information that can be analyzed across countries, the data needs  to be collected in the same units of measurement and over the same time  period in each country, but currently, they are not. According to INL,  absent a standardized data collection process, it is difficult to track data  trends across programs.", "INL has expressed concerns about its program monitoring and an inability  to centrally collect reliable program monitoring data. In 2015, an  independent evaluation of INL\u2019s CBSI activities noted that lack of  monitoring information hinders INL\u2019s efforts to link assistance directly to  goals, objectives, and results laid out in the CBSI Results Framework. It  recommended that INL prioritize improving internal program monitoring  capacity. INL\u2019s Functional Bureau Strategy, released in 2018, states that  INL\u2019s program monitoring efforts are often constrained by the availability  of reliable data.", "In response to these concerns about program monitoring, the INL office  for Western Hemisphere Programs contracted with a private firm in 2017  to improve its program monitoring capabilities by creating new  performance indicators meant to standardize data collection across INL\u2019s  programs in the Western Hemisphere and better capture the impact of  INL\u2019s assistance. The contract also included the creation of a centralized  data management system for collecting and storing the program  monitoring data associated with the performance indicators.", "According to INL officials and progress reports submitted by the  contractor, some progress has been made. To date, the contractors have  been studying the availability of data, reviewing existing performance  indicators, and proposing new indicators. The contractors have been  considering options for designing and building the centralized data  management system. However, INL officials acknowledge that data  challenges remain, such as the issue of how to collect standardized data  from each of the embassies and how to build a functioning data  management system that is compatible with State requirements. As of  October 2018, according to INL officials, the characteristics of the  centralized data management system had not yet been determined, and  consequently, they are uncertain what capabilities the final data  management system will have. Therefore, it is unclear whether the  system will allow for the consistent collection and storage of reliable  program monitoring data for all CBSI activities and the ability to  distinguish these data from those of other Western Hemisphere activities.  In the absence of centrally-available, reliable data for CBSI activities, INL  may continue to struggle with effective program monitoring for these  activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Caribbean region faces a variety of economic and security  challenges that jeopardize the region\u2019s economic growth and  development.

We  compared the data to those previously reported to identify  inconsistencies, and interviewed State and USAID officials. We  determined these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting allocations,  unobligated balances, unliquidated obligations, and disbursements by  fiscal year, funding account, and country. To obtain additional detail on  the types of assistance provided by the United States, we reviewed  activity documentation; interviewed State and USAID officials in  Washington, D.C. and traveled to Barbados, the Dominican Republic, and  Jamaica to meet with State, USAID, and implementing partner officials.

We also assessed relevant  Performance Plans and Reports for Caribbean countries and the Western  Hemisphere and interviewed State officials to determine how information  on CBSI activities is aggregated and reported on a country level and  initiative-wide basis. In addition, we interviewed relevant State and USAID  officials in Washington, D.C. and in Barbados, the Dominican Republic,  and Jamaica, about their planning processes for CBSI activities. We  compared the planning and reporting procedures in place to the key  elements for effectively aligning foreign assistance strategies in situations  where multiple agencies work together to deliver foreign assistance.", "To determine the extent to which State and USAID have established  objectives and performance indicators to measure the progress of CBSI  activities, we selected three case study countries\u2014Barbados, the  Dominican Republic, and Jamaica.

We  requested lists of all ongoing and completed CBSI activities from State  and USAID for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 and used the lists to select  a non-generalizable sample of activities, 15 implemented by State and 10  by USAID. The activities were chosen to provide a range of  implementing partners, types of activity, and location. We requested State  and USAID documentation related to the activities in our sample,  including applications for funding, contracts, agreements, program  monitoring and progress reports, financial reports, and evaluations.

The objectives  and performance indicators in place for these activities do not represent  those in place for all CBSI activities, but offer illustrative examples.
