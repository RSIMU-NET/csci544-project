For each grant, we also reviewed the most recent award covering 12 months to examine specific monitoring requirements and activities, such as telephone calls and site visits. Specifically, we reviewed a random sample of 89 of 545 OJJDP demonstration discretionary grants, and 45 of 83 training and technical assistance discretionary grants that were active in all of fiscal years 1999 and/or 2000. The results of these samples are representative of the populations from which they were drawn. We express our confidence in the precision of our sample results as a 95-percent confidence interval.

After our review was complete, some of the missing files were located. We did not review the missing files but used the substitute files that were a part of our random sample. Four grant files were not found in time to be included in our review. In addition, when only one of the two files (the official grant file or the grant managers\u2019 file) was available, we used the available file to complete the data collection instrument.

The Office of the Comptroller also performs risk-based on-site financial reviews of grantee organizations to monitor administrative and financial capability. The Comptroller applies risk-based criteria to a universe of grants to develop a sample for each fiscal year monitoring plan. The risk-based criteria include the dollar amount of the grant, new grantees, new grant programs, and programs with known problems. The Comptroller excludes from its sample any grantee organizations that were subject to its other on-site financial monitoring or to audit by the Office of the Inspector General during the last 2 years.  According to OJP officials, the purpose of the reviews is to provide as much of a comprehensive financial review as possible without going on site. Our review of the results of the Comptroller\u2019s in-house financial reviews of the grants in our sample disclosed that they identified a number of problems similar to our own observations.

According to OJJDP officials, this formula is applied to determine how often a grantee will be visited and officially contacted for monitoring purposes. This formula applies a weight to issues such as program priority (i.e., how important is the grant within the context of the OJJDP\u2019s goals and objectives), size of grant, grantee\u2019s need for assistance, and anticipated difficulties in implementing the approach. The grant manager assigns a weight or \u201cscore\u201d to each of these criteria, which are added together for a total score. This score assigns the grant to a category that defines the specific number of on-site and off-site visits and the frequency of monitoring calls.", "In February 1992, OJP revised its 1987 Handbook and eliminated the score requirement to determine the monitoring level of a project. However, OJJDP grant managers still use the instructions to determine the monitoring level of a project. We found in our file reviews that 72 of the 89 demonstration grant files and 14 of the 45 training and technical assistance grant files had a score or level indicating monitoring requirements. Using the obsolete monitoring requirement to establish grant manager\u2019s grant monitoring responsibilities may not result in the most efficient use of their time or in the needed monitoring to ensure grantee compliance, as pointed out by the Deputy Administrator in May 1996. He said that site visits did not occur because they are expensive and time-consuming. He added that OJJDP might need to revise some procedures, noting that a site visit once every 2 years and some interim telephone monitoring may be more appropriate than annual visits. Current OJP policy provides flexibility to determine monitoring needs (e.g., site visits as appropriate) consistent with resource availability as compared with a monitoring level that is associated with a specific monitoring requirement that may not be achievable with existing resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OJJDP Current Activities", "paragraphs": ["Since April 2001, OJJDP has been engaged in a review of its monitoring practices.

In addition, OJJDP recently embarked on an overhaul of its grant closeout practices to improve its monitoring records.

The grant files generally did not contain documentation showing required telephone contacts and site visits.Further, progress and financial reports did not cover the entire grant period over half of the time. For those grants in our sample that were closed, most did not contain documentation showing compliance with closeout procedures.

The grant managers\u2019 monitoring plans for the most recent awards for 79 demonstration grants and 34 training and technical assistance grants had specific requirements for telephone contacts (e.g., monthly or quarterly). There was no documentation showing that the requirement for telephone contacts was met in 96 percent of the demonstration grants and in any of the training and technical assistance grants.

The grant managers\u2019 monitoring plans for the most recent awards for 66 demonstration grants and 20 training and technical assistance grants had a specified number of on-site visits to be made. There was no documentation showing that the requirement for site visits was met in 88 percent of the demonstration grants and 90 percent of the training and technical assistance grants. Documentation was present that showed that some, but not all, of the required on-site visits had been made for 6 percent of the demonstration grants and 10 percent of the training and technical assistance grants. When site visits are made to grantees, a written site visit report is to be prepared. Of the awards that had any evidence of site visits, such as memos or e-mails referring to the visit, 7 out of the 12 demonstration grants and 2 out of the 4 training and technical assistance grants had any of the OJP-required, written site visit reports.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Acting Assistant Attorney General informed us that most grant managers prepare site visit reports after an on-site review, as their travel vouchers are not forwarded for payment unless the reports are attached. She noted that the grant managers do not routinely forward copies of the reports to the official grant and program files. She said that a copy of the reports is filed in the grant manager\u2019s travel folders that we did not review. However, according to the OJP Handbook, the original site visit report is to be placed in the official grant file. While the grant managers\u2019 travel folders may contain site visit reports, the official grant files kept by the OJP Comptroller\u2019s Control Desk are the official record of the history and activity of the grant. As such, we reviewed the official grant files as well as the grant managers\u2019 files for required grant documents and not the travel voucher folders.", "In another comment to a draft of this report, the Acting Assistant Attorney General told us that monitoring plans that call for on-site visits by grant managers are contingent upon staffing capacity and administrative resources and not requirements. Our review indicated that, contrary to the Acting Assistant Attorney General\u2019s comment, certain specific program monitoring requirements are included in the OJP Handbook, such as creating monitoring plans and writing site visit reports within 10 days of a site visit. To be useful, monitoring plans should be feasible. If they are not feasible, then they will not be helpful guidance for monitoring. While it is entirely reasonable to expect that some planned site visits will not take place (for a variety of reasons), the proportion of site visits specified to occur that were not documented seems to indicate that either they occurred but were not documented or monitoring plans for site visits were infeasible.", "Progress and Financial Reports. According to the OJP Handbook,recipients of discretionary grants are required to submit initial and then semiannual categorical assistance progress reports documenting progress achieved in relation to project milestones. Before December 31, 1995, progress reports were due every quarter. Since March 1, 1996, progress reports have been due every 6 months. This report must be submitted within 30 days after the end of the reporting period for the life of the award.

Copies are disseminated to the appropriate financial analysts and cognizant grant managers. These quarterly reports are required for all active grants, even if there has been no financial activity during the reporting period. According to OJP officials, reports are considered delinquent, for payment purposes, if not received 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

Without such reviews, OJJDP does not have assurances that the grants are being properly administered. For example, one grant we reviewed had no documentation of required semiannual categorical assistance progress reports or quarterly financial reports in the file for the entire life of the award. The project and budget periods ran from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2000. A $300,000 grant was awarded on March 7, 2000 (6 months after the start of the budget period). The grantee was required to submit an initial and then semiannual categorical assistance progress reports documenting progress achieved in relation to project milestones, starting June 30, 2000, and every 6 months thereafter.

Nevertheless, OJJDP extended the grant period for an additional year to allow the grantee to spend the funds for the project, which it had not drawn down during the grant period. Missing progress reports and quarterly financial reports increase the risk that OJJDP might not be able to identify and rectify grantee\u2019s program and financial problems in a timely manner.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Acting Assistant Attorney General acknowledged this lack of documentation, but did not agree that it meant that OJJDP had not been monitoring grants to ensure they were being properly implemented. From our perspective, this lack of documentation suggests to us that OJJDP does not know the extent to which grant managers were carrying out their monitoring responsibilities to ensure that grants were being properly implemented.", "Despite the lack of evidence that grant managers were adhering to the established monitoring plans, we did find that some grant monitoring was occurring. For example, the files contained evidence that communication occurred between grantees and the grant managers in the form of reports, faxes, letters, and oral and e-mail communication on specific issues, problems, or requests for information. However, much of the communication between grantees and grant managers was not documented according to OJJDP requirements.", "Closeout Procedures. The OJP grant closeout process calls for an accounting of programmatic accomplishments in relation to planned activities; an inventory of all required financial, programmatic, and audit reports; and an accounting of all federal funds. According to the OJP Handbook, the grant manager is to complete an assessment report and other closure requirements within 180 days after the end date of the award or any approved extension. These requirements include a closeout checklist, overall assessment of grant performance, final progress reports, final financial status reports, and closeout notification and grant adjustment notice.", "Our assessment of the closeout process did not include enough cases to ensure that it is representative of all grant closeouts. However, our limited review showed that some grant files did not contain required closeout materials.", "At the time of our review, the following documents were missing from the files:   The required case checklists were not prepared for two of the eight demonstration grants that expired and required closeout. Similarly, neither of the two training and technical assistance grants had the required case checklists.", "An overall assessment of grant performance was not prepared for two of the eight demonstration grants.

They pointed out that the OJP Handbook requires staff performance to be carefully scrutinized against the performance work plans (i.e., the critical performance elements and standards pertaining to monitoring responsibilities). They said that OJJDP supervisory managers are to address the following questions to determine how well each grant manager with monitoring responsibilities is performing: (1) how informed is the grant manager about his or her project; (2) what specific oversight and review activities are being conducted; and (3) how are grantee performance issues, if any, being resolved?", "Our review of the performance work plan OJJDP considered to be representative found that it tended to contain information that made it difficult to precisely understand the nature of the monitoring to be conducted.

Senior staff within OJJDP have been directed to address each of the issues identified in the draft report to focus on adjusting the nature and types of monitoring activities pursuant to these types of grants, thus ensuring that every active grant receives a programmatic assessment. OJJDP will also be considering ways to improve and streamline grant management monitoring activities to ensure that program monitoring efforts are documented and useful, including the development of a management information system and the use of private contractors to assist in some of these review functions.", "The Acting Assistant Attorney General also said that the draft report could have gone further in acknowledging the impact of OJJDP\u2019s enormous growth of the past 5 years on its ability to monitor recipients. We recognized that the number of active OJJDP discretionary grants has more than tripled over the past 5 years. However, it is OJJDP\u2019s responsibility to initiate action, such as to request additional funding to meet its monitoring responsibilities or revise its monitoring efforts to comport with its available resources. In commenting on our May 1996 testimony, the OJJDP Deputy Administrator recognized that OJJDP\u2019s heavy workload might have resulted in a lack of monitoring records, but that he would take steps necessary to improve records. However, our current review disclosed that similar monitoring problems persist.", "Further, the Acting Assistant Attorney General said that we did not acknowledge OJJDP\u2019s efforts in a major OJP-wide effort to improve grant monitoring practices and establish uniform policies. We recognized some of the efforts to review its monitoring practices, such as revising the OJP Handbook: Policies and Procedures for the Administration of OJP Grants and its recent embarking on an overhaul of its grant closeout practices to improve its monitoring records. Such efforts, we believe, should help address the monitoring problems we identified.", "The Acting Assistant Attorney General concurred with our recommendation that grant managers\u2019 performance work plans include clear expectations and accountability for monitoring. She said performance work plans put into effect after February 2001 for grant managers in OJJDP\u2019s Special Emphasis Division more clearly reflect monitoring responsibilities and provide for better supervisory controls. Further, she noted that OJJDP\u2019s Special Emphasis Division has put into place a new process designating one staff member with responsibility for file \u201caudits\u201d to help ensure that files are in order and that documentation of monitoring is in place.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from the date of this letter.
