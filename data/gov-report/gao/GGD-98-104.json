Exports of U.S. goods sold by direct marketers to Japan, for example, increased substantially in recent years but have leveled off recently as the U.S. dollar has increased in strength against the Japanese yen, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that U.S. merchandise represents 80 to 90 percent of the value of total personal imports in Japan. Direct marketers have estimated the value of personal imports in Japan to represent sales of $1 billion to $1.5 billion annually. On the basis of catalog requests at direct marketing promotions in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, Japanese consumers prefer goods such as apparel; sports/outdoor equipment; videos, cassettes, compact discs, and books; and hobby merchandise.", "Generally, GPL mailers said that their success in overseas markets depended on their ability to offer unique and high-quality goods at favorable prices, including shipping charges.

For example, private express services generally provide for guaranteed scheduled delivery within 1 to 4 business days, compared to 2 to 10 business days for delivery of GPL parcels, depending on the destination.

Customs organizations are typically charged with ensuring that all goods and persons entering and exiting their countries comply with customs laws and regulations, as well as with facilitating the prompt and efficient movement of international goods. To ensure compliance, customs services monitor the arrival and departure of shipments of goods through their clearance processes. The export process normally consists of seeking permission from customs services to export goods. This may involve a process of listing goods on a manifest for presentation to the customs services for export clearance. The import process involves the inspection of goods for admissibility and the assessment and collection of any applicable duties and fees.", "Duties, also known as tariffs, are charges that a government imposes on the goods that are brought into the country. Using a Harmonized Tariff Schedule, each country can establish its own rates, which may vary with the type of goods and sometimes with the country of origin. In addition, fees or taxes, such as the Value Added Tax (VAT) in European Union countries, also may be assessed. Table 1.2 shows the duties and taxes applicable to imported parcels in the three countries and the United States.", "Historically, customs clearance requirements and procedures have developed along separate tracks for postal and cargo shipments. In the United States, customs requirements for clearance of postal items are affected by a postal law (39 U.S.C. 3623) that protects certain mail of domestic origin from inspection without a search warrant. Customs treatment of international mail parcels originated decades ago, when the need to handle large volumes of international mail prompted customs and postal administrations to work closely together to simplify forms and streamline their procedures for handling mail and parcels.", "According to customs officials in the United States and the countries in our review, different requirements and processes for postal and commercial imports evolved over time, and the requirements were not intended to be the same. They said that historically, more requirements have been imposed on commercial cargo than on postal parcels. Customs clearance for international mail parcels was intended to be simple for individuals sending parcels to other individuals overseas. International mail primarily consisted of written letters and low-value packages containing items for personal consumption. International express cargo, on the other hand, tended to be time-sensitive shipments being sent from a company in one country to a company in another country for the purpose of generating revenue.", "Because of the differences in the nature and value of the items entering a country by mail versus commercial cargo, most countries established different customs requirements and procedures for these two different types of shipments. However, with the development of the direct marketing industry through catalog sales and, more recently, through on-line computer orders, the historical distinctions between mail parcels and cargo have been blurred, as consumers increasingly purchase merchandise goods directly from businesses and have the goods delivered to their residences.", "The Universal Postal Union (UPU), an agency of the United Nations that governs international postal service, also established customs procedures for international mail. Under a UPU international agreement, the Universal Postal Convention, member countries are provided with a standard declaration form to prepare parcels for international shipment. On the declaration form, mailers provide information about a parcel\u2019s contents, weight, and value, as well as the mailer\u2019s and recipient\u2019s names and addresses.", "Private express carriers began importing and exporting shipments into and out of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a small industry responding to the geographic dispersion of industries and organizations. Initially, the industry provided door-to-door service for documents. Cargo shipments were not part of express consignment shipments during the early years because regulatory barriers prevented rapid effective movement of packages.", "During the latter 1970s, private express carriers began the practice of importing courier-accompanied parcels into the United States via commercial airlines. Initially, the U.S. Customs Service did not recognize the private express industry as a separate entity and treated private express shipments as passenger baggage or normal air cargo. In 1987, after repeated requests by the private express carriers to be treated as a separate and special industry, the Customs Service recognized the need to address the growing private express industry. In May 1989, U.S. Customs published regulations (19 C.F.R. Part 128) recognizing the special needs of the private express industry. These regulations provided definitions and guidelines addressing private express procedures, which included application procedures and requirements that the carriers provide advance manifest information and reimburse U.S. Customs for expedited clearances, and required the express facility to be highly automated.", "Although we will discuss differences between foreign customs clearance requirements and processes for postal and private express carrier shipments in chapter 2, figure 1.2 is a general overview of the major steps involved in U.S. Customs clearance.

We considered options to address concerns raised by USPS competitors about whether duties and fees were being appropriately assessed on GPL packages. However, such options as sending comparable GPL and private express parcels as a test to measure differences in customs treatment or examining foreign governments\u2019 customs records were not deemed feasible for a variety of reasons, including methodological and resource limitations.

Further, USPS was not required to calculate or pay duties and taxes on GPL parcels shipped to Japan because, under Japanese law, duties and taxes on postal parcels were calculated by Japan Customs and paid by the parcel recipients. By contrast, in the United Kingdom, USPS was providing customs information similar to that provided by private express carriers as well as calculating and paying duties and taxes owed on GPL parcels. In providing comments on a draft of this report, Japan Customs said that it was planning to introduce an import information system in cooperation with USPS similar to that used in the United Kingdom.

Issues being discussed include whether USPS would be required to present manifests of incoming GPL parcels and how duties and taxes would be paid. With regard to future incoming GPL service, USPS officials said that they were willing to comply with many of the same requirements that private express carriers must follow, such as preparing manifests and prepaying duties and taxes. However, they indicated that providing invoices would be unnecessary because CPAS data included parcel values. In addition, Postal Service officials did not believe that USPS, as a government entity, could be subject to the same liabilities and associated penalties as are private express carriers.", "USPS officials said that they would like to see their procedures for providing shipping data electronically and paying duties and taxes in Canada and the United Kingdom applied to GPL service in other countries, including Japan. U.S. Customs\u2019 strategic plan for 1997 through 2002 indicates that the United States is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth in world trade and the value of trade imports is expected to double over the next 5 years. To handle the increased volume of trade, U.S. Customs is planning to expand the electronic transmission of data needed by Customs, as well as permit the electronic payment of duties and taxes, and take other measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National and International Efforts to Develop Efficient Customs Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Costs and workload burdens are a concern to all parties. Therefore, efforts to find more efficient and cost-effective customs clearance procedures could benefit all parties. International organizations and national governments are attempting to simplify and standardize customs procedures worldwide. These international efforts are relevant to the debate over whether the same and which requirements should apply to GPL and private express parcels because, as explained in chapter 2, most of the requirements that apply to parcels exported from the United States are imposed by the importing countries. All three countries in our review have initiated or implemented procedures to speed the customs clearance process and reduce the paperwork burdens on the carriers for low-value imports.", "In 1993, Canada implemented its courier/low-value shipment program to streamline the reporting, release, and accounting procedures for certain goods valued at less than $1,600 Canadian. Under the program, couriers report the goods to Revenue Canada on a cargo/release list, which reduces paperwork burden by eliminating the need to present a separate manifest for each parcel. Revenue Canada said it usually receives the list before the goods arrive. Prior to the arrival of goods, customs inspectors are to review the cargo/release list and select any parcels to be examined. Customs entry and accounting documentation must be presented by the 24th day of the month following the month of release, and the duties and taxes must be paid by the last business day of that month. Revenue Canada said it verifies compliance with customs laws through periodic audits of importers and customs brokers and other checks.", "In 1996, Japan Customs began allowing shippers to declare imported shipments valued at no more than 100,000 yen without preparing an invoice as long as the shipper maintains import records. In addition, carriers have the option of calculating duties on imports into Japan that are valued at no more than 100,000 yen using single duty rates that are selected from six categories, eliminating the time needed to determine specific duty rates applicable to each item. Another new program in Japan allows shippers to clear some low-value imports on one air waybill. We asked Japan Customs officials whether they would like USPS to provide certain shipping documentation on GPL parcels, such as harmonized tariff codes, as private carriers do. In providing comments on this report, Japan Customs indicated that it is preparing for the introduction of an import information system with the cooperation of USPS that is similar to that used in the United Kingdom.", "In April 1997, the United Kingdom initiated a pilot program to simplify customs clearance procedures for some types of private express shipments. H.M. Customs indicated that the program is aimed at reducing paperwork requirements by allowing electronic submission of customs declarations. In addition, under the simplified procedures, carriers may pay duties and taxes the following month. According to the carriers operating in the United Kingdom, the new program has reduced customs clearance times for qualifying imports from about 2 hours to immediate clearance upon arrival.", "At the international level, organizations such as the World Customs Organization are examining the issue of simplifying customs procedures worldwide. Similarly, a project was initiated at the 1996 G-7 summit in Lyon, France, to standardize and simplify customs procedures scheduled to be completed in 1998. Two key proposals raised at the international forums to streamline customs procedures included (1) reducing paperwork requirements on imported goods and (2) increasing the dutiable de minimis in various countries. In the three countries in our review, imported nondutiable goods were subject to reduced paperwork requirements for customs clearance. In U.S. dollars, the dutiable de minimis was the equivalent of about $14 in Canada, about $30 in the United Kingdom, about $80 in Japan, and $200 in the United States.According to the U.S. Embassy officials in Japan, increasing the dutiable de minimis on imported goods has been the subject of ongoing negotiations between the United States and Japan. One carrier said that raising the dutiable de minimis in Japan from 10,000 yen to 30,000 yen, for example, would increase its nondutiable imports from 40 to 80 percent. Guidelines issued by the International Chamber of Commerce in 1996 regarding best practices recommended that customs services regularly review dutiable de minimis levels to take into account such factors as inflation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Conflicts With International Postal Agreements", "paragraphs": ["The ability of the United States to apply the same international customs requirements to both USPS and the private carriers may have some limitations, due to the lack of U.S. jurisdiction over importing requirements imposed by foreign governments and potential conflicts with current international agreements on customs clearance. For example, a UPU agreement prescribes specific procedures for member postal services regarding customs declarations on postal parcels. These procedures differ from the customs procedures that the private carriers are required to follow. Further, the UPU agreement provides that \u201cpostal administrations shall accept no liability for customs declarations in whatever form these are made or for decisions taken by the Customs on examination of parcels submitted to customs control.\u201d If USPS were subject to the same requirements as the private carriers, this provision of the UPU agreement could conflict with a requirement to subject USPS to liabilities for customs declarations.

Issues related to fair competition involve weighing how USPS and its private sector competitors can compete, given that different sets of requirements and obligations currently exist. The potential implications of whether to apply the same requirements, under what terms, and how to implement the same requirements for both USPS and the carriers may include a number of factors, including those raised by the U.S. and foreign postal and customs services, private express carriers, shippers, and consumers. USPS officials noted that they incur costs that the private carriers do not, such as meeting their obligations to provide delivery service to persons in all communities of the United States and to UPU member countries. The carriers noted the benefits that simplification of customs formalities for low value shipments could have for all international commerce. Moreover, businesses that ship their goods internationally stressed their need to have competitive choices that provide alternatives in the cost and speed of international shipping services for consumers.", "In urging that the same international customs clearance requirements should be applied to USPS and the private carriers, the carriers have raised fundamental questions about the fairness of competing with a government entity that is providing a businesslike service. The carriers believe that competing with a government entity that is subject to fewer customs requirements and lower associated costs distorts the competitive marketplace. However, depending upon what types of competitive international postal products would be subject to the same requirements, postal services are concerned that requiring USPS and the private carriers to follow the same requirements could affect the simplified process that was intended for mail sent from household to household internationally.", "Another consideration is the potential impact on shippers, such as the direct marketing industry, who want to have a choice of different types, costs, and speeds of delivery services to respond to their customers\u2019 demands for their goods.", "Determining how to make customs requirements the same would involve several considerations. Changes in U.S. law by themselves would not equalize customs treatment for postal and private express parcels under foreign law. Bilateral or multilateral agreements with other countries may also be necessary. Further, additional analysis would be needed to determine whether making customs requirements the same would conflict with current international agreements, such as those involving UPU service obligations, and if such changes would impose additional workload burdens on postal and customs services worldwide.", "With respect to U.S. law, opportunities may exist to change customs treatment of parcels imported into the United States. Negotiations between USPS and the U.S. Customs Service regarding the treatment of future GPL service incoming to the United States involve discussions of such issues as manifesting requirements and payment of duties and taxes. Moreover, in considering what requirements might be appropriate, additional opportunities may exist to build on national and international proposals discussed earlier in this chapter to simplify and expedite customs clearance procedures worldwide. Such opportunities include reducing paperwork and increasing the dutiable de minimis, which could benefit both USPS and the private express carriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In its comments, ACCA said that this chapter did not develop a sound and objective basis for evaluating the policy implications of the differences in customs treatment. It appears that ACCA may have misinterpreted our discussion of several issues in this chapter. We did not intend to take a position on the policy issues that are discussed in this chapter or make assumptions about the implications of changes in policy. Rather, our intent was to identify some of the key issues that are being considered by policymakers in Congress and that were raised during our review to provide some perspective on the significance of the issues related to differences in customs treatment. We modified this chapter to address ACCA\u2019s specific concerns.", "ACCA raised four primary areas of concern about this chapter. First, it said our report implied that the principle of equal application of the customs laws, as advocated by the carriers, could result in adverse consequences, such as eliminating the simplified clearance process that currently benefits U.S. shippers. In discussing the potential implications of the principle of equal application of customs laws, we were not taking a position on whether existing requirements or a change in policy would be desirable. Thus, we changed our discussion to make this clear where appropriate.", "Second, ACCA said that our report assumed that a U.S. policy of equal application of the customs laws could lead foreign customs authorities to subject all postal shipments\u2014or at least all GPL parcels\u2014to the customs procedures now applied to privately carried shipments. In this report, we discussed options that were raised during the course of our review; however, other options could be considered. One of the possibilities raised in draft legislation was to apply the customs requirements for private carriers to all competitive international postal products. ACCA indicated in its comments that foreign governments would discover strong incentives to extend simplified customs procedures to all U.S. direct marketing shipments tendered by all U.S. carriers, provided that the carriers tender the shipments in the same manner now employed by USPS. In providing informal comments on a draft of this report, H.M. Customs said that simplified procedures already could be used by anyone fulfilling its requirements, but that customs inspectors would need shipment data in advance, or at least at the time of importation, for inspection purposes. In addition, the World Customs Organization is currently reviewing this issue.", "Third, ACCA was concerned that by presenting USPS\u2019 views on its universal service obligations, our report helped to militate against a U.S. policy of nondiscrimination in customs treatment for U.S. carriers. Although we noted both USPS\u2019 stated service obligations and the carriers\u2019 business choices, we did not take positions on their respective arguments. We sought to provide a fair and balanced presentation of the often conflicting interests and opinions associated with this issue.", "Finally, ACCA said that our report exaggerated the legal difficulties associated with implementing a U.S. policy requiring equal application of customs procedures to U.S. based carriers. We disagree. We only pointed out that potential limitations may exist in applying equal customs requirements, including the lack of U.S. jurisdiction over foreign customs laws. This discussion was presented not as obstacles, but as legal considerations for implementing these policies."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
