Specifically, officials expressed  concern that while the Army, as CBDP Executive Agent, works to build  consensus among the military services as it coordinates and integrates  requirements, CBDP has made key prioritization decisions without  communicating its justification to key stakeholders, including the Army.  For instance, CBDP and military service officials told us that CBDP  officials decided to prioritize medical countermeasure research and  development, while transferring funds from military service requirements,  such as personal protective equipment and threat-detection sensors.  Specifically:", "According to Army officials, during preparation of future budget plans  in 2010, CBDP leadership transferred funding from programs that  would have provided personal protective equipment in order to  increase funding for a medical countermeasures initiative. According  to Army officials, this occurred after the Army had integrated and  coordinated priorities with the other military services and combatant  commands, and CBDP leadership did not coordinate this change with  key stakeholders. CBDP\u2019s actions affected 24 different programs and  totaled about $1.2 billion over the course of the 4-year budget,  according to Army officials. Though the Army, in its role as Executive  Agent, ultimately concurred with the final CBDP budget plan, it  expressed its concern about CBDP\u2019s decisions when doing so.", "During the same time frame, CBDP transferred funding from an Air  Force threat-detection sensor program, according to Air Force  officials. The officials indicated that the program was a high priority for  their service and had, until that point, received sufficient funding.  However, according to the officials, CBDP removed nearly all of the  funding, approximately $50 million, in order to support other priorities,  including medical countermeasures.", "Navy officials indicated that in fiscal year 2013, CBDP removed $90  million in funding for upgrades to a ship-based threat-detection sensor  program. This program would have addressed issues with the current  version of the system, such as false alarms and high rates of repair.  According to Navy officials, though they met frequently with the Joint  Requirements Office to advocate for the program, CBDP leadership  removed the funding during its review of the proposed budget.", "CBDP officials acknowledged that they did not effectively communicate  with the military services regarding some of these actions, but stated that  their decisions were driven by the need to balance resources among all  priorities, including medical countermeasures. Also, CBDP officials noted  that the services had equipment available to respond to short-term  requirements. Additionally, CBDP officials told us that some of the  increased investments in medical countermeasures would not continue,  but were necessary to initiate specific programs, such as the creation of a  DOD facility for advanced development and manufacturing of medical  countermeasures. According to CBDP officials, they are now strategically  planning how they fund medical countermeasures for the future, so that  they do not have to transfer funding from other programs, though they  recognize that they will not always be able to meet all military service  resource-allocation requests. In addition, Army and Navy officials stated  that the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation within the  Office of the Secretary of Defense is conducting a study of DOD\u2019s  biological defense capabilities and, among other things, the most- effective balance between capabilities, such as medical countermeasures  and personal protective equipment and threat-detection sensors. Army  officials told us that this study, which is slated for completion in mid-2014,  will help inform CBDP prioritization and resourcing decisions in the future.", "Since CBDP made some of these funding decisions, it has updated its  practices for collaboration by issuing a business plan that details how it  will coordinate with stakeholders in the future, and military service officials  have agreed that these changes have resulted in improvements in  coordination among CBDP components. CBDP intends for its business  plan, issued in October 2012, to help it manage the program and develop  capabilities in a focused and collaborative manner by laying out a  framework through which CBDP stakeholders can align strategies. CBDP  established a yearly cycle to develop strategic guidance and establish  priorities, which ultimately inform CBDP\u2019s budget planning and resource  decisions. In order to implement this cycle, CBDP created multiple teams,  at varying levels of authority, to provide input and recommendations. For  example, the Integrated Product Team includes representatives from all  of the military services and other members of CBDP. Members of this  team assess the composition of the CBDP portfolio, coordinate and align  CBDP efforts across the program, provide input on portfolio priorities, and  support budget development. Similar teams and boards at higher  organizational levels then review this input and make decisions.  Additionally, CBDP can charter teams to address specific issues as  needed. For example, CBDP officials said that a Medical Working  Integrated Product Team began holding meetings in January 2014 to  examine specific threats and determine which medical countermeasures  against biological threat agents DOD needs, and how to prioritize among  them.", "According to the business plan, these processes support decision making  and incorporate perspectives from key stakeholders, including the military  services. According to CBDP officials, these efforts have resulted in  increased predictability, transparency, and representation of stakeholder  perspectives, including agreement on budget plans. Military service  officials complimented CBDP\u2019s work to improve coordination, especially  the ability to provide early input into the strategic priorities, and said that  this change has resulted in a more-transparent budget process. These  officials told us that it will be important for CBDP to continue to improve  coordination and collaboration in the future. In particular, Army officials  expressed concern that potential revisions to the DOD directive on CBDP  roles and responsibilities could weaken their role and authorities as  Executive Agent. Under the current directive, the Army reviews the  CBDP funding plan, and provides senior-level input to CBDP leadership.
