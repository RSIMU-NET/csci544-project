The Federal Reserve Act directs  the Federal Reserve System to provide currency in the quantities  demanded by the public and authorizes the Federal Reserve System to  establish a nationwide check clearing system, which has resulted in the  Federal Reserve System\u2019s becoming a major provider of check clearing  services.", "Congress modified the Federal Reserve System\u2019s role in the payment  system through the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (MCA). One purpose of  the MCA is to promote an efficient nationwide payment system by  encouraging competition between the Federal Reserve System and private- sector providers of payment services.  The MCA requires the Federal  Reserve System to charge fees for its payment services, which are to be set  to recover, over the long run, all direct and indirect costs of providing the  services.  Before the MCA, the Federal Reserve System provided payment  services to its member banks for no explicit charge.  The MCA expanded  access to Federal Reserve System services, allowing the Federal Reserve  System to offer services to all depository institutions, not just member  banks.  Congress again expanded the role of the Federal Reserve in the  payment system in 1987 when it enacted the Expedited Funds Availability  Act.This act expanded the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s authority to regulate  certain aspects of check payments that are not processed by the Federal  Reserve System.", "Through specific regulatory authority and its general authority as the  central bank, the Federal Reserve plays an important role in the oversight  of the nation\u2019s payment systems.  The Federal Reserve Board has outlined  its policy regarding the oversight of private-sector clearance and settlement  systems in its Policy Statement on Payment Systems Risk.  The second part  of this policy incorporates risk management principles for such systems.", "The Federal Reserve System competes with the private sector in providing  wholesale payment services. Wholesale payment systems are designed to  clear and settle time-critical and predominantly large-value payments.The two major wholesale payment systems in the United States are the  Fedwire funds transfer system, owned and operated by the Federal  Reserve System, and the Clearing House Interbank Payments System  (CHIPS), which is owned and operated by the Clearing House Service  Company LLC, a subsidiary of the New York Clearing House Association  LLC (NYCHA) for use by the participant owners of the Clearing House  Interbank Payments Company LLC (CHIPCo).  Fedwire is a real-time gross  settlement (RTGS) system through which transactions are cleared and  settled individually on a continuous basis throughout the day. CHIPS  began operations in 1970 as a replacement for paper-based payments  clearing arrangements. Since January 22, 2001, CHIPS has operated as a  real-time settlement system. Payment orders sent over CHIPS are either  simultaneously debited/credited to participants\u2019 available balances or have  been netted and set off with other payment orders and the resulting  balance is debited/credited against participants\u2019 available balances  throughout the day.

Although wholesale payments constitute less than  0.1 percent of the total number of transactions of noncash payments, they  represent 80 percent of the total value of these payments.  Moreover, in  1999, the value of payment flows through the two major wholesale systems  in the United States, Fedwire and CHIPS, was approximately 69 times the  U.S. gross domestic product in that year.", "The Federal Reserve System also competes with the private sector in  providing retail payment services.  For example, the Federal Reserve  System provides ACH and check clearing services.  ACH systems are an  important mechanism for high-volume, moderate to low-value, recurring  payments, such as direct deposit of payrolls; automatic payment of utility,  mortgage, or other bills; and other business- and government-related  payments. The Federal Reserve System also competes with private-sector  providers of check clearing services.  To do this, the Federal Reserve  operates a nationwide check clearing service with 45 check processing  sites located across the United States.", "The Federal Reserve System\u2019s market share of payment services as of year- end 1999 is represented in table 1.", "During forums held by the Federal Reserve System\u2019s Committee on the  Federal Reserve System in the Payments Mechanism, held in May and June,  1997, committee members and Federal Reserve staff met with  representatives from over 450 payment system participants, including  banks of all sizes, clearing houses and third-party service providers,  consumers, retailers, and academics.

These risks are listed and defined in table  2.", "Core Principle IV seeks to mitigate settlement risk by endorsing prompt  final settlement, preferably during the day but, minimally, at the end of the  day.  The two major types of wholesale payment settlement systems are  RTGS and multilateral netting systems.  Recently, several hybrid systems  have also been developed.  (These two major types of systems are  described further in app. III.)  In general, multilateral netting systems offer  greater liquidity because gross receipts and deliveries are netted to a single  position at the end of the day.  An institution can make payments during the  day as long as its receipts cover the payments by the end of the day.  However, multilateral netting systems without proper risk controls can  lead to significant systemic risk.  Because transactions are processed  throughout the day, but not settled until the end of the day, the inability of a  member to settle a net debit position could have large unexpected liquidity  effects on other system participants or the economy more broadly.  RTGS  systems rely on immediate and final settlement of transactions, and these  systems have much less exposure to systemic risk that could result from a  settlement failure.  Without a system for the provision of adequate intraday  credit, these systems cause potential liquidity constraints because they  require that funds or credit be available at the time that a payer initiates a  transaction.", "Efficiency in payment systems can be characterized as both operational  and economic.  Operational efficiency involves providing a required level  and quality of payment services for minimum cost.  Cost reductions beyond  a certain point may result in slower, lower quality service.  This creates  trade-offs among speed, risk, and cost.  Going beyond operational  efficiency, economic efficiency refers to (1) pricing that, in the long run,  covers all of the costs incurred and (2) charging those prices in a way that  does not inappropriately influence the choice of a method of payment.", "The Core Principles sets forth four responsibilities of the central bank in  applying the core principles, two of which address oversight functions.  The first is that the central bank should ensure that the systemically  important systems it operates comply with the Core Principles, and the  second is that the central bank should oversee compliance with the Core  Principles by systems it does not operate, and it should have the ability to  carry out this oversight.

In the absence of collateral for such overdrafts, the central bank  assumes some amount of credit risk until the overdrafts are eliminated at  the end of the day.", "In recent years, central banks have taken steps to more directly manage  intraday credit, including collaterization requirements, caps on intraday  credit, and charging interest on intraday overdrafts. Fedwire was  established in 1918 as a telegraphic system and was the first RTGS system  among the G-10 countries.  Presently, account tallies are maintained  minute-by-minute.  The Federal Reserve Banks generally allow financially  healthy institutions the use of daylight overdrafts up to a set multiple of  their capital and may impose certain additional requirements, including  collateral.  In 1994, the Federal Reserve System began assessing a fee for  the provision of this daylight liquidity.  Other central banks have only  recently adopted RTGS systems and have established a variety of intraday  credit policies, such as intraday repurchase agreements, collateralized  daylight overdrafts, and other policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Net Settlement Systems Reduce Liquidity Needs", "paragraphs": ["Other networks operate under net settlement rules. Under these rules, the  value of all payments due to and due from each bank in the network is  calculated on a net basis bilaterally or multilaterally. This occurs at some  set interval\u2014usually the end of each business day\u2014or, in some newly  developed systems, continuously throughout the day. Banks ending the day  in a net debit position transfer reserves to the net creditors, typically using  a settlement account at the central bank.", "Net settlement systems, with delayed or end of business day settlement,  enhance liquidity in the payment system because such systems potentially  allow payers to initiate a transaction without having the funds immediately  on hand, but available pending final settlement.  However, this can increase  the most serious risk in netting systems, which is systemic risk.  Recognizing that systemic risk is inherent in netting systems, central banks  of the G-10 countries formulated minimum standards for netting schemes  in the Lamfalussy Standards. The standards stress the legal basis for  netting and the need for multilateral netting schemes to have adequate  procedures for the management of credit and liquidity risks.", "Although netting arrangements generally reduce the need for central bank  funds, they also expose the participants to credit risks as they implicitly  extend large volumes of payment-related intraday credit to one another.  This credit represents the willingness of participants to accept or send  payment messages on the assumption that the sender will cover any net  debit obligations at settlement. The settlement of payments, by the delivery  of reserves at periodic, usually daily, intervals is therefore an important test  of the solvency and liquidity of the participants. In recent years, central  banks in countries using net settlement rules have taken steps to reduce  credit risks in these systems as part of overall programs to reduce systemic  risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Federal Reserve System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
