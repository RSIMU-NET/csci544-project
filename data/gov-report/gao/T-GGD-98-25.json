In particular, OFHEO does not expect to complete a stress test and risk-based capital standards for the enterprises until 1999 even though it was to have done so by December 1, 1994, under the act. Further, OFHEO has not fully implemented a comprehensive and timely enterprise examination program. As a result, OFHEO has a limited ability to lower the long-term financial risks to U.S. taxpayers associated with the enterprises\u2019 activities.", "GAO identified a number of reasons for OFHEO\u2019s inability to comply with the statutory deadline for completing the stress test and risk-based capital standards. For example, the development process specified in the act presented OFHEO with complex and time-consuming challenges. To meet these challenges, OFHEO, in 1994, decided to develop its own sophisticated stress test rather than adopting existing stress tests. OFHEO officials said that their approach was the most appropriate strategy, but GAO notes that the approach has involved substantial time and resource commitments. GAO also notes that OFHEO faces considerable challenges in completing the stress test by its current target of 1999, such as the need to translate its complex components into proposed and final rules. Given OFHEO\u2019s history of underestimating the time necessary to complete the stress test components, GAO believes that strong congressional oversight of the development process is necessary to ensure that OFHEO completes the process as quickly as feasible. implement an annual examination cycle by early 1998 to cover all enterprise risks. GAO noted that without a reassessment of resource requirements and potentially a reallocation of resources to the examinations office, OFHEO may not be able to fully implement an annual examination cycle because it has been unable to fully implement a 2-year cycle with existing examination office resources. Thus, GAO recommended that OFHEO include in its reassessment an analysis of the staff resources necessary to adequately carry out alternative examination cycles, such as 1 or 2 years. Through such an analysis, OFHEO could better ensure a fuller consideration of the trade-offs associated with examination coverage provided versus costs involved and thereby engage in a more informed decisionmaking process.", "Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been consistently profitable in recent years, GAO believes it is essential, given the enterprises\u2019 outstanding financial commitments of about $1.5 trillion at year-end 1996, that OFHEO implement its safety and soundness responsibilities as quickly as feasible so that any potential long-term financial risks to taxpayers are lowered."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Housing Enterprises: Operations of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: We are pleased to be here today to discuss the operations of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the status of OFHEO\u2019s efforts to fulfill its mission of helping to ensure the safety and soundness of the two largest housing government-sponsored enterprises: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises).", "Congress has a long-standing concern that the safety and soundness of the enterprises be maintained so that they can continue to fulfill their public purposes while taxpayers are protected from unnecessary financial risks. Consequently, Congress passed the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (the act), which established OFHEO as an independent regulator within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Under the act, OFHEO is authorized to help ensure the enterprises\u2019 safety and soundness by setting capital standards, conducting examinations, and taking enforcement actions if unsafe and unsound financial or management practices are identified.", "As mandated in the Department of Veterans Affairs/HUD Appropriations Act of 1997, we recently issued a report on OFHEO\u2019s implementation of its safety and soundness responsibilities since it began operations in June 1993. We concluded that OFHEO has not yet fully implemented its statutory responsibilities and faces considerable future challenges in doing so. In particular, OFHEO currently does not expect to establish final risk-based capital standards for the enterprises until 1999, even though this process was to have been completed under the act by December 1, 1994. Further, OFHEO has not fully implemented a comprehensive and timely safety and soundness enterprise examination program.

It is widely accepted that the enterprises\u2019 activities have generated benefits to home-buyers, such as lower mortgage interest rates. Moreover, the enterprises have reduced regional disparities in mortgage interest rates and spurred the development of new technologies to facilitate the home financing process.", "However, the potential also exists that the federal government would choose to rescue the enterprises in a financial emergency. OFHEO officials have stated that, despite the enterprises\u2019 consistent profitability in recent years, past financial performance does not guarantee future success. For example, during the 1990s, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have rapidly increased the size of their debt-financed mortgage asset portfolios. According to OFHEO, large holdings of debt-financed mortgage assets potentially expose Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increased losses resulting from fluctuations in interest rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OFHEO Is Statutorily Mandated to Develop Capital Standards and Conduct Safety and Soundness Examinations", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 1998, OFHEO has requested a budget of about $16 million to carry out its safety and soundness responsibilities and to perform administrative support functions.

OFHEO has classified Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d under the minimum standard in each quarter beginning with the quarter that ended on June 30, 1993.", "The act also mandated that OFHEO develop a stress test to serve as the basis for more sophisticated risk-based capital standards. The purpose of a stress test is to lower taxpayer risks by simulating, in a computer model, situations where the enterprises are exposed to adverse credit and interest rate scenarios and requiring them to hold sufficient capital to withstand these scenarios for a 10-year period, plus an additional 30 percent of that amount to cover management and operations risk. Under the act, the stress test and risk-based capital standards derived from the test were to have been completed by December 1, 1994.

We identified several reasons why OFHEO did not comply with the statutory deadline and found that OFHEO faces continuing challenges in meeting its current estimate.

Beginning in 1994, OFHEO officials requested that the enterprises provide large amounts of historical and current financial data so it could do the work necessary to develop the stress test. According to OFHEO officials, the enterprises did not always provide all of the necessary data, or they provided data that may have been inaccurate. These problems persisted into 1996 and impeded development of the stress test, according to OFHEO officials.", "In response, Fannie Mae officials said that OFHEO\u2019s data requests were burdensome and would have been less extensive if OFHEO had used a simpler approach to develop the stress test. The Fannie Mae officials said that a more simplified approach would have resulted in appropriate risk-based capital standards and could have been completed faster than OFHEO is currently taking to develop its stress test. Freddie Mac officials said they have tried to assist OFHEO in developing the stress test and that inaccurate data submissions have not been responsible for the delays.", "OFHEO experienced significantly greater technical and managerial challenges and associated delays than initially anticipated in developing an integrated financial model. This model\u2014which is referred to as the Financial Simulation Model is to serve as the foundation of the stress test\u2014is designed to simulate the behavior of the enterprises\u2019 assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet obligations under adverse credit and interest rate scenarios.

We believe that limited resources allocated to the examination office as well as staff attrition contributed to OFHEO\u2019s inability to fully implement the 1994 plan.

OFHEO\u2019s examination plan was similar in substance but not in timing to risk-focused examination plans that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve System have established to monitor the activities of large commercial banks.

However, OFHEO\u2019s current 3- to 4-year cycle for assessing the six core risks is considerably longer than the 2-year cycle established in the plan. In addition, OFHEO has scaled back the planned coverage of its most recently completed core risk examination; the examination covered only one of four business areas.", "OFHEO\u2019s 3-to 4-year examination cycle and limited examination coverage raise questions about the organization\u2019s ability to fully monitor the enterprises\u2019 financial activities and risks. In particular, with its current examination schedule, OFHEO may not be able to do another on-site examination of the enterprises\u2019 interest rate risks until 1999 or 2000, even though such risks may have increased because of increased holdings of debt-financed mortgage assets, since the previous core risk examination that addressed interest rate risk was completed in 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Resources Allocated to the Examination Office and Attrition Contributed to OFHEO\u2019s Inability to Fully Implement the 1994 Plan", "paragraphs": ["decision to commit virtually its entire staff of line examiners to each core risk examination for 1 year and the significant attrition the examination office has experienced have contributed to OFHEO\u2019s inability to fully implement its 2-year examination cycle.", "OFHEO officials said that another important factor that has contributed to OFHEO\u2019s inability to fully implement the 1994 examination plan was the amount of time that OFHEO examination staff needed to develop an understanding of the enterprises\u2019 operations and risk management. Prior to 1993 when OFHEO began operations, the enterprises had not been subjected to an examination oversight program.

The OFHEO officials also said that the reassessment is to include a review of examination office staff resources to ensure that an annual examination cycle can be implemented. OFHEO\u2019s acting director also said that OFHEO may have some flexibility to increase its examination staff resources by shifting staff from its research activities as the stress test and risk-based capital standards are completed.", "We stated in our report that, without a reassessment of and potential reallocation of resources, OFHEO may not be able to implement an annual examination cycle by early 1998, since it had not fully implemented a 2-year cycle with existing examination office resources.

Among its accomplishments, OFHEO has assembled a professional staff that appears to have considerable expertise in housing economics, mortgage finance, computer systems analysis, and financial institution examinations. Although the development process has been slow, OFHEO has developed a working financial model that it believes will serve as the basis of the stress test and OFHEO plans to complete the final risk-based capital rule by 1999.
