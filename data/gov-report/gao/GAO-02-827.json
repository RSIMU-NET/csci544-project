To stimulate the economy more rapidly than would be achieved if taxpayers had to wait until they filed their tax year 2001 return to realize the full impact of this rate reduction, the act provided for eligible taxpayers to receive an advance tax refund in 2001.The amount of the refund was to be based on the filing status and amount of taxable income on the taxpayer\u2019s 2000 return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was to identify eligible taxpayers and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) was to issue the checks on behalf of IRS, with the first checks scheduled to be received during the week of July 23, 2001, about 6 weeks after the act became law.", "Taxpayers who were eligible to receive an advance tax refund in 2001 but who (1) did not receive a check because IRS did not have their current address or (2) did not have enough taxable income in 2000 to qualify for the maximum amount allowable, may have been entitled to a rate reduction credit when filing their tax year 2001 returns.

Prior to sending a disbursement request to FMS, IRS was to reduce the amount of the refunds for any delinquent federal taxes owed by the taxpayers. FMS then issued the advance refund checks for IRS with assistance from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).Before issuing these checks, FMS was to reduce the amount of the checks by the amount of certain other debts owed by the taxpayers, such as delinquent child support.

In addition, FMS was to offset the advance tax refunds to collect other types of debt via the Treasury Offset Program.

IRS offset about $2.5 billion to recover delinquent federal tax, and about 5.4 million taxpayers had their entire advance tax refund offset due to a federal tax delinquency. FMS offset about $468 million for the following reasons: $261.5 million for delinquent child support. $190.8 million for federal debts other than delinquent taxes. $15.7 million for delinquent state taxes.", "Some taxpayers also had their advance tax refunds offset by as little as 1 cent for interest that was owed.

IRS temporarily reassigned staff from other functions to assist with taxpayer telephone calls and correspondence related to the advance tax refunds. For example, IRS recalled furloughed staff at its forms distribution centers to assist taxpayers who called IRS with questions about the advance refund that were relatively easy to answer.

Similarly, our review of a sample of 80 advance tax refund transactions disclosed no material errors requiring adjustments in the advance refund sample. We determined that all of the taxpayers in our sample were eligible for the advance refund, all of those refunds were calculated correctly, there were no instances where a taxpayer had a debt recorded in the Treasury Offset Program that should have been offset but was not, and there were no instances in which the taxpayer had an outstanding tax debt that should have been offset by IRS but was not. Based on our sample results, we estimate that the number of errors requiring adjustment in the population of all advance tax refunds was 0 + 4.5 percent.", "Despite this significant accomplishment, TIGTA\u2019s work and ours identified the following problems related to implementation of the advance tax refund program in 2001:   A computer programming problem resulted in 523,000 taxpayers receiving inaccurate advance refund notices.", "About 5.3 million taxpayers received untimely advance refund notices because of IRS\u2019s procedures for processing returns and the way programming was developed to generate advance refund notices.", "Over 2 million advance refund notices and about 548,000 advance refund checks valued at about $174 million were returned undeliverable due to incorrect addresses. As of late October 2001, IRS had identified about 34,000 of these checks that were not reissued in a timely manner even though it had updated address information.

TIGTA found that IRS had initially erred in developing its computer program for the advance tax refunds by not limiting the refund amounts to the net income tax after nonrefundable credits.

Thus, many nonrefund returns filed by April 16, 2001, had not been processed by the time IRS prepared the initial list of taxpayers who were to receive advance tax refund notices.", "When IRS developed the programming to generate the advance tax refund notices for taxpayers whose returns had yet to be processed when the initial list was prepared, it decided to mail the notices to these taxpayers just before they were to receive their advance tax refund checks, rather than mailing the notices as soon as their tax returns were processed.", "In response to TIGTA\u2019s finding, IRS issued a news release explaining that some taxpayers might experience a delay in receiving their advance tax refund notices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Small Percentage of Advance Refund Notices and Checks Were Undeliverable", "paragraphs": ["One challenge that IRS encountered throughout the implementation of the advance tax refund program involved undeliverable advance tax refund notices and checks due to incorrect addresses.

According to an IRS official, the undeliverable notices were sorted and counted by type of notice and then destroyed. Because these notices were sent to taxpayers via first class mail, the Postal Service was to forward notices for which taxpayers had provided an address change. Therefore, IRS decided that it would not be cost-effective to follow up on the undeliverable notices. According to IRS officials, if a notice was undeliverable, a check would still have been sent to the same address, unless IRS had received an updated address from the taxpayer.", "According to FMS, about 580,000 advance tax refund checks had been returned as of December 31, 2001, the last date that IRS was authorized to make advance payments. About 548,000 of those checks (less then 1 percent of the advance refund checks sent) valued at about $174 million were returned undeliverable due to problems with the taxpayer\u2019s address, according to IRS. The percentage of checks returned undeliverable (less than 1 percent) was less than the approximate 4-percent rate that an FMS official indicated was the normal rate for undeliverable tax refunds.", "According to an FMS official, undeliverable advance refund checks, like other tax refund checks that are returned undeliverable, were cancelled and information concerning the cancelled checks was provided to IRS. IRS was to research a taxpayer\u2019s account to determine if there was an updated address to which another check could be sent. IRS updates taxpayer addresses each week through a National Change of Address Database maintained by the Postal Service. Taxpayers can also update their addresses with IRS by submitting an IRS Form 8822 \u201cChange of Address.\u201d", "In addition, for purposes of the advance tax refunds, IRS revised its normal procedures by authorizing its customer service representatives to accept change of address information over the telephone from taxpayers. Officials at IRS\u2019s Philadelphia campus said that much of the written correspondence they received during the period that the advance tax refund payments were being made involved address changes from taxpayers who wanted to ensure that they would receive their checks.", "TIGTA found that some undeliverable advance refund checks were not reissued even though IRS had updated address information. According to TIGTA, this occurred because IRS did not program its computer system to automatically reissue undelivered refunds for all types of address changes made to taxpayers\u2019 accounts and IRS employees did not always perform adequate research on IRS computer systems necessary to identify current addresses and reissue the refunds.", "TIGTA brought this to IRS\u2019s attention, and as of late October 2001, IRS had identified about 34,000 taxpayers for whom refunds had not been reissued even though updated addresses were available. TIGTA estimated that the 34,000 refunds totaled over $10 million and had been delayed for an average of 8 weeks. According to TIGTA, in late December 2001, IRS reissued refunds for taxpayers for which IRS had a more current address. However, because this issue goes beyond the advance tax refunds and affects refunds in general, TIGTA recommended that IRS (1) revise its computer programming to automatically reissue undelivered refunds for any address changes after the refunds are initially issued and (2) eliminate the need for IRS employees to perform certain IRS computer system research to identify a more current address because the recommended programming revision would enable the computer to perform this research. IRS agreed with both recommendations and plans to initiate both the programming and procedural changes necessary to implement them.", "Besides having to deal with undeliverable advance refund checks, FMS also had to deal with a relatively small number of duplicate, altered, and counterfeit checks.

Overall, when compared with the same 3-month period in 2000, the accessibility of IRS\u2019s telephone assistance generally declined. According to IRS officials, accessibility declined because the demand for assistance, driven by taxpayer questions about the advance refund, exceeded the capacity of available telephone equipment and staffing to answer the calls. However, during the last 3 months of the refund period (Oct. through Dec.), accessibility improved compared with the first 3 months of the refund period and the same 3-month period in 2000.", "Problems reaching an IRS assistor may have caused some taxpayers to call the Taxpayer Advocate Service with questions about the advance refund. Appendix II has information on taxpayer contacts with the Taxpayer Advocate Service concerning advance tax refunds.", "IRS generally projects demand for telephone assistance based on historical data. Because IRS did not have previous experience with an initiative of the type and scope of the advance tax refund to provide historical data, IRS did a speculative analysis in June 2001 to project the volume of advance refund-related calls it would receive. The analysis projected that IRS would receive 53.2 million additional calls during the advance refund period. This would have been a 275-percent increase over the 19.4 million calls IRS received in the same 6-month period in 2000 and about a 129-percent increase over the 41.2 million calls IRS received in the 2001 filing season (Jan. through July 14, 2001), which is traditionally IRS\u2019s busiest time of the year for telephone assistance. According to the text of the analysis, the assumptions on which the analysis was based were risky, and IRS officials had limited confidence in the results.", "Although IRS lacked a reliable projection of advance refund-related demand for telephone assistance, IRS officials said that they expected demand to be significant based on previous general experience with refunds and changes in the tax law. However, according to IRS officials, IRS did not plan for nor expect to meet a dramatic increase in telephone assistance demand during the advance refund period, but, instead, had a two-pronged approach for responding to as much as possible of the increased demand given the telephone equipment and the staff resources that were available. The first prong of IRS\u2019s strategy was to handle as many calls as possible through automation, thereby freeing up assistors to handle calls that required live assistance. To accomplish this, IRS publicized its TeleTax telephone number in the notices sent to taxpayers and through an announcement played on IRS\u2019s main telephone assistance line. The TeleTax line had recorded information on the advance tax refund program and an interactive service that told the taxpayer the expected date the check would be mailed based on the last two digits of the SSN entered by the taxpayer. IRS data show that many taxpayers called for this information\u2014from July 1 through December 31, 2001, IRS received about 36.6 million calls on TeleTax compared with 1.8 million calls received on TeleTax during the same months in 2000.", "The second prong of IRS\u2019s strategy was to devote more staffing to answering refund-related calls. IRS\u2019s forms distribution centers recalled about 450 employees from furlough and trained them to handle simpler calls related to the advance tax refund. Also, IRS devoted more staffing to its regular telephone operations compared to the previous year\u2014during the first 3 months of the refund period, IRS expended 1,952 staff years in its toll-free telephone operation, 179 more staff years than during the same 3-month period in 2000, or about a 10-percent increase. According to IRS officials, total staffing increases do not fully reflect the extent of the staffing for answering refund-related calls because IRS directed resources from other toll-free work, such as answering calls from taxpayers about their accounts, to answer refund calls. IRS estimates that of the 1,952 total staff years expended during the first 3 months of the advance refund period, 493, or 25 percent, were expended answering advance refund- related calls.", "Despite IRS\u2019s efforts to meet the increased demand for telephone assistance, taxpayers had greater difficulty in accessing that assistance during the first 3 months of the advance refund period as compared with the same time period in 2000. IRS has four measures for judging its performance in providing access to telephone assistance. As shown in table 1, during the first 3 months of the refund period\u2014when notices were mailed out and checks were mailed to most taxpayers\u2014IRS\u2019s telephone performance declined for all four measures compared with the same time period in 2000. However, as also shown in table 1, performance improved during the last 3 months of the refund period (when, as discussed later, the demand for assistance decreased) and was better than in the same 3-month period in 2000.", "According to IRS officials, (1) a significant increase in the demand for telephone assistance caused the decline in accessibility during the first 3 months of the advance tax refund period, (2) this increase was driven by taxpayer questions about the advance tax refund, and (3) the demand for assistance exceeded IRS\u2019s capacity for handling it given IRS\u2019s available equipment and staff resources. As we previously reported, demand for assistance is one of the key factors that can affect level of service. As demand increases, for example, level of service would typically decline because, other factors being held constant, IRS would likely answer a lesser percentage of the calls.", "Table 2 has information on the demand for telephone assistance during the 6-month advance tax refund period and the same 6-month period in 2000.

For example, as early as January 23, 2002, IRS posted information to its Web site and issued news releases informing the public that many early tax returns were being filed with rate reduction credit errors. In addition, IRS provided clarifying information to preparers who file returns electronically and, around the beginning of February, began rejecting electronic submissions that involved certain types of errors related to the credit. By rejecting these submissions, IRS required the taxpayer or return preparer to correct the error before IRS would accept the electronic return for processing.

As of March 15, 2002, 6.8 percent of all returns filed included a rate reduction credit error; as of May 31, 2002, the error rate was 6.5 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demand for Telephone Assistance Related to the Rate Reduction Credit Likely Negatively Affected Level of Service in the 2002 Filing Season", "paragraphs": ["IRS data suggest that demand for telephone assistance related to the rate reduction credit was significant during the 2002 filing season and that the demand negatively affected telephone level of service, especially in mid- to late-February when the greatest number of taxpayers called with questions about this credit.", "As discussed earlier, the amount of demand for assistance is one of the key factors that can affect level of service, with an increase in demand being associated with a decrease in the level of service because, other factors being held constant, IRS would answer a lesser percentage of the calls. The average time it takes assistors to handle calls is another factor that affects level of service, with a higher average handle time being associated with a decrease in level of service. According to IRS officials, as the filing season progressed, demand for assistance related to the rate reduction credit increased significantly and unexpectedly, causing the level of service to decline. Officials said that taxpayer access to service began declining in early February as taxpayers called in response to notices IRS mailed them because of errors on their returns related to the credit.  In that regard, data provided by IRS showed that taxpayers made about 1.5 million calls to IRS's accounts assistance telephone number during the 3 weeks ending March 2, 2002, compared with about 0.8 million such calls during the same 3-week period in 2001. Because these account- type calls take longer to handle, on average, than other types of calls, this increase in account-related demand increased the average handle time and lowered the level of service.", "Figure 1 shows that customer service representative (CSR) level of service during the first 6 weeks of the 2002 filing season was significantly better than or about the same as the level of service during the first 6 weeks of the 2001 filing season but was significantly worse during the next 3 weeks (the 3 weeks ending March 2). In the remaining weeks of the filing season, CSR level of service returned to levels comparable to 2001 performance.", "The performance dip coincides with other data that indicate there was likely a significant increase in demand related to the rate reduction credit. For example, previous IRS studies have shown a strong relationship between the volume of certain types of notices IRS mails to taxpayers and the demand for telephone assistance. One such notice is the CP-12, which IRS sends to taxpayers notifying them of a math error on a return. The notice gives the taxpayer information about the error and includes one of IRS\u2019s main toll-free telephone numbers for the taxpayer to call for further information. According to IRS data, for the 4 weeks beginning February 3, 2002, IRS mailed over 1.6 million of these notices\u2014about 5 times the number mailed over the same period in 2001. According to IRS officials, the bulk of this increase was due to taxpayer errors in completing the rate reduction credit line of the tax return.", "Unlike the advance tax refund period in which IRS\u2019s plans for handling the increased telephone assistance demand included both automation and increased staffing, IRS\u2019s plans for handling the additional demand in the 2002 tax filing season focused on automated assistance. IRS implemented an automated interactive telephone application that provided callers with the amount of their advance refund based on the SSN and personal identification data the caller input. According to IRS officials, when IRS began planning for staffing for the 2002 filing season\u2014around June 2001\u2014 the potential effect of the rate reduction credit on the filing season was unknown.  Officials said that although IRS planned for some increased staff time to handle potential demand to be generated by the rate reduction credit, the plans did not anticipate the level of demand that was caused by the error notices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Problems Related to the Rate Reduction Credit Were Identified Early in the 2002 Filing Season", "paragraphs": ["TIGTA identified and IRS corrected two problems related to the rate reduction credit that could have resulted in (1) taxpayers receiving a rate reduction credit to which they were not entitled or (2) taxpayers receiving erroneous information via IRS\u2019s TeleTax number concerning whether or not they received an advance tax refund. In addition, IRS identified another problem that may have resulted in as many as 15,000 taxpayers receiving as much as $4.5 million in erroneous refunds due to rate reduction credits to which they were not entitled.", "One problem identified by TIGTA involved the lack of advance tax refund data in IRS\u2019s National Account Profile (NAP) for certain taxpayers. The taxpayers involved were those who had filed joint returns for tax year 2000 with a deceased spouse on which the deceased spouse was the primary taxpayer and the surviving spouse was the secondary taxpayer.In those cases, because of a computer programming oversight, no advance refund amount was placed on the surviving spouse\u2019s NAP account. Thus, if the surviving spouse filed a tax year 2001 return and correctly claimed no rate reduction credit, IRS\u2019s records would have erroneously indicated that the taxpayer had not received an advance refund, and IRS would have adjusted the taxpayer\u2019s return to include a credit. According to TIGTA, IRS corrected this problem by January 11, 2002, thus preventing about 217,000 taxpayers from receiving up to $50 million in rate reduction credits to which they were not entitled.", "Another problem identified by TIGTA, which it attributed to a misinterpretation of programming requirements, involved IRS\u2019s failure to add information in the NAP for taxpayers who did not receive an advance tax refund. As a result, if these taxpayers called IRS\u2019s automated telephone system, they would have been told that no information was available regarding their advance tax refund, rather than being told that they did not receive an advance tax refund. According to TIGTA, it notified IRS of this problem, which could have affected as many as 35 million taxpayers, on January 8, 2002, and IRS made the necessary corrections by January 15.", "During the filing season, IRS\u2019s computer system was generating rate reduction credits for some taxpayers who had already received the maximum advance tax refund. This occurred when a taxpayer received an advance tax refund based on a tax year 2000 return on which the taxpayer used a taxpayer identification number other than an SSN, such as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), and subsequently filed a tax year 2001 return using an SSN. Because IRS\u2019s records showed no advance tax refund associated with the SSN the taxpayer used on the 2001 return, IRS\u2019s computer system indicated that the taxpayer was entitled to a rate reduction credit on the 2001 return but had failed to claim it. Thus, the computer automatically generated a rate reduction credit for the taxpayer.", "According to IRS officials, this problem was brought to IRS\u2019s attention by IRS field staff. They estimated that it would affect no more than about 15,000 taxpayers, who in a worst-case scenario may have received an additional $300 credit, for a total of $4.5 million in potentially erroneous rate reduction credits. According to the officials, IRS will not attempt to recover any erroneous payments resulting from this problem because it would not be cost-effective to do so. The officials noted, among other things, that since IRS , not the taxpayers, was at fault, IRS would have to attempt to recover the erroneous payments through civil court rather than tax court."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Rate Reduction Credit to Be Allowed", "paragraphs": ["According to IRS officials, an additional rate reduction credit will be allowed to as many as 2.5 million taxpayers. When IRS originally reviewed these taxpayers\u2019 returns, it was determined that the taxpayers had underclaimed the amount of their rate reduction credits. However, IRS did not correct the errors because the amount underclaimed was less than a specified amount. It is IRS\u2019s policy to not make a tax change based on correction of a credit either in favor of the taxpayer or the government if the tax change is less than a specified amount. According to IRS, this policy applies to all credits, not just the rate reduction credit, and was implemented both for budgetary reasons and to ensure timely return processing.", "IRS had originally decided to follow this policy with respect to the rate reduction credit. However, during its review of the 2002 filing season, TIGTA pointed out that the policy seemed inequitable because the specified amount below which IRS did not issue an advance tax refund was substantially less than the specified amount below which IRS did not correct an underclaimed rate reduction credit. As a result, some taxpayers could receive a small advance tax refund, while other taxpayers could not receive a similar small refund based on an underclaimed rate reduction credit on their 2001 tax return. IRS subsequently stated that it would allow the underclaimed credit and any interest to the affected taxpayers by the end of calendar year 2002."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues Encountered During the Advance Tax Refund Program Could Provide Useful Guidance for the Future", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our work and TIGTA\u2019s, we had some observations that IRS may find useful if faced with similar challenges in the future. For example, several problems related to the advance tax refunds and the rate reduction credit were avoided because TIGTA identified and quickly notified IRS of programming errors. While this may indicate deficiencies in IRS\u2019s process for testing program changes, the work needed to make that determination was beyond the scope of this report. What TIGTA\u2019s findings do indicate is the value of enlisting the assistance of an outside party, such as TIGTA, to review the programming for a major unplanned effort that has to be implemented in a short period of time. This would provide an independent review with an eye toward identifying any potential problems that could either negatively impact taxpayers or create unnecessary work for IRS. \u201cThis year\u2019s main problem is the Rate Reduction Credit, where multiple terms (\u2018rebates,\u2019 \u2018advance payments,\u2019 \u2018refund advances,\u2019 \u2018rate reduction credits\u2019) and instructions that confused taxpayers and even tax preparers resulted in many rejected  and over three million errors.\u201d", "Besides the confusing terminology mentioned by H&R Block, we identified the following three aspects of IRS\u2019s instructions that, in retrospect, could have been clearer:   Because taxpayers might use their prior year\u2019s tax return as a guide in preparing their current year\u2019s return, it is important that changes to the tax form, such as the new line added for the rate reduction credit, be clearly highlighted. Although IRS mentioned the new credit on the front page of the tax form instructions, it was done in a way that we believe could easily be missed (see app. III for a copy of the front page with our highlighting of the language in question). What IRS emphasized was the fact that tax rates had changed, which is not information that taxpayers need to know in completing their returns since the effect of that change happens automatically when they use the tax table or tax rate schedules to compute their taxes. What was more important to emphasize was the fact that there was a new credit on the tax return that they might be eligible for. The tax form instructions indicate that if a taxpayer received \u201cbefore offset\u201d an advance tax refund of either $600, $500, or $300 based on his or her filing status, the taxpayer would not be entitled to a rate reduction credit. There is no further explanation in the instructions of the meaning of \u201cbefore offset,\u201d a term that may not have been clear to all taxpayers. The instructions might have been clearer if IRS had included the explanation provided on its Web site. On the Web site, IRS explains that if taxpayers had their advance tax refund \u201coffset\u201d to pay back taxes, other government debts, or past due child support, they could not claim the rate reduction credit for the amount that was offset. Because many taxpayers may not have had access to the Web site or known of the extent of rate reduction credit information available, it would have been advantageous to include a similar explanation in the instructions. To its credit, IRS, expecting that many taxpayers would not remember the amount of their advance tax refund, established an interactive application as part of TeleTax that taxpayers could use to find out the amount of their advance. Although the instructions for Forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ included reference to the interactive application, the reference was in a general section of the instructions dealing with TeleTax rather than in the section of the instructions dealing with the rate reduction credit (see app. III for copies of the relevant pages in the Form 1040 instructions with our highlighting of the relevant data on those pages).", "In addition to clearer instructions, an IRS official indicated that IRS could have done a better job of getting information on the rate reduction credit to the public before the filing season. In that regard, IRS had decided not to send notices to taxpayers reminding them of the amount of the advance tax refund they received due to cost considerations. Although sending such a notice would have resulted in additional cost, it may have lessened the confusion experienced by taxpayers when it came time to determine whether or not they qualified for the rate reduction credit and subsequently may have reduced the costs IRS incurred to identify and correct rate reduction credit errors, send error notices to the affected taxpayers, and provide related telephone assistance.", "A final issue with respect to guidance for the future is IRS\u2019s lack of plans to do a \u201clessons learned\u201d review of the advance tax refund initiative. According to IRS officials, other than a critique of the filing season, which is done annually and will no doubt include a review of problems that taxpayers experienced with the rate reduction credit, IRS has no plans to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the advance tax refund initiative. Both the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and IRS guidance stress that analysis is a key part of understanding performance and identifying improvement options. Such an analysis would benefit IRS management if it became necessary to deal with similar challenges in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IRS and FMS should be commended for the extensive amount of work they accomplished in a short period of time to issue 86 million advance tax refund checks.
