In addition, aviation security experts have advocated this concept as a way to better target security resources to those travelers who might pose greater security risks. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act of November 2001 allows the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to consider developing a registered traveler program as a way to address these two issues. GAO completed this review to inform Congress and TSA of policy and implementation issues related to the concept of a registered traveler program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under a variety of approaches related to the concept of a registered traveler program proposed by industry stakeholders, individuals who voluntarily provide personal background information and who clear background checks would be enrolled as registered travelers. Because these individuals would have been pre-screened through the program enrollment process, they would be entitled to expedited security screening procedures at the airport. Through a detailed literature review and interviews with stakeholders, GAO found that a registered traveler program is intended to reduce the inconvenience many travelers have experienced since September 11 and improve the quality and efficiency of airport security screening. Although GAO found support for this program among many stakeholders, GAO also found concerns that such a program could create new aviation security vulnerabilities. GAO also identified a series of key policy and program implementation issues that affect the program, including (1) Criteria for program eligibility; (2) Level of background check required for participation; (3) Security-screening procedures for registered travelers; (4) Technology options, including the use of biometrics to verify participants; (5) Program scope, including the numbers of participants and airports; and (5) Program cost and financing options. Stakeholders offered many different options on how best to resolve these issues. Finally, GAO identified several best practices that Congress and TSA may wish to consider in designing and implementing a registered traveler program. GAO concluded that a registered traveler program is one possible approach for managing some of the security vulnerabilities in our nation's aviation systems. However, decisions concerning key issues are needed before developing and implementing such a program. TSA felt that GAO's report offered a good overview of the potential and the challenges of a registered traveler program. The agency affirmed that there are no easy answers to some of the issues that GAO raised and that these issues need more study."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, highlighted gaps in aviation  security and have continued to affect the ease with which Americans have  traditionally traveled by air. Since the attacks, Congress has taken  measures to enhance the security of our nation\u2019s air transportation system  through passage of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the Act),  which federalized passenger screeners, mandated the use of explosives  detection equipment to screen all checked baggage, called for the  reenforcement of cockpit doors, and expanded the federal air marshal  program. More extensive screening of passengers and carry-on baggage at  airport security checkpoints has been one of the most immediate and  visible changes over the past year. The Act also allows for the  consideration of other approaches to improve security, such as  \u201cestablish requirements to implement trusted passenger programs and  use available technologies to expedite security screening of passengers  who participate in such programs, thereby allowing security screening  personnel to focus on those passengers who should be subject to more  extensive screening.\u201d  Under such a program\u2014which is referred to as a  \u201ctrusted,\u201d \u201cknown,\u201d or \u201cregistered\u201d traveler program\u2014those who  voluntarily apply to participate in the program and successfully pass  background checks would receive a unique identifier or card that enables  them to be screened more quickly and promotes greater focus on those  passengers who require more extensive screening at airport security  checkpoints.  Recently, discussion among Members of Congress and the  aviation industry, at congressional committee hearings and elsewhere, has  focused on a registered traveler program as one possible way to better  manage security risks by targeting resources more effectively while at the  same time reducing long waits at security checkpoints.", "You asked us to provide information on issues associated with developing  and implementing a registered traveler program. As agreed with your  office, this report includes information on (1) the potential purposes of a  registered traveler program, (2) the key policy and implementation issues  that have been raised by interested parties concerning how a registered  traveler program might be designed and implemented, and (3) the basic  principles that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) might  consider if it implements such a program. In obtaining this information, we  conducted an extensive review of existing literature on registered traveler  or similar programs, including key studies on issues associated with  implementing a registered traveler program. In addition, we interviewed 22  key stakeholders, including officials from the federal government, airline  industry, aviation security consulting groups, vendors developing and  testing registered traveler applications, and organizations concerned with  issues of data privacy and civil liberties. The intent of these interviews was  to obtain the opinions and perspectives of officials from organizations that  possess extensive awareness of the key issues related to such a program.  We did not, however, attempt to empirically validate the information  expressed by these officials. (See appendix I for information on our scope  and methodology and appendix II for a complete list of interviewees.)  We  also visited and interviewed officials associated with registered traveler\u2013 type programs in two European countries. We will report later on ongoing  work related to issues such as the nature and scope of similar programs  already established in the United States and abroad and the potential costs,  benefits, and alternatives to implementing a registered traveler program.  We performed our work from July 2002 through October 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A safe and secure aviation system is a critical component to securing the  nation\u2019s overall physical infrastructure and maintaining its economic  vitality. Billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been  devoted to achieving such a system. Critical to ensuring aviation security  are screening checkpoints, at which screening personnel check over 2  million individuals and their baggage each day for weapons, explosives,  and other dangerous articles that could pose a threat to the safety of an  aircraft and those aboard it. All passengers who seek to enter secure areas  at the nation\u2019s airports must pass through screening checkpoints and be  cleared by screeners. In addition, many airline and airport employees,  including flight crews, ground personnel, and concession vendors, have to  be cleared by screeners. At the nation\u2019s 429 commercial airports that are  subject to security requirements, screeners use a variety of technologies  and procedures to screen individuals. These include x-ray machines to  examine carry-on baggage, metal detectors to identify any hidden metallic  objects, and physical searches of items, including those that cannot be  scanned by x-rays, such as baby carriers or baggage that has been x-rayed  and contains unidentified objects.", "In response to the terrorist attacks  of September 11, 2001, the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) and the air carriers implemented new  security controls to improve security. These actions included increased  screening of baggage and passengers at airport checkpoints with the use of  explosives trace detection devices and hand-held metal detectors, the  mandatory removal of laptop computers from carrying cases, and the  removal of shoes. They included additional screening of randomly selected  passengers at an airline\u2019s boarding gate. Although these initiatives have  been a visible sign of heightened security procedures, they have also, in  some instances, caused longer security delays, inconvenienced the  traveling public, and raised questions about the merits of using these  techniques on assumed lower-risk travelers, such as young children.", "Congress has also taken actions to improve aviation security. In November  2001, it passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which  transferred aviation security from FAA to the newly created TSA and  directed TSA to take over responsibility for airport screening.  The Act also  left to TSA\u2019s discretion whether to \u201cestablish requirements to implement  trusted passenger programs and use available technologies to expedite  security screening of passengers who participate in such programs, thereby  allowing security screening personnel to focus on those passengers who  should be subject to more extensive screening.\u201d", "In response to this Act, officials representing aviation and business travel  groups have proposed developing a registered traveler program. Under  their proposals, travelers who voluntarily provide personal information and  clear a background check would be enrolled as registered travelers. These  participants would receive some form of identification, such as a card that  includes a unique personal characteristic like a fingerprint, which they  would use at an airport to verify their identity and enrollment in the  program. Because they would have been prescreened, they would be  entitled to different security screening procedures at the airport. These  could be as simple as designating a separate line for registered travelers, or  could include less intrusive screening. Although TSA had initially resisted  such a program because of concerns that it could weaken the airport  security system, it has recently changed its position and has begun  assessing the feasibility and need for such a program and considering the  implementation of a test program.", "The concept underlying a registered traveler program is similar to one that  TSA has been studying for transportation workers\u2014a Transportation  Worker Identity Credential  (TWIC)\u2014that could be used to positively  identify transportation workers such as pilots and flight attendants and to  expedite their processing at airport security checkpoints. TSA had been  studying the TWIC program for several months. Initially, the agency had  planned to implement the TWIC program first, saying that any registered  traveler program would be implemented after establishing the TWIC  program. In recent months, congressional appropriations restrictions have  caused TSA to postpone TWIC\u2019s development. According to a senior  agency official, however, TSA was still planning  to go forward with  studying the registered traveler program concept."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Registered Traveler Program Is Intended to Improve Airport Security While Reducing the Inconvenience of Security Screening", "paragraphs": ["Although most of the 22 stakeholders we interviewed supported a  registered traveler program, several stakeholders opposed it. Our literature  review and supporters of the program whom we interviewed identified two  primary purposes for such a program\u2014improving the quality and efficiency  of airport security and reducing the inconvenience that some travelers have  experienced by reducing uncertainties about the length of delay and the  level of scrutiny they are likely to encounter. The literature we reviewed  and more than a half-dozen of the 22 stakeholders we contacted suggested  that such a program could help improve the quality and efficiency of  security by allowing security officials to target resources at potentially  higher risk travelers. Several stakeholders also indicated that it could  reduce the inconvenience of heightened security measures for some  travelers, thus encouraging Americans to fly more often, and thereby  helping to improve the economic health of the aviation industry.  Representatives of air traveler groups identified other potential uses of a  registered traveler program that were not directly linked to improving  aviation security, such as better tracking of frequent flier miles for program  participants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Stakeholders We Contacted Indicated That a Registered Traveler Program Could Potentially Improve Aviation Security and More Effectively Target Resources", "paragraphs": ["Many of the 22 stakeholders we contacted and much of the literature we  reviewed identified the improvement of aviation security as a key purpose  for implementing a registered traveler program. Such a program would  allow officials to target security resources at those travelers who pose a  greater security risk or about whom little is known. This concept is based  on the idea that not all travelers present the same threat to aviation  security, and thus not everyone requires the same level of scrutiny. Our  recent work on addressing homeland security issues also highlights the  need to integrate risk management into the nation\u2019s security planning and  to target resources at high-priority risks. The concept is similar to risk- based security models that have already been used in Europe and Israel,  which focus security on identifying risky travelers and more appropriately  matching resources to those risks, rather than attempting to detect objects  on all travelers. For example, one study suggested that individuals who had  been prescreened through background checks and credentialed as  registered travelers be identified as low risk and therefore subjected to less  stringent security. This distinction would allow security officials to direct  more resources and potentially better screening equipment at other  travelers who might pose a higher security risk, presumably providing  better detection and increased deterrence.", "In addition, several stakeholders also suggested that a registered traveler  program would enable TSA to more efficiently use its limited resources.   Several of these stakeholders suggested that a registered traveler program  could help TSA more cost-effectively focus its equipment and personnel  needs to better meet its security goals. For example, two stakeholders  stated that TSA would generally not have to intensively screen registered  travelers\u2019 checked baggage with explosives detection systems that cost  about $1 million each. As a result, TSA could reduce its overall  expenditures for such machines. In another example, a representative from  a major airline suggested that because registered travelers would require  less stringent scrutiny, TSA could provide a registered traveler checkpoint  lane that would enable TSA to use fewer screeners at its checkpoint lanes;  this would reduce the number of passenger screeners from the estimated  33,000 that it plans to hire nationwide.", "In contrast, several stakeholders and TSA officials said that less stringent  screening for some travelers could weaken security. For example, two  stakeholders expressed concerns that allowing some travelers to undergo  less stringent screening could weaken overall aviation security by  introducing vulnerabilities into the system. Similarly, the first head of TSA  had publicly opposed the program because of the potential for members of  \u201csleeper cells\u201d\u2014terrorists who spend time in the United States building up  a law-abiding record\u2014to become registered travelers in order to take  advantage of less stringent security screening.  The program manager  heading TSA\u2019s Registered Traveler Task Force explained that the agency  has established a baseline level of screening that all passengers and  workers will be required to undergo, regardless of whether they are  registered. Nevertheless, a senior TSA official told us that the agency now  supports the registered traveler concept as part of developing a more risk- based security system, which would include a refined version of the  current automated passenger prescreening system. While the automated  prescreening system is used on all passengers, it focuses on those who are  most likely to present threats. In contrast to a registered traveler program,  the automated system is not readily apparent to air passengers. Moreover,  the registered traveler program would focus on those who are not likely to  present threats, and it would be voluntary. Some stakeholders we  contacted said that a registered traveler program, if implemented, should  serve to complement the automated system, rather than replace it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Believe That a Registered Traveler Program Could Potentially Reduce the Inconvenience of Security Screening Procedures", "paragraphs": ["According to the literature we reviewed and our discussions with several  stakeholders, reducing the inconvenience of security screening procedures  implemented after September 11, 2001, constitutes another major purpose  of a registered traveler program, in addition to potentially improving  security. The literature and these stakeholders indicated that participants  in a registered traveler program would receive consistent, efficient, and  less intrusive screening, which would reduce their inconvenience and serve  as an incentive to fly more, particularly if they are business travelers.  According to various representatives of aviation and business travelers  groups, travelers currently face uncertainty regarding the time needed to  get through security screening lines and inconsistency about the extent of  screening they will encounter at various airports. For example, one  stakeholder estimated that prior to September 11, 2001, it took about 5 to 8  seconds, on average, for a traveler to enter, be processed, and clear a  security checkpoint;  since then, it takes about 20 to 25 seconds, on  average, resulting in long lines and delays for some travelers. As a result,  travelers need to arrive at airports much earlier than before, which can  result in wasted time at the airport if security lines are short or significant  time spent in security lines if they are long. Additionally, a few stakeholders  stated that travelers are inconvenienced when they are subjected to  personal searches or secondary screening at the gates for no apparent  reason.", "While some stakeholders attributed reductions in the number of  passengers traveling by air to these inconveniences, others attributed it to  the economic downturn. Some literature and three stakeholders indicated  that travelers, particularly business travelers making shorter trips (up to  750 miles), have as a result of these inconveniences reduced the number of  flights they take or stopped flying altogether, causing significant economic  harm to the aviation industry. For example, according to a survey of its  frequent fliers, one major airline estimates that new airport security  procedures and their associated inconveniences have caused 27 percent of  its former frequent fliers to stop flying. Based on this survey\u2019s data, the Air  Transport Association, which represents major U.S. air carriers, estimates  that security inconveniences have cost the aviation industry $2.5 billion in  lost revenue since September 11, 2001. Supporters of a registered traveler  program indicated that it would be a component of any industry recovery  and that it is particularly needed to convince business travelers to resume  flying. To the extent that registered travelers would fly more often, the  program could also help revitalize related industries that are linked to air  travel, including aviation-related manufacturing and such tourism-related  businesses as hotels and travel agencies. However, not all stakeholders  agreed that a registered traveler program would significantly improve the  economic condition of the aviation industry. For example, officials from  another major U.S. airline believed that the declining overall economy has  played a much larger role than security inconveniences in reducing air  travel. They also said that most of their customers currently wait 10  minutes or less in security lines, on average\u2014significantly less than  immediately after September 11, 2001\u2014and that security inconveniences  are no longer a major issue for their passengers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Potential Uses for a Registered Traveler Program", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the two major purposes of a registered traveler program,  some stakeholders and some literature we reviewed identified other  potential uses. For example, we found that such a program could be part of  an enhanced customer service package for travelers and could be used to  expedite check-in at airports and to track frequent flier miles. Some  stakeholders identified potential law enforcement uses, such as collecting  information obtained during background checks to help identify  individuals wanted by the police, or tracking the movement of citizens who  might pose criminal risks. Finally, representatives of air traveler groups  envisioned extensive marketing uses for data collected on registered  travelers by selling it to such travel-related businesses as hotels and rental  car companies and by providing registered travelers with discounts at these  businesses. Two stakeholders envisioned that these secondary uses would  evolve over time, as the program became more widespread. However, civil  liberties advocates we spoke with were particularly concerned about using  the program for purposes beyond aviation security, as well as about the  privacy issues associated with the data collected on program participants  and with tracking their movements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Policy and Implementation Issues Associated with a Registered Traveler Program", "paragraphs": ["Our literature review and discussions with stakeholders identified a  number of policy and implementation issues that might need to be  addressed if a registered traveler program is to be implemented.

Most stakeholders indicated that only the  federal government has the resources and authority to resolve these issues.  In addition to these policy questions, our research and stakeholders  identified practical implementation issues that need to be considered  before a program could be implemented. These include deciding (1) which  technologies to use, and how to manage the data collected on travelers; (2)  how many airports and how many passengers should participate in a  registered traveler program; and (3) which entities would be responsible  for financing the program, and how much it would cost."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Stakeholders We Contacted Agreed That the Federal Government Should Address Key Policy Issues When Developing a Registered Traveler Program", "paragraphs": ["Most stakeholders we contacted agreed that, ultimately, the federal  government should make the key policy decisions on program eligibility  criteria, requirements for background checks, and specific security- screening procedures for registered travelers.

These  suggestions ranged from allowing any U.S. or foreign citizen to apply to the  program to limiting it only to members of airline frequent flier programs.  Although most stakeholders who discussed this issue with us favored  broad participation, many of them felt it should be limited to U.S. citizens  because verifying information and conducting background checks on  foreigners could be very difficult. Several stakeholders said that extensive  participation would be desirable from a security perspective because it  would enable security officials to direct intensive and expensive resources  toward unregistered travelers who might pose a higher risk. Several  stakeholders indicated that it would be unfair to limit the program only to  frequent fliers, while representatives from two groups indicated that such a  limitation could provide airlines an incentive to help lure these travelers  back to frequent air travel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Proposed Alternatives for Background Check Requirements", "paragraphs": ["We also found differing opinions as to the type and extent of background  check needed to determine whether an applicant should be eligible to  enroll in a registered traveler program. For example, one stakeholder  suggested that the background check should primarily focus on  determining whether the applicant exists under a known identity and truly  is who he or she claims to be. This check could include verification that an  individual has paid income taxes over a certain period of time (for  example, the past 10 years), has lived at the same residence for a certain  number of years, and has a sufficient credit history. Crosschecking a  variety of public and private data sources, such as income tax payment  records and credit histories, could verify that an applicant\u2019s name and  social security number are consistent. However, access to income tax payment records would probably require an amendment to existing law.   Another stakeholder said that the program\u2019s background check should be  similar to what is done when issuing a U.S. passport. A passport check  consists, in part, of a name check against a database that includes  information from a variety of federal sources, including intelligence,  immigration, and child support enforcement data. In contrast, others felt  that applicants should undergo a more substantial check, such as an FBI- type background check, similar to what current airline or federal  government employees must pass; or a criminal background check, to  verify that the applicant does not have a criminal history. This could  include interviewing associates and neighbors as well as credit and  criminal history checks. In this case, applicants with criminal histories  might be denied the right to participate in a registered traveler program.", "No matter what the extent of these checks, most stakeholders generally  agreed that the federal government should perform or oversee them. They  gave two reasons for this:  (1) the federal government has access to the  types of data sources necessary to complete them, and (2) airlines would  be unwilling to take on the responsibility for performing them because of  liability concerns. One stakeholder also suggested that the federal  government could contract out responsibility for background checks to a  private company, or that a third-party, nonprofit organization could be  responsible for them.  A majority of stakeholders also agreed that the  federal government should be responsible for developing the criteria  needed to determine whether an applicant is eligible to enroll and for  making the final eligibility determination.", "Some stakeholders also stated that background checks should result in a  simple yes or no determination, meaning that all applicants who passed the  background check would be able to enroll in the program and the ones who  did not pass would be denied. Other stakeholders alternatively  recommended that all applicants be assigned a security score, determined  according to the factors found during the background check. This security  score would establish the level of screening given an individual at a  security checkpoint. TSA has indicated that, at a minimum, the government  would have to be responsible for ensuring that applicants are eligible to  enroll and that the data used to verify identities and perform background  checks are accurate and up-to-date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Screening Procedures for Registered Travelers Would Differ from Procedures for Other Passengers", "paragraphs": ["All the stakeholders we contacted agreed that registered travelers should  be subjected to some minimum measure of security screening, and that the  level of screening designated for them should generally be less extensive  and less intrusive than the security screening required for all other  passengers. Most stakeholders anticipated that a participant would receive  a card that possessed some unique identifier, such as a fingerprint or an iris  scan, to identify the participant as a registered traveler and to verify his or  her identity. When arriving at an airport security checkpoint, the registered  traveler would swipe the card through a reader that would authenticate the  card and verify the individual\u2019s identity by matching him or her against the  specific identifier on the card. If the card is authenticated and the holder is  verified as a registered traveler, the traveler would proceed through  security. Most stakeholders suggested that registered travelers pass  through designated security lines, to decrease the total amount of time they  spend waiting at the security checkpoint. If the equipment cannot read the  card or verify the traveler\u2019s identity, or if that passenger is deemed to be a  security risk, then the traveler would  be subjected to additional security  screening procedures, which might also include full-body screening and  baggage searches. If the name on the registered traveler card matches a  name on a watch-list or if new concerns about the traveler emerge, the card  could be revoked.", "A common suggestion was that registered travelers would undergo pre- September 11th security-screening measures, which involved their walking  through a magnetometer and the x-raying of their carry-on baggage.  Moreover, they would not be subjected to random selection or additional  security measures unless warranted, and they would be exempted  from  random secondary searches at the boarding gate. According to TSA  officials, the agency is willing to consider some differentiated security  procedures for program participants.", "As for security procedures for those not enrolled in such a program, several  stakeholders agreed that nonparticipants would have to undergo current  security screening measures, at a minimum. Current security measures  involve walking through a magnetometer, having carry-on baggage run  through an x-ray machine, and being subjected to random searches of  baggage for traces of explosives, hand searches for weapons, and  the  removal of shoes for examination. Travelers may also be randomly selected  for rescreening in the gate area, although TSA has planned pilot programs  to determine whether to eliminate this rescreening. Other stakeholders  suggested that travelers who were not enrolled in the registered traveler  program should be subjected to enhanced security screening, including  more stringent x-rays and baggage screening than are currently in place at  the airports. These stakeholders thought that because little would be  known about nonparticipants, they should be subjected to enhanced  security screening measures.", "In addition, several stakeholders mentioned that a registered traveler  program might be useful in facilitating checked-baggage screening. For  example, one stakeholder suggested that the x-ray screening of registered  travelers\u2019 baggage could be less intensive than the screening required for all  other passengers, thus reducing the time it would take to screen all  checked baggage. A few stakeholders even suggested that the most  sophisticated baggage screening technology, such as explosives detection  machines, would not be needed to screen a registered traveler\u2019s checked  baggage. However, the 2001 Aviation and Transportation Security Act  requires the screening of all checked baggage, and using a registered  traveler program to lessen the level of the checked baggage screening  would not be permissible under the requirements of the Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Raised Equity, Privacy, and Liability Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Finally, our research and discussions with stakeholders raised nonsecurity- related policy issues, including equity, privacy, and liability concerns that  could impede implementation of a registered traveler program. With  respect to equity issues, some stakeholders raised concerns that the federal  government should carefully develop eligibility and enrollment criteria that  would avoid automatically excluding certain classes of people from  participating in the program. For example, requiring applicants to pay a  high application or enrollment fee could deter some applicants for financial  reasons. In addition, concern was expressed that certain races and  ethnicities, mainly Arab-Americans, would be systematically excluded from  program participation. Most stakeholders, however, did not generally view  equity issues as being a major obstacle to developing the program, and one  pointed to the precedent set by existing government programs that  selectively confer known status to program participants. For example, the  joint U.S./Canadian NEXUS pilot program, a program for travelers who  frequently cross the U.S./Canadian border, is designed to streamline the  movement of low-risk travelers across this border by using designated  passage lanes and immigration-inspection booths, as well as some risk- management techniques similar to those proposed for use in a registered  traveler program.", "With respect to privacy issues, civil liberties advocates we spoke with  expressed concerns that the program might be used for purposes beyond  its initial one and that participants\u2019 information would need protection.", "They were particularly concerned about the potential for such a program to  lead to the establishment of a national identity card, or to other uses not  related to air travel. For example, some suggested that there could be  enormous pressure on those who are not part of the program to apply,  given the advantages of the program, and this would therefore, in effect,  lead to a national identity card. One stakeholder raised a concern about the  card\u2019s becoming a prerequisite for obtaining a job that includes traveling  responsibilities, or the collected information\u2019s being used for other  purposes, such as identifying those sought by police. Others countered that  because participation in a registered traveler program would be voluntary,  privacy concerns should not be a significant issue. According to TSA  attorneys, legal protections already in place to prevent the proliferation of  private information are probably applicable, and additional safeguards for  this program could be pursued.", "Through our review, we identified two particular liability issues potentially  associated with the concept of a registered traveler program. First, it is  uncertain which entity would be liable and to what extent that entity would  be liable if a registered traveler were to commit a terrorist act at an airport  or on a flight. Second, it is also unclear what liability issues might arise if an  applicant were rejected based on false or inaccurate information, or the  applicant did not meet the eligibility criteria. For the most part,  stakeholders who addressed the liability issue maintained that, because the  federal government is already responsible for aviation security, and  because it is likely to play an integral role in developing and administering  such a program, security breaches by registered travelers would not raise  new liability concerns. Although the assumption of screening  responsibilities has increased the federal government\u2019s potential exposure  to liability for breaches of aviation security, TSA representatives were  unsure what the liability ramifications would be for the federal government  for security breaches or terrorist acts committed by participants of a  registered traveler program.", "Fewer stakeholders offered views on whether there would be liability  issues if an applicant were denied participation in a registered traveler  program because of false or inaccurate information. However, some  indicated that the federal government\u2019s participation, particularly in  developing eligibility criteria, would be key to mitigating liability issues.  One stakeholder said that the program must include appeal procedures to  specify under what conditions an individual could appeal if denied access  to the program, who or what entity would hear an appeal, and whether an  individual would be able to present evidence in his or her defense. Other  stakeholders, however, stressed the importance of keeping eligibility  criteria and reasons for applicant rejection confidential, because they  believe that confidentiality would be crucial to maintaining the security of  the program. TSA maintained that if the program were voluntary,  participants might have less ability to appeal than they would in a  government entitlement program, in which participation might be  guaranteed by statute."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Stakeholders Also Identified Practical Implementation Issues to Consider", "paragraphs": ["In addition to key policy issues, some stakeholders we spoke with  identified a number of key program implementation issues to consider.

One of the first  decisions that would have to be made in this area is whether to use  biometrics to verify the identity of registered passengers and, if so, which  biometric identifier to use. The term \u201cbiometrics\u201d refers to a wide range of  technologies that can be used to verify a person\u2019s identity by measuring and  analyzing human characteristics. Identifying a person\u2019s physiological  characteristics is based on data derived from scientifically measuring a part  of the body. Biometrics provides a highly accurate confirmation of the  identity of a specific person.", "While the majority of those we interviewed said that some sort of biometric  identifier is critical to an effective registered traveler program, there was  little agreement among stakeholders as to the most appropriate biometric  for this program.

Although there  is no consensus on which biometric identifier should be used for a  registered traveler program, three biometric identifiers were cited most  frequently as offering the requisite capabilities for a program:  iris scans  (using the distinctive features of the iris), fingerprints, and hand geometry  (using distinctive features of the hand). Although each of the three  identifiers has been used in airport trials, there are disadvantages  associated with each of them. (Appendix III outlines some of the  advantages and disadvantages of each.)", "A few stakeholders also claimed that a biometric should not be part of a  registered traveler program. Among the reasons cited were that biometric  technology is expensive, does not allow for quick processing of numerous  travelers, and is not foolproof.  Some studies conducted have concluded  that current biometric technology is not as infallible as biometric vendors  claim. For example, a German technology magazine recently demonstrated  that using reactivated latent images and forgeries could defeat fingerprint  and iris recognition systems. In addition, one stakeholder stated that an  identity card with a two-dimensional barcode that stores personal data and  a picture would be  sufficient to identify registered travelers. Such a card  would be similar to those currently used as drivers\u2019 licenses in many states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Registered Traveler Program Raises Data Storage and Maintenance Issues", "paragraphs": ["In addition to choosing specific technologies, stakeholders said that  decisions will be needed regarding the storage and maintenance of data  collected for the program. These include decisions regarding where a  biometric or other unique identifier and personal background information  should be stored. Such information could be stored either on a card  embedded with a computer chip or in a central database, which would  serve as a repository of information for all participants. Stakeholders  thought the key things to consider in deciding how to store this information  are speed of accessibility, levels of data protection, methods to update  information, and protections against forgery and fraudulent use by others.  One stakeholder who advocates storing passenger information directly on  a \u201csmart\u201d card containing an encrypted computer chip said that this offers  more privacy protections for enrollees and would permit travelers to be  processed more quickly at checkpoints than would a database method. On  the other hand, advocates for storing personal data in a central database  said that it would facilitate the updating of participants\u2019 information.  Another potential advantage of storing information in a central database is  that it could make it easier to detect individuals who try to enroll more than  once, by checking an applicant\u2019s information against information on all  enrollees in a database. In theory, this process would prevent duplication of  enrollees.", "Another issue related to storing participant information is how to ensure  that the information is kept up-to-date. If participant information is stored  in a database, then any change would have to be registered in a central  database. If, however, information is stored on an identification card, then  the card would have to feature an embedded computer chip to which  changes could be made remotely. Keeping information current is necessary  to ensure that the status of a registered traveler has not changed because of  that person\u2019s recent activities or world events. One stakeholder noted the  possibility that a participant could do something that might cause his or her  eligibility status to change. In response to that concern, he stressed that a  registered traveler program should incorporate some sort of \u201cquick revoke\u201d  system.  When that traveler is no longer entitled to the benefits associated  with the program, a notification would appear the next time the card is  registered in a reader."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Had Different Opinions about the Scope of a Registered Traveler Program", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders differed in their opinions as to how many airports and how  many passengers should participate in a registered traveler program.

Others contended that,  because of equipment costs, the program should optimally include only the  largest airports, such as the fewer than 100 airports that the FAA classifies  as Category X and Category 1 airports, which the vast majority of the  nation\u2019s air travelers use.", "There were also different opinions as to whether the program should limit  enrollment to frequent travelers or should strive for wider enrollment to  maximize participation. Representatives of a passenger group asserted that  the program should be limited to passengers who fly regularly because one  of the goals of the program would be to process known passengers more  quickly, and that having too many enrollees would limit the time saved.  Others, however, maintained that the program should enroll as many  passengers as possible.

Representatives of  aviation traveler groups said that participants would be willing to bear  almost all of the costs. One airline representative estimated that frequent  passengers would be willing to pay up to $100 for initial enrollment and an  additional $25 to $50 annually for renewal. For similar reasons, some  stakeholders have suggested that the airlines bear some of the costs of the  program, probably by offering subsidies and incentives for their passengers  to join, since the aviation industry would also benefit. For instance, one  stakeholder said that airlines might be willing to partially subsidize the cost  if the airlines could have access to some of the participant information.", "A few stakeholders also expect that the federal government would pay for  some of the cost to develop a registered traveler program. One stakeholder  who said the government should pay for a significant portion of the  program did so based on the belief that national security benefits will  accrue from the program and so, therefore, funding it is a federal  responsibility. Others maintained that significant long-term federal funding  for the program is unrealistic because of the voluntary aspect of the  program, the possibility that it might be offered only to selected travelers,  and TSA\u2019s current funding constraints.", "In addition to the uncertainty about which entity would primarily fund a  registered traveler program, there are also questions about how much the  program would cost. None of the stakeholders who were asked was able to  offer an estimate of the total cost of the program.  A technology vendor  who has studied this type of program extensively identified several primary  areas of cost, which include but are not limited to background checks,  computer-chip\u2013enabled cards, card readers, biometric readers, staff  training, database development, database operations, and enrollment  center staffing.  The fact that the costs of many of these components are  uncertain makes estimating the overall program costs extremely difficult.   For example, one stakeholder told us that extensive background checks for  enrollees could cost as much as $150 each, while another stakeholder  maintained that detailed, expensive background checks would be  unnecessary. Therefore, the choice of what type of background check to  use if a program is implemented would likely significantly influence the  program\u2019s overall costs.

We derived these principles from our  discussions with stakeholders and from review of pertinent literature as  well as best practices for implementing new programs. Chief among these  is the principle that vulnerabilities in the aviation system be assessed in a  systematic way and addressed using a comprehensive risk management  plan. Accordingly, the registered traveler program must be assessed and  prioritized along with other programs designed to address security  vulnerabilities, such as enhancing cockpit security, controlling access to  secure areas of the airport, preventing unsafe items from being shipped in  cargo or checked baggage, and ensuring the integrity of critical air traffic  control\u2013computer systems. TSA officials also noted that the agency is  responsible for the security of all modes of transportation, not just aviation.  They added that a program such as registered traveler needs to be assessed  in the broader context of border security, which can include the security of  ports and surface border crossings overseen by a number of federal  agencies, such as Customs, Coast Guard, and INS.   TSA might consider the  following principles if, and when, a registered traveler program is  implemented:  Apply lessons learned from and experience with existing programs that  share similarities with the registered traveler program. This information  includes lessons related to such issues as eligibility criteria, security  procedures, technology choices, and funding costs.", "Test the program initially on a smaller scale to demonstrate its  feasibility and effectiveness, and that travelers will be willing to  participate.", "Develop performance measures and a system for assessing whether the  program meets stated mission and goals.", "Use technologies that are interoperable across different enrollment sites  and access-control points, and select technologies that can readily be  updated to keep pace with new developments in security technology,  biometrics, and data sharing.

Although not of the scope that a nationwide U.S. registered  traveler program would likely be, several existing smaller programs, both  in the United States and abroad, address some of the same issues as the  registered traveler concept and still present excellent opportunities for  policymakers to learn from real-life experiences. For example, in the  United States, the INS already has border control programs both at airports  and roadway checkpoints to expedite the entry of \u201cknown\u201d border  crossers. Internationally, similar programs exist at Ben Gurion Airport in  Israel, Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, and Dubai International Airport in  the United Arab Emirates. In the past, similar pilot programs have also  been run at London\u2019s Gatwick and Heathrow airports.  All of these  programs rely on credentialing registered travelers to expedite their  processing and are candidates for further study. Finally, programs  established by the Department of Defense and the General Services  Administration that use cards and biometrics to control access to various  parts of a building offer potential technology-related lessons that could  help design a registered traveler program. (Appendix IV offers a brief  description of some of the U.S. and foreign programs.)  TSA\u2019s program  manager for the Registered Traveler Task Force stressed that his agency  has no role in these other programs, which are different in purpose and  scope from the registered traveler concept.

ATA\u2019s  proposal assumes that (1) the appropriate pool of registered traveler  participants will be based on background checks against the FBI/TSA  watch list, and (2) airlines would determine which employees could apply,  and would initiate background checks for them. ATA estimates that the  pilot program would initially cost about $1.2 million to implement. To allow  TSA and the airlines to evaluate the effectiveness of the program\u2019s  technologies and procedures and their overall impact on checkpoint  efficiency, ATA plans to collect data on enrollment procedures, including:   the number of individuals who applied and were accepted, the reasons for  rejection, and customer interest in the program; reliability of the biometric  cards and readers; and checkpoint operational issues.", "In our discussions, the Associate Under Secretary for Security Regulation  and Policy at TSA made it clear that he thought developing a registered  traveler pilot program on a small scale would be a necessary step before  deciding to implement a national program.  TSA officials responsible for  assessing a registered traveler program said that they hope to begin a pilot  program by the end of the first quarter of 2003. They also noted that much  of the available information about the registered traveler concept is  qualitative, rather than quantitative. They added that, because the cost- effective nature of a registered traveler program is not certain, a financial  analysis is needed that considers the total cost of developing,  implementing, and maintaining the technology and the program. Along  these lines, they believe that a pilot program and rigorous, fact-based  analysis of the costs and benefits of this program will be useful for  determining (1) whether the hassle factor really exists, and if so to what  extent, (2) whether a registered traveler program will effectively address  the need to expedite passenger flow or to manage risk, and (3) whether  such a program would be the risk-mitigation tool of choice, given the  realities of limited resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Develop Performance Measures to Ensure the Program Is Achieving Its Goals", "paragraphs": ["In addition to developing performance-based metrics to evaluate the  effectiveness of a pilot program, TSA could consider developing similar  metrics to measure the performance of a nationwide program if one is  created.

Collecting  such information is most useful if the data-gathering process is designed  during the program\u2019s development and initiated with its implementation.  Periodic assessment of the data should include comparisons with  previously collected baseline data.", "The implementation of a registered traveler program could be helped by  following those principles. For example, determining whether, and how  well, the program improves aviation security and alleviates passenger  inconvenience requires that measurements be developed and data  collected and analyzed to demonstrate how well these goals are being met.  Such information could include the success of screeners at detecting  devices not allowed on airplanes for both enrollees and nonparticipants, or  the average amount of time it takes for enrollees to pass through security  screening."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use Technologies That Are Interoperable and That Can Be Upgraded in the Future", "paragraphs": ["An effective registered traveler program depends on using technologies  that are interoperable across various sites and with other technologies, and  can be readily updated to keep pace with new developments in security  technology, biometrics, and data sharing. Such a program is unlikely to be  airport- or airline-specific, which means that the various technologies will  have to be sufficiently standardized for enrollees to use the same individual  cards or biometrics at many airports and with many airlines. Consequently,  the technologies supporting the nationwide system need to be  interoperable so that they can communicate with one another. The FAA\u2019s  experience with employee access cards offers a good lesson on the dangers  of not having standards to ensure that technologies are interoperable. As  we reported in 1995, different airports have installed different types of  equipment to secure doors and gates. While some airports have installed  magnetic stripe card readers, others have installed proximity card readers,  and still another has installed hand-scanning equipment to verify employee  identity. As a result, an official from one airline stated that employees who  travel to numerous airports have to carry several different identity cards to  gain access to specific areas.", "Another important interoperability issue is the way in which the personal  data associated with a registered traveler program relates to other existing  information on travelers, most important of which is the automated  passenger prescreening system information. Some stakeholders believe it  will be crucial that the registered traveler program is integrated into the  automated system. Given TSA\u2019s focus on developing and launching a  revised automated passenger prescreening system, such integration will  likely be essential. Integrating the data depends on finding a workable  technology solution. Furthermore, TSA officials added that interoperability  may extend beyond aviation to passengers who enter the United States at  border crossings or seaports. They noted that ensuring the interoperability  of systems across modes of transportation overseen by a variety of  different federal agencies will be a complex and expensive undertaking.", "An equally important factor to consider is how easily a technology can be  upgraded as related technologies evolve and improve. As stakeholders  made clear to us, because technologies surrounding identification cards  and biometrics are evolving rapidly, often in unpredictable ways, the  technology of choice today may not be cost-effective tomorrow.  To ensure  that a registered traveler program will not be dependent on outdated  technologies, it is essential to design a system flexible enough to adapt to  new technological developments as they emerge. For example, if  fingerprints were initially chosen as the biometric, the supporting  technologies should be easily adaptable to other biometrics, such as iris  scans.

(Unlike the CANPASS/PORTPASS programs, NEXUS is a harmonized border-crossing  program with common eligibility requirements, a joint enrollment process, and a common  application and identity card.)  Since 2000, program administrators have issued 4,415 identification cards to participants.", "Enrollees must provide a two-finger print biometric. Photo identification cards are given to all  participants.", "The NEXUS identification card allows participants to use NEXUS-designated lanes in the  United States and Canada and to cross the border without routine customs and immigration  questioning.", "A nonrefundable processing fee of $80 Canadian or $50 U.S. must be paid every 5 years.", "According to a study on the NEXUS Program, participants can save  20 minutes, compared  with using the regular primary inspection lanes.", "Officials may request full fingerprints to verify identity. The two-finger print biometric or full  prints may be shared with other government and law enforcement agencies. In addition, any  personal information provided will also be shared with other government and law enforcement  agencies.

INSPASS enrollment is open to all citizens of the United States,  Canada, Bermuda, and visa-waiver countries who travel to the United States on business  three or more times a year for short visits (90 days or less). INSPASS is not available to anyone with a criminal record or to aliens who are not otherwise  eligible to enter the United States. The enrollment process involves capturing biographical information, hand geometry biometric  data and facial picture and digital fingerprint information. A background check is done  automatically for the inspector and, if approved, a machine-readable card is created for the  traveler. The entire enrollment process typically takes 30\u201340 minutes.  Over 98,000 enrollments have been performed in INSPASS, of which 37,000 are active as of  September 2001.", "Once enrolled, the traveler is able to use an automated kiosk at passport control. A traveler is  required to swipe the INSPASS card, enter flight information on a touchscreen, verify hand  geometry, and complete a security check. Upon successful inspection, a receipt is printed that  allows the traveler to proceed to U.S. Customs.", "Presently, there are no system cost fees or filing fees associated with INSPASS.", "The CANPASS Airport program has been suspended since September 11, 2001, and will be  replaced by the Expedited Passenger Processing System in 2003.
