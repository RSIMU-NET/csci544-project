To ensure early, open, and comprehensive information dissemination and allow for informed decisionmaking, risk communication experts suggest that warnings should include (1) multiple communication methods, (2) timely notification, and (3) specific threat information and guidance on actions to take. Federal agencies and states responding to GAO's questionnaires sent to 28 federal agencies and 56 states and territories generally indicated that they did not receive specific threat information and guidance, which they believe hindered their ability to determine and implement protective measures. The majority of federal agencies reported operating at heightened security levels regardless of the threat level, and thus, did not need to implement a substantial number of additional measures to respond to code-orange alerts. States reported that they varied in their actions during code-orange alerts. The costs reported by federal agencies, states, and selected localities are imprecise and may be incomplete, but provide a general indication of costs that may have been incurred. Additional costs reported by federal agencies responding to GAO's questionnaire were generally less than 1 percent of the agencies' fiscal year 2003 homeland security funding.

We also examined literature on risk communication principles to  identify the applicability of such principles to the Homeland Security  Advisory System. In addition, we sent questionnaires to 28 federal agencies  and the homeland security or emergency management offices in 50 states,  the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana  Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, regarding the notification  and information these entities received, the protective measures they took,  and the costs they reported for the three code-orange alert periods from  March 17 to April 16, 2003; May 20 to 30, 2003; and December 21, 2003, to  January 9, 2004. Although some federal agencies and states did not respond  to every question in our questionnaires, we received responses from 26  federal agencies, which account for about 99 percent of total fiscal year  2003 nondefense homeland security funding as reported to the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), and 43 states, for a 77 percent response  rate. We selected the 28 federal agencies because they reported receiving  homeland security funding for fiscal year 2003 to OMB and are Chief  Financial Officers Act agencies.

We selected the 12 localities to visit based on the following  criteria: (1) their receipt of grants from DHS; (2) their geographic location  and topography (e.g., inland, border, or seaport); and (3) the type of locality  (e.g., metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas). We also sent a  questionnaire to 8 additional localities, selecting them based on population  and geographic location. We received questionnaire responses from 4 of  these localities.

Additionally,  HSPD-3 established the Homeland Security Advisory System as a  mechanism to inform and facilitate decisions related to securing the  homeland among various levels of government, the private sector, and  American citizens.", "The Homeland Security Advisory System is comprised of five color-coded  threat conditions as described below, which represent levels of risk related  to potential terror attack.", "Code-red or severe alert\u2014severe risk of terrorist attacks.", "Code-orange or high alert\u2014high risk of terrorist attacks.", "Code-yellow or elevated alert\u2014significant risk of terrorist attacks.", "Code-blue or guarded alert\u2014general risk of terrorist attacks.", "Code-green or low alert\u2014low risk of terrorist attacks.", "As defined in HSPD-3, risk includes both the probability of an attack  occurring and its potential gravity.", "Since its establishment in March 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory  System national threat level has remained at elevated alert\u2014code-yellow\u2014 except for five periods during which the administration raised it to high  alert\u2014code-orange. The periods of code-orange alert follow:  September 10 to 24, 2002;  February 7 to 27, 2003;  March 17 to April 16, 2003;  May 20 to 30, 2003; and  December 21, 2003, to January 9, 2004.", "The Homeland Security Advisory System is binding on the executive  branch. HSPD-3 directs all federal departments, agencies, and offices, other  than military facilities, to conform their existing threat advisory systems  to the Homeland Security Advisory System. These agencies are responsible  for ensuring their systems are consistently implemented in accordance  with national threat levels as defined by the Homeland Security Advisory  System. Additionally, federal departments and agency heads are  responsible for developing protective measures and other antiterrorism or  self-protection and continuity plans in response to the various threat levels  and operating and maintaining these plans. While HSPD-3 encourages other  levels of government and the private sector to conform to the system, their  compliance is voluntary.", "When HSPD-3 first established the Homeland Security Advisory System, it  provided the Attorney General with responsibility for administering the  Homeland Security Advisory System, including assigning threat conditions  in consultation with members of the Homeland Security Council, except in  exigent circumstances. As such, the Attorney General could assign threat  levels for the entire nation, for particular geographic areas, or for specific  industrial sectors. Upon its issuance, HSPD-3 also assigned responsibility  to the Attorney General for establishing a process and a system for  conveying relevant threat information expeditiously to federal, state, and  local government officials, law enforcement authorities, and the private  sector.", "In November 2002, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002,  P.L. 107-296, which established the Department of Homeland Security.  Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the DHS Under Secretary for  Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) is responsible  for administering the Homeland Security Advisory System. As such, the  Under Secretary for IAIP is primarily responsible for issuing public threat  advisories and providing specific warning information to state and local  governments and to the private sector. The act also charges the Under  Secretary for IAIP with providing advice about appropriate protective  actions and countermeasures.", "In February 2003, in accordance with the Homeland Security Act, the  administration issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD- 5), which amended HSPD-3 by transferring authority for assigning threat  conditions and conveying relevant information from the Attorney General  to the Secretary of Homeland Security.

While the national threat level  has been raised and lowered for five periods, DHS officials told us that the  department has not yet assigned a threat level for an industrial sector or  geographic location. However, DHS officials said that the department has  encouraged specific sectors and regions to operate at heightened levels of  security. According to DHS officials, decisions to change the national threat  level and to encourage specific sectors and regions to operate at  heightened levels of security involve both analysis and sharing of threat  information, as well as an assessment of the vulnerability of national  critical infrastructure assets that are potential targets of terrorist threats.", "DHS officials told us they use the criteria in HSPD-3 in determining  whether to raise the national threat level or whether to suggest that certain  regions or sectors operate at heightened security levels. These criteria  include:  the credibility of threat information;  whether threat information is corroborated;  the degree to which the threat is specific and/or imminent; and  the gravity of the potential consequences of the threat.", "In determining whether these criteria are met and whether to raise the  national threat level, DHS considers intelligence information and the  vulnerability of potential targets, among other things. DHS officials told us  that they use a flexible, \u201call relevant factors\u201d approach to decide whether to  raise or lower the national threat level or whether to suggest that certain  regions or sectors operate at heightened security levels. They said that  analysis of available threat information and determination of national  threat levels and regional and sector threat conditions are specific for each  time period and situation. According to these officials, given the nature of  the data available for analysis, the process and analyses used to determine  whether to raise or lower the national threat level or suggest that specific  regions or sectors heighten their protective measures are inherently  judgmental and subjective.", "DHS officials said that the intelligence community continuously gathers  and analyzes information regarding potential terrorist activity. This  includes information from such agencies as DHS, the Central Intelligence  Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Terrorist Threat  Integration Center, as well as from state and local law enforcement  officials. DHS officials also noted that analyses from these and other  agencies are shared with DHS\u2019s IAIP, which is engaged in constant  communication with intelligence agencies to assess potential homeland  security threats.", "DHS also considers the vulnerability of potential targets when determining  the national threat level. For example, DHS officials explained that they  hold discussions with state and local officials to determine whether  potential targets specified by threat information require additional security  to prevent a terrorist attack or minimize the potential gravity of an attack.  According to these officials, if the target is determined to be vulnerable,  then DHS will consider raising the threat level. Last, DHS determines  whether there is a nationwide threat of terrorist attack or if the threat is  limited to a specific geographic location or a specific industrial sector. DHS  officials said that, in general, upon assessment of the above criteria, if there  appears to be a threat of terrorist attack nationwide, then IAIP  recommends to the Secretary of Homeland Security that the national threat  level should be raised. The Secretary of Homeland Security then consults  with the other members of the Homeland Security Council on whether the  national threat level should be changed. DHS officials told us that if the  Homeland Security Council members could not agree on whether to  change the national threat level, the President would make the decision.  DHS officials also told us that when deciding whether to lower the national  threat level, they consider whether the time period in which the potential  threat was to occur has passed and whether protective measures in place  for the code-orange alerts have been effective in mitigating the threats.", "DHS officials told us that if a credible threat against specific industrial  sectors or geographic locations exists, DHS may suggest that these sectors  or locations operate at a heightened level of security, rather than raising the  national threat level. For example, for the third code-orange alert period in  our review from December 31, 2003, to January 9, 2004, threat information  raised concerns of potential terrorist activity for specific industrial sectors  and geographic locations. In response, DHS officials said that they  encouraged those responsible for securing chemical and nuclear power  plants, transit systems, and aircraft, as well as certain cities, to maintain a  heightened level of security, even after the national threat level was  lowered to code-yellow. However, DHS officials noted that they did not  assign a threat level to these sectors and regions at that time. DHS officials  further indicated that these sectors and locations were not operating at  code-orange alert levels. Rather, they operated at heightened levels of  security. According to DHS officials, when encouraging specific sectors or  regions to continue to operate at heightened levels of security, DHS may  suggest that these sectors or regions (1) implement security measures that  are in addition to those implemented during a code-orange alert period, (2)  continue the measures implemented during the code-orange alert period,  or (3) continue selected measures implemented during a code-orange alert  period.", "DHS officials told us that not all threats to specific regions or sectors are  communicated to the public or to officials in all regions or sectors. Rather,  if intelligence information suggests a targeted threat to specific regions or  industrial sectors, DHS officials said that they inform officials in the  specific regions or sectors that are responsible for implementing protective  measures to mitigate the terrorist threat. To inform these officials, DHS  issues threat advisories or information bulletins. The threat advisories we  reviewed contained actionable information about threats targeting critical  national networks, infrastructures, or key assets such as transit systems.  These products may suggest a change in readiness posture, protective  actions, or response that should be implemented in a timely manner. If the  threat is less urgent, DHS may issue information bulletins, which  communicate risk and vulnerabilities of potential targets. In a February  2004 testimony, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security said that  because threat advisories and information bulletins are derived from  intelligence, they are generally communicated on a need-to-know basis to a  targeted audience. The threat advisories and bulletins we reviewed also  included advice on protective measures to be implemented by law  enforcement agencies or the owners and operators of national critical  infrastructure assets in response to the specific threat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Communication Principles Can Be Useful in Communicating Threat Information and Guidance to Federal Agencies and States", "paragraphs": ["DHS officials told us that they have not yet officially documented protocols  for communicating information about changes in the national threat level  to federal agencies and states.

These principles can be applied to threat information shared with  federal agencies and states through the Homeland Security Advisory  System.

Thus, while attempts have been made to officially  document protocols for notifying federal agencies and states of national  threat level changes, DHS officials said that they have not made much  progress in doing so and could not provide a specific target date for  completing this effort. Without documented communication protocols,  recipients of threat level notifications are uncertain as to how, when, and  from what entity, such as which DHS agency, they will be notified of threat  level changes and the content and extent of guidance and threat  information they may receive.

However, warnings about terrorist threats differ from  these relatively more familiar warnings. For example, specific terrorist  threat warnings to the public may allow terrorists to alter tactics or targets  in response to the issuance of warnings. Warnings of terrorist threats may  also increase general anxiety for populations clearly not at risk. Moreover,  government agencies may not always have specific information on terrorist  threats, or may not be able to publicly share specific information in threat  warnings. Yet, despite these differences, the purpose of warnings,  regardless of the threat, is to provide information to citizens and groups  that allows them to make informed decisions about actions to take to  prevent and respond to threats.

In addition, HSPD-3 states  that the Homeland Security Advisory System should provide a  comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding  the risk of terrorist acts to federal, state, and local authorities. One means  of disseminating threat information is through notifications to federal  agencies and states of changes in the national threat level. DHS officials  told us that with each increase in the national threat level, they apply  lessons learned from previous alerts to improve their notification and  information sharing processes regarding threat level changes. Based on  federal agencies\u2019 and states\u2019 responses to our questionnaires, it appears  that DHS is making progress in expanding the scope of its notification  process, which is consistent with HSPD-3. As shown in table 1, more  federal agencies reported receiving direct notification from DHS for the  third code-orange alert period than for the other two code-orange alert  periods in our review.

One other state reported  that it would prefer to first learn about changes in the national threat level  from DHS so that it has sufficient time to notify state agencies and  localities of the change and so that these entities can prepare their  responses before the public is notified of the change. Additionally, 8  localities from which we obtained information indicated that they first  learned of threat level changes from media sources, and 4 of these  localities would prefer to be notified of threat level changes prior to the  public. Officials from some of these localities told us that after media  sources reported the change, their agencies received requests for detailed  information on the change from the public and other entities.

Results for the other two code-orange alert periods are  consistent with those reported in tables 3 and 4 for the third code-orange  alert period.", "Furthermore, 13 localities reported to us that information on site-, area-, or  event-specific threats would have been beneficial to them in responding to  the code-orange alert periods. Six of the localities from which we obtained  information reported that information on region- or sector-specific threats  would have assisted them in determining their level of risk and measures to  take in response to the three code-orange alerts in our review.", "When federal agencies and states perceive that they have not received  sufficient guidance and threat information, these entities may not be able  to determine whether they are at risk from possible threats or what  measures to take in response to the threats. For example, 1 federal agency  reported that DHS never notified the agency as to whether Washington,  D.C., would remain at heightened security levels after the national threat  level was lowered to code-yellow on January 9, 2004, which resulted in the  agency maintaining code-orange alert measures for an additional week and  incurring additional costs for doing so. Another federal agency reported  that to respond to the code-orange alerts, it implemented measures at all  facilities regardless of the specific location or risk involved, which spread  resources across all facilities rather than focusing the measures on  mitigating specific threats. Officials from 1 state and 1 locality noted that  without specific threat information, these entities did not understand the  true nature of the threat and what impact the threat may have on them.", "Federal agencies and states responding to our questionnaire also indicated  that without guidance and specific threat information, they may not be able  to effectively and efficiently target or enhance protective measures to  respond to the code-orange alerts. Eighteen of the 25 federal agencies and  32 of the 41 states providing responses to the questions on operational  challenges in our questionnaires reported that lack of sufficient threat  information was a challenge they faced during the three code-orange alert  periods.

DHS officials told us that they  provide specific threat information, when available, to federal agencies,  states, and localities at risk and with the authority to respond to threats.  For example, the Deputy Secretary said that threat information that was  shared by DHS regarding changes in the national threat level was primarily  intended for security professionals at all levels of government and the  private sector. Moreover, to provide more specific threat information and  respond to sector- and location-specific security needs, DHS officials told  us they have adjusted the system based on feedback from federal, state,  local and private sector officials; tests of the system; and experience with  previous periods of code-orange alert. For example, for the most recent  code-orange alert from December 21, 2003, to January 9, 2004, the Deputy  Secretary noted in his February 2004 testimony that DHS provided specific  recommendations for protective measures to industrial sectors and for  geographic areas in response to specific threat information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Reported Implementing Few New Protective Measures for Code- Orange Alerts because They Always Operate at High Security Levels, While States Varied Their Responses", "paragraphs": ["The majority of federal agencies responding to our questionnaire indicated  that they maintain high security levels regardless of the national threat  level and, as a result, they did not need to implement a substantial number  of new or additional protective measures to respond to the three periods of  code-orange alert from March 17 to April 16, 2003; May 20 to 30, 2003; and  December 21, 2003, to January 9, 2004. For the most part, these federal  agencies reported enhancing existing protective measures to respond to  the three code-orange alerts. To a lesser extent, federal agencies continued  the use of existing measures, without enhancement, during the code- orange alert periods.

For example, some states reported that they already operated at  heightened security levels and, therefore, did not need to implement  additional protective measures in response to the code-orange alerts in our  review; rather they enhanced measures already in place. Other states  indicated that the extent to which they implemented protective measures  for the code-orange alert periods in our review depended on specific threat  information. For example, 1 state indicated that it did not enhance existing  protective measures or implement new protective measures for the code- orange alert periods in our review because there were no specific threats to  the state that required it to do so. Other states indicated that the extent to  which they implemented protective measures for code-orange alert periods  depended on the required level of security for their critical infrastructure  sites. For example, 1 state reported that it implemented new protective  measures for its nuclear power plants during code-orange alert periods, but  for some other critical infrastructure assets, it enhanced security measures  already in place. Some states also indicated that resource constraints  determined the extent to which they enhanced or implemented new  protective measures for code-orange alert periods.

For example, 1 federal agency reported that it received different  requests from several federal agencies to deploy personnel to different  locations. This federal agency noted that improved federal  governmentwide coordination might result in more efficient assignment of  resources. Similarly, 1 locality noted that because different government  agencies notified different local agencies of changes in the national threat  level, first responders and local officials could not effectively and  efficiently coordinate and implement protective resources. On the other  hand, 1 state official raised concerns about whether federal agencies were  fully informed of the information DHS provided to states and had the  information needed to implement appropriate local security measures. This  official noted that persons from the Transportation Security  Administration, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  called his state\u2019s homeland security office for advisories and bulletins DHS  had provided to the state.

Officials in one state indicated that DHS did not  coordinate with the state when it initially developed this list of national  critical infrastructure assets. DHS officials told us that the department  developed a list of national critical infrastructure assets to assist states in  determining protective measures to implement at their national critical  infrastructure sites. According to the Deputy Director of the Protective  Security Division of IAIP, DHS initially developed a list of 145 national  critical infrastructure assets, including nuclear power plants, chemical  facilities, and transportation systems, to ensure their security during  Operation Liberty Shield. This official told us that DHS identified national  critical infrastructure assets for the list based on intelligence information  indicating possible assets at risk, the vulnerabilities of these assets, and  possible consequences of an attack on assets, including health, safety, and  economic impacts. DHS did not coordinate with states and localities in  developing the national critical infrastructure assets list for Operation  Liberty Shield because planning and timing of military operations for the  war in Iraq and for Operation Liberty Shield were given the highest  classification levels and discussed only at the federal level. The Deputy  Director said that since Operation Liberty Shield, DHS has continually  expanded and revised its national critical infrastructure assets list based on  ongoing analysis of threat information and input from states. In reviewing a  draft of this report, DHS officials told us that its Protective Security  Division has given all states and territories opportunities to suggest assets  to be included in the National Asset Database as well as to verify and  validate information DHS maintains on such assets. To enhance standard  security levels at national critical infrastructure sites, this DHS official said  that the department is working with states to develop plans for protecting  the immediate areas surrounding national critical infrastructure assets and  reducing vulnerabilities in those areas.

To the extent that DHS  does not communicate specific threat information and guidance on actions  to take, federal agencies, states, and localities may not be able to  effectively determine their levels of risk, the appropriate protective  measures to implement in response to threats, and how to effectively and  efficiently focus their limited resources on implementing those appropriate  protective measures.

To better inform the Congress on the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) and identify potential  improvements, GAO is also collecting data on (1) applicable threat alert systems used by states and territories prior to the  establishment of the HSAS and (2) operational and financial challenges faced by states and territories as a result of  responding to code-orange alerts.", "This questionnaire should be completed by the person(s) most knowledgeable about the guidance received and protective  measures taken by your state or territory during the periods identified above, including the protective measures your  jurisdiction developed to respond to national threat levels, any threat-advisory system you have in place, types of  protective measures taken, costs incurred during these periods of orange alert, how your state or territory was notified of  the increase in the national threat level, and financial and operational challenges your state or territory faced during these  periods of orange alert.
