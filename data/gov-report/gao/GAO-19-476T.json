We also noted in our report that VBA had  not conducted a customer satisfaction survey that would allow the  department to compile data on how users viewed the system\u2019s  performance and, ultimately, to develop goals for improving the system.", "We made five recommendations to improve VA\u2019s efforts to effectively  complete the development and implementation of VBMS. VA agreed with  four of the recommendations. In addition, the department has addressed  one of the recommendations\u2014that it establish goals for system response  time and use the goals as the basis for reporting system performance.", "However, the department has not yet fully addressed our remaining  recommendations to (1) develop a plan with a time frame and a reliable  cost estimate for completing VBMS, (2) reduce the incidence of system  defects present in new releases, (3) assess user satisfaction, and (4)  establish satisfaction goals to promote improvement. Continued attention  to these important areas can improve VA\u2019s efforts to effectively complete  the development and implementation of VBMS and, in turn, more  effectively support the department\u2019s processing of disability benefit  claims."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Demonstrated Uneven Progress toward Implementing Key FITARA Provisions", "paragraphs": ["FITARA included provisions for federal agencies to, among other things,  enhance government-wide acquisition and management of software,  improve the risk management of IT investments, consolidate data  centers, and enhance CIOs\u2019 authorities. Since its enactment, we have  reported numerous times on VA\u2019s efforts toward implementing FITARA.", "VA\u2019s progress toward implementing key FITARA provisions has been  uneven. Specifically, VA issued a software licensing policy and has  generated an inventory of its software licenses to inform future investment  decisions. However, the department did not fully address requirements  related to IT investment risk, data center consolidation, or CIO authority  enhancement.", "VA has made progress in addressing federal software licensing  requirements. In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019  management of software licenses and stressed that better management  was needed to achieve significant savings government-wide.  Specifically regarding VA, we noted that the department did not have  comprehensive policies that included the establishment of clear roles and  central oversight authority for managing enterprise software license  agreements, among other things. We also noted that it had not  established a comprehensive software license inventory, a leading  practice that would help the department to adequately manage its  software licenses.", "The inadequate implementation of these and other leading practices in  software license management was partially due to weaknesses in the  department\u2019s policies related to licensing management. Thus, we made  six recommendations to VA to improve its policies and practices for  managing licenses. For example, we recommended that the department  regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software  licenses and analyze the inventory to identify opportunities to reduce  costs and better inform investment decision making.", "Since our 2014 report, VA has taken actions to implement all six  recommendations. For example, the department implemented a solution  to generate and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software licenses  using automated tools for the majority of agency software license  spending and/or enterprise-wide licenses. Additionally, the department  implemented a solution to analyze agency-wide software license data,  including usage and costs; and it subsequently identified approximately  $65 million in cost savings over 3 years due to analyzing one of its  software licenses.", "VA has made limited progress in addressing the FITARA requirements  related to managing the risks associated with IT investments. In June  2016, we reported on risk ratings assigned to investments by CIOs. We  noted that the department had reviewed compliance with risk  management practices, but had not assessed active risks when  developing its risk ratings.", "VA determined its ratings by quantifying and combining inputs such as  cost and schedule variances, risk exposure values, and compliance with  agency processes. Metrics for compliance with agency processes  included those related to program and project management, project  execution, the quality of investment documentation, and whether the  investment was regularly updating risk management plans and logs.", "When developing CIO ratings, VA chose to focus on investments\u2019 risk  management processes, such as whether a process was in place or  whether a risk log was current. Such approaches did not consider  individual risks, such as funding cuts or staffing changes, which detail the  probability and impact of pending threats to success. Instead, VA\u2019s CIO  rating process considered several specific risk management criteria:  whether an investment (1) had a risk management strategy, (2) kept the  risk register current and complete, (3) clearly prioritized risks, and (4) put  mitigation plans in place to address risks. As a result, we recommended  that VA factor active risks into its CIO ratings. We also recommended that  the department ensure that these ratings reflect the level of risk facing an  investment relative to that investment\u2019s ability to accomplish its goals. VA  concurred with the recommendations and cited actions it planned to take  to address them.", "VA has reported progress on consolidating and optimizing its data  centers, although this progress has fallen short of targets set by OMB.  Specifically, VA reported a total inventory of 415 data centers, of which 39  had been closed as of August 2017. While the department anticipated  another 10 data centers would be closed by the end of fiscal year 2018,  these closures fell short of the targets set by OMB. Further, while VA  reported $23.61 million in data center-related cost savings and  avoidances from 2012 through August 2017, the department did not  realize further savings from the additional 10 data center closures.", "In addition, as of February 2017, VA reported meeting one of OMB\u2019s five  data center optimization metrics related to power usage effectiveness.  Also, the department\u2019s data center optimization strategic plan indicated  that VA planned to meet three of the five metrics by the end of fiscal year  2018. Further, while OMB directed agencies to replace manual collection  and reporting of metrics with automated tools no later than fiscal year  2018, the department had only implemented automated tools at 6 percent  of its data centers.", "We have recommended that VA take actions to address data center  savings goals and optimization performance targets identified by OMB.  The department has taken actions to address these recommendations,  including reporting data center consolidation savings and avoidance costs  to OMB and updating its data center optimization strategic plan. However,  the department has yet to address recommendations related to areas that  we reported as not meeting OMB\u2019s established targets, including  implementing automated monitoring tools at its data centers.", "VA has made limited progress in addressing the CIO authority  requirements of FITARA. Specifically, in November 2017, we reported on  agencies\u2019 efforts to utilize incremental development practices for selected  major investments. We noted that VA\u2019s CIO had certified the use of  adequate incremental development for all 10 of the department\u2019s major IT  investments. However, VA had not updated the department\u2019s policy and  process for the CIO\u2019s certification of major IT investments\u2019 adequate use  of incremental development, in accordance with OMB\u2019s guidance on the  implementation of FITARA, as we had recommended. As of October  2018, a VA official stated that the department was working to draft a  policy to address our recommendation, but did not identify time frames for  when all activities would be completed.", "In January 2018, we reported on the need for agencies to involve CIOs in  reviewing IT acquisition plans and strategies. We noted that VA\u2019s CIO  did not review IT acquisition plans or strategies and that the Chief  Acquisition Officer was not involved in the process of identifying IT  acquisitions.", "Accordingly, we recommended that the VA Secretary ensure that the  office of the Chief Acquisition Officer is involved in the process to identify  IT acquisitions. We also recommended that the Secretary ensure that the  acquisition plans or strategies are reviewed and approved in accordance  with OMB guidance. The department concurred with the  recommendations and, in a May 2018 update, provided a draft process  map that depicted its forthcoming acquisition process. However, as of  March 2019, this process had not yet been finalized and implemented.", "In August 2018, we reported that the department had only fully addressed  two of the six key areas that we identified\u2014IT Leadership and  Accountability and Information Security. The department had partially  addressed IT Budgeting, minimally addressed IT Investment  Management, and had not at all addressed IT Strategic Planning or IT  Workforce. Thus, we recommended that the VA Secretary ensure that the  department\u2019s IT management policies address the role of the CIO for key  responsibilities in the four areas we identified.

Our December 2018 report identified that the  department was deficient or had material weaknesses in all four  indicators of departments\u2019 effectiveness in implementing the federal  approach and strategy for securing information systems. Specifically, VA  was not effective in the Inspector General Information Security Program  Ratings, was found to have material weaknesses in the Inspector General  Internal Control Deficiencies over Financial Reporting, did not meet CIO  Cybersecurity Cross-Agency Priority Goal Targets, and had enterprises  that were at risk according to OMB Management Assessment Ratings.", "We reported on federal high-impact systems\u2014those that hold sensitive  information, the loss of which could cause individuals, the government, or  the nation catastrophic harm\u2014in May 2016. We noted that VA had  implemented numerous controls, such as completion of risk assessments,  over selected systems. However, the department had not always  effectively implemented access controls, patch management, and  contingency planning to protect the confidentiality, integrity and  availability of these high-impact systems. These weaknesses existed in  part because the department had not effectively implemented elements of  its information security program.", "We made five recommendations to VA to improve its information security  program. The department concurred with the recommendations and, as of  March 2019, had implemented three of the five recommendations.", "Our March 2019 report on the federal cybersecurity workforce indicated  that VA was not accurately categorizing positions to effectively identify  critical staffing needs. The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce  Assessment Act of 2015 required agencies to assign the appropriate work  role codes to each position with cybersecurity, cyber-related, and IT  functions. Agencies were to assign a code of \u201c000\u201d only to positions that  did not perform IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions.", "As we reported, VA had assigned a \u201c000\u201d code to 3,008 (45 percent) of its  6,636 IT positions. Human resources and IT officials from the department  stated that they may have assigned the \u201c000\u201d code in error and that they  had not completed the process to validate the accuracy of their codes.", "We recommended that VA take steps to review the assignment of the  \u201c000\u201d code to any of the department\u2019s positions in the IT management  occupational series and assign the appropriate work role codes. VA  concurred with the recommendation and indicated that it was in the  process of conducting a cyber coding review.", "In conclusion, VA has long struggled to overcome IT management  challenges, which have resulted in a lack of system capabilities needed to  successfully implement critical initiatives. In this regard, VA is set to begin  deploying its new electronic health record system in less than 1 year and  questions remain regarding the governance structure for the program.  Thus, it is more important than ever for the department to ensure that it is  managing its IT budget in a way that addresses the challenges we have  identified in our previous reports and high-risk updates. If the department  continues to experience the challenges that we have previously identified,  it may jeopardize its fourth attempt to modernize its electronic health  record system.", "Additionally, the department has been challenged in fully implementing  provisions of FITARA, which has limited its ability to improve its  management of IT acquisitions. Until the department implements the act\u2019s  provisions, Congress will be unable to effectively monitor VA\u2019s progress  and hold it accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost  savings. Further, the lack of key cybersecurity management elements at  VA is concerning given that agencies\u2019 systems are increasingly  susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist.
