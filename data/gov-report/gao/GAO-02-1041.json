In response to GAO's previous findings, DOD and Navy have begun improving the control environment over the purchase card program. However, further improvements are needed to achieve an effective control environment. GAO determined that the Navy did not provide cardholders, approving officials, and agency program coordinators with sufficient human capital resources--time and training--to effectively perform oversight and manage the program. The weaknesses in the Navy's purchase card control environment at the units audited led to a significant breakdown in key control activities in fiscal year 2001. GAO determined that (1) cardholders did not screen for the availability of goods from required sources, (2) cardholders did not document that someone independent of the cardholder received and accepted the goods and services, (3) many Navy units did not maintain accountability over pilferable property acquired with the purchase card, and (4) cardholders did not reconcile monthly purchase card statements to supporting documentation and approving officials did not review the cardholders' reconciled bills prior to payment certification. The weak control environment and breakdown in key internal controls contributed to potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable transactions that went undetected at units in all three Navy commands and the Marine Corps base GAO audited. GAO's site-specific and Navy-wide data mining transactions reviews identified other potentially fraudulent transactions including the purchase of computers, cell phones, food, cameras, power tools, televisions, personal digital assistants, clothing, and stereos. GAO also identified abusive and questionable transactions at all three Navy commands and the Marine Corps base audited and in GAO's Navy-wide data mining.

Purchase card transactions include acquisitions at or below the  $2,500 micropurchase threshold, payment for commercial training requests  valued at or below $25,000, and for payment on contracts.  The use of  purchase cards has dramatically increased in past years as agencies have  sought to eliminate the lengthy process and paperwork long associated  with making small purchases.

In July 2001 and March 2002,  we testified on significant breakdowns in internal control over purchase  card transactions at two Navy sites in San Diego, California.", "As a result of our work at the two Navy sites and continuing concern about  fraud, waste, and abuse in DOD\u2019s purchase card program, you requested  that we expand our audits of purchase card controls.   On June 27, 2002, we  reported on control weaknesses in the Army\u2019s purchase card program.   This report focuses on purchase card activities at the Navy.  The Navy is the  second largest purchase card program in DOD.  During fiscal year 2001, the  Navy had about 2.8 million transactions and $1.8 billion in purchases, and  as of September 2001 it had about 28,000 cardholders.  We plan to report to  you separately on the results of our audit of the Air Force purchase card  program.", "The objective of our audit of the Navy\u2019s purchase card program was to  assess the adequacy of internal control over the authorization, purchase,  and payment of purchase card transactions during fiscal year 2001, and  determine whether the purchase card control weaknesses identified at two  Navy units in San Diego were isolated examples or were indicative of Navy- wide weaknesses with the purchase card program.   Specifically, we  addressed whether (1) the Navy\u2019s overall control environment and  management of the purchase card program were effective, (2) the Navy\u2019s  key internal control activities operated effectively and provided reasonable  assurance that purchase cards were used appropriately, and (3) indications  existed of potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable  transactions.  We supplemented our previous fiscal year 2001 audit work at  the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Systems Center in San  Diego, and the Naval Facilities Engineering Command\u2019s Navy Public Works  Center in San Diego by auditing the Navy\u2019s internal control policies,  procedures, and key activities at three major warfighting commands  (Atlantic Fleet, Pacific Fleet, and the Marine Corps), and one other major  support command (Naval Sea Systems Command).  These six major  commands account for about 56 percent of the Navy\u2019s total fiscal year 2001  purchases and 56 percent of the Navy\u2019s total fiscal year 2001 transactions.   For each major command audited, we selected a geographic location (e.g.,  for the Pacific Fleet we selected cardholders based in or near San Diego)  where we conducted a case study analysis by testing a statistical sample of  purchase card transactions and performing other audit work to evaluate  the design and implementation of key internal control procedures and  activities.  The results of our audit for transactions that comprised the  statistical samples can only be projected to the units where we performed  testing and cannot be used for projections to the entire command or to the  Navy as a whole.  However, the cumulative results of all our work offer  significant perspective on the adequacy of the design and implementation  of purchase card program internal controls across the Navy.", "We also looked for indications of potentially fraudulent, improper, and  abusive or questionable purchases as part of our statistical sampling and  through nonrepresentative selections of transactions using data mining of  Navy-wide fiscal year 2001 transactions.  Our data mining included  identifying transactions with certain vendors that were more likely to sell  items that would be unauthorized or that would be personal items (e.g.,  department and jewelry stores).  Because of the large number of  transactions that met these criteria, we did not look at all potential abuses  of the purchase card.  While we identified some potentially fraudulent,  improper, and abusive or questionable purchases, our work was not  designed to identify, and we cannot determine, the extent of these  purchases.

DOD  has seen significant growth in the program since its inception and  estimated that in fiscal year 2001 about 95 percent of its transactions of  $2,500 or less were made by purchase card.", "The purpose of the program is to simplify the process of making small  purchases.  It allows cardholders to make micropurchases of $2,500 or less  and pay for training of $25,000 or less without having to execute a contract.   The government purchase card can also be used for larger transactions, but  only under a contract.  For larger transactions, the card is referred to as a  \u201cpayment card\u201d because it pays for an acquisition made under a legally  executed contract.", "The Navy uses a combination of governmentwide, DOD, and Navy guidance  as the policy and procedural foundation for its purchase card program.   The Navy purchase card program operates under a governmentwide  General Services Administration purchase card contract, as do the  purchase card programs of all federal agencies.   In addition, government  acquisition laws and regulations such as the Federal Acquisition  Regulation provide overall governmentwide guidance.  DOD and the Navy  have issued clarifying guidance to these regulations.", "The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics\u2014in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller)\u2014has overall responsibility for DOD\u2019s purchase card  program.

The  Commander of the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) has been  designated the Navy\u2019s chief contracting officer, and under his command is  the Navy purchase card program manager.  However, primary day-to-day  management responsibility for the program lies with the agency program  coordinators in the Navy\u2019s major commands and local units.

The figure shows  each major command where we conducted audit work; for each location  we selected for a case study analysis, the figure also shows the total  number of subordinate level agency program coordinators, approving  officials, and cardholders.  It is important to note that at the major  commands and the subordinate level units that we audited, most agency  program coordinators, approving officials, and cardholders were not  dedicated to the purchase card program on a full-time basis.  Rather, most  individuals had additional job responsibilities and performed purchase  card duties when needed.", "At the major commands and units audited, personnel in three positions\u2014  agency program coordinator, cardholder, and approving official\u2014are  collectively responsible for providing reasonable assurance that purchase  card transactions are appropriate and meet a valid government need.

Major command agency program coordinators operate under the  direction of the command\u2019s director of the contracting office, and are  responsible for the day-to-day management, administration, and oversight  of the program.  Unit level agency program coordinators develop local  standard operating procedures, issue and cancel cards, train cardholders  and approving officials, and work with other Navy units and the card- issuing bank.  Cardholders are to make purchases, maintain supporting  documentation, and reconcile their monthly statements.

These recommendations  address many of the concerns that we previously identified and provide  management at the Pacific Fleet, Atlantic Fleet, Naval Sea Systems  Command (NAVSEA), and Marine Corps the opportunity to take a  proactive role in correcting control weaknesses and ensuring that the  purchase card remains a valuable tool."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Cardholders Significantly Reduced but Approving Official Span of Control Remains an Issue", "paragraphs": ["Although the Navy significantly reduced the number of purchase cards  since our July 30, 2001, testimony, it continued to have approving officials  who were responsible for reviewing more cardholder statements than  allowed by either DOD or Navy guidance, which limits the number of  cardholders that an approving official should review to seven.  The  convenience of the purchase card must be balanced against the time and  cost involved in the training, monitoring, and oversight of cardholders.  It  must also be balanced against the exposure of the Navy to the legally  binding obligations incurred by those transactions.  The proliferation of  purchase cards and high cardholder-to-approving-official ratios increase  the risks associated with the purchase card program.  In response to the  July 2001 hearing, DOD\u2019s Director of Procurement instructed the directors  of Defense agency procurement and contracting departments on August 13,  2001, to limit purchase cards to only those personnel who need to purchase  goods and services as part of their jobs.  As a result of this heightened  concern, the Navy reduced the number of cardholders by more than half\u2014 from about 59,000 in June 2001 to about 28,000 by September 2001.  In  October 2001, the Navy followed up the initial reduction in cardholders  with an interim change to the NAVSUP existing purchase card instructions  that established minimum criteria for prospective purchase card holders.   As shown in figure 2, the Navy continued to reduce the number of  cardholders and was down to about 25,000 as of March 2002.  Agency  program coordinators at the commands we audited told us that the  reduction was a result of (1) employee attrition, and (2) cancellation of  cards of individuals who no longer needed them.", "NAVSUP\u2019s interim change limiting purchase cards also established a  maximum ratio of seven  cardholders to each approving official, and  required that Navy and Marine Corps units establish local policies and  procedures for approving purchase cards and for issuing them to activity  personnel.

This average, however,  masks the wide range of ratios across units, including those that far  exceeded the DOD and Navy prescribed ratio of cardholders to approving  official. The problem of high cardholder-to-approving-official ratios  remains especially acute at NAVSEA, which at some locations used one  approving official to certify a single payment for all the unit\u2019s cardholders.

Therefore, to determine the maximum credit available we  analyzed the credit limits available to both cardholders and approving  officials.  In August 2001, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics sent a memorandum to the directors of all  defense agencies stating that supervisors should set reasonable limits  based on what each person needs to buy as part of his or her job and that  every cardholder does not need to have the maximum transaction or  monthly credit limit.   Similarly, in October 2001, NAVSUP issued an interim  change to the purchase card program instruction which requires agency  program coordinators to monitor cardholder credit limits and ensure that  the credit limits are appropriate for mission requirements.  We concur with  both the Under Secretary\u2019s statement and NAVSUP\u2019s interim change to the  purchase card instructions, and continue to believe that limiting cardholder  spending authority is an effective way of minimizing the federal  government\u2019s financial exposure.

Specifically, NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94 requires that prior to the issuance  of a purchase card account, the prospective cardholder and approving  official must receive training regarding both Navy policies and procedures  and local procedures.  The instruction also requires all cardholders and  approving officials to receive refresher training every 2 years.   In response  to the July 30, 2001, hearing, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for  Research, Development and Acquisition sent a message in August 2001 to  all Navy units directing them to train all of their cardholders on or about  September 12, 2001, concerning the proper use of the purchase cards.

Managers at all four locations told us that they  require all cardholders to receive training prior to receiving their purchase  cards.  Not all managers were as confident that cardholders and approving  officials received follow-up training.  Without a centralized training  database it would be extremely difficult to track when each cardholder  needed the required 2-year refresher training.", "Further, for training to be effective it should be tailored to provide the  knowledge needed for the different tasks in purchase card management.

These sources of supply include vendors qualifying  under the Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day Act (JWOD), Federal Prison Industries, and  DOD\u2019s Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS).  JWOD  vendors are nonprofit agencies that employ people who are blind or have  other severe disabilities.  JWOD vendors primarily sell office supplies and  calendars, which often cost less than items sold by commercial vendors.  In  a June 2001 letter to all procurement officials, DOD\u2019s Director of  Procurement reminded cardholders of the need to purchase listed items  from JWOD sources unless they have a specific waiver.

DOD\u2019s Purchase Card  Joint Program Management Office, the Navy, command procedures, and  the units\u2019 operating procedures recognize that cardholder reconciliation  and approving official review are central to ensuring that purchase card  transactions are appropriate.  Under 31 U.S.C. 3325 and DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation,disbursements are required to be made on the  basis of a voucher certified by an authorized agency official.  The certifying  official is responsible for ensuring (1) the adequacy of supporting  documentation, (2) the accuracy of payment calculations, and (3) the  legality of the proposed payment under the appropriation or fund charged.   The certification function is a preventive control that requires certifying  officers to maintain proper controls over public funds.  It also helps  prevent fraudulent and improper payments, including unsupported or  prohibited transactions, split purchases, and duplicate payments.  Further,  section 2784 of title 10, United States Code, requires the Secretary of  Defense to prescribe regulations that ensure that each purchase card  holder and approving official is responsible for reconciling charges on a  billing statement with receipts and other supporting documentation before  certification of the monthly bill.  Consistent with these requirements, Navy  purchase card guidance calls for cardholders to reconcile the monthly  purchase card statements to supporting records.  It calls for approving  officials to ensure that all cardholder purchases were appropriate and all  charges were accurate, and to resolve all questionable purchases with the  cardholder.  According to NAVSUP Instruction 4200.94, after the approving  official reviews the monthly bill, the approving official will certify it for  payment.", "Because certification is necessary for payment, it is likely to occur whether  or not cardholders and approving officials have performed required  reconciliations and reviews.  Thus, when we tested whether the cardholder  reconciled the monthly statement and whether the approving official  reviewed the monthly statement, we did not simply look for a physical or  electronic signature on a form.  Rather, for this test we considered that  proper reconciliation and review occurred if:  the cardholder signed and dated the monthly bill before it was paid,  and the monthly bill contained any markings or notes linking the  amounts billed to a credit card receipt, invoice, packing slip, or a  purchase log; and  the approving official\u2019s review of the cardholders\u2019 monthly statements  was signed and dated prior to certification for payment, and there were  virtually any markings or notes on the monthly statements evidencing  that review.", "Our testing revealed that documented evidence of adequate cardholder  reconciliation or approving official review of cardholder transactions did  not exist for most of our sample transactions.  Examples of inadequate  documentation included missing statements, invoices, signatures, or dates,  or a lack of evidence of cardholder reconciliation or approving official  review.  Without such evidence, we\u2014and the program coordinators, who  are required to semiannually review approving official records\u2014cannot  determine whether officials are complying with review requirements.   As  shown in table 6, the failure rate for this internal control activity at the  units in the four commands audited was among the highest of the controls  we tested.", "The failure rates for this attribute were similar to the failure rates that we  reported for this attribute in our previous testimony related to two San  Diego-based Navy units.  The Navy agreed with our initial  recommendations concerning the need to clarify the payment certification  portion of the purchase card instruction.   Based on this audit\u2019s broader  review of the Navy\u2019s purchase card program, we believe that the high  failure rate may also be attributable to the fact that approving official and  cardholder responsibilities fall into the category of \u201cother duties as  assigned\u201d without any specific time allocated for their performance, as  discussed previously.  Further, cardholders and approving officials are not  necessarily in the same geographic location.  Consequently, while an  approving official might be able to review cardholder transactions  electronically, the approving official will not necessarily be able to review  the documentation supporting the transaction.  Approving officials and  cardholders told us they had many duties of a higher priority than  reviewing the monthly purchase card statements.  A large workload,  especially in \u201cother duties as assigned,\u201d and geographical separation of  cardholders and approving officials can lead to less attention than  expected or desired.  For example, one NAVSEA approving official\u2019s ability  to promptly and accurately review cardholders\u2019 monthly statements was  hampered because (1) the approving official was responsible for reviewing  the statements of nearly 400 cardholders and regularly certified for  payment monthly statements exceeding $1 million and (2) the approving  official who was located in Rhode Island was responsible for reviewing the  statements of cardholders not only located in Rhode Island but also  cardholders located in Virginia, Washington, and Florida.", "We identified numerous instances of purchases that had not been  adequately reviewed and reconciled to the monthly statements, but in  which the statements were, nonetheless, certified for payment.  Such  activities allow potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or  questionable purchases (discussed in more detail in the following section  of this report) to go undetected.  Also, mistaken or other improper charges  by vendors might not be detected.  The following are examples of such  charges that we identified:  At Camp Lejeune, we found 29 transactions totaling over $50,000 for  which the Marine Corps was unable to provide any supporting  documentation concerning what was purchased or whether the items  purchased had a legitimate government use.  The vendors that the  Marine Corps paid without adequate supporting documentation  included Internet vendors, rental car companies, gift stores, and a stereo  store.  Considering that Camp Lejeune did not have documentation that  cardholders and approving officials routinely reconciled or reviewed the  monthly statements prior to payment, neither the Marine Corps nor we  can determine whether these accounts had been compromised and  someone was using them to fraudulently obtain goods or services at the  government\u2019s expense.  Navy purchase card instructions require  cardholders to retain documentation received from the vendor, such as  a sales slip or cash register receipt to verify the accuracy of the charges  made.  The purpose of maintaining this documentation is to provide an  audit trail that supports each decision to use the card and any required  special approvals.", "In December 2000, NAVSEA paid a hotel $12,200 despite the fact that  neither the cardholder nor the approving official had any evidence  concerning how the hotel arrived at the $12,200 amount.  When we  questioned the cardholder concerning the charge, he gave us a written  statement that the transaction was for the rental of a conference room  and audiovisual equipment.  The statement also said that he did not  authorize the purchase of any food.

We were informed that these were  for purchases of civilian clothes\u2014slacks, shirts, and suits\u2014for enlisted  personnel who were serving in an official capacity as assistants to  admirals and general officers, and to wear when playing in a jazz band.   The Director, Purchase Card Unit, Defense Contracting Command  Washington, informed us that this appears to be a fairly widespread  practice.  Clothing needs of military personnel are covered by the  clothing allowances that they receive.", "As part of our data mining of Navy-wide purchase card transactions, we  identified two purchases in which cardholders purchased Bose headsets  at $300 each.  The headsets were for personal use\u2014listening to music\u2014 while taking commercial flights and, therefore, should not have been  purchased with the Navy purchase card.", "At NAVSEA, we identified charges to hotels in Newport News and  Portsmouth, Virginia, totaling about $8,000 for locally based NAVSEA  employees to attend meetings at which they were inappropriately  provided meals and refreshments at the government\u2019s expense.  The  cardholders told us that they authorized the hotels to bill for audiovisual  equipment and conference room rental.  The cardholders said the hotel  was not authorized to bill for food.  However, despite the cardholders\u2019  assertion, the detailed bills showed that the hotels charged NAVSEA  about $7,000 for meals including breakfasts, lunches, and snacks.   Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1301(a), \"ppropriations shall be applied only to  the objects for which the appropriations were made . . . .\"  In the absence  of specific statutory authority, appropriated funds may only be used to  purchase items for official purposes, and may not be used to acquire  items for the personal benefit of a government employee.  For example,  without statutory authority, appropriated funds may not be used to  furnish meals or refreshments to employees within their normal duty  stations.  Free food and other refreshments normally cannot be  justified as a necessary expense of an agency's appropriation because  these items are considered personal expenses that federal employees  should pay for from their own salaries.", "Three of the four commands audited paid improper and abusive phone  charges.  For example in June 2001, the Atlantic Fleet paid $1,175 for  monthly service charges for 22 phones.  We determined that some cell  phone calls were long distance toll calls that were not for legitimate  government business.  The Navy\u2019s and Atlantic Fleet\u2019s command level  procedures prohibit the use of cell phones for other than officially  approved uses.  In addition, even though Atlantic Fleet guidance  requires subordinate units to verify monthly cell phone usage, the units  were not reviewing the monthly bills as required.  Our audit of the calls  made using the cell phones determined that some were to personal  residences\u2014not military facilities or merchants supplying goods and  services to the Navy.  In addition, we found wasteful charges for cell  phones.  For example, the Navy paid for 13 months of service at $15 per  month for a cell phone that had been returned to the vendor.  It was not  until we inquired about the lack of use on the phone that the Navy  realized it was paying for a phone that had been returned over 1 year  earlier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Split Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Another category of improper transaction is a split purchase, which occurs  when a cardholder splits a transaction into segments to avoid the  requirement to obtain competition for purchases over the $2,500  micropurchase threshold or to avoid other established credit limits.  The  Federal Acquisition Regulation prohibits splitting a purchase into more  than one transaction to avoid the requirement to obtain competition for  purchases over the $2,500 micropurchase threshold.  Navy purchase card  instructions also prohibit splitting purchases to avoid other established  credit limits.  Once items exceed the $2,500 threshold, they are to be  purchased through a contract in accordance with simplified acquisition  procedures that are more stringent than those for micropurchases.", "Our analysis of data on purchases at the four major commands we audited  and our data mining efforts identified numerous occurrences of potential  split purchases.   In addition, internal auditors at all four commands that we  audited identified split purchases as a continuing problem.  In some of  these instances, the cardholder\u2019s purchases exceeded the $2,500 limit, and  the cardholder split the purchase into 2 or more transactions of $2,500 or  less.  For example, a Camp Lejeune cardholder made 8 transactions  totaling about $17,000 on 1 day to purchase combat boots.  In addition, a  NAVSEA cardholder made 14 purchases totaling over $30,000 in 1 day from  an electronic supply store.", "All the commands that we audited said that cardholders splitting purchases  to circumvent the micropurchase threshold was a problem.  As we  previously reported, by circumventing the competitive requirements of the  simplified acquisition procedures, the commands may not be getting the  best prices possible for the government.  For the Navy to reduce split  transactions, it will need to monitor the vendors with whom cardholders  are conducting business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Management of Transactions with Frequently Used Vendors Could Result in Additional Savings", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has not proactively managed the purchase card program to  identify opportunities for savings.  Purchase card sales volume has grown  significantly over the last few years with the Navy now using the purchase  card to procure nearly $2 billion a year in goods and services.  We believe  that the Navy could better leverage its volume of purchases and negotiate  discounts with frequently used vendors.  For example, during fiscal year  2001, the Navy paid over $1 million each to 122 different vendors using the  purchase card.  In total during fiscal year 2001, the Navy paid those 122  vendors about $330 million.  However, the Deputy Director of the Navy  eBusiness Operations Office told us that, despite this heavy sales volume,  the Navy had not negotiated reduced-price contracts with any of the  vendors.", "As previously stated, one of the benefits of using purchase cards versus  traditional contracting and payment processes is lower transaction  processing costs and less red tape for both the government and the vendor.   Through increased analysis of purchase card procurement patterns, the  Navy has the opportunity to leverage its high volume of purchases and  achieve additional savings from vendors by negotiating volume discounts  similar to those the General Service Administration (GSA) has negotiated  in its Multiple Award Schedule program.  Under GSA\u2019s Multiple Award  Schedule, participating vendors agree to sell their products at preferred  customer prices to all government purchasing agents.  According to the  Deputy Director of the Navy\u2019s eBusiness Operations Office, 74 of the 122  vendors with which the Navy spent more than $1 million using the  purchase card during fiscal year 2001 did not participate in the Multiple  Award Schedule program.  In addition, for 48 of the vendors with which  Navy spent more than $1 million and that did participate in the Multiple  Award Schedule, the opportunity existed for the Navy to negotiate  additional savings.  GSA encourages agencies to enter into blanket  purchase agreements (BPAs) and negotiate additional discounts with  Multiple Award Schedule vendors from which they make recurring  purchases.", "By analyzing Navy-wide cardholder buying patterns, the Navy should be  able to achieve additional savings by identifying vendors and vendor  categories for which it uses the purchase card for significant amounts of  money and negotiate discounts with them.  For example, during fiscal year  2001, the Navy spent about $65 million with 5 national computer vendors  (Dell, Gateway, CDW Computer Centers, Micro Warehouse, and GTSI),  $22 million with 3 office supply companies (Corporate Express, Staples,  and Office Depot), and $9 million with 2 national home improvement stores  (Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s).  While 8 of these 10 vendors participate in GSA\u2019s  Multiple Award Schedule program, the Navy could not tell us whether its  purchases from these vendors were made using that program\u2019s preferred  price schedules.  Further, considering the Navy\u2019s volume of purchases, it is  reasonable to assume that it could negotiate additional savings with these  and other vendors if it used historical purchase card sales data as a  bargaining tool."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Abusive and Questionable Purchases", "paragraphs": ["We identified numerous examples of abusive and questionable transactions  at each of the four installations we audited.  We defined abusive  transactions as those that were authorized, but in which the items were  purchased at an excessive cost (e.g., \u201cgold plated\u201d) or for a questionable  government need, or both.  Abuse can be viewed when the conduct of a  government organization, program, activity, or function falls short of  societal expectations of prudent behavior.  Often, improper purchases such  as those discussed in the previous section are also abusive.  Transactions  that are both improper and abusive were discussed previously, such as the  excessive cell phone charges at the Atlantic Fleet.", "Questionable transactions are those that appear to be improper or abusive  but for which there is insufficient documentation to conclude either.  We  consider transactions to be questionable when they do not fit within the  Navy guidelines on purchases that are acceptable for the purchase card  program, and when there is not a reasonable or documented justification to  acquire the item purchased.  When we examined the support for  questionable transactions, we usually did not find evidence of why the  Navy or Marine Corps needed the item purchased. Consequently, the  cardholder provided an after-the-fact rationale that the item purchased was  not improper or abusive.  To prevent unnecessary costs, these types of  questionable purchases require scrutiny before the purchase, not after.   Table 11 identifies examples of both abusive and questionable purchases.", "The following include details of some of the abusive and questionable  purchases in table 11.", "Computer and related equipment exceeding documented need\u2014The  Navy used the purchase card to acquire computer and computer-related  items far in advance of its needs.  Considering that computer prices  decrease over time while their capabilities improve, warehousing  computers and related items is an especially ineffective use of  government funds.  Despite this time, price, and capability relationship,  we found in our statistical sample that the Atlantic Fleet, Pacific Fleet,  and NAVSEA purchased computers, monitors, and printers that often  remained unused for more than 12 months.  For example, the computers  purchased by the Atlantic Fleet in September 2000 that were discussed  in the section on pilferable property had Pentium III microprocessors.   By the time the Atlantic Fleet issued some of those computers in  January 2002, the manufacturer was selling computers with Pentium IV  microprocessors at a cost of less than what the Atlantic Fleet paid for  the Pentium IIIs.  Further, our statistical sample at the Atlantic Fleet  identified 22 other computers that the Navy purchased in April 2001  that, as shown in figure 4, were unused and still in their original boxes in  June 2002.  Similarly, we found two $3,500 laser printers purchased in  September 2000 that were selected in our statistical sample of Pacific  Fleet transactions still in their original boxes at a Pacific Fleet  warehouse in January 2002.", "We have previously identified DOD\u2019s inventory management as an area  at high risk for fraud, waste, and abuse.  In our report on DOD major  management challenges and program risk we stated that because of  its unreliable inventory management systems managers may request  funds to obtain additional items that were on hand.  Our review of fiscal  year 2001 Atlantic Fleet transactions found that despite having these  unopened items, the unit had in fact purchased additional computers  after September 2000 and the Pacific Fleet purchased laser printers  after June 2001.", "Designer leather goods\u2014In September and October 2000, NAVSEA  made two separate transactions totaling nearly $1,800 to obtain designer  leather folios and PDA holders costing up to $300 each made by Coach  and Dooney and Bourke.  Two of the folios were given as gifts to a  visiting officer in the Australian Navy, while other designer items were  personal preferences of the cardholders and requesting individuals.", "Flat panel monitors\u2014Our statistical sample selected transactions  containing 243 flat panel monitors purchased by the Atlantic Fleet,  Pacific Fleet, and NAVSEA.  The cost of the monitors selected in our  sample ranged from $550 to $2,200.  Conversely, the 17-inch standard  monitors selected in the sample cost about $200.  As we have reported in  the past, we believe the purchase of flat panel monitors\u2014particularly  those that cost far in excess of standard monitors\u2014to be abusive and  not an effective use of government funds in the absence of a  documented need based on technical, space, or other considerations.  Further, in our statistical sample, we found that some of the flat panel  monitors that the Atlantic Fleet purchased were placed in a warehouse  and not issued for more than a year after the Navy took possession.   Warehousing flat panel monitors is especially inefficient because, like  computers, as time passes the price of flat panel monitors decreases and  technology increases.  The flat panel monitors that we found still in the  box cost the Navy $709 each.  As of June 2002, the GSA price for the  same flat panel monitors was about $480.", "Personal digital assistants\u2014We found that the Atlantic Fleet and  Pacific Fleet purchased PDAs for staff without documenting why the  staff needed them to perform their official duties.  In one instance, the  Atlantic Fleet purchased 90 PDAs for $32,500 in October 2000 without  any documented justification of need.  As of June 1, 2002, 14 of the 90  PDAs had not been issued and were still in inventory.  Further, the  competitive bid price worksheet showed that the Navy did not accept  the lowest bid for the PDAs.  According to the competitive bid  worksheet, the Atlantic Fleet received three bids for the PDAs that  ranged from a low of $30,400 to a high of $32,850.  The Atlantic Fleet  accepted the middle bid of $32,500.  Federal Acquisition Regulation  allows purchasing agents to reject lower bids if the purchasing agent  determines that the items being delivered do not conform to the  applicable specifications, or if the vendors cannot deliver the goods or  services within the specified time requirements.  We saw no evidence  that quality or timeliness were a factor in selecting the higher priced bid.", "Clock radios\u2014As part of our Navy-wide data mining we inquired about a  $2,443 transaction with Bose Corporation on September 30, 2000.  In  response to that inquiry, the Navy command that made the purchase told  us that it purchased seven Bose \u201cWave Radios\u201d costing $349 each.  The  command justified the purchase by stating that Navy regulations require  all visiting office quarters to be supplied with a clock radio.

Specifically, we recommended that the  Commander, Naval Supply Systems Command, revise NAVSUP Instruction  4200.94 to include specific consequences for noncompliance with purchase  card policies and procedures.  In response to the November 2001 report,  DOD did not concur with that recommendation and stated that existing  Navy policy clearly identifies consequences for fraud, abuse, and misuse.

Unless cardholders and approving officials are held  accountable for following key internals controls, the Navy is likely to  continue to experience the types of fraudulent, improper, and abusive and  questionable transactions identified in our work.  As part of this audit, we  asked the agency program coordinators at each command that we audited  whether any cardholders referred to in this report were disciplined for  improper, abusive, or questionable purchases; or if the reduction in the  number of cardholders could be attributed to individuals who lost the card  because they made improper, abusive, or questionable purchases.

For example, the Navy has reduced the number of cardholders by  over 50 percent, from 59,000 to 25,000, thus improving the prospects for  effective program management.  However, further actions are needed to  achieve an effective control environment.
