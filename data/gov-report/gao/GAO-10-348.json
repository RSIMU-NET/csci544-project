The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has certain oversight authorities for cleaning up contaminants on federal property, and has placed 1,620 of the most contaminated sites--including 141 DOD installations--on its National Priorities List (NPL). As of February 2009, after 10 or more years on the NPL, 11 DOD installations had not signed the required interagency agreements (IAG) to guide cleanup with EPA. GAO was asked to examine (1) the status of DOD cleanup of hazardous substances at selected installations that lacked IAGs, and (2) obstacles, if any, to cleanup at these installations. GAO selected and visited three installations, reviewed relevant statutes and agency documents, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EPA and DOD use different terms and metrics to report cleanup progress; therefore, the status of cleanup at Fort Meade Army Base, McGuire Air Force Base (AFB), and Tyndall AFB is unclear. EPA reports that cleanup at all three installations is in the early investigative phases, while DOD's data suggest that cleanup is further along and, in some cases, in mature stages. EPA and DOD have differing interpretations of cleanup progress because they describe and assess cleanup differently. In particular, while both agencies divide installations into smaller cleanup projects, DOD divides them into units generally smaller than EPA's; therefore, DOD measures its progress in smaller increments. Further, because DOD did not obtain EPA's approval for key cleanup decisions, EPA does not recognize them. Unless key cleanup decisions are justified, documented, and available to the public for review and comment, they are not sufficient under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and once an IAG is in place, some DOD cleanup work may have to be redone. When an agency refuses to enter into an IAG and cleanup progress lags, because of statutory and other limitations, EPA cannot take steps--such as issuing and enforcing orders--to compel CERCLA cleanup as it would for a private party. A variety of obstacles have delayed cleanup progress at these installations. First, DOD's persistent failure to enter IAGs, despite reaching agreement with EPA on the basic terms, has made managing site cleanup and addressing routine matters challenging at these installations. For example, in the absence of IAGs, DOD may fund work at other sites ahead of these NPL sites. Second, DOD failed to disclose some contamination to EPA and the public in a timely fashion, including lead shot on a playground, delaying cleanup and putting human health at risk. Third, the extensive use of performance-based contracts at these installations has created pressure to operate within price caps and fixed deadlines. In some cases, these pressures may have contributed to installations not exploring the full range of cleanup remedies, or relying on nonconstruction remedies, such as allowing contaminated groundwater to attenuate over time rather than being cleaned up. In particular, Tyndall AFB's long-standing lack of full compliance with environmental cleanup requirements, such as notification of hazardous releases and EPA's 2007 administrative order, has been an obstacle to verifiable cleanup of that installation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending, among other things, that EPA and DOD identify options that would provide a uniform method for reporting cleanup progress at the installations and allow for transparency to Congress and the public. EPA and DOD agreed with the recommendations directed at them. GAO is also suggesting that Congress may want to consider giving EPA certain tools to enforce CERCLA at federal facilities without IAGs. DOD disagreed with this suggestion. GAO believes EPA needs additional authority to ensure timely and proper cleanup at such sites."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Before federal environmental legislation was enacted in the 1970s and  1980s regulating the generation, storage, treatment, and disposal of  hazardous waste, Department of Defense (DOD) activities and industrial  facilities contaminated millions of acres of soil and water on and near  DOD properties in the United States and its territories. DOD properties  released hazardous substances to the environment primarily through  industrial operations to repair and maintain military equipment, and the  manufacturing and testing of weapons at ammunition plants and proving  grounds. From 1986 to 2008, DOD spent $29.8 billion on environmental  cleanup and restoration activities at its properties in response to such  hazardous releases. Furthermore, in its most recent annual report to  Congress, DOD expressed its commitment to full and sustained  compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and  regulations that protect human health and preserve natural resources.", "To address the cleanup of hazardous releases at both private and  government facilities nationwide, in 1980, Congress passed the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act  (CERCLA), better known as \u201cSuperfund.\u201d Under CERCLA, as amended,  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has certain oversight  authorities for cleaning up releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or  contaminants on federal properties. As of April 2010, 1,620 Superfund sites  were on EPA\u2019s National Priorities List (NPL), which identifies some of the  most seriously contaminated sites in the nation, of which 141 or almost 9  percent were DOD properties. As of February 2009, 11 of these properties  did not have an interagency agreement (IAG) despite CERCLA\u2019s  requirement that federal agencies enter into IAGs with EPA within a  certain time frame to clean up sites on the NPL. DOD and EPA signed  IAGs for 7 of these installations between March 2009 and January 2010,  but as of June 2010, DOD had not signed IAGs for 4 of these properties,  even though they are required under CERCLA.", "You asked us to review activities at selected DOD installations on the NPL  that lacked IAGs as of February 2009. Accordingly, this report examines  (1) the status of DOD cleanup of hazardous substances at selected DOD  installations that lacked IAGs and (2) obstacles, if any, to progress in  cleanup at these selected installations and the causes of such obstacles.", "To select installations for review, from the 11 without IAGs at the start of  our review, we focused on the 4 that received EPA administrative cleanup  orders\u2014Air Force Plant 44 in Arizona, Fort Meade Army Base in  Maryland, McGuire Air Force Base (AFB) in New Jersey, and Tyndall AFB  in Florida. EPA and DOD agreed that one of these\u2014Air Force Plant 44\u2014 was near completion of the ordered cleanup and we therefore eliminated it  from our selection of installations. To determine the status of DOD  cleanup of hazardous substances at the three remaining installations, we  reviewed numerous technical documents and interviewed officials from  DOD, EPA, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  (ATSDR)\u2014created by CERCLA to help determine the public health  consequences of the worst hazardous waste sites\u2014and DOD contractors.  To identify any obstacles to progress in cleanup at the selected  installations and the causes of such obstacles, we reviewed federal  contracting guidelines and technical documents developed by DOD  installations and EPA regions, and interviewed officials from DOD, EPA,  ATSDR, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Architect of the Capitol as  well as state officials from Florida, Maryland, and New Jersey. We also  reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and policies. Appendix I includes  additional information about our selection criteria, scope, and  methodology.

Federal agencies cannot use the Superfund trust fund to finance their  cleanups and must, instead, use their own or other appropriations.", "CERCLA does not establish regulatory standards for the cleanup of  specific substances, but requires that remedial actions\u2014which are long- term cleanups\u2014comply with \u201capplicable or relevant and appropriate  requirements.\u201d These requirements may include a host of federal and  state standards that generally regulate exposure to contaminants. CERCLA  also establishes authorities for removals, including expeditious response  actions by EPA and DOD to reduce dangers to human health, welfare, or  the environment such as an emergency response required within hours or  days to address acute situations involving actual or potential threat to  human health, the environment, or real or personal property due to the  release or threatened release of a hazardous substance. Generally,  removals are quicker, short-term responses to reduce risks, while remedial  actions are the culmination of the full CERCLA process to provide long- term protection of human health and the environment.", "The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan  (NCP) outlines procedures and standards for implementing the Superfund  program. The NCP designates DOD as the lead agency for cleanup at  defense installations. CERCLA requires DOD to comply with the law and the  NCP to the same extent as a nonfederal entity; thus, the same process and  standards for cleanup apply. Where there has been a release of a hazardous  substance where DOD is the lead agency, CERCLA section 103 requires  DOD to report such releases above reportable quantities as soon as it has  knowledge of such release to the National Response Center, and section  111(g) requires DOD to notify potentially injured parties of such release, and  promulgate regulations pertaining to notification. In addition, DOD must  carry out its responsibilities consistent with EPA\u2019s oversight role under  section 120 of CERCLA, including EPA\u2019s final authority to select a remedial  action at NPL installations if it disagrees with DOD\u2019s proposed remedy.", "CERCLA section 120 establishes specific requirements governing IAGs  between EPA and federal agencies. The contents of the IAGs must include  at least the following three items: (1) a review of the alternative remedies  considered and the selection of a remedial action by the agency head and  EPA (or, if unable to reach agreement, selection by EPA); (2) the schedule  for completing the remedial action; and (3) arrangements for long-term  operations and maintenance at the installation. Federal agencies and  EPA are required to enter into an IAG within 180 days of the completion of  EPA\u2019s review of the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) at  an installation. An RI/FS is performed at the site, typically after a site is  listed on the NPL. The RI serves as the mechanism for collecting data to  characterize site conditions; determine the nature of the waste; assess risk  to human health and the environment; and conduct treatability testing to  evaluate the potential performance and cost of the treatment technologies  that are being considered. The FS is the mechanism for the development,  screening, and detailed evaluation of alternative remedial actions. Because  such study culminates in a record of decision (ROD), EPA has interpreted  this requirement as triggered by the first ROD at an NPL site with multiple  cleanup activities. EPA and federal agencies often enter IAGs earlier so the  agreement may guide the study process as well.", "IAGs between EPA and DOD include a site management plan, which is an  annually amended document providing schedules and prioritization for  cleanup of the installation, addressing all response activities and  associated documentation, as well as milestones. IAGs also specify  requirements for documents throughout the cleanup process, addressing  DOD\u2019s submission, EPA\u2019s review, and DOD\u2019s response to EPA\u2019s  comments. For \u201cprimary\u201d documents, such as the site management plan,  RI/FS work plans and reports, RODs, final remedial action designs, and  remedial action work plans, the IAG establishes a review and comment  process intended to result in no further comment\u2013\u2013essentially agency  agreement on the document; if either agency disagrees, it can submit the  issue to dispute resolution procedures. Hence, for purposes of this report  we consider that formal EPA approval is effectively required for these key  steps. IAGs do not subject removals to formal EPA approval, although  submission of certain documents is required (unless shown impracticable)  before an action is taken to allow EPA to comment. Removals are  intended to prevent, minimize, or mitigate a release or threat of release,  and are not subject to required cleanup goals, whereas a remedial action is  intended to implement remedies that eliminate, reduce, or control risks to  human health and the environment and generally involve establishing  numerical cleanup goals. Removals do not relieve DOD of completing  additional steps\u2013\u2013such as RI/FS completion\u2013\u2013or the full cleanup process  for the site with formal EPA approval, if required to ensure long-term  protection of human health and the environment.

This  preliminary assessment is reviewed by EPA, together with additional  information, to determine whether the site poses a threat to human health  and the environment or requires further investigation or assessment for  potential proposal to the NPL.", "SARA\u2019s legislative history explains that, while the law already established  that federal agencies are subject to and must comply with CERCLA, the  addition of section 120 provides the public, states, and EPA increased  involvement and a greater role in assuring the problems of hazardous  substance releases at federal facilities are dealt with by expeditious and  appropriate response actions. The relevant congressional conference  committee report establishes that IAGs provide a mechanism for (1) EPA  to independently evaluate the other federal agency\u2019s selected cleanup  remedy, and (2) states and citizens to enforce federal agency cleanup  obligations, memorialized in IAGs, in court. Specifically, the report states  that while EPA and the other federal agency share remedy selection  responsibilities, EPA has the additional responsibility to make an  independent determination that the selected remedial action is consistent  with the NCP and is the most appropriate remedial action for the affected  facility. The report also observes that IAGs are enforceable documents just  as administrative cleanup orders are under RCRA and, as such, are subject  to SARA\u2019s citizen suit and penalties provisions. Thus, IAGs can provide for  the assessment of penalties against federal agencies for violating terms of  the agreements.

The report  was issued following DOD\u2019s February 2009 agreement with EPA that  appeared to resolve a long dispute by determining that the 11 IAGs  outstanding at the time would be completed using an IAG between the  Army and EPA for Fort Eustis, Virginia, as a template. In addition, EPA  agreed to rescind each administrative cleanup order upon the effective  date of an installation\u2019s IAG.", "Soon after this approach for resolving outstanding disputes was agreed to  by EPA and DOD leadership, some progress was made in signing IAGs. For  example, the Army signed an IAG for Fort Meade Army Base in June 2009.  Likewise, the Air Force signed IAGs for McGuire AFB, Brandywine  Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office Salvage Yard, Langley AFB,  and Hanscom Field AFB, by November 2009.", "In the absence of the required IAGs, DOD, at some installations, took a few  actions toward cleanup and, at others, proceeded with some cleanup  activities\u2014including investigations, removals, and remedial actions\u2014 without EPA approvals, according to EPA officials. To address continued  challenges, EPA issued administrative cleanup orders at four DOD  installations, either under EPA\u2019s RCRA authority, or under EPA\u2019s Safe  Drinking Water Act authority. According to EPA officials, the agency  took the unusual step of issuing the orders because it needed them to  fulfill EPA\u2019s cleanup oversight responsibilities at the sites in the absence  of IAGs. These administrative cleanup orders were issued as final in 2007  and 2008. In response, DOD challenged the validity of the administrative  cleanup orders and asked DOJ to resolve certain questions in dispute  between DOD and EPA over the terms of the IAGs and the circumstances  under which EPA may issue administrative cleanup orders at such NPL  installations. In December 2008, DOJ issued a letter upholding EPA\u2019s  authority to issue administrative cleanup orders at DOD NPL installations  in general, without discussing whether the facts supported these specific  orders. DOJ\u2019s letter also supported including provisions in IAGs, such as  the types of provisions that EPA regularly includes in its cleanup  agreements with private parties, in addition to those specifically in  CERCLA, while stating the opinion that DOD does not necessarily have to  agree to all extra-statutory terms.", "After DOJ\u2019s letter, the Fort Meade Army Base recognized EPA\u2019s 2007  administrative cleanup order under RCRA and gave formal notice to EPA  that the Army would comply with the order. However, at about the same  time, the state of Maryland filed a lawsuit in December of 2008 against the  Army \u201cto force the Army to investigate fully and remediate soil and  groundwater contamination resulting from years of mismanagement of  hazardous substances, solid waste, and hazardous waste,\u201d and to enforce  EPA\u2019s 2007 administrative cleanup order. In November 2009, the state  voluntarily withdrew the suit after the Army, EPA, and two other federal  agencies signed an IAG for Fort Meade. By the terms of the IAG, EPA  withdrew the administrative cleanup order in October 2009.", "In contrast, Air Force officials at Tyndall AFB and McGuire AFB did not  give formal notice of intent to comply with EPA\u2019s administrative cleanup  orders and never complied with the terms of the orders. For example, the  Air Force stated in a May 2008 letter to EPA regarding the Tyndall order,  \u201cthe Air Force continues to challenge this Order as lacking legal and  factual basis\u2026I have directed my staff and Tyndall AFB to continue to  conduct cleanup actions under  using our lead agency functions,  authorities and responsibilities delegated to DOD.\u201d The Air Force  continues to assert that the IAG proposed by EPA does not match the  agreed-to template, whereas EPA asserts the IAG does follow the  template; both EPA and DOD officials told us the dispute over the IAG  relates to the appendices listing the areas to be investigated and, if  required, cleaned up. McGuire AFB\u2019s IAG was since signed and became  effective December 2009, and EPA\u2019s 2008 administrative cleanup order  was withdrawn. While Tyndall remains without an IAG and its  administrative cleanup order is still in effect, the Air Force counsel has  asserted they are continuing \u201csubstantive compliance\u201d with the  administrative cleanup order using the CERCLA process\u2014although EPA\u2019s  order specifically requires Tyndall to use the RCRA process. EPA  officials stated that the agency cannot on its own impose penalties or  otherwise compel compliance with the administrative cleanup order at Tyndall; to do so would require concurrence from DOJ to proceed with court action against another federal agency, which is contrary to fed policy.", "A summary of the current status of IAGs is provided in Table 1.

As DOD did not obtain EPA\u2019s  concurrence with some of the cleanup actions it took at these  installations, it may need to conduct additional work even on reported  completed actions as a result of EPA requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cleanup Work Has Begun, but EPA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s Differing Performance Metrics and Reporting Practices Result in Differing Interpretations of Progress", "paragraphs": ["Twenty or more years after contamination was first reported at Fort  Meade, McGuire AFB, and Tyndall AFB, EPA reports that environmental  cleanup generally remains in the early, investigative phases of the  CERCLA process, with little progress in achieving long-term remediation  of contaminated sites at these installations. While DOD\u2019s data suggest that  some remedial action work has taken place, EPA and DOD have differing  interpretations of the level of cleanup achieved at these installations, in  part because the agencies use different terminology and performance  metrics to assess cleanup. EPA\u2019s terminology and metrics are based on the  Superfund program, including some that are unique to federal facilities,  while DOD\u2019s terminology and metrics are based on the DERP program,  which DOD is directed to conduct in accordance with CERCLA.  Specifically:    EPA divides installations into numbered \u201coperable units\u201d (OU), which may  represent the type of action to be taken, such as the removal of drums and  tanks from the surface of an installation; the geographic boundaries of the  contamination; or the medium that is contaminated, such as groundwater.", "DOD divides installations into smaller geographic areas of contamination  called \u201csites.\u201d These sites are typically scoped narrowly to allow for  targeting work on actions that can be accomplished efficiently\u2014for  example, a building or waste disposal area where a potential or actual  release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants may have  occurred may be considered a \u201csite,\u201d while adjacent buildings with similar  operations are considered as separate sites. DOD\u2019s sites are sometimes  smaller than EPA\u2019s OUs; therefore there may be multiple DOD sites in one  EPA OU.", "The differing nomenclature can make it difficult to interpret and compare  the information DOD reports annually to Congress with what EPA lists in  its Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability  Information System (CERCLIS) database on the status of environmental  cleanup at NPL sites. For example, as seen in figure 1, EPA reports the  progress of cleanup at McGuire AFB by tracking advancements achieved  at the installation\u2019s 8 EPA OUs, while DOD reports progress according to  advancements achieved at 36 DOD sites. EPA, as the regulator under  CERCLA, must track progress made under the statute, and EPA officials  said that units in program regulations must have precedence over DOD\u2019s  internal system of measuring progress.", "According to EPA data, most of the OUs at Fort Meade, McGuire AFB, and  Tyndall AFB are in the RI/FS phase of environmental cleanup, which as  seen in figure 2 occurs early in the CERCLA cleanup process. While the  RI/FS phase historically has an average duration of 5.2 years for EPA OUs  at federal facility sites on the NPL, many EPA OUs at these three bases  have already been in the RI/FS phase for twice that long and are not yet  complete. In fact only 3 of a total 37 OUs at these three installations have  completed the RI/FS phase of the CERCLA process; those 3 EPA OUs are  located at Fort Meade, and none of the OUs at McGuire AFB or Tyndall  AFB have completed the RI/FS phase according to EPA.", "DOD, on the other hand, reports that cleanup is further along at all three  of these installations. For example, officials at Fort Meade said that  environmental cleanup at their installation is at a very mature stage. In a  2008 report to Congress, DOD reported that Fort Meade had achieved  response complete at 61 percent of its 54 sites. The achievement of  \u201cresponse complete,\u201d a DOD term, occurs either late in the CERCLA  process after the remedy selected in the RI/FS phase is implemented, or at  any time when DOD deems cleanup goals have been met and no further  action is required at the site. As we previously reported, we are  concerned about the lack of clarity in DOD\u2019s use of this term to describe  sites that have been administratively closed, with no physical cleanup.", "In addition, EPA and DOD report dissimilar pictures of cleanup progress  because each agency reports cleanup progress in a different way. For  example, DOD reports on removals, which CERCLA defines as short-term  and emergency actions to reduce risk, and for which EPA\u2019s formal  approval is not required unless specified in an enforceable agreement.  These actions are not necessarily designed to provide long-term  protectiveness of human health and the environment, and sites where a  removal has been conducted are still subject to the full CERCLA process,  until no further action is appropriate. EPA tracks removals through its  CERCLIS database, which also shows the remaining steps in the full  CERCLA process; a removal may be the first response action taken,  although one can occur at any time during the process.", "Furthermore, EPA tracks approved cleanup actions under CERCLA that  have been completed or are under way for an entire EPA OU, and records  these cleanup actions by EPA OU in the CERCLIS database, where key  information is made available to the public on EPA\u2019s Web site. Also,  EPA\u2019s current reporting system does not show cleanup progress unless the  action has been achieved at all DOD sites within that OU. In contrast, DOD  tracks cleanup by site through various cleanup phases as defined in the  DERP, which generally aligns with CERCLA but includes additional  milestones, and then reports the number of sites in each cleanup phase in  its annual report to Congress. For example, Tyndall AFB includes 12 EPA  OUs with 12 DOD sites, with an additional 39 other sites that are not  contained within any EPA OU. These additional sites are still in stages of  preliminary investigation under CERCLA, according to EPA officials; DOD  officials said that a number of these are regulated completely as petroleum  sites under a separate program that is administered by the state of Florida,  but EPA officials said they want to evaluate all of them under CERCLA, to  ensure that any non-petroleum contamination that may exist is accounted  for and cleaned up under CERCLA. According to EPA officials, Tyndall  AFB has achieved no completed cleanup actions at the base, and it  recognizes only one RI/FS action as ongoing. In contrast, DOD reported in  fiscal year 2008 that Tyndall staff had completed 36 of 51 study actions for  sites at Tyndall AFB, amounting to 71 percent of the study phase complete  at the base. The fact that DOD measures progress in smaller increments  can lead to differing interpretations of cleanup. As we said earlier, DOD  counts as progress the completion of each contaminated DOD site located  within an EPA OU, although EPA does not count progress until action is  taken at all DOD sites in that OU.", "In June 2009, EPA and DOD formed a working group to review and  harmonize both agencies\u2019 environmental cleanup goals and metrics, with  the goal of better communication between the agencies regarding cleanup  progress at DOD installations on the NPL.

Specifically at Tyndall, after a change in personnel at EPA,  the new project manager reviewed the files and found the documentation  was insufficient to support many of the previous decisions made at the  base. EPA officials told us that once IAGs are in place at these  installations, any unilateral cleanup actions previously taken are likely to  be revisited and EPA may require work to be redone.", "According to EPA officials, DOD and EPA have long agreed that, because  EPA has ultimate authority under CERCLA for remedies at DOD NPL  installations, EPA approval of key steps toward remedy selection is  required. In practice, according to EPA officials, it is difficult for a federal  facility to obtain EPA concurrence on its cleanup decisions in the absence  of a signed IAG for several reasons. First, from a project management  perspective, EPA lacks assurance that it has had adequate involvement in  key steps in the process. Second, from a compliance standpoint, EPA told  us it must incorporate, among other things, an enforceable schedule and  arrangements for long-term management of a remedy into a ROD, in order  to approve the selected remedy at a federal facility without an IAG.", "At least one installation has gained EPA\u2019s concurrence with cleanup  actions without an IAG through effective interagency cooperation.  However, two of the three DOD installations we examined for this  report\u2014Tyndall AFB and Fort Meade\u2014moved forward with cleanup  actions, including remedies, without a signed IAG or ROD. For example,  EPA\u2019s records for Tyndall AFB show that DOD made decisions at a  number of sites without the required concurrence of EPA.", "Despite the lack of IAGs, DOD submitted a variety of documents for EPA  review at each of the three selected installations. However, without an  IAG, there are no agreed-upon time frames for review and comment and  no overall work plan to provide predictable schedules for DOD or EPA.  With an IAG, EPA\u2019s typical primary document review times would be 60  days; however, DOD officials told us that EPA reviews sometimes take  longer, with or without an IAG. As a result, DOD officials said that, in  some cases, DOD moved forward without EPA concurrence, while in  other cases DOD may have delayed planned actions. For example, EPA  provided comments on a preliminary assessment of munitions sites at  Tyndall AFB that included concerns about how the munitions at these  sites could affect other nearby hazardous substances sites. However, EPA  took approximately 4 months after receiving the assessment from DOD to  submit the comments. As a result, DOD officials told us they finalized the  preliminary assessment before receiving EPA\u2019s comments because they  wanted to close out the contract. On the other hand, without the  predictable schedules provided by an IAG, EPA officials told us they could  not predict the flow of documents from DOD they would have to review.  EPA officials told us that DOD at times submitted few documents for  review, while at other times, an overwhelming number of documents,  making it difficult for EPA to allocate resources for review and comment.  We could not verify long-term trends in the volume of document  submission and in document review times because neither EPA nor DOD  maintains a consistent, verifiable, and long-term management system for  tracking documents submitted or reviewed.

In addition, at Fort Meade  Army Base, a lack of coordination with EPA and incomplete record  reviews resulted in DOD personnel occupying housing at risk of  contamination until they were evacuated. Further, the Air Force has failed  to disclose some contamination risks at Tyndall AFB promptly, resulting in  delays in taking cleanup action. We also found particular problems at  Tyndall AFB, where long-standing noncompliance regarding  environmental cleanup and notification has contributed to the lack of  cleanup progress.

Without an IAG, EPA lacks the mechanisms to  ensure that cleanup by an installation proceeds expeditiously, is properly  done, and has public input, as required by CERCLA. For example, DOD  officials said that EPA reviewed the proposed remedial action and provided  written agreement for the Army\u2019s decision to use monitored natural  attenuation\u2014relying on natural processes to reduce the contamination in  soil or groundwater without human intervention\u2014as the remedy for  groundwater contamination at the Ordnance Demolition Area at Fort  Meade, which had been historically used for the demolition of unexploded  munitions. However, Fort Meade did not have EPA\u2019s signature on the ROD  and did not seek formal public comment. EPA officials said that additional  documentation was needed to support the use of that remedy and advised  Fort Meade that it was exceeding its authority. The IAG for Fort Meade  provided that Fort Meade withdraw this decision document and submit a  new one for EPA\u2019s review, which could result in the Army being required to  carry out additional cleanup actions for that site.", "Whereas an IAG would provide for negotiated deadlines designed to  reflect the specific complexities at an installation, DOD\u2019s national cleanup  goals may drive installations to take actions without EPA approval to meet  deadlines. In particular, DOD recently set a cleanup goal for reducing risk  or achieving remedy in place or response complete by 2014 for sites under  DOD\u2019s Installation Restoration Program at active installations, including  those at NPL-listed installations. The Air Force set an even more stringent  deadline of 2012 for its sites, which Air Force officials have said is a  \u201cstretch goal\u201d imposed to ensure that the 2014 goal is met. These deadlines  were not based on evaluations of field conditions, and therefore do not  necessarily reflect remaining required cleanup actions. However, DOD\u2019s  use of these deadlines has acted as an incentive for DOD to proceed with  actions that have not been fully vetted with EPA and the public, according  to EPA officials. For example, EPA officials said that, under the pressure  of the 2012 deadline, McGuire AFB has proposed monitored natural  attenuation, which EPA has not approved, as a remedy for contaminated  groundwater at the installation despite not having performed required  analyses. EPA typically only approves monitored natural attenuation as a  remedy when certain conditions exist, such as a low potential for  contaminant migration and a time frame comparable to other methods of  remediation. EPA said DOD did not provide evidence of these conditions  to EPA, which is necessary for EPA to concur in the remedy selection, as  required by CERCLA. One consequence of this gap is that the public lacks  assurance that human health and the environment are adequately  protected by DOD\u2019s remedy.", "At installations with IAGs, the Site Management Plans include detailed  schedules and become part of the IAG, thus providing a legal basis for  when DOD must complete the work. Moreover, with IAGs to provide an  enforceable cleanup schedule, DOD must move forward with cleanup or  there will be consequences, such as penalties, for violating the terms of the  agreements. These legal obligations are a key factor in DOD\u2019s sequencing  of cleanup activities for funding. DOD officials told us that, in the early  1990s, the installations that had IAGs were moved to the top of the list for  funding, while other installations were considered a lower priority. Also,  DOD headquarters makes its funding decisions from budget requests  submitted by installations; therefore, if an installation does not have an  IAG and does not submit a request for funding for a particular  contaminated area, DOD does not consider it in its national funding  decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Contract Management Issues Have Undermined Cleanup Progress", "paragraphs": ["DOD contracting management issues have affected how the cleanup work  at the selected installations was scoped and conducted, placing effective  and efficient use of the public\u2019s resources at risk, and further undermining  cleanup progress. Specifically, two of the installations, Tyndall and Fort  Meade, have relied extensively on performance-based contracts (PBC) to  clean up installations. The third, McGuire, in 2008 awarded a PBC for 21  sites. However, PBCs can create pressure on contractors to operate within  price caps and meet deadlines, which may conflict with regulatory review  times and encourage DOD to take shortcuts. Both EPA and DOD officials  told us that PBCs may frequently be inappropriate for some Superfund  cleanup work\u2014particularly in the investigative stages\u2014since there can be  a great deal of uncertainty in these phases. For example, initial sampling  during a site investigation may lead to the need for extensive follow-up  sampling that was not anticipated and therefore not provided for in the  contract incentives.", "While the federal government has advocated the use of PBCs in recent  years for procurement of most services, federal acquisition regulations  generally requiring the use of PBCs specifically exclude engineering  services from this requirement. DOD policy directs the services to use  PBCs whenever possible\u2014establishing the goal that PBCs be used for 50  percent of service acquisitions\u2014but acknowledges that not all acquisitions  for services can be conducted using PBCs. According to federal  guidelines, PBCs are not generally appropriate for work that involves a  great deal of uncertainty concerning the parameters of the work to be  performed. For example, Air Force guidance establishes the first step in  using PBCs is to screen the particular project for suitability, noting that in  general, a PBC may not be the right approach when the site is poorly  characterized or the project would pose inordinately high risk to  contractors, among other characteristics. PBCs are generally better  suited to work that has highly prescribed goals, such as the provision of  food service or janitorial services. The general intent of PBCs is to allow  contractors to determine the best way to achieve specific goals within a  certain time frame for a fixed cost. When used in appropriate  circumstances, PBCs can reduce costs by allowing contractors flexibility  in how they provide the services.", "EPA officials cited a number of problems resulting from the use of PBCs  for cleanup at these three installations. One problem cited is that, when  PBCs are used, the contractor typically may not explore the full range of  alternatives during the remedial investigation and feasibility study due to  the pressure of PBC price caps to reduce the costs involved in developing  these alternatives. In addition, EPA officials said, the remedies or  proposals put forward by the PBCs tend to be those that do not require  construction, such as monitored natural attenuation for groundwater  contamination, in order to save money on the contract. For example, EPA  officials said that the sole PBC contractor for 21 DOD-designated sites at  McGuire AFB proposed in its contract a remedy of \u201cno further action\u201d for  soil, sediment, and groundwater for nearly all 21 sites, along with  monitored natural attenuation for groundwater at many of the sites; these  approaches to address contamination at the sites were proposed prior to  completing the remedial investigation, which would include a human and  ecological risk assessment, feasibility study, proposed plan, public  meeting, and ROD. In addition, EPA has specific guidelines on the  selection of monitored natural attenuation as a remedy.", "Other problems that EPA cited with using PBCs for environmental cleanup  work include    contractor\u2019s inability to carry out cleanup-related work required by EPA or  other stakeholders that was not contained in the original PBC contract,  such as installing monitoring wells, without contract amendment;    unrealistic time frames for cleanup work that have not been agreed to by  EPA or other stakeholders and that create an incentive for rushed work,  resulting in possible rework later on;    poor quality of documents submitted to EPA, including lack of legal  review and routine failure of the installation to perform quality reviews of  contractors\u2019 work, which EPA officials said were due to pressure to meet  the fixed price aspect of these contracts, and which result in significant  redrafting by EPA\u2019s legal staff; and    PBC contractors\u2014rather than DOD officials\u2014acting as project managers  to the point of decision making, rather than supporting DOD, when critical  cleanup decisions require interaction between EPA and DOD officials.", "In responding to a draft of this report, DOD noted that the department  believes it has successfully used PBCs for some environmental  remediation and munitions response activities. According to DOD, the  PBCs include identifiable and measurable costs, schedules, and outcomes,  such as acceptance by DOD and the regulatory agencies. DOD stated PBCs  can benefit DOD by    providing flexibility of scope, rather than prescriptive methods;    allowing DOD to benefit from the expertise and emerging technologies of  the private sector in solving problems during various phases of the  cleanup process;    ensuring cost control with known outcomes at the completion of the    encouraging contractors to look for ways to reduce time and cost.", "Nonetheless, Tyndall AFB officials told us that after shifting toward PBCs  for cleanup work in 2004, they are now migrating away from them because  there is too much uncertainty in the cleanup work needed at the base.

A contractor for Fort Meade building  military housing on the base\u2014as part of the Army\u2019s new national  privatized housing construction effort\u2014in 2003 discovered an old dump  site in the area of the new housing and near an existing elementary school.  Prior to construction, the Army Corps of Engineers prepared an  environmental baseline survey, but it was later determined that the Corps  apparently did not review key historical maps in the possession of Fort  Meade indicating a former dump and incinerator in the area. The Corps, in  conducting the survey, also apparently failed to use a relevant EPA report,  which provided an interpretation of historical aerial photographs to  identify potential hazards. According to Fort Meade documentation, once  the dump was discovered, the housing contractor attempted to determine  the limits of the dump and continued with construction, avoiding building  directly on top of the dump site. However, according to EPA officials, Fort  Meade did not involve EPA in these assessments prior to construction  after the dump was discovered. Nonetheless, EPA, which had an on-site  manager at the Fort Meade installation, was aware of the discovery of the  dump and did not assert a role in decisions about where to locate housing.  For example, EPA did not provide any written advice concerning the  matter to Fort Meade. After construction was completed and the housing  was occupied, methane fumes were found in 2004 below the ground in  soils adjacent to the 20 houses that were built nearest the dump site and  elementary school. The Army installed and operated a methane abatement  system but in 2005 determined that methane was reaching the homes, and  families were evacuated. These houses remain empty, and DOD is  monitoring both the houses and the school for methane gas intrusion into  indoor air. Thus far methane gas has not been found at an unacceptable  level in the school. In addition to methane, Fort Meade has documented  other contamination at the dump site, including volatile organic  compounds (VOC) in the groundwater, and heavy metals,  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and VOCs in soil. Fort Meade has since  prepared a preliminary assessment and site inspection(PA/SI) and a draft RI, which EPA has reviewed. While the Army has a policy requiring  that  the environmental conditions of properties be assessed, it is unclear  whether local Fort Meade officials were adequately involved in the  preconstruction assessment, which was performed by a contractor to the  Corps under the Army\u2019s national housing privatization initiative. While the  Army has acknowledged that the preconstruction assessment apparently  missed evidence pointing to the incinerator and dump, the Army has not  explained the source of the omission\u2014for example whether lack of  adherence to policy or shortcomings in coordination and review were  contributing factors.

In January 2009, Tyndall officials put forth  the option to EPA officials of dredging the DDT-contaminated sediments  from the bayou with the highest concentrations of contamination,  proposing to carry out this ecologically sensitive and potentially risky  action as a removal action for which Tyndall would not need concurrence  from EPA.

According to ATSDR officials,  ATSDR examined Tyndall records that said the lead shot was removed and  clean sand was deposited. As such, ATSDR based its assessment solely on  the soil sampling results from 1992, found the contamination below levels  of concern, and concurred with Tyndall taking no further action.

Following the request, ATSDR  notified its Air Force liaison, who then initiated the formal request on July  7, 2009.", "When asked about these events, Tyndall officials stated they had always  known lead shot could be there, and said they believed EPA also knew of  this potential.

In 1992, CERCLA and the DERP statute were  in effect and well-established, and since lead is a CERCLA hazardous  substance, DOD was legally required to conduct any response in  accordance with CERCLA and its standards. Thus, Tyndall officials either  left the lead shot in place with essentially no response other than to  reassure parents of the schoolchildren, or conducted a response outside of  CERCLA. While Tyndall officials now state that the lack of response with  respect to the lead shot itself was based on its belief that ATSDR found the  lead shot not to pose a health hazard, the ATSDR report was not issued  until 2000 while Tyndall decided not to conduct a response action years  earlier, in 1992.", "Regarding Tyndall\u2019s lack of action on the discovery of lead shot, Tyndall  officials did not take steps until 2009 to protect children from potential  exposure, despite their statements that they knew from 1992 forward that  lead shot could be present at the school, because they did not believe  there were any health risks. Tyndall officials further stated that they  believed the ATSDR health assessment found no health risk from the lead  shot. However, because ATSDR understood the lead shot had been  removed, the ATSDR assessment was based solely on the soil lead levels  reported by the Air Force to have been found in 1992 and did not address  any subsequent risks from the presence of lead shot after 1992 (e.g., from  direct contact and the possibility of increased soil levels from leaching).  Moreover, the ATSDR assessment had a narrow objective\u2014to evaluate the  potential human health effects associated with exposure to certain  environmental conditions at several areas on the base\u2014and was not  intended as a substitute for the CERCLA process, which provides for  investigations to determine whether a remedial action is required based on  both human health and the environment. For example, as ATSDR focused  on the likely exposure of children, it discounted certain soil samples with  lead levels above its screening values because the agency determined  children were unlikely to play in those areas; however, those samples are  relevant for CERCLA purposes.", "Finally, while Tyndall officials have not denied knowledge of the presence  of lead shot in the playground prior to June 2009 (when Tyndall reported  high lead levels in the soil), they were unable to identify or document  when base officials or contractors became aware of the lead shot and clay  target debris on the ground surface of the playground. Because Tyndall  failed to promptly notify EPA of the release observed prior to March 2009,  as required by the administrative cleanup order as well as the DERP  provisions of SARA, EPA did not have the information needed to ensure  Tyndall\u2019s actions were protective of the health of the schoolchildren.  Only at the urging of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the  Environment did the base conduct sampling, and only when the results  showed high levels of lead in soils did the base inform EPA of the lead  shot.

However, until the current  challenges\u2014including the lack of uniform measures for DOD and EPA to  report cleanup progress, the absence of IAGs at some installations, the  failure to disclose newly discovered contamination at some installations as  required by provisions in SARA, and the continued disagreement over  proposals for the use of monitored natural attenuation and other  nonconstruction remedies, and over DOD\u2019s use of PBCs\u2014are addressed,  delays in cleaning up these three installations will likely persist.", "Section 120 of CERCLA was enacted in 1986 amidst concerns that federal  facilities on the NPL were taking too long to get cleaned up and contained  key provisions aimed at eliminating stalemates, such as those that were  occurring over IAGs. Yet, the IAGs required by law are still outstanding at  several NPL installations after more than a decade of effort. While EPA is  charged with regulating cleanup of federal NPL sites, without IAGs and  lacking independent authority to enforce CERCLA, EPA has little leverage  to facilitate compliance at such sites. While EPA ultimately issued  administrative cleanup orders at these three installations under other  environmental laws, the agency is nonetheless limited in its ability to  enforce these orders because DOJ policy generally precludes bringing suit  on behalf of one federal agency against another.", "In the absence of the IAGs, EPA attempted to work with the services over  the past decade by offering technical support and in many cases  participating in informal meetings with DOD officials, while the services  provided numerous documents to EPA. However, we believe that these  interactions, while well intentioned, contributed to a less rigorous  approach that interfered with the collection of documents such as formal  approvals for the administrative record, and led to insufficient  communication between the agencies on significant issues such as risk  and approvals. Further, without the more predictable time frames as  would be provided with an IAG, EPA and DOD resorted to less formal  document review processes\u2014including a lack of clarity on document  review times and on whether agreements had been reached on key  decisions\u2014leading DOD to sometimes move forward in the cleanup  process without EPA\u2019s concurrence.

In its disagreement with  our recommendation that EPA pursue amendments to Executive Order  12580 if outstanding CERCLA section 120 IAGs are not negotiated  expeditiously, DOD suggested that we incorrectly characterized the entire  IAG process as flawed due to five outstanding site agreements that  represent more complex cleanup issues than most sites. However, we  disagree because while we acknowledge that IAGs have successfully been  entered into at most DOD NPL sites, DOD\u2019s refusal to enter into IAGs \u2014 required by CERCLA section 120\u2014for more than a decade at four of the  five sites nonetheless suggests, in our view, that there is a significant  problem requiring additional attention by the Administration. DOD  disagreed with our Matter for Congressional Consideration that Congress  consider amending section 120 of CERCLA to provide additional  enforcement authority to EPA because it believes EPA has adequate  existing means\u2014including informal tools such as interagency dispute  mechanisms, and statutory authorities\u2014to enforce cleanup requirements  at federal facilities without a negotiated IAG. However, we disagree with  DOD\u2019s position for a number of reasons. For example, despite the informal  tools pursued by EPA, a decade passed without negotiated IAGs at the  three installations. EPA then resorted to more formal means to attempt to  compel cleanup at these installations. Nonetheless, even when EPA  attempted to use its RCRA authority, DOD initially refused to comply with  RCRA cleanup orders issued by EPA at the three installations and is still in  noncompliance at one installation. Moreover, while EPA has remedy  selection authority under CERCLA, it has no enforceable schedule to  ensure DOD installations make progress on the technical steps leading up  to a remedy decision.

For this recommendation DOD agreed that it is vitally important to  track cleanup progress at its installations and to make that information  available to Congress and the public in a manner that is transparent  and easily understandable. DOD also discussed working actively with  EPA through a federal working group. However, DOD indicated that if  the working group decides a common metric is essential, DOD would  require that the metric meet DOD criteria, such as continuing use of  DOD\u2019s site level measure as compared to EPA\u2019s operating unit level of  measure, suggesting the agencies are unlikely to implement a uniform  method for reporting cleanup progress at the installations. We  continue to believe that such uniformity is essential to provide greater  assurance that cleanup progress is being measured accurately and  consistently across all Superfund sites, and to provide for transparency  to Congress and the public. An agency may need more detailed  information for management purposes, but information comparable to  other Superfund sites is essential to providing adequate transparency.  2.  DOD disagreed with our recommendation that EPA pursue  amendments to Executive Order 12580 to condition delegation of  CERCLA authorities to DOD on the existence of a signed IAG. DOD  stated that because all but 5 of the 141 IAGs remain in negotiation,  DOD should maintain lead agency CERCLA authority so it can  continue executing cleanup actions pending resolution of any IAG  issues and indicated its intention to sign the remaining 5 IAGs using as  a template an IAG between the Army and EPA for Fort Eustis, Virginia,  as has been agreed upon by the agencies. However, given that 4  remaining agreements have been pending for over a decade, we  continue to believe that outstanding CERCLA Section 120 IAGs need to  be negotiated expeditiously and that amendments to Executive Order  12580 could facilitate such action.  3.  For this recommendation, the Deputy Under Secretary agreed that  proper notification of new releases that exceed statutory thresholds  and significant new information about previously known releases is  necessary. DOD noted that DOD guidance on this issue is already in  existence; however, GAO reviewed these documents during the  engagement and found them to lack adequate specificity for use by  installation personnel, particularly in the area of new information  about previous releases.

When we asked why, installation personnel stated they  were not required to provide regulators with such information. For  example, our report highlights an example of Tyndall\u2019s failure to notify  EPA about the presence of lead\u2014a hazardous substance under  CERCLA\u2014at the Tyndall elementary school, and failure to take action  to prevent children\u2019s exposure to lead shot, among other issues.  4.  For this recommendation, DOD agreed and referenced its policy.", "However, our review found inconsistencies in how this policy was  interpreted. While federal guidelines indicate that performance-based  contracts (PBC) are not generally appropriate for work that involves a  great deal of uncertainty, officials from the Army told us that in their  view, PBCs are better suited for complex work because they foster  innovation from the private sector. DOD policy directs the services to  use PBCs whenever possible\u2014establishing the goal that PBCs be used  for 50 percent of service acquisitions. Nonetheless, Tyndall AFB  officials told us that after shifting toward PBCs for cleanup work in  2004, they are no longer using them for new contracts because of the  uncertainty in the cleanup work needed at the base.  5.  For this recommendation, DOD agreed and referenced its DERP  guidance, which outlines the process for developing and proposing  remedies. The guidance, however, does not provide specific  requirements regarding monitored natural attenuation. As DOD notes,  when DOD selects monitored natural attenuation as its remedy, DOD  is to present the basis for its selection in a ROD or proposed plan.  However, DOD and its contractors are not uniformly demonstrating  that EPA\u2019s specific criteria for selection of monitored natural  attenuation are met before selecting such a remedial alternative,  according to EPA. These criteria require that certain conditions exist  such as a low potential for contaminant migration and a time frame  comparable to other methods of remediation.  6.  The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense disagreed with our Matter for  Congressional Consideration, in which we suggested that Congress  should consider amending section 120 of CERCLA to authorize EPA to  administratively impose penalties to enforce cleanup requirements at  federal facilities without a negotiated CERCLA interagency agreement.  DOD presented several reasons for its position, including its belief that  EPA has existing statutory enforcement tools under the Resources  Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act  (SDWA). However, there is little evidence that these other mechanisms  have been effective.  For example, in 2007 EPA issued administrative  cleanup orders under RCRA at all three installations that the services  disagreed with and they all initially refused to comply while DOD sought  DOJ review of the orders\u2019 validity. The orders stated that an imminent  and substantial endangerment from contamination may be present on  the sites and required DOD to notify EPA of its intent to comply and  clean up. The Air Force and Army did not notify EPA of their intent to  comply with the order within the time frame required and stated they  would continue to clean up the sites under their CERCLA removal and  lead agency authority. After DOJ issued a letter stating its opinion that  EPA had the authority to issue the orders, as a matter of law, the Army  informed EPA of its intent to comply and initiated work under RCRA at  Fort Meade, while the Air Force did not take similar actions for its  installations. Subsequent negotiations between DOD and EPA resulted  in IAGs at Fort Meade and McGuire AFB. However, at Tyndall AFB,  where there is still no signed IAG, DOD continues to refuse to comply  with the RCRA order. In regards to SDWA, we recognize there can be  installations with contamination that do not threaten a public water  supply, and therefore SDWA would not apply. DOD also commented  that EPA has authority to negotiate administrative penalties in IAGs  under CERCLA and that existing IAGS include stipulated penalties.  However, as we stated previously, several of the most challenging sites  do not yet have IAGs, including Tyndall AFB. For more than a decade  DOD has failed to enter into IAGs required by CERCLA section 120 to  clean up DOD National Priorities List (NPL) sites. As we note in our  report, without an IAG EPA lacks the mechanisms to ensure that  cleanup by an installation proceeds expeditiously, is properly done, and  has public input, as required by CERCLA. We disagree that providing  EPA with the authority to issue CERCLA penalties at facilities without  an IAG will be a disincentive to EPA\u2019s negotiating interagency  agreements. EPA has stated on numerous occasions its commitment to  complete negotiations for such agreements. Finally, DOD noted that  EPA has remedy selection authority at NPL installations regardless of  whether the installation has a signed IAG. Despite having authority for  choosing a final cleanup remedy, EPA has not been able to force  progress toward remedy selection because it has no enforceable  schedule to ensure DOD installations make progress on the technical  steps leading up to the ROD, which documents the remedy selected for  cleanup. Hence, as at the three installations reviewed in this report,  installations may not complete cleanup for a decade or more without an  IAG. We believe our report demonstrates that EPA has experienced  considerable difficulty employing its existing enforcement authorities  and that DOD has resisted EPA\u2019s use of such authority to compel DOD  to enter into IAGs at NPL sites. Hence, we continue to assert that an  expansion in EPA\u2019s enforcement authority is warranted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Diane B.

The docket is a listing of all federal  facilities that have reported hazardous waste activities under RCRA or CERCLA. RCRA  and CERCLA require federal agencies to submit to EPA information on their facilities that  generate, transport, store, or dispose of hazardous waste or that has had some type of  hazardous substance release or spill. EPA updates the docket periodically.", "The lead agency (DOD, in this case) conducts a preliminary assessment of the site by  reviewing existing information, such as facility records, to determine whether hazardous  substance contamination is present and poses a potential threat to public health or the  environment. EPA regions review these preliminary assessments to determine whether  the information is sufficient to the likelihood of a hazardous substance release, a  contamination pathway, and potential receptors. EPA regions are encouraged to complete  their review of preliminary assessments of federal facility sites listed in EPA\u2019s CERCLA  database within 18 months of the date the site was listed on the federal docket. EPA may  determine the site does not pose a significant threat to human health or the environment  and no further action is required.

EPA reviews the site inspection report  and, if it determines the release poses no significant threat, EPA may eliminate it from  further consideration. If EPA determines that hazardous substances, pollutants, or  contaminants have been released at the site, EPA will use the information collected during  the preliminary assessment and site inspection to calculate a preliminary HRS score.", "If EPA determines that a significant hazardous substance release has occurred, the EPA  region prepares an HRS scoring package. EPA\u2019s HRS assesses the potential of a release  to threaten human health or the environment by assigning a value to factors such as (1)  the likelihood that a hazardous release has occurred; (2) the characteristics of the waste,  such as toxicity and the amount; and (3) people or sensitive environments affected by the  release.", "If the release scores an HRS score of 28.50 or higher, EPA determines whether to  propose the site for placement on the NPL. CERCLA requires EPA to update the NPL at  least once a year.", "Within 6 months after EPA places a site on the NPL, the lead agency (DOD, in this case)  is required to begin a remedial investigation and feasibility study to assess the nature and  extent of the contamination. The remedial investigation and feasibility study process  includes the collection of data on site conditions, waste characteristics, and risks to human  health and the environment; the development of remedial alternatives; and testing and  analysis of alternative cleanup methods to evaluate their potential effectiveness and  relative cost. EPA, and frequently the state, provides oversight during the remedial  investigation and feasibility study and the development of a proposed plan, which outlines  a preferred cleanup alternative. After a public comment period on the proposed plan, EPA  and the federal facility sign a record of decision (ROD) that documents the selected  remedial action cleanup objectives, the technologies to be used during cleanup, and the  analysis supporting the remedy selection.", "Within 6 months of EPA\u2019s review of DOD\u2019s remedial investigation and feasibility study,  CERCLA, as amended, requires that DOD enter into an IAG with EPA for the expeditious  completion of all remedial action at the facility. (EPA\u2019s policy however, is for federal  facilities to enter into an IAG after EPA places the site on the NPL.) The IAG is an  enforceable document that must contain, at a minimum, three provisions: (1) a review of  remedial alternatives and the selection of the remedy by DOD and EPA, or remedy  selection by EPA if agreement is not reached; (2) schedules for completion of each  remedy; and (3) arrangements for the long-term operation and maintenance of the facility.", "During the remedial design and remedial action process, the lead agency (DOD, in this  case) develops and implements a permanent remedy on the site as outlined in the record  of decision and IAG.", "Long-term monitoring occurs at every site following construction of the remedial action.

The purpose of a 5-year review, similar to long-term monitoring, is to assure that the  remedy continues to meet the requirements contained in the record of decision and is  protective of human health and the environment."], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
