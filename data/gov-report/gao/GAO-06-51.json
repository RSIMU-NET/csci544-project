According to officials, IRS made a strategic decision to reduce others to accommodate budget cuts. IRS's processing of returns and refunds went smoothly. Accuracy of responses to telephone inquiries about tax law and about taxpayers' accounts significantly improved. And, IRS's Web site performed well. On the other hand, in response to budget cuts, IRS reduced access to telephone assistors, resulting in longer wait-times and more callers hanging up. IRS officials viewed telephone access as a more flexible area for absorbing budget cuts than, for example, processing. The number of taxpayers visiting IRS walk-in sites continued to decline, while the number of tax returns prepared at volunteer sites increased. This is consistent with IRS's strategy of reducing the number of its employees providing expensive face-to-face assistance. IRS continues to lack reliable data on the accuracy of walk-in and volunteer site assistance but has plans in place to improve quality measurement. For the first time, more than half of individual tax returns were filed electronically, which is important because electronic filing has allowed IRS to reduce resources devoted to processing paper returns. However, despite IRS's actions to promote electronic filing, it is not on track to achieve its long-term goal of having 80 percent of such returns filed electronically by 2007. State mandated electronic filing has proven effective at encouraging electronic filing at the federal level and one IRS advisory group has recommended a federal mandate. However, little is known about the costs and burdens of such mandates. IRS has been developing long-term goals to help assess agency progress and understand the impact of budget decisions. Because of the difficulty in developing goals, IRS has experienced delays and lacks a schedule for finalizing those goals. IRS is taking numerous actions to assist taxpayers affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Most of the impact on IRS, such as more questions from taxpayers, will be felt during the 2006 filing season and beyond."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the filing season most taxpayers have their only contact with the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by filing their individual income tax returns,  receiving refunds, and, if needed, seeking assistance.

These state mandates have  contributed to an increase in electronic filing of not only state tax returns,  but of federal individual tax returns as well.

IRS has  nearly eliminated this practice, which pulled the staff away from  performing enforcement work, and instead hired more full-time staff to  cover the workload during the filing season.", "To prevent the newly expanded walk-in staff from experiencing downtime  after the filing season, when the workload drops off, since fiscal year 2004,  IRS began having walk-in staff perform some collections work after the filing season. For example, between October and July 2005, IRS used 53 of  its 602 total direct FTEs (9 percent) to handle this collections work.  According to IRS officials, this has provided sufficient work to keep walk- in staff productive all year and greatly reduced dependence on  enforcement staff. Besides regulating the filing season workload, IRS  officials stated that handling these individual taxpayer collection cases at  walk-in sites could help them address overdue collections that, in their  view, may be overlooked by the normal collections process.", "Some IRS officials question moving collections work out of the normal  collection process because IRS lacks information about the effectiveness  of conducting such work using walk-in site staff. According to IRS officials,  IRS will have a reporting system in January 2006 that will allow it to analyze  the results of that work and compare it to normal collection results to  determine the most effective place to do the work. IRS is on schedule for  implementing this system, according to IRS officials. Furthermore, IRS is  reevaluating the services provided at walk-in sites, including collections  work.", "IRS lacks reliable and comprehensive data on the quality of the services  provided at walk-in sites. In 2004, IRS began implementing a program to  collect data on the quality of services provided to taxpayers at walk-in  sites, and we noted concerns with the reliability of the data due to the  collection method. Under this program, managers directly observe a  sample of employee interactions with taxpayers. We were concerned that  employees\u2019 performance could be influenced by the knowledge that they  are being observed by managers, biasing the sample results. Also, IRS  found that managers were not consistently coding employee performance.  As a result, we and TIGTA have stated that the quality review program  used to monitor walk-in sites does not provide reliable data and made  recommendations intended to improve quality measurement.", "To obtain reliable and comprehensive data on the quality of services  provided, IRS is implementing Contact Recording at walk-in sites, which is  similar to the method used for IRS\u2019s telephone service, whereby IRS  employee and taxpayer interactions will be recorded and reviewed later by  managers. IRS piloted Contact Recording at a small number of walk-in  sites, ending in July 2005, and decided to continue implementation.", "The results of the Contact Recording pilot and the current direct  observation method are quite different. According to IRS officials, Contact  Recording results showed quality to be significantly worse than the results  from the direct observation method. However, IRS is not scheduled to  fully implement Contact Recording at walk-in sites until December 2007.  Until that occurs, IRS will lack reliable and comprehensive data. While IRS  appears to be on schedule based on its implementation plan for Contact  Recording, it has previously experienced delays implementing other parts  of its quality review program. In fact, in a previous report we made a  recommendation to help ensure that IRS addresses the causes of past  delays in implementing its quality program at walk-in sites.", "For 2006, IRS asked TIGTA to assess the accuracy of tax law assistance,  one service offered at walk-in sites. The results of TIGTA\u2019s requested  assessment of tax law assistance would be unreliable because sites they  covered would be selected judgmentally and the results could not be  projected to all sites. Also, IRS will continue to lack data on the other  services it provides, namely account assistance and return preparation.", "In addition to the lack of reliable data on quality, IRS lacks complete data  on what kind of services these sites should offer. As TIGTA and the  National Taxpayer Advocate have noted, IRS lacks accurate and complete  management information on walk-in sites. For example, TIGTA reported  that (1) IRS has limited information on the exact numbers and types of  services provided at IRS\u2019s walk-in sites as well as information on what kind  of face-to-face service taxpayers need or want and (2) the lack of  information hinders IRS\u2019s ability to make appropriate decisions about the  locations and services it provides taxpayers.

Ensuring quality service at volunteer sites is  important because not only does IRS provide assistance to volunteer sites,  but IRS actively promotes volunteer sites as an alternative for face-to-face  services at its walk-in sites. Furthermore, we and TIGTA have reported  concerns about the quality of return preparation assistance provided at  volunteer sites and have made recommendations to remedy the concerns,  some of which date back to 2000. More recently, a TIGTA official told us  that that while improvements have been made at volunteer sites, continued  effort is needed to ensure the accuracy of services provided.", "IRS recognized the data quality problems and proposed a strategy to  address them, but there is still insufficient data to determine the quality of  services provided. As part of IRS\u2019s strategy for improving quality at  volunteer sites, it developed three methods to monitor quality during the  2005 filing season--observation reviews, site reviews, and mystery  shopping. However, IRS halted its use of observation reviews immediately  after starting due to concerns raised by the National Taxpayer Advocate  and some partner organizations that observation reviews violate taxpayer  privacy and unfairly target low-income taxpayers. IRS maintained its two  other methods, but according to IRS officials, neither of these methods are  as comprehensive as the observation method in following the process  volunteers used to prepare returns, such as appropriate probing techniques  to acquire dependency information from taxpayers. Furthermore, IRS  conducted only 14 of the proposed 100 mystery shopping visits, which did  not provide sufficient results. As a result, the methods used to collect data  on quality at volunteer sites were inadequate for monitoring and evaluating  quality at volunteer sites in 2005.", "IRS has proposed conducting return reviews instead of observational  reviews for the 2006 filing season. During each site review, IRS officials  plan to select three tax returns to examine by comparing a taxpayer\u2019s  return against their supporting tax-related documents, as well as other  information obtained by the volunteers, to determine the accuracy of the  return. According to IRS officials, IRS has consulted with several partner  groups participating in the volunteer program about the return reviews.", "The partners did not express the same concerns with return reviews as  those they had with observation reviews.", "IRS intends to use return reviews, along with site and mystery shopping  reviews, in an implementation plan for the 2006 filing season as part of its  strategy to monitor and evaluate quality of return preparation at volunteer  sites.

The substantial increase  in IRS\u2019s performance for the ETLA program this year is due to the fact that  IRS received significantly fewer questions than last year, which allowed it  to improve its timeliness and accuracy in responding to those questions.  IRS received fewer questions because it kept the ETLA function at the  same, less prominent location on the Web site that it was moved to last  year. As we reported last year, IRS moved the ETLA function on its Web site  to a less prominent location in the middle of the filing season last year.
