Although FAA's authority to address some of these challenges related to FCAAs is limited, FAA has been addressing many of them. For example, FAA has created a certification management team with its three major bilateral partners to provide a forum for addressing approval process challenges, among other issues. FAA has also taken action to mitigate the challenges related to some BASAs by holding regular meetings with bilateral partners and adding dispute resolution procedures to some BASAs.", "Reported FAA-related challenges primarily involved (1) FAA's process for facilitating approval applications, which sometimes delayed the submission of applications to FCAAs; (2) limited availability of FAA staff for facilitating approval applications; and (3) lack of FAA staff expertise in issues unique to foreign approvals, such as intellectual property concerns and export control laws. FAA has initiatives under way to improve its process that may help resolve some of these challenges raised by U.S. companies.

As you know, among its responsibilities for aviation safety, FAA  grants approvals (called type certificates) for new aircraft, engines, and  propellers. Studies published since 1980, our prior work, industry  stakeholders, and experts have long raised questions about the efficiency  of FAA\u2019s certification processes and varying interpretations and  applications of its regulations in making certification decisions. Over time,  FAA has implemented efforts to address these issues, but as we reported  in July 2014, they persist as FAA faces greater industry demand and its  overall workload has increased. The 2012 FAA Modernization and  Reform Act required FAA to work with industry to resolve these issues.  In response, in April 2012, FAA chartered two aviation rulemaking  committees\u2014one to address certification processes (the Certification  Process Committee) and another to address regulatory consistency (the  Regulatory Consistency Committee)\u2014which recommended  improvements in 2012. In 2013, FAA published an implementation plan  for addressing the six certification process recommendations and stated it  would publish an implementation plan for addressing the six regulatory  consistency recommendations at a later date. As we previously reported  in July 2014, FAA\u2019s current efforts to improve these processes are aimed  at (1) improving its decision-making process for issuing certificates, (2)  keeping pace with emerging technology, and (3) enabling industry growth  and innovation. We previously concluded that it will be critical for FAA to  follow through with reforms to its certification processes to meet industry\u2019s  future needs. We have also recommended that FAA develop a  continuous evaluative process with performance goals and measures to  determine the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s actions to improve its  certification processes.", "FAA also approves foreign aviation products that are manufactured in other countries for  use in the United States as a result of sales to U.S. customers. and safety. In 2012, the U.S. aerospace industry contributed $118.5  billion in export sales to the U.S. economy, with this sector remaining  strong in the European markets and growing in the emerging markets of  Asia and the Middle East. Internationally, according to the General  Aviation Manufacturers Association, the U.S. has historically been  viewed as setting the global standard for the approval of aviation  products. In fact, some countries accept the FAA approval outright as  evidence that the product is safe for use in their country. Some other  countries, however, do not accept the FAA certification and conduct their  own approval processes for U.S. products, which can be lengthy,  according to U.S. industry stakeholders. These stakeholders have raised  concerns that such practices provide no additional safety benefit and  result in U.S. companies facing uncertainty and costly delays in delivering  their products to foreign markets.", "This testimony discusses (1) FAA\u2019s progress in implementing the aviation  rulemaking committees\u2019 recommendations regarding its certification  process and the consistency of its regulatory interpretations and (2) the  challenges, if any, that selected U.S. companies reported they have faced  when attempting to obtain foreign approvals of their products, and how  FAA is addressing some of the reported challenges.

We also interviewed 15 of  the approximately 288 U.S. companies that submitted applications for  foreign approvals\u2014these companies submitted about 34 percent of the  roughly 1,500 applications to foreign countries from January 2012 through  November 2014. We selected these 15 U.S. companies to interview  primarily on the basis of the number of approval applications submitted  and to represent a diversity of aviation product types (e.g., engines, large  airplanes, small airplanes, rotorcraft, propellers, and parts). Because the  15 companies represent a non-generalizable sample, their views cannot  be attributed to all U.S. company applicants. We determined that the FAA  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing information on  the approximate number of approval applications, types of products for  which approvals were typically sought, and for selecting U.S. companies  to interview. This determination was based on consultation with FAA  officials responsible for overseeing the data. We also conducted  interviews with FAA headquarters and field staff and other industry  stakeholders\u2014including representatives of the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) and U.S. aviation stakeholder groups. In order to  better understand whether the challenges faced by U.S. aviation  companies are unique or more commonly faced by aviation companies  worldwide, we also interviewed representatives of three foreign aviation  companies. Our selection was based on the company being a known  importer of aviation products into the United States, as well as based on  the type of product they produced.

In doing  so, FAA is also responsible for working with a FCAA in an authority- to-authority capacity, and communications should flow through FAA to  the applicant company. However, representatives of five companies  noted that due to a lack of FAA travel funds, FAA staff is generally not  able to attend key meetings between U.S. companies and FCAAs  conducted at the beginning of the foreign approval process. These  representatives noted that this can complicate the process for  companies, which then have to take on a larger role in defending the  original type certificate issued for a product. Representatives of two  companies also noted that when there is limited FAA staff availability  at the time a foreign approval application is received that it contributes  to delays in obtaining their approvals. Industry stakeholders have  continued to suggest that FAA should more thoroughly utilize its  delegation authority in several areas to better utilize available FAA  resources. In fact, the Certification Process Committee made  recommendations to encourage FAA to include the expansion of  delegation in its efforts for improving the efficiency of its certification  process. FAA\u2019s initiatives related to expanding the use of delegation  appear to be moving in the right direction, but FAA\u2019s efforts have been  slower than industry would like and has expected.", "Staff expertise. Some of the U.S. companies in our selection (7 out of  15) reported issues related to FAA staff expertise. These cited issues  included limited experience on the part of FAA staff in dispute  resolution as well as limited expertise related to intellectual property  and export control laws. For example, representatives of three  companies told us that FAA staff sometimes lack technical knowledge  due to having little to no experience with some aviation products,  while a representative of another company argued that increased  training for FAA staff in dispute resolution could be very helpful,  especially for disputes involving different cultural norms. In another  example, representatives of two companies described situations in  which FAA staff was ready to share information with a FCAA that the  applicant company considered proprietary until the company objected  and other solutions were found."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Initiatives to Address Challenges", "paragraphs": ["FAA has initiatives under way aimed at improving its process for  supporting foreign approvals that may help address some of the  challenges raised by the U.S. companies in our review. Specifically,  FAA\u2019s current efforts to increase the efficiency of its foreign approval  process could help address reported challenges related to FAA\u2019s process  and its limited staff and financial resources. For example, FAA is planning  to address its resource limitations by focusing on improving the efficiency  of its process with such actions as increasing international activities to  support U.S. interests in global aviation, and by implementing its 2018  strategic plan, which includes the possibility of allocating more resources  to strengthening international relationships.", "FAA has also initiated efforts to improve the robustness of its data on  foreign approvals, to in turn further improve the efficiency of its process  for supporting these approvals. With more complete data, FAA aims to  track performance metrics such as average timeframes for foreign  approvals and to better evaluate FAA\u2019s relationships with bilateral  partners. As previously mentioned, in 2012, FAA started tracking data on  foreign approval packages received and processed. In addition, according  to FAA officials, FAA currently tracks the time needed from initial receipt  of a foreign approval application by an ACO to the date the application is  forwarded to the FCAA. However, currently, there is no formal written  requirement for FAA field staff to enter foreign approval application  information into the central tracking system, so not all applications are  captured. FAA officials told us in December 2014 that the agency is  developing formal requirements for field staff to enter data into this  system, in order to ensure the integrity of data within its control, but they  did not provide an expected time frame for completion. According to FAA  staff in one field office, Aircraft Certification\u2019s International Policy Office\u2014 which manages the central data system\u2014recently updated this system  with additional data fields to capture more data on the number of foreign  approval projects in process and data for tracking performance metrics.", "As previously mentioned, FAA collects Bilateral Relationship  Management (BRM) forms as a method for field staff to relay information  on specific foreign approval projects\u2014both positive and negative  experiences\u2014to headquarters. Based on discussions with us regarding  policies related to BRM submissions, FAA officials told us that they plan  to clarify BRM submission criteria and response policies for field and  headquarters staff to enhance information gathered through this process.", "According to FAA, collecting, sharing, and taking appropriate action on  information in BRM forms is necessary for FAA to recognize and resolve  issues. Initially, FAA officials indicated that field staff is required to submit  BRM forms whenever an employee meets with an official from a FCAA or  foreign company, but that other issues can trigger the submission of BRM  forms, such as when the FCAA is not adhering to the BASA, or is not  actively engaged in certification activities. FAA officials also said that  designated headquarters officials are required to respond to all BRM  forms received within 48 hours.", "However, FAA officials at four ACOs we interviewed told us that field staff  does not consistently submit BRM forms, and that when staff does submit  BRM forms, field staff generally does not receive feedback from FAA  headquarters about the information received in the form. For example,  one ACO official indicated that his office\u2019s staff is only likely to submit the  BRM form when there is a significant issue regarding an ongoing foreign  approval package, and not to report any positive outcomes or  circumstances. Further, the official said that the Aircraft Certification\u2019s  International Policy Office does not provide feedback on issues raised in  these forms. Two officials from a different ACO indicated that the  submission of BRM forms varies greatly by project manager, with some  managers submitting these routinely whereas others do not submit them  at all; these officials also indicated that their staff do not typically receive  feedback from headquarters on submitted forms. After hearing about  these concerns about the BRM process raised by field staff, FAA  headquarters officials indicated that they plan to clarify to field staff when  BRM forms should be submitted and also clarify to designated  headquarters staff that each BRM form requires feedback to the  submitting field staff, but they did not provide an expected time frame for  completion. These planned efforts should help improve the robustness  and completeness of data shared in BRM forms.", "Some current FAA efforts to collect additional data on foreign approvals  are aimed at improving FAA\u2019s ability to evaluate its relationships with its  bilateral partners; such efforts could help to address domestic challenges  raised by companies about FAA not having performance metrics to  assess how well BASAs are working. For example, according to FAA  officials, in November 2013, Aircraft Certification formally expanded its  process for evaluating international partners to include risk-based  evaluation methods. Officials noted that this evaluation process includes  gathering quantitative and qualitative information about the effectiveness  of bilateral partnerships. Officials explained that FAA uses a structured  process to evaluate and to establish a risk factor for each foreign bilateral  partner, based on information in the BRM forms, the number of foreign  approval projects the respective authority has within FAA\u2019s system, and  the authority\u2019s most recent ICAO airworthiness score, among other  factors. FAA officials said that this evaluation system will continue to  expand as FAA identifies new data sources.", "In conclusion, to its credit, FAA has made some progress in addressing  the Certification Process and Regulatory Consistency Committees\u2019  recommendations, as well as in taking steps to address challenges faced  by U.S. aviation companies in obtaining foreign approvals of their  products. It will be critically important for FAA to follow through with its  current and planned initiatives to increase the efficiency and consistency  of its certification processes, and its efforts to address identified  challenges faced by U.S. companies in obtaining foreign approvals. Given  the importance of U.S. aviation exports to the overall U.S. economy,  forecasts for continued growth of aviation exports, and the expected  increase in FAA\u2019s workload over the next decade, it is essential that FAA  undertake these initiatives to ensure it can meet industry\u2019s future needs.  To demonstrate that it is making progress on these important initiatives, it  is also important that FAA continue to develop and refine its outcome- based performance measures to determine what is actually being  achieved through the current and future initiatives, and also through  improvements to its data tracking for monitoring the effectiveness of its  bilateral agreements and partnerships. Such outcome-based metrics will  make it easier for FAA to determine the overall outcomes of its actions  and relationships, hold field and headquarters staff accountable for the  results, and demonstrate to industry stakeholders, congressional  stakeholders, and others that progress is being made.", "Going forward, we will continue to monitor FAA\u2019s progress, highlight the  key challenges that remain, and the steps FAA and industry can take to  find a way forward on the issues covered in this statement as well as  other issues facing the industry. As we noted in our October 2013  statement, however, some improvements to the certification processes  will likely take years to implement and, therefore, will require a sustained   We are hopeful that our  commitment as well as congressional oversight.findings related to previous and ongoing work in these areas will continue  to assist this Committee and its Subcommittee on Aviation as they  develop the framework for the next FAA reauthorization act.", "Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
