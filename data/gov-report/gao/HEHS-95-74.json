Federal agencies were prohibited from imposing burdensome reporting requirements and, for many of the block grants, states were allowed to establish their own program reporting formats. However, some data collection and reporting requirements were contained in each of the block grants as a way to ensure some federal oversight in the administration of block grants.

Block grant allocations were initially based on allocations under the prior categorical programs and were not sensitive to relative need, cost of providing services, or states\u2019 ability to pay, posing concerns regarding their equity. Steps have been taken to improve program accountability, but problems such as noncomparable data persist.

Moreover, states reported that reduced federal application and reporting requirements had a positive effect on their management of block grant programs. In addition, some state agencies were able to make more productive use of their staffs as personnel devoted less time to federal administrative requirements and more time to state-level program activities.", "Although states reported management efficiencies under the block grants, they also experienced increased grant management responsibilities because they had greater program flexibility and responsibility. It is not possible to measure the net effect of these changes in state responsibilities on the level of states\u2019 administrative costs.

Together, these approaches helped states replace much of the funding reductions during the first several years. For example, some states carried over funding from the prior categorical programs. This was possible because many prior categorical grants were project grants that extended into fiscal year 1982. States also offset federal funding reductions through transfers among block grants. The 13 states transferred about $125 million among the block grants in 1982 and 1983. About $112 million, or 90 percent, entailed moving funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Block Grant to the Social Services Block Grant. The transfer option was used infrequently between other block grants, although it was allowed for most. States also used their own funds to help offset reduced federal funding, but only for certain block grants.

For alcohol and drug abuse programs, funds had to be distributed in the same proportions as in fiscal year 1980.", "Today, most block grants use formulas that more heavily weigh beneficiary population and other need-based factors. For example, the Community Development Block Grant uses a formula that reflects poverty, overcrowding, age of housing, and other measures of urban deterioration. The formula for the Job Training Partnership Act Block Grant considers unemployment levels and the number of economically disadvantaged people in the state.

However, states stepped in and assumed a greater role in oversight of the programs, consistent with the block grant philosophy. The 13 states we visited generally reported that they were maintaining their level of effort for data collection as under the prior categorical grants. States tailored their efforts to better meet their own planning, budgetary, and legislative needs. Given their new management responsibilities, states sometimes increased reporting requirements for local service providers.", "However, the Congress, which maintained interest in the use of federal funds, had limited information on program activities, services delivered, and clients served. This was because there were fewer federal reporting requirements, and states were given the flexibility to determine what and how to report program information. Due to the lack of comparability of information across states, state-by-state comparisons were difficult. In response to this situation, model criteria and standardized forms were developed in 1984 to help states collect uniform data, primarily through voluntary cooperative efforts by the states. However, continued limitations in data comparability reduced the usefulness of the data to serve the needs of federal policymakers, such as for allocating federal funds, determining the magnitude of needs among individual states, and comparing program effectiveness among states.", "Just as with data collection and reporting, the Congress became concerned about financial accountability in the federal financial assistance provided to state and local entities. With the passage of the 1984 Single Audit Act, the Congress promoted more uniform, entitywide audit coverage than was achieved under the previous grant-by-grant audit approach. We have found the single audit approach has contributed to improving financial management practices in state and local governments. Systems for tracking federal funds have been improved, administrative controls over federal programs have been strengthened, and oversight of entities receiving federal funds has increased. However, the single audit process is not well designed to assist federal agencies in program oversight, according to our 1994 review.", "To illustrate, we found limitations with the usefulness of single audit reports. For example, reports do not have to be issued until 13 months after the end of the audit period, which many federal and state program managers found too late to be useful. In addition, managers are not required to report on the adequacy of their internal control structures, which would assist auditors in evaluating the entity\u2019s management of its programs. In addition, the results of the audits are not being summarized or compiled so that oversight officials and program managers can easily access and analyze them to gain programwide perspectives and identify leads for follow-on audit work or program oversight.

This trend reduced state flexibility. Many of these restrictions were imposed because of congressional concern that states were not adequately meeting national needs.", "In nine block grants, from fiscal years 1983 and 1991, the Congress added new cost ceilings and set-asides or changed existing ones 58 times.Thirteen of these amendments added new cost ceilings or set-asides to 9 of 11 block grants we reviewed. Between fiscal years 1983 and 1991, the portion of funds restricted under set-asides increased in three block grants (Maternal and Child Health Services; Community Development, and Education).

First, there clearly is a need to focus on accountability for results, and the Government Performance and Results Act may provide such a framework. Second, funding allocations based on distributions under prior categorical programs may be inequitable because they do not reflect need, ability to pay, and variations in the cost of providing services. Finally, states handled the transition to the 1981 block grants, but today\u2019s challenges are likely to be greater. The programs being considered for inclusion in block grants not only are much larger but also, in some cases, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which provides cash assistance to the poor, are fundamentally different from those programs included in the 1981 block grants.

Paradoxically, accountability may be critical to preserving state autonomy. When adequate program information is lacking, the 1981 block grant experience demonstrates that the Congress may become more prescriptive. For example, funding constraints were added that limited state flexibility, and, in effect, \u201crecategorized\u201d some of the block grants.", "Across the government, we have recommended a shift in focus of federal management and accountability toward program results and outcomes, with correspondingly less emphasis on inputs and rigid adherence to rules.This focus on outcomes is particularly appropriate for block grants, given their emphasis on providing states flexibility in determining the specific problems they wish to address and the strategies they plan to employ to address those problems. The flexibility block grants allow should be reflected in the kinds of national information collected by federal agencies. The Congress and agencies will need to decide the kinds and nature of information needed to assess program results.", "While the requirements in the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (P.L. 103-62) apply to all federal programs, they also offer an accountability framework for block grants. Consistent with the philosophy underlying block grants, GPRA seeks to shift the focus of federal management and accountability away from a preoccupation with inputs, such as budget and staffing levels, and adherence to rigid processes to a greater focus on outcomes and results. GPRA is in its early stages of implementation, but by the turn of the century, annual reporting under this act is expected to fill key information needs. Among other things, GPRA requires every agency to establish indicators of performance, set annual performance goals, and report on actual performance, in comparison with these goals, each March beginning in the year 2000. Agencies are now developing strategic plans (to be submitted by Sept. 30, 1997) articulating the agency\u2019s mission, goals, and objectives preparatory to meeting these reporting requirements.", "In addition, although the single audit process is not well designed to assist federal agencies in program oversight, we believe that it is an appropriate means of promoting financial accountability for block grants, particularly if our recommended improvements are implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equitable Funding Formulas Reflect Need and Ability to Pay", "paragraphs": ["The Congress will need to make tough decisions on block grant funding formulas.

Practices such as \u201coff-budget\u201d transactions could obscure the long-term impact of program costs in some states. In addition, while states\u2019 financial position has improved on the whole, the fiscal gap between wealthier and poorer states and localities remains significant, in part due to federal budget cuts. We reported in 1993 that southeastern and southwestern states, because of greater poverty rates and smaller taxable resources, generally were among the weakest states in terms of fiscal capacity.", "New block grant proposals include programs that are much more expansive than block grants created in 1981 and could present a greater challenge for the states to both implement and finance. Nearly 100 programs in five areas\u2014cash welfare, child welfare and abuse programs, child care, food and nutrition, and social services\u2014could be combined, accounting for more than $75 billion of a total of about $200 billion in federal grants to state and local governments.

For example, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) provides direct cash assistance to individuals. Given that states tend to cut services and raise taxes during economic downturns to comply with balanced budget requirements, these cash assistance programs could experience funding reductions affecting vulnerable populations at a time when the AFDC population is likely growing. At the same time, the needs to assist these vulnerable populations would be increasing.

The 13 states transferred about $125 million among the block grants in 1982 and 1983. About $112 million, or 90 percent, entailed moving funds from LIHEAP to SSBG.

These amendments also called for phasing out the distribution of funds based on categorical grant distribution. We examined the formula in 1990, finding that the formula\u2019s urban population factor overstates the magnitude of drug use in urban as compared with rural areas and that a provision that protects states from losing funding below their 1984 levels causes a mismatch between needs and actual funding.", "Under MCH, funds continue to be distributed primarily on the basis of funds received in fiscal year 1981 under the previous categorical programs. Only when funding exceeds the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1983 are additional funds allotted in proportion to the number of persons under age 18 that are in poverty.

Although this formula was prescribed, states were given the discretion to decide which factors to consider in determining who were high-cost students.", "Where the law did not prescribe such distribution, some states developed their own formulas.

Specifically, criteria for determining which entities and programs are to be audited are based solely on dollar amounts. This approach has the advantage of subjecting a high percentage of federal funds to audit, but it does not necessarily focus audit resources on the programs identified as being high risk.

Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, states modernized their government structures, hired more highly trained individuals, improved their financial management practices, and diversified their revenue systems.", "State and local governments have also taken on an increasing share of the responsibility for financing the country\u2019s domestic expenditures. Changing priorities, tax cuts, and mounting deficits drove federal policymakers to cut budget and tax subsidies to both states and localities. These cuts fell more heavily on localities, however, because the federal government placed substantial importance on \u201csafety net\u201d programs in health and welfare that help the poor, which generally are supported by federal-state partnerships. In contrast, the federal government placed less importance on other \u201cnonsafety net\u201d programs such as infrastructure and economic development, which generally are federal-local partnerships. Growth in spending by state governments also reflects rising health care costs as well as officials\u2019 choices favoring new or expanded services and programs.", "As figure V.1 illustrates, state and local governments\u2019 expenditures have increased more rapidly, while federal grants-in-aid represent a smaller proportion of total state and local expenditure burden. Between 1978 and 1993, state and local outlays increased dramatically, from $493 billion to $884 billion in constant 1987 dollars. With their growing fiscal responsibilities, states have reevaluated their spending priorities and undertaken actions to control program growth, cut some services, and increase revenues\u2014by raising taxes and imposing user fees, for example. The continued use of these state budget practices, combined with a growing economy, have improved the overall financial condition of state governments.", "Many factors contribute to state fiscal conditions, not the least of which are economic recessions, since most states do not possess the power to deficit spend. In addition, state officials have expressed concern about unfunded mandates imposed by the federal government. Practices such as \u201coff-budget\u201d transactions could obscure the long-term impact of program costs in some states. In addition, while states\u2019 financial position has improved on the whole, the fiscal gap between wealthier and poorer states and localities remains significant, in part due to federal budget cuts. We reported in 1993 that southeastern and southwestern states, because of greater poverty rates and smaller taxable resources, generally were among the weakest states in terms of fiscal capacity.", "New block grant proposals include programs that are much more expansive than block grants created in 1981 and could present a greater challenge for the states to both implement and finance, particularly if such proposals are accompanied by federal funding cuts. Nearly 100 programs in five areas\u2014cash welfare, child welfare and abuse programs, child care, food and nutrition, and social services\u2014could be combined, accounting for more than $75 billion of a total of about $200 billion in federal grants to state and local governments. Comparatively, the categorical programs, which were replaced by the OBRA block grants, accounted for only about $6.5 billion of the $95 billion in 1981 outlays.", "In addition, these block grant proposals include programs that are fundamentally different than those included in the 1981 block grants. For example, Aid to Families with Dependent Children provides direct cash assistance to individuals. Given that states tend to cut services and raise taxes during economic downturns to comply with balanced budget requirements, these cash assistance programs could experience funding reductions, which could impact vulnerable populations at the same time their number are likely to increase. In addition, some experts suggest that states have not always maintained state funding for cash assistance programs in times of fiscal strain."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Bibliography of GAO Reports and Other Studies on Block Grants", "paragraphs": ["The following bibliography lists selected GAO reports on block grants created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 and subsequent reports pertaining to implementation of block grant programs.
