The MHS governance structure has been the subject of many studies, some recommending major changes. In 2006, DOD considered potential governance structure changes but left its existing structure in place, approving instead a shared-services directorate to consolidate common MHS functions (e.g., shared information-technology services) that ultimately was never developed. In 2012, DOD announced the creation of the DHA by October 1, 2013, with seven main goals: (1) consolidate functions (shared services) common to DOD, (2) deliver more-integrated health care in areas with more than one military service, (3) establish more-standardized processes, (4) more-closely align financial incentives with health and readiness outcomes, (5) match other resources with missions, (6) deliver more primary care and other health services, and (7) better coordinate care over time and across treatment settings.

This entity is chartered to exist until October 2015, when the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is expected to reach full operating capability. Formation of this entity addresses an issue GAO reported on in April 2012\u2014that DOD did not form such a team to oversee its 2006 MHS reform effort.", "GAO\u2019s November 2013 report identified several areas in DOD\u2019s implementation plan where sustained senior leadership attention is needed to help ensure the reform achieves its goals including:", "Undetermined staffing requirements : DOD did not have the data to determine how the creation of the DHA will affect the total number of MHS headquarters staff because it had not conducted an accurate baseline assessment of current staffing levels. Notwithstanding, using data that service officials later believed were inaccurate, in 2011, DOD identified anticipated annual personnel savings of $46.5 million as part of the rationale for creating the DHA.", "Unclear cost estimates : DOD\u2019s cost savings estimates were missing key details such as the source of the savings. DOD aggregated the separate functions of its shared services, which obscures the size and cost of planned efficiencies for each function. A business case analysis requires detailed information to convince customers and stakeholders that the selected business process is the appropriate means for achieving performance. In addition, business-case analyses should demonstrate the sensitivity of the outcome to changes in assumptions. However, DOD did not assess the risk that implementation costs could increase.", "Incomplete performance measures : DOD did not develop explanations for how each measure relates to the goals of the reform effort, did not define the specific measure to be developed; did not provide a baseline assessment of the current performance that is to be measured; and, most importantly, did not identify quantifiable targets for assessing progress. In its third submission, DOD provided some additional information, but did not provide fully developed performance measures for any of its seven reform goals.", "DOD concurred with all of GAO\u2019s recommendations, including: (1) develop a baseline assessment of the number of personnel currently working within the MHS headquarters and an estimate for the DHA at full operating capability; (2) develop a more thorough explanation of the potential sources of cost savings from DOD\u2019s implementation of shared services; and (3) develop performance measures that are clear, quantifiable, objective, and include a baseline assessment of current performance.

DOD plans to spend almost $50 billion on the MHS in  fiscal year 2014. This number has grown from approximately $20 billion in  fiscal year 2000, and is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to  continue to grow to $70 billion in 2028. In an effort to create a more  integrated and cost effective MHS, in March 2012, the Deputy Secretary  of Defense directed the establishment of a Defense Health Agency, which  officially began operations on October 1, 2013. Throughout the  implementation of the DHA, senior DOD leadership, including the Deputy  Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs),  and the service Surgeons General have demonstrated a commitment to  oversee implementation for reform of the MHS.

In the  course of our work, we interviewed officials from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, MHS Transition Office,  and the military Surgeons General. For the purposes of this testimony, in  February 2014, we subsequently examined DOD\u2019s third and final reform  plan, which was submitted to Congress in November 2013, and  discussed the status of our November 2013 report recommendations with  an official within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)  who represented the department.

After  studying several options for reorganizing the defense organizations that  constitute the MHS, in 2006 the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved  multiple initiatives including a shared services directorate to integrate the  services these organizations provide, such as information technology,  and make the MHS more cost-effective. DOD implemented those  initiatives to varying extents; however, the directorate was never formed  and the overarching governance structure of the MHS did not change.  Further, Congress expressed concern that DOD had not yet developed a  comprehensive plan to enhance quality, efficiencies, and savings in the  MHS.  DOD\u2019s senior leadership established a task force in 2011 to review  various options for changing the governance structure of the system. This  task force reported the results of its review to the congressional defense  committees in March 2012 and, in October 2013, implemented its  recommended course of action by establishing the DHA. According to  DOD, with the creation of the DHA, the military services\u2019 respective  Surgeons General will continue to oversee medical forces and the  operation of health care systems, including their military hospitals, and  the DHA will support the services in executing their respective medical  missions.", "DOD created the DHA with the intent of creating a more cost-effective  and integrated MHS.

As a result,  in March 2013, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs  chartered the MHS Governance Transition Organization to provide  oversight, management, and support for the implementation of MHS  governance reforms. The formation of this MHS Governance Transition  Organization addresses an issue we previously reported on\u2014that DOD  had not formed an overarching team to manage the implementation of the  2006 attempt to improve the department\u2019s medical governance structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have an Accurate Baseline Assessment of Current Staffing to Determine Potential Savings and Future Staffing Needs of the DHA", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in November 2013, DOD has not conducted an accurate  baseline assessment of the headquarters personnel currently working in  the MHS\u2014that is, personnel working at each military service\u2019s  headquarters and at the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In addition,  DOD has not determined the number of personnel required for the DHA  when it is fully operational in 2015, as currently planned. Our previous  work highlighted the need for federal agencies to have valid, reliable  data and to be aware of the size of their workforce, its deployment across  the organization, and the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for the  agency to accomplish its mission. A baseline assessment of the number  of current headquarters personnel is a crucial first step for developing an  estimate of the number of personnel that will be required once DHA is  fully operational.", "In its September 2011 analysis of options to reform the MHS, DOD  identified anticipated personnel savings as part of the rationale for the  reform effort and estimated a resulting estimated annual personnel cost  savings of $46.5 million. The Deputy Secretary of Defense based the  decision to establish the DHA, in part, on this estimate of personnel  savings. In contrast, we reported in November 2013 that DOD officials  told us that there would be no net increase in personnel numbers across  the MHS headquarters as a result of the creation of the DHA. Further, we  reported that, according to DOD officials, military service officials believed  that DOD\u2019s previous baseline assessment that was reflected in the $46.5  million cost savings estimate did not accurately reflect the current number  of headquarters personnel working in the MHS.", "We also reported in November 2013 that, according to DOD officials, the  number of military, civilian, and contractor positions required when the  DHA is fully operational in 2015 could be significantly higher for certain  headquarters functions than the estimates for the number of positions  required at the time of the DHA\u2019s establishment in October 2013. For  example, we reported that according to a senior official responsible for  information technology in the MHS, the number of staff required to  provide information-technology services when DHA began initial  operations in October 2013 was estimated at about 400 military and  civilian positions; however, that estimate could increase to about 3,500  military and civilian positions and about 5,000 contractor equivalent  positions once the DHA becomes fully operational in 2015. We concluded  that DOD was unable to determine whether the establishment of the DHA  would result in an increase or decrease in the number of headquarters  personnel because the department had not completed an accurate  baseline assessment of the number of headquarters personnel working in  the MHS across the services and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "In our November 2013 report, we recommended that DOD develop a  baseline assessment of the current number of military, civilian, and  contractor personnel currently working within the MHS headquarters and  an estimate for the DHA at full operating capability, including estimates of  changes in contractor full-time equivalents. DOD concurred with our  recommendation. In our November 2013 report, we noted that DOD  officials told us that they planned to conduct a baseline assessment of  headquarters staffing levels and submit a revised estimate of its staffing  needs in the department\u2019s third and final implementation plan submission.  In the final submission which we reviewed for this statement, DOD did not  include a baseline assessment of the number of personnel currently  working in the MHS headquarters across the services and the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, nor did it include an estimate of the staffing  needs once the DHA is fully operational in 2015. Instead, DOD reported  that the DHA would include 1,941 military and civilian personnel as of its  initial operating capability on October 1, 2013. Additionally, the plan\u2019s  estimate of staffing in October 2013 does not account for any contractor  positions currently associated with the MHS\u2019s headquarters functions. As  the DHA moves toward full operating capability, accurate baseline staffing  data is critical for senior leadership to make informed decisions about the  resources required to manage the MHS. Such data have become even  more critical since the Deputy Secretary of Defense announced a           20 percent reduction in DOD management headquarters spending over    5 fiscal years beginning in fiscal year 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Clarified the Sources of Cost Savings and Its Plan to Monitor Implementation Costs", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not provided discrete cost savings estimates for the various  functions it has identified as part of its 10 shared service projects it is  planning as part of the MHS reform.

The Guide  identifies that as the reengineering process matures, the business case  should include detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis in support of  selecting and implementing the new process that includes a statement  regarding benefits, costs, and risks. In addition, business-case analyses  should demonstrate the sensitivity of the outcome to changes in  assumptions, with a focus on the dominant benefit and cost elements and  the areas of greatest uncertainty.

For example, DOD identified the consolidation of medical  logistics functions and a resulting aggregated cost-savings range of  between $132 million and $353 million from fiscal years 2014 through  2019. However, the plan did not explain which function within this area  (e.g., equipment or housekeeping) would be the larger source of those  savings. Similarly, DOD\u2019s second implementation plan submission  identified that DOD plans to achieve savings in administration of its health  care plan for servicemembers, TRICARE, by closing walk-in help centers  and transitioning to a phone-based system. Further, it plans to achieve  savings through better coordination of TRICARE benefit payments with  other health insurers. However, as in the case of the consolidation of  medical logistics functions, DOD did not identify separate cost-savings  estimates for each planned effort (e.g., transitioning to a phone-based  system) and instead presented the estimated cost savings as an  aggregated amount of between $503 million and $787 million.", "DOD\u2019s second implementation plan submission included risk-adjusted  estimates of net cost savings for shared services based on uncertainty  regarding these projects\u2019 effectiveness and that are presented as a range,  with a 10 percent to 100 percent chance of achieving the maximum  estimated savings for each shared service. However, while DOD  assessed the risk of its reforms failing to achieve their maximum potential  cost savings, it did not similarly assess the risk that estimated  implementation costs may increase and affect net savings. As noted  above, our prior work emphasizes that business-case analyses should  demonstrate the sensitivity of the outcome to changes in assumptions,  with a focus on the dominant benefit and cost elements and the areas of  greatest uncertainty. DOD\u2019s analysis did not assess the risk that  estimated implementation costs may increase. In instances where  estimated implementation costs increase, overall savings may be  negatively affected.", "DOD\u2019s past experience with large-scale projects demonstrates its  difficulties in controlling rising implementation costs. For example, in  October 2010, we previously found that after obligating approximately     $2 billion over the 13-year life of its initiative to acquire an electronic  health record system, as of September 2010 DOD had delivered various  capabilities for outpatient care and dental care documentation, but scaled  back other capabilities it had originally planned to deliver, such as  replacement of legacy systems and inpatient-care management. In  addition, users continued to experience significant problems with the  performance (speed, usability, and availability) of the portions of the  system that have been deployed. According to DOD\u2019s estimates,  collectively, the 10 shared services to be implemented as part of the MHS  reform effort require an investment in information-technology capabilities  of about $273 million between fiscal years 2014 and 2019. Given DOD\u2019s  past experience in this area, rising implementation costs are an area of  specific concern.", "In our November 2013 report, we recommended that DOD develop a  more thorough explanation of the potential sources of cost savings from  the implementation of its shared-services projects and monitor the cost of  the implementation process, and DOD concurred with our  recommendations.submission did not provide additional information concerning the potential  sources of cost savings, nor did it clarify its plan to monitor  implementation costs. In February 2014, a DOD representative told us  that DOD has developed a process for leadership to monitor  implementation costs, and we plan to review DOD\u2019s process to determine  if it addresses our recommendation.

Practices of successful performance management show that interim  milestones can be used to show progress towards implementing efforts or  to make adjustments when necessary. Specifically, we found that  developing and using specific milestones and timelines to guide and  gauge progress toward achieving an agency\u2019s desired results informs  management of the rate of progress toward achieving goals and whether  adjustments need to be made in order to maintain progress within given  time frames.", "DOD\u2019s March 2013 submission was required to include a detailed  schedule for carrying out the reform of the governance of the MHS,  including a schedule for meeting the goals of the reform. However, in that  submission, DOD provided a schedule of activities leading up to its first  major milestone\u2014initial operating capability of October 1, 2013. This  schedule of activities did not provide information related to activities  beyond this first major milestone, and it did not present milestones for  achieving each of the supporting seven goals of the reform. In that March  2013 submission, DOD also did not include some key features of effective  schedules identified in our prior work, such as interim milestones or  related timelines for all of the activities supporting the reform.

DOD\u2019s third implementation plan  submission contained additional timeline activities for its reform goal  concerning the implementation of shared services, with milestones  leading up to each shared services\u2019 initial operating capability. However,  DOD has not consistently identified milestones for all activities between  initial operating capability and final operating capability for each of the  goals of its reform. While senior leaders now have more interim  milestones by which to track the implementation of the DHA, they  continue to lack milestones subsequent to initial operating capability in a  number of areas.

As noted in our report, some performance measures were used to assess  multiple objectives. performance measures that we had established in our prior work.Specifically, we found that DOD provided only the measures\u2019 names, with  no accompanying explanation for how each measure relates to the goals  of the reform effort, definition of the specific measure to be developed, or  quantifiable, numerical target for performance, nor had DOD provided a  baseline assessment of the current performance to be measured. For  example, DOD listed \u201cEmergency Room Utilization Rate\u201d as a  performance measure, but did not explain how that measure relates to  the objective of consolidating delivery of health care in areas with more  than one military service. Further, we found that DOD did not provide an  explanation of what each measure will evaluate, which could be used to  determine the extent to which each measure provides new information  beyond that provided by other measures. For example, two of the  measures listed under the objective to deliver more-comprehensive  primary care and integrated health services using advanced patient- centered medical homes are \u201csatisfaction with provider communications\u201d  and \u201csatisfaction with health care.\u201d As presented in DOD\u2019s June  submission of its implementation plan, it is unclear whether there is any  overlap between these measures, because the aspects of satisfaction are  not clarified by any accompanying explanation or definition.", "We also reported that decision makers would not be able to determine the  objectivity of DOD\u2019s measures because there is no information  accompanying the measures that indicates specifically what is to be  observed, in which population or conditions, and in what time frame. For  example, one of the measures is \u201csavings achieved versus savings  projected.\u201d This measure does not indicate specifically how savings will  be measured, and does not indicate what time frame will be used to  compare what savings were projected versus what were actually  achieved.", "In our November 2013 report, we recommended that DOD provide more  detailed information on its performance measures\u2014specifically, that DOD  develop and present to Congress measures that are clear, quantifiable,  objective, and include a baseline assessment of current performance.the third submission of its implementation plan, DOD provided some  additional information, such as baselines and performance targets, for the  performance measures under two of its seven reform goals. In this  submission, DOD included tables with expanded information for the  performance measures for its goals related to (1) delivering more- comprehensive primary care and integrated health services using  advanced patient-centered medical homes, and (2) coordinating care  over time and across treatment settings to improve outcomes in the  management of chronic illness, particularly for patients with complex  medical and social problems. For these objectives, DOD listed the  measures\u2019 names, and, where available, estimates of current and target  performance. For those measures without a definition or baseline, DOD  provided a date by when the measures would be defined and when the  baseline performance level would be established.", "As of DOD\u2019s final submission, much of the information to be included in  these two tables was still to be determined. As a result, many of the  entries in the tables represented placeholders for information, rather than  actual baselines or performance targets. Further, DOD did not include this  additional information for any of the performance measures listed under  its other five reform goals. In this third submission, DOD noted that it was  in the process of developing measures and respective performance  targets to be published in its 2014 strategic plan for the MHS, which it  expected to issue in December 2013. In February 2014, a DOD  representative told us that the strategic plan is now expected to be  released in May 2014.

As we noted in previous reports, the successful  implementation of the DHA will require committed senior leadership to  sustain the momentum created by the current reform effort. This  leadership, in turn, will help to provide oversight and accountability for the  improvement process. However, senior leaders need appropriate  information to make decisions and guide the reform. The first step to  determine what is needed for the implementation of the DHA is a baseline  assessment of current MHS staffing, followed by an estimate of DHA  staffing at full operating capability. In addition, a detailed quantitative  analysis regarding the sources of cost savings and a plan to monitor  implementation costs would provide greater clarity to DOD\u2019s shared- service consolidation projects. Moreover, the development of  comprehensive milestones for all of the reform goals would allow decision  makers to track the progress of DOD\u2019s reform efforts toward achieving its  goals. Finally, the completion of a set of fully developed performance  measures across all seven of DOD\u2019s stated goals for the DHA would  ensure that DOD\u2019s senior leaders and other decision makers have the  necessary information to assess DOD\u2019s progress in creating a more cost- effective and integrated MHS.", "Chairman Wilson, Ranking Member Davis, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
