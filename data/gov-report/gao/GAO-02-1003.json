These concerns were raised during the Persian Gulf War (August 1990 to April 1991). In the Gulf War, the Department of Defense (DOD) deployed over 580,000 military personnel and a wide array of conventional weapons and munitions that it had designed and acquired primarily to fight the Soviet Union. The munitions used by these forces included several types of land mines and represented the largest U.S. combat use of its newer aircraft- and artillery-delivered scatterable self-destructing land mines. Since the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001, DOD has been reviewing war plans to ensure that the military services are ready to meet future U.S. national security needs. This effort includes plans for the use of land mines. U.S. Gulf War experience documented in DOD after-action and lessons-learned reports provides insights concerning land mines.", "As you requested, this report focuses on U.S. land mine use during the Gulf War. Our objective was to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent were U.S. land mines available, planned for use, and used in the Gulf War; and what enemy losses resulted from U.S. land mine use? (2) To what extent did land mines cause U.S. casualties? (3) What concerns and related actions were identified in lessons-learned and other reports about the use of land mines? In addition, you asked us to provide information on the quantity of land mines in the current U.S. stockpile and the planned U.S. use of land mines for the defense of the Republic of South Korea. We are providing information on the current U.S. land mine stockpile in appendix I. We will later provide information on the U.S. use of land mines for the defense of South Korea. Because land mine issues are in some ways related to issues regarding unexploded ordnance (UXO) on the battlefield, we also discuss unexploded ordnance as it relates to U.S. casualties and troop mobility. This report does not assess the military utility or effectiveness of land mine warfare, the use of land mines by U.S. allies or the enemy in the Gulf War, the utility of nonland-mine \u201csubmunition\u201d weapons, the services\u2019 casualty-reporting systems, post- conflict humanitarian issues, or DOD\u2019s current actions to address land mine and unexploded ordnance issues. (See app. IV.)", "Because many records on the use of land mines and U.S. casualties during the Gulf War had been destroyed or lost, were incomplete or contradictory, or were archived and not easily accessible, we compiled records and documents from various sources and different DOD locations and interviewed a wide range of cognizant officials. Military service officials believe that service-provided data regarding U.S. land-mine, casualty, and unexploded ordnance issues are as accurate as available DOD records permit and that our coverage of U.S. casualties is based on the most complete analysis by service casualty officials to date.

They can therefore cause unintended post-conflict and civilian casualties. The second type consists of land mines that are generally, but not always, surface-laid \u201cscatterable\u201d land mines that are dropped by aircraft, fired by artillery, or dispersed by another dispenser system. They are conversely called \u201csmart\u201d because they remain active for preset periods of time after which they are designed to self-destruct or deactivate, rendering themselves nonhazardous.", "According to DOD, smart land mines have a 99.99-percent self-destruct reliability rate. Most self-destruct land mine systems are set at one of three self-destruct periods: 4 hours, 48 hours, or 15 days. In addition, should the self-destruct mechanism fail, self-destruct land mines are designed to self- deactivate, meaning that they are to be rendered inoperable by means of the \u201cirreversible exhaustion of their batteries\u201d within 120 days after employment. This feature, according to DOD, operates with a reliability rate of 99.999(+) percent. At the time of the Gulf War, U.S. forces were armed with both nonself-destruct and self-destruct land mines, and U.S. policy allowed them to use both types. Today, however, U.S. presidential policy limits the U.S. forces\u2019 use of nonself-destruct M-14 and M-16 antipersonnel land mines (see fig. 6 in app. II) to Korea.", "Antitank mines, as the name implies, are designed to immobilize or destroy tracked and wheeled vehicles and the vehicles\u2019 crews and passengers. The fuzes that activate antitank mines are of various types. For example, they can be activated by pressure, which requires contact with the wheels or tracks of a vehicle, or by acoustics, magnetic influence, radio frequencies, infrared-sensor, command, disturbance, or vibration, which do not require contact. Antitank mines have three types of warheads. Blast mines derive their effectiveness from the force generated by high-explosive detonation. Shaped-charged mines use a directed-energy warhead. Explosive-formed penetrating mines have an explosive charge with a metal plate in front, which forms into an inverted disk, a slug, or a long rod.", "Antipersonnel land mines are designed to kill or wound soldiers. Their fuzes can be activated, for example, by pressure, trip wires, disturbance, antihandling mechanisms, or command detonation. Antipersonnel land mine warhead types include blast, directed fragmentation, and bounding fragmentation. The blast mine is designed to injure the lower extremities of the individual who steps on it. The directed fragmentation mine propels fragments in the general direction it is pointed, and the bounding fragmentation mine throws a canister into the air, which bursts and scatters shrapnel throughout the immediate area to kill or wound the enemy.", "Antitank and antipersonnel land mines are often employed together, as \u201cmixed\u201d systems. In a mixed system, the antipersonnel land mines are intermingled with antitank land mines to discourage enemy personnel from attempting to disarm them. Antitank land mines may also be equipped with explosive antidisturbance devices designed to protect them from being moved by enemy personnel, thus increasing the difficulty and challenge of breaching a minefield."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of the Use of Self-Destruct U.S. Land Mines in the Gulf War Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD, all the types of land mines in DOD\u2019s arsenal were available and included in U.S. war plans for use if needed in the Gulf War.

This report stated that two persons were killed and seven injured when soldiers \u201ccollected what they thought were parachute flares.\u201d Furthermore, soldiers might not have recognized that a battlefield object was hazardous because UXO comes in many shapes, sizes, and designs, much of which inexperienced soldiers have never seen before.

These concerns led to the reluctance of some U.S. commanders to use land mines in areas that U.S. and allied forces might have to traverse.Commanders\u2019 fears arose because of two basic reasons: The first reason involved both the obsolescence of conventional U.S. mines and safety issues with both conventional and scatterable land mines. A higher-than- anticipated dud rate for land mines and other submunitions during the Gulf War was one safety issue. Reflective of the safety issues, DOD reports recognized that de facto minefields created by all unexploded submunitions\u2014land mine and nonland-mine alike\u2014threatened fratricide and affected maneuvers by U.S. forces.

In a joint service lessons-learned report, officials stated, \u201cCommanders were afraid to use conventional and scatterable mines because of their potential for fratricide.\u201d The report said that this fear could also be attributed to the lack of training that service members had received in how to employ land mines. In particular, prior to the Gulf War, the Army restricted live-mine training with conventional antipersonnel land mines (M-14s and M-16s) because they were considered dangerous. The joint lessons-learned report argued, \u201cIf the system is unreliable or unsafe during training, it will be unreliable and unsafe to use during war.\u201d", "Since before the Gulf War, the Army has known about safety issues with its conventional nonself-destruct M-14 and M-16 antipersonnel land mines.

A DOD reliability testing document states that the M-16 mines \u201care subject to duds; the mine ejects but fails to detonate.  mine is then unexploded ordnance and still presents a danger.\u201d A DOD 2001 report on dud rates for land mines and other munitions states that the dud rate identified by stockpile reliability testing for M-16 land mines is over 6 percent. In a specific case, a currently serving senior Army officer told us that he had trained his unit with these antipersonnel land mines in Germany in 1990 to get ready for the Gulf War. According to the officer, during the training, his unit suffered 10 casualties from the M-16 land mine. This officer said that U.S. \u201cBouncing Betty\u201d M-16 and \u201cToe Popper\u201d M-14 antipersonnel land mines should be eliminated from Army stockpiles because they are too dangerous to use.", "Due to safety concerns, the Army placed prohibitions on live-fire training with these land mines before and after the Gulf War, with restrictions being lifted during the Gulf War. But DOD reporting does not indicate that any U.S. unit chose to conduct live-mine training in the theater with any type of mines. According to an Army engineer after-action report, \u201cSome troops even reported that they were prohibited from training on live mines after their arrival in Saudi Arabia.\u201d Moreover, DOD reporting states that U.S. forces employed no M-14 or M-16 mines in combat. Because of renewed restrictions following the Gulf War, service members still are prohibited from live-fire training on M-14 antipersonnel land mines, and training on live M-16 mines is restricted to soldiers in units assigned or attached to the Eighth U.S. Army in Korea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land Mines and Other Scatterable Munitions Had Higher-Than-Expected Dud Rates During the Gulf War", "paragraphs": ["Another safety concern expressed in lessons-learned reports was that higher-than-expected dud, or malfunction, rates occurred for the approximately 118,000 U.S. self-destruct land mines and the millions of other U.S. scatterable submunitions employed in the Gulf War.

The office also reports that all U.S. self-destruct mines self- deactivate, that is, their batteries die within 90 to 120 days. The office stated that the reliability rate for the self-destruct feature is 99.99 percent and that the reliability rate for the self-deactivation feature is 99.999(+). According to the program office, these features mean that self-destruct land mines leave no hazardous mines on the battlefield. \u201cFor safety reasons, SCATMINEs  must receive two arming signals at launch. One signal is usually physical (spin, acceleration, or unstacking), and the other is electronic. This same electronic signal activates the mine\u2019s SD  time. \u201cMines start their safe-separation countdown (arming time) when they receive arming signals. This allows the mines to come to rest after dispensing and allows the mine dispenser to exit the area safely . . . . \u201cMines are armed after the arming time expires. The first step in arming is a self-test to ensure proper circuitry. Approximately 0.5 percent of mines fail the self-test and self- destruct immediately. \u201cAfter the self-test, mines remain active until their SD time expires or until they are encountered. Mines actually self-destruct at 80 to 100 percent of their SD time. . . .", "No mines should remain after the SD time has been reached.

CMS reported finding substantially more U.S. land mine duds than would be expected if dud rates were as low as DOD documents and briefings stated they are. DOD indicated that it cannot confirm the accuracy of the CMS-reported data.", "After the Gulf War, CMS employed more than 500 certified, experienced, and trained personnel to eliminate the unexploded ordnance in its sector of Kuwait. About 150 CMS employees were retired U.S. military explosive ordnance disposal experts. In a report for the U.S. Army, CMS recorded the types and numbers of U.S. submunition duds it found in its explosive ordnance disposal sector of the Kuwaiti battlefield. The report illustrates how the dangers of the battlefield during the Gulf War were compounded by the large numbers of unexploded U.S. submunitions, including land mines.", "According to the CMS report, it found 1,977 U.S. scatterable land mine duds and about 118,000 U.S. nonland-mine submunition duds in its disposal sector. CMS\u2019s report stated that \u201cmany tons of modern bombs called Cluster Bomb Unit were dropped,\u201d each of which \u201cwould deploy as many as 250 small submunitions.\u201d The report states, \u201cA significant number of the bombs and more importantly the submunitions, did not detonate upon striking the ground resulting in hundreds of thousands of \u2018dud\u2019 explosive devices laying  on the ground in Kuwait.\u201d While the vast majority of these duds were from nonland mine submunitions, they included the more modern self-destructing RAAM, ADAM, and Gator land mines. Table 6 lists the types and amounts of U.S. dud submunitions CMS reported finding in its disposal sector of the Kuwaiti battlefield.", "DOD reports that it employed in the Gulf War a total of about 118,000 self- destruct land mines (see table 1) and that their self-destruct failure, or dud, rate is 0.01 percent (1 in 10,000). However, if, as DOD reported, about 118,000 of these self-destruct land mines were employed and they produced duds at the DOD-claimed rate of 0.01 percent, there should have been about 12 duds produced, not 1,977 as CMS reported finding in one of seven Kuwaiti battlefield sectors. Thus, a substantial inconsistency exists between the DOD-reported reliability rate and the dud rate implied by the number of mines that CMS reported finding from actual battlefield use. At the time CMS was completing this UXO disposal work in Kuwait, the DOD program manager for Mines, Countermine and Demolitions visited the CMS cleanup operation. His report of that trip indicates that he thought CMS\u2019s techniques, training of personnel, and recording of ordnance recovered were thorough and accurate. The project manager said in his report that he had personally seen unexploded U.S. ordnance on the battlefield. The mine database developed by CMS to record the location of land mines, the project manager believed, was \u201cextremely useful\u201d to the U.S. soldiers working in that area.", "We interviewed several former employees of CMS to obtain their views on these issues. All of those we interviewed were retired senior U.S. officers and noncommissioned officers whose rank ranged from major general to sergeant first class. All but one were experienced in military ordnance and explosive ordnance disposal. They included the then-CMS president, the Kuwaiti on-site manager, and leaders of ground UXO disposal teams. They made two major points: (1) U.S. submunition UXO found in their sector was tactically employed, unexploded ordnance duds that had failed to explode as designed and could have been hazardous, meaning that if disturbed, the ordnance might have exploded, and (2) U.S. Gator, ADAM, and RAAM land-mine duds had not self-destructed as designed and were treated as hazardous. CMS explosives disposal personnel stated that they had personally experienced what they thought were Gator duds exploding on the battlefield in Kuwait, caused by no apparent triggering event, over a year after the Gulf War ended. CMS experts speculated that these detonations might have been caused by the extreme heat in a desert environment.", "DOD has been unable to explain the circumstances that caused the nearly 2,000 U.S. self-destruct land mine duds found in the CMS disposal sector of the Kuwaiti battlefield not to self-destruct. Several DOD land mine and explosive ordnance disposal experts speculated that these dud land mines could have resulted from (1) mines that had malfunctioned or had been misemployed; (2) greater-than-expected and reported dud rates; or (3) the use by U.S. forces of many thousands more scatterable land mines than DOD has reported having used. Some Army land mine-related officials discounted the accuracy of some data included in the CMS report. However, these officials did not provide us with any factual evidence supporting these views.", "Other DOD experts in explosive ordnance disposal confirmed in interviews that scatterable mine duds can exist after their self-destruct times have elapsed and that these duds may be hazardous. A DOD explosive ordnance disposal expert said that procedures for eliminating Gator duds specify that explosive ordnance disposal should be postponed for 22 days, and then the duds should normally be destroyed remotely by blowing them up in place. The 22-day period is calculated by adding a 50-percent safety factor to the maximum possible self-destruct period of 15 days. Explosive ordnance disposal personnel thus attempt to reduce the possibility of a munition detonating or self-destructing while they are near it.", "DOD did not provide us with records to show the results of reliability testing for ADAM, RAAM, or Gator land mines done prior to the Gulf War or any safety-of-use messages that might have been in effect for these or other U.S. land mines that were in U.S. stockpiles at that time. However, DOD did provide some post-Gulf War test records that document reliability problems with eight of its self-destruct land mine systems.Specifically, testing showed that some land mines did not self-destruct at the selected times. For example, a July 2000 Army study of dud rates for ammunition reports that the submunition dud rate for RAAM land mines with short duration fuzes is over 7 percent, and the dud rate for RAAM land mines with long duration fuzes is over 10 percent. In an Ammunition Stockpile Reliability Program test for the ADAM, the Army suspended one lot because it failed. In a test for the Volcano system, 66 out of 564 land mines failed the test. Among the failures were 1 hazardous dud (meaning that it could explode), 24 nonhazardous duds (meaning that they had not armed), 6 mines that detonated early, and 1 mine that detonated late. In another case, DOD testing of the Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition (SLAM) land mine showed that it also did not destruct at the selected time. While this problem was investigated, SLAM use was suspended and a safety-of-use message was put into effect advising personnel \u201cnever to approach an M2 SLAM that has been armed\u201d and, in training, \u201cto assure that it can be detonated if it fails to go off as intended.\u201d According to DOD, the same self-destruct and self-deactivation design has been used in all U.S. mines since 1970. Because of this design similarity, it is possible that U.S. self-destruct land mines could be subject to similar failures.", "Failures of self-destruct land mines that are induced by extremes in temperature and other variations in environmental conditions are well- documented in service field manuals and after-action reports. Field manuals state that the reliability of self-destruct land mines degrades when they are employed on sand, vegetation, hillsides, snow, or hard surfaces. Also, self-destruct land mines have reportedly \u201creduced effectiveness\u201d on hard surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. They break apart and can easily be seen. Also, the high detectability of scatterable mines on bare and lightly covered surfaces permits the enemy to seek out unmined passageways or pick a way through lightly seeded areas. An Army document states that \u201cFASCAM  must be covered by either observation or fire, since FASCAM minefields are surface laid and an undisturbed enemy could breach those obstacles quickly\u2026.FASCAM is not suitable for use in road interdiction due to its tendency to malfunction on hard surfaces.\u201d In snow, self-destruct land mines may settle into the snow at unintended angles, causing their antihandling devices to prematurely detonate them. In deep snow, self- destruct land mines are considered \u201cineffective,\u201d and at least 40 percent of their blast is smothered. Soft sand, mud, or surface water can have similar effects. During the Gulf War in particular, Marines found that in the constantly blowing and shifting sand, surface mines became buried, and buried mines came to the surface. Slope or unevenness of the terrain may also have an adverse impact on self-destruct land mines. Specifically, between 5 and 15 percent of scatterable mines come to rest on their edges when deployed. RAAM and ADAM land mines must come to rest and stabilize within 30 seconds of impact, or the submunitions will not arm. Very uneven terrain such as ground covered by vegetation or rocks also may prevent the ADAM or Gator trip wires from deploying properly.", "Gator testing indicates that various reliability problems can increase dud rates. For example, in 58 tests, seven submunition land mine dispenser failures were observed, reducing the reliability rate of the dispensers to 88 percent. Of the submunition mines delivered, 99 percent survived ground impact. Of those, 97 percent of the antitank mines armed, and 95 percent of the antipersonnel mines armed. Various other problems can affect a mine\u2019s explosion. For example, one antitank mine did not explode when triggered, but it did activate when it was picked up and shaken."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonland-Mine Submunitions Also Had Higher Dud Rates Than Expected", "paragraphs": ["During the Gulf War, accumulations of thousands of U.S. nonland-mine submunition duds on the battlefield created unintended de facto minefields. This problem was exacerbated by dud rates for these submunitions that appear to have been higher than the 2- to 4-percent submunition dud rate that DOD had previously reported. In a study of UXO issues, the Army identified an estimated 8-percent overall dud rate for submunitions. Another Army document said that an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) commander estimated that an area occupied by the 24th Infantry Division during the war experienced at least a 15- to 20-percent dud rate for some Army submunitions. The document stated that \u201cAn unknown amount was covered by sand suggesting an even higher rate.\u201d EOD personnel estimated that the dud rate for Air Force submunitions was 40 percent for one area. They commented that these submunitions \u201cdid not function well in soft sand.\u201d In addition, DOD reported that at the time of the Gulf War, over half of the 133 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) submunition lots in inventory exceeded the Army\u2019s 5-percent dud-rate goal. Each Multiple Launch Rocket System contains 644 M77 submunitions. One DOD document stated that the dud rate for the M77 for the Gulf War ranged from 10 to 20 percent.", "U.S. ammunition stockpile sample testing also indicated that DOD has experienced past problems with submunition reliability rates. For example, in 1990, testing of artillery-delivered nonland-mine submunitions identified two lots that had duds in excess of 40 percent. According to a testing document, one way to compensate for this high dud rate is to increase the quantity fired. Instructions contained in the testing document were to \u201cNotify the user of the increase in submissile defect rate so that he can make adjustments in the tactical employment plans.\u201d The July 2000 Army study of dud rates for ammunition reports that the dud rate for artillery-fired M42/46 submunitions is over 14 percent.", "Like land mines, nonland-mine submunitions experience higher failure rates in various environmental conditions. According to an Army field manual, about 50 percent of the submunitions that fail to detonate are armed and hazardous. Firing them into mountainous areas or uneven terrain further increases the dud rate. The effectiveness of these rounds also decreases in snow, water, marshy areas, mud, vegetation, and soft sand.", "According to one DOD document, the improved conventional munitions used, including dual-purpose improved conventional munitions, and CBUs, experienced a high dud rate and caused obstacles for maneuvering forces. Units perceived the dud rates as \u201cconsiderably greater than the 2-4 percent anticipated,\u201d creating a dud minefield. The document continued that because the dud rates were \u201ctoo high,\u201d some maneuver commanders hesitated to use submunition weapons, especially if they believed that their units would move through the area later. Hazardous dudfields caused delays in movement on the battlefield, and high winds and shifting sands often covered many duds. According to this report, \u201cThis became especially dangerous for high hazard missions such as refueling operations.\u201d \u201cIn one case, the 1st Cavalry Division moved into Kuwait along the Wadi al Batin. Twenty miles of this route was saturated with both USAF submunitions (BLU97 and Rockeye) and Army M77 submunitions. . . . Maneuvering through this area was no problem for the tracked vehicles of the division. However, the 1st Cav selected the same route for its main supply route (MSR). Because the division\u2019s CSS  consisted of mainly wheeled vehicles, EOD  support was required. It took the 64th EOD and a British unit about five days to clear a two lane path through the area. In this case, the unit\u2019s progress was clearly slowed by the duds.\u201d", "Because Gulf War records are not always specific, it is not clear how frequently U.S. forces experienced problems in maneuvering through areas previously attacked by U.S. ordnance. However, available records indicate that such problems did occur to some degree and were an operational concern. In fact, DOD reported that in some instances \u201cground movement came to a halt\u201d because units were afraid of encountering unexploded ordnance. Moreover, Army officials reported that, in the case of the M77 submunitions, the Army believed that the weapon would most likely be used against the Soviet threat in Europe, where U.S. troops would probably be in a defensive position.

The program office indicated that the Army-led project to end the use of all pure antipersonnel systems outside Korea by 2003 by fielding artillery- fired mixed land mine ammunition, budgeted at about $145 million, might now be discontinued. A second effort, budgeted at $24 million and led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is to seek long-term alternatives for mixed land mine systems. One concept under development is the self-healing minefield, which does not require antipersonnel land mines to protect antitank land mines because the antitank mines in the system are able to independently hop around the battlefield to intelligently redistribute themselves in response to breaching attempts. This system is not expected to be fielded before 2015. A third effort, budgeted at about $230 million and led by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics), is aimed at replacing all U.S. mixed land mine systems by removing the antipersonnel land mines in them.

These revisions are intended to improve the integration of UXO-related planning into military operations and provide improved procedures for the services to use when operating in a UXO environment. However, DOD has provided to us no manuals that require combat commanders to always report and track all potential hazardous submunition dudfields. Instead, commanders are allowed to determine when reporting, tracking, and marking of potentially hazardous submunition dudfields are required.", "DOD\u2019s post-Gulf War UXO manuals increase attention to procedures for operations in a UXO environment. DOD\u2019s guidance is based on Gulf War lessons learned: \u201cExperience from Operation Desert Storm revealed that a battlefield strewn with unexploded ordnance (UXO) poses a twofold challenge for commanders at all levels: one, to reduce the potential for fratricide from UXO hazards and two, to minimize the impact that UXO may have on the conduct of combat operations. Commanders must consider risks to joint force personnel from all sources of UXO and integrate UXO into operational planning and execution.\u201d DOD\u2019s manuals conclude that \u201cAlthough UXO is not a mine, UXO hazards pose problems similar to mines concerning both personnel safety and the movement and maneuver of forces on the battlefield.\u201d", "DOD\u2019s manuals describe the UXO problem as having increased in recent years: \u201cSaturation of unexploded submunitions has become a characteristic of the modern battlefield. The potential for fratricide from UXO is increasing.\u201d According to DOD, \u201cThe probability of encounter is roughly equal for a minefield and a UXO hazard area of equal density  the lethality of the UXO hazard area is lower.\u201d DOD lists three Army and Marine Corps systems as causes of UXO: the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the cannon artillery-fired dual-purpose improved conventional munition (DPICM). The manuals warn that, based on the types of ammunition available for these weapons in 1996, \u201cevery MLRS and ATACMS fire mission and over half of the fire missions executed by cannon artillery produce UXO hazard areas.\u201d With a 95-percent submunition reliability rate, a typical fire mission of 36 MLRS rockets could produce an average of 1,368 unexploded submunitions. Air Force and Navy cluster bomb units (CBUs) contain submunitions that produce UXO hazard areas similar to MLRS, ATACMS, and cannon artillery-fired DPICM submunitions.", "In its post-Gulf War manuals, DOD\u2019s guidance includes \u201crecommended methodologies for use by the services for planning, reporting, and tracking to enhance operations in an UXO contaminated environment.\u201d Of primary concern to DOD is the prevention of fratricide and the retention of freedom of maneuver. DOD\u2019s manuals state that U.S or allied casualties produced by friendly unexploded submunitions may be classified as fratricide. In planning wartime operations, the guidance suggests that commanders be aware of hazardous areas and assess the risk to their operations if their troops must transit these areas. Such planning is necessary for any type of mission, regardless of the unit. Without careful planning, according to the manuals, commanders\u2019 ability to maintain the required operational tempo could be difficult. Planners should allocate additional time for the operation if a deliberate breach or a bypass of a UXO hazard area is required. When encountering locations where unexploded submunitions have been or may be encountered, commanders should immediately report these areas. According to the manuals, \u201cImmediate reporting is essential. UXO hazard areas are lethal and unable to distinguish between friend and foe.\u201d After reporting hazardous areas, commanders should carefully coordinate with other units to prevent the UXO from restricting or impeding maneuver space while at the same time decreasing fratricide. Such areas should be accurately tracked and marked.", "When describing the need for improved procedures, DOD\u2019s UXO manuals state, \u201cCurrently no system exists to accurately track unexploded submunitions to facilitate surface movement and maneuver.\u201d DOD now highlights staff responsibilities for joint force planning, reporting, tracking, and disseminating UXO hazard area information and tactics, techniques, and procedures for units transiting or operating within a UXO hazard area. For example, the joint force engineer is responsible for maintaining the consolidated mine field records and historical files of UXOs, minefields, and other obstacles. The manuals conclude that \u201cProperly integrated, these procedures will save lives and reduce the impact of UXO on operations.\u201d Some of the suggested procedures are as follows:   Coordination between component commanders and the joint force commander may be required before the use of submunitions by any delivery means.", "Units should bypass UXO hazard areas if possible. When bypassing is not feasible, units must try to neutralize the submunitions and scatterable mines.", "Combat units that have the assets to conduct an in-stride breach can do so.", "Extraction procedures resemble in-stride breach or clearing procedures.   Dismounted forces face the greatest danger of death or injury from UXO.", "Unexploded ordnance is a significant obstacle to dismounted forces. Dismounted forces require detailed knowledge of the types and locations of submunitions employed.", "The chance of significant damage to armored, light armored vehicles, and other wheeled armored vehicles is relatively low. Personnel being transported by unarmored wheeled vehicles face nearly the same risk to UXO as dismounted forces. The protection afforded by unarmored wheeled vehicles is negligible.", "Air assault and aviation forces are also at risk from UXO. Aircraft in defilade, flying nap-of-the-earth or in ground effect (hovering) are vulnerable to submunitions. Certain submunitions are sensitive enough to function as a result of rotor wash.", "DOD has issued manuals that alert U.S. forces to the threat of UXO and identify procedures to mitigate risks. For example, Field Manual 20-32 states that \u201cMine awareness should actually be entitled mine/UXO awareness. If only mines are emphasized, ordnance (bomblets, submunitions) may be overlooked, and it has equal if not greater killing potential.\u201d Despite this recognition, DOD officials have not indicated to us that they plan to require commanders to report and track all potential hazardous nonland-mine submunition dudfields and to mark them when appropriate, as is now required for scatterable submunition minefields.

The Army estimated in 1994 that the cost would be about $29 billion to increase submunition reliability by retrofitting or replacing submunitions to add self-destruct fuzing for the nearly 1 billion submunitions in the Army stockpile. In a different estimate in 1996, the Army estimated the cost to retrofit the stockpile to be $11-12 billion. The Army also estimated lesser costs to retrofit or procure submunitions with self-destruct fuzing for only those munitions most likely to be used, including those in unit basic ammunition loads and pre-positioned ships. These Army cost estimates to equip Army submunitions with self-destruct fuzing do not indicate that they include costs to similarly equip Air Force, Marine, and Navy submunitions. Using actual CMS, Inc., costs to clean up UXO from the CMS sector of the Kuwaiti Gulf War battlefield, the Army also estimated that the cost to reduce the dud rate by adding self-destruct fuzes for the submunitions actually used on a battlefield was comparable to the cost to clean up duds left by unimproved submunitions. The Army further recognized that, while the costs of reducing and cleaning up duds may be similar, the detrimental battlefield fratricide and countermobility effects of duds also need to be considered, as well as humanitarian concerns.", "In 1995, DOD reported that its long-term solution to reduce UXO \u201cis the ongoing efforts to incorporate self-destruct mechanisms in the DoD\u2019s high density munitions which would limit further proliferation of unexploded ordnance on the battlefield.\u201d DOD called the UXO detection and clearance problem \u201cof enormous magnitude.\u201d", "DOD has reported that it is taking actions to increase land mine and submunition reliability rates and reduce dud rates. In a 2000 report to Congress, DOD summarized its overall approach to addressing UXO concerns. DOD stated in that report, \u201cAn analysis of the UXO problem concluded that UXO concerns are viable and, using existing weapons, the potential exists for millions of UXO.\u201d The report further stated that the majority of battlefield UXO will result from submunitions that \u201care not equipped with self-destruct features,  pose the greatest potential for UXO hazards.\u201d", "Importantly, DOD\u2019s approach to ammunition reliability improvement is to emphasize adding reliability to future procurements rather than fixing the existing stockpile. According to DOD\u2019s 2000 report to Congress, \u201cThe Department does not plan to retrofit or accelerate the demilitarization of its current inventory of weapons containing submunitions that pose UXO hazards. Notwithstanding, the Department will monitor the Service submunition development programs to make sure that every effort is taken to develop a mechanism within the submunition that will increase its overall reliability, thus reducing the potential for UXO.\u201d The report went on to state that DOD will also monitor future procurement programs to ensure that reprocured weapons that contain submunitions were improved to increase their overall reliability.", "In addition to DOD actions aimed at controlling the UXO problem, there are a number of procurement-related efforts in place by the services to reduce and/or eliminate potential UXO from new purchases of ammunition. For example, in its 2000 report to Congress, DOD states, \u201cThe Army is in the process of producing new weapons that contain self- destruct mechanisms. In addition, the Army is considering developing requirements for new weapons systems aimed at controlling unexploded submunitions.\u201d The report also states that Air Force and Navy munitions procurements likewise address reliability concerns. DOD has concluded in this report that \u201chile it has been deemed infeasible to attempt to retrofit legacy weapons systems with self-destruct features, new and future submunition-based weapon systems for the Services have or will incorporate self-destruct features to contain the UXO problem.\u201d", "In January 2001, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandumdirecting the services to adhere to DOD policy on submunition reliability.
