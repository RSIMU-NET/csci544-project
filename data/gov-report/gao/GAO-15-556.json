According to GAO's analysis of 2012 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data, about 45 percent of private sector U.S. workers participated in a workplace retirement savings program\u2014an estimate that is consistent with prior GAO work and other research. Using tax data to correct for under-reporting raised the share of workers participating to 54 percent, but still indicates many workers lack coverage. Among those not participating, the vast majority\u201484 percent\u2014lacked access because they either worked for employers that did not offer programs or were not eligible for the programs that were offered, for example, because they were new employees or in specific jobs that were excluded from the program. In particular, lower-income workers and those employed by smaller firms were much less likely to have access to programs. However, among those who had access, the majority of these workers participated.", "Key strategies to expand private sector coverage identified in the states and countries GAO reviewed include encouraging or requiring workplace access, automatic enrollment, financial incentives, and program simplification. For example, pending implementation, programs in two of the states GAO studied\u2014California and Illinois\u2014would require certain employers to automatically enroll workers in a state-run program, though workers could choose to opt-out. In the countries GAO studied, combining workplace access with automatic enrollment and financial incentives\u2014tax preferences or employer contributions\u2014has helped increase participation. Moreover, states and countries have tried to simplify program designs to (1) limit the responsibility and cost for employers and (2) reduce complexity, cost, and risk for workers. For example, some states intend to not only reduce burdens for employers by selecting and monitoring providers, but also reduce complexity for workers by limiting the number of investment options.", "State and national stakeholders reported potential challenges with uncertainty created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and agency regulations that could delay or deter state efforts to expand coverage. Generally, ERISA preempts, or invalidates, any state law relating to \u201cemployee benefit plans\u201d for private sector workers, but different areas of uncertainty arise based on the details of each state effort. For example, four of the six states GAO reviewed intend to create payroll deduction individual retirement account (IRA) programs that would not be considered employee benefit plans. However, due to uncertainty created by ERISA, it is unclear whether a state can offer such programs or whether some of the program features would lead a court to find that they are, or relate to, employee benefit plans. Stakeholders also noted uncertainty caused by regulations from the Departments of Labor (DOL) and the Treasury meant to assist workers and employers. For example, DOL's regulation on payroll deduction IRAs was written before these state efforts were proposed and omits detail that, if included, could help reduce uncertainty. Given these uncertainties, states may face litigation and stakeholders noted that state programs could lose tax preferences if they were ruled preempted by ERISA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO suggests that Congress consider providing states limited flexibility regarding ERISA preemption to expand private sector coverage.

In addition, New Zealand and Canada would  encourage or require certain employers to offer workplace access.", "Instead of creating a state-run program for employers, though, New  Zealand and Canada license service providers to offer programs that  meet established criteria\u2014an approach similar to the marketplace in  Washington State.", "In combination with workplace access, each of the six state efforts we  reviewed would require or allow employers to automatically enroll workers  in a workplace retirement savings program to increase participation.  Specifically, efforts in California, Illinois, and Maryland would require  eligible employers that do not offer an employee benefit plan to  automatically enroll their workers in the state-run program. In addition,  state officials told us that the program for not-for-profit employers in  Massachusetts would require employers who adopt the state plan to use  automatic enrollment. In each of these programs, workers would have the  ability to opt out. For example, California\u2019s Secure Choice program would  require that employers enroll workers, but an official said workers would  have a 90-day opt out period. In West Virginia, on the other hand,  employers who would sign up to participate in the state-run program  would have the option of automatically enrolling their workers, but it is at  the employer\u2019s discretion. Similarly, Washington would provide an online  marketplace with multiple vehicles\u2014a SIMPLE IRA, payroll deduction  IRA, and myRA\u2014and employers that choose to use the marketplace  would be encouraged, but not required, to automatically enroll workers.", "State officials and stakeholders emphasized the importance of automatic  enrollment in increasing participation and contributions, which can, in  turn, help reduce costs. For example, in California, members of the  Secure Choice program\u2019s board said that automatic enrollment helps  increase participation and promote better outcomes by nudging workers  to save. A representative from the Maryland task force also said that  without automatic enrollment fewer workers would participate, and the  burden to provide financial education would increase. Similarly, our prior  work and other research show that automatic enrollment is effective in  overcoming workers\u2019 inertia and considerably increases participation.  For example, we previously found that automatic enrollment has  considerably increased participation in programs adopting this feature,  with some participation rates reaching as high as 95 percent. In addition  to expanding participation, state officials and stakeholders we interviewed  said that automatic enrollment can reduce the costs of managing  programs as the overall amount of savings increase.", "Government officials and stakeholders in the countries we reviewed also  emphasized the importance of automatic enrollment in increasing  participation. According to the former Retirement Commissioner in New  Zealand, automatic enrollment has been essential to the success of their  KiwiSaver program and, without it, they would need a massive education  campaign. Similarly, other government officials in New Zealand said that  automatic enrollment is critical because too many people\u2014even those  who want to save\u2014will not actively seek out participation. Government  officials and stakeholders in the U.K. and Canada also highlighted the  importance of automatic enrollment in increasing participation. According  to a report to Parliament submitted by the largest organization  representing unionized workers in the U.K., initial opt-out rates have been  lower than expected, and their experience has shown the value of  harnessing inertia to improve outcomes for workers. Moreover, the  program was designed to further reduce opt-outs because it requires  automatic re-enrollment of those who opted-out after 3 years.   Government officials in Canada said that the PRPP program utilizes  automatic enrollment to increase participation, but it is unclear how  successful it will be because the program is voluntary for employers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Incentives", "paragraphs": ["While all six state efforts we reviewed anticipate using tax-advantaged  vehicles to encourage participation, state officials and others said Roth  IRAs, in particular, could help partially address concerns over limited tax  benefits for lower-income workers. Financial incentives for participation in  retirement savings programs include preferential tax treatment and  employer contributions and multiple stakeholders noted that such  incentives encourage worker participation. The state efforts we reviewed  all seek to incentivize participation by using vehicles\u2014employer- sponsored 401(k) plans or workplace-based IRAs\u2014that typically qualify  for preferential tax treatment. But they do not allow for other financial  incentives, such as employer contributions, or do so only to a limited  extent.  In the absence of other financial incentives, some states, such  as Illinois and California, are using or considering a Roth IRA vehicle to  address concerns that lower-income workers may realize little or no  current tax benefit from savings. Treasury officials and stakeholders said  a Roth IRA may be beneficial for workers who have little or no current tax  liability but may pay higher taxes in the future. Moreover, Treasury  officials said that Roth IRAs can benefit workers with limited resources by  allowing them to withdraw contributions tax free under certain  circumstances. In light of these issues, Illinois enacted the Secure Choice  program, which uses a Roth IRA vehicle, and California\u2019s Secure Choice  board commissioned a feasibility study to examine this issue.", "Government officials and stakeholders in the countries we reviewed  pointed to the importance of additional financial incentives, such as  employer and government matching contributions, in increasing  participation. For example, New Zealand\u2019s KiwiSaver used a one-time  \u201ckick-start\u201d contribution of $1,000 New Zealand Dollars (NZD), about $650  U.S. dollars (USD), as well as matching employer contributions and tax  benefits, as financial incentives to encourage worker participation in the  program.  The former Retirement Commissioner in New Zealand and  other stakeholders noted that the kick-start has been very popular and  effective because it is so easily understood by participants, while the tax  incentive is less well-understood. Government officials attributed the  higher than expected rate of participation, particularly for those opting in  to KiwiSaver, to the success of the financial incentives. Similarly, in the  U.K., the automatic enrollment requirement includes matching  contributions from the employer and government\u2014employers are  currently required to contribute 1 percent for a specified range of  earnings, which will gradually increase to 3 percent in 2018, while the  government contribution will increase from 0.2 percent to 1 percent.

Specifically, in  order to mitigate some of the challenges of setting up workplace  retirement savings programs, state officials seek to (1) limit the  responsibility and cost for employers, and (2) reduce complexity, cost,  and investment risk for workers. These efforts would simplify program  administration and investment management with the goals of lowering  fees and encouraging broad employer adoption and worker participation.  However, state officials also noted that this may elevate the role of the  state in administering these programs and create implementation  challenges, including how to fund them. Since no state effort has been  implemented to date, states may be able to draw lessons from  experiences in the countries we reviewed, as well as other state  programs.

For example, the U.K. government created  NEST to ensure that all employers, particularly small employers, would  have access to a low-cost program, with the added benefit of diminishing  the burden on employers of choosing an appropriate provider. NEST  stakeholders said the existence of a low-cost program with a universal  public service obligation reduces the burden on small employers who  might otherwise expend considerable time and effort in identifying a  provider willing to serve them at an acceptable cost. Among other things,  NEST\u2019s governing board selects and monitors providers, takes on  fiduciary liability for management of the program\u2019s investments, and does  not charge employers to set up and use NEST. Lastly, NEST is  responsible for sending out welcome packages to new participants with  information on how to access the website and create accounts.", "In addition to addressing challenges for employers, state and country  efforts we reviewed address issues of complexity, cost, and investment  risk for workers through a variety of approaches (see table 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Implementation of State Efforts Would Likely Increase Coverage, Some Private Sector Workers May Remain Uncovered", "paragraphs": ["While successful implementation of these efforts by states will likely  increase coverage for many private sector workers, some workers in  those states may remain uncovered.

For state efforts that would create a voluntary program for  all employers who are eligible to offer it to their workers, such as  Massachusetts\u2019 not-for-profit program, stakeholders said many  employers would still likely not choose to offer workplace access.  Specifically, one national industry representative said, by definition,  the employers targeted by state programs have already chosen not to  offer retirement programs to their workers. Similarly, state and  national stakeholders felt that the absence of a requirement for  employers to offer workers access to workplace retirement savings  programs would significantly lessen any expansion of coverage. Yet  even those state efforts that would require eligible employers to offer  workplace access, such as Illinois\u2019 and California\u2019s Secure Choice  programs, would apply only to employers above a certain employee  size threshold, 25 and 5 employees, respectively. According to one  academic, there could be many employers under that size threshold.  In addition, there are many self-employed workers who may continue  not to have access to a workplace retirement program. For example,  while California\u2019s target population is 6.3 million workers who lack  access to an employer-sponsored plan, California Secure Choice  board members estimated that there are an additional 2 million  uncovered Californians who are contractors or self-employed. For this  reason, California officials said that the Secure Choice program may  allow self-employed workers to opt in.", "Ineligible workers: National industry stakeholders said that the state  efforts would not cover some of the traditionally ineligible  populations\u2014including part-time and temporary workers\u2014at  employers that already offer qualifying employee benefit plans.   Some state efforts that would require employers of a certain size to  offer workplace access, such as California and Illinois, exempt those  employers that already offer employee benefit plans, for which  existing law allows employers to determine which populations are  eligible. By contrast, Maryland\u2019s proposed program would cover  workers who are ineligible for the employee benefit plan offered by  their employer, but only if the employer has 5 or more workers eligible  for the state program.", "Workers who choose not to participate: Since none of the state efforts  we studied would require workers to contribute\u2014all of these efforts  allow workers to either opt in or opt out\u2014some workers will choose  not to participate. As noted above, state efforts that would require the  use of automatic enrollment will likely achieve broader increases in  participation than efforts that allow workers to choose whether to opt  in. For example, one industry study found that 41 percent of those  surveyed postponed saving for retirement in order to pay down  student loan debt. In addition, a member of the California Secure  Choice board said that some workers may not understand the value of  earning investment returns on savings. To help address this, a  California official said that the marketing materials for Secure Choice  would need to clearly explain the benefits of participation.", "Workers with very low earnings who cannot afford to participate:  Several stakeholders noted that it may be difficult for very low income  workers to afford contributions. For example, a representative from  the California Secure Choice board said that lower income workers  may need the money for more immediate expenses. Our prior work  indicates that while Social Security retirement benefits replace a  higher percentage of earnings for lower income workers, this alone  may not ensure an adequate retirement income. In Canada, a  representative of an association representing program providers said  that the PRPP program is targeted to middle income workers, while  lower income workers who are eligible for other federal government  income supplements in retirement. Moreover, a representative of an  employer group noted that the government is motivated to provide  programs to ensure a minimum level of income in retirement because  Canadian provinces assume responsibility for the welfare of their  citizens, and increased purchasing power can have a positive impact  on the overall economy.

For over a decade legal uncertainty has influenced the  design of state efforts. More recently, four of the six states we studied  have enacted legislation to increase coverage in workplace retirement  savings programs and legislators in other states have introduced similar  bills or have studied potential solutions to expand coverage. However,  state and national stakeholders said these efforts face potential  challenges because of legal uncertainties created by existing federal  law\u2014ERISA\u2014and various agency regulations, depending on the type of  program state efforts intend to create (see fig. 10).", "While stakeholders noted multiple issues causing legal uncertainties for  state efforts, the most prevalent and pervasive was ERISA preemption.  Specifically, ERISA preempts, or invalidates, any and all state laws that  \u201crelate to\u201d any private-sector employee benefit plan. Generally, the  \u201crelate to\u201d provision in ERISA could be applicable to state laws that either  directly regulate employee benefit plans or, in some cases, only indirectly  affect such plans. For example, a state law that mandates the way in  which employee benefit plans are administered may be determined to  \u201crelate to\u201d such plans and may, therefore, be preempted. In this way,  ERISA\u2019s preemption provision enables employers to establish uniform  plans and administrative schemes, preventing them from having to  comply with different requirements for employees located in different  states. Whether ERISA preempts a state law has historically been  determined by federal courts,  so states may face litigation. One  national stakeholder indicated that it might be beneficial for a state to  implement a program and go through resulting litigation to resolve some  of the areas of legal uncertainty and clear the way for other states to  implement similar programs. However, other state and national  stakeholders were concerned about the potential consequences for  workers and employers should an implemented program later be  preempted. Noted implications for employers and workers included that  the state program might lose its preferential tax treatment or create risk  for employers that choose to offer the programs. Given these implications  of uncertainty regarding ERISA preemption, state efforts to expand  access to millions of workers and address the retirement savings shortfall  may be delayed or deterred.", "Based on our interviews with state and national stakeholders and  government officials, none of the state efforts we reviewed are immune  from legal uncertainty caused by ERISA preemption, but the type of  uncertainty differs depending on the details of the state efforts.", "Employee benefit plan programs. For states that are attempting to  use an employee benefit plan, such as a 401(k) plan or SIMPLE IRA,  DOL officials told us that it is unclear whether a state could create a  program without being preempted by ERISA because it is unclear  what level of state effort would \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans.  For example, Massachusetts is the furthest along implementing an  effort that would create a 401(k) plan that not-for-profit employers with  20 or fewer employees could adopt, but national stakeholders had  mixed opinions about whether its program will be preempted if legally  challenged. Among other things, a Massachusetts official said that the  state plans to take on administrative responsibilities and oversight of  the program\u2019s service providers and will charge employers who  choose to offer the program, but employers will still be plan  fiduciaries.", "Payroll deduction IRA programs. Partly to avoid uncertainty caused  by ERISA preemption, four of the six states we examined would  create programs using payroll deduction IRAs because by complying  with relevant DOL regulations such IRAs are not employee benefit  plans and are not subject to ERISA. However, programs relying on  payroll deduction IRAs could run into similar preemption uncertainty  as state efforts with employee benefit plans because the DOL  regulation does not address some key questions. First, the regulation  was promulgated primarily to provide guidance to employers and, as  DOL officials noted, it does not specify whether a state can offer  payroll deduction IRAs to private sector workers. In addition, DOL  officials said the regulation does not address whether certain program  features states intend to use would cause the programs to be  considered employee benefit plans. For example, some states  would like to capitalize on the potential advantages of using automatic  enrollment for workers and requiring certain employers to offer  workplace access to retirement savings programs. If these features  cause the programs to be considered employee benefit plans,  stakeholders said there would be uncertainty regarding preemption.", "To address this uncertainty, state and national stakeholders thought DOL  and Treasury should provide guidance and one thought DOL should  clarify its regulation on payroll deduction IRAs. On July 13, 2015, the  President announced that DOL will propose a set of rules by the end of  the year to provide a clear path forward for states to create retirement  savings programs. DOL officials said the agency\u2019s role is limited under  ERISA without further Congressional action\u2014it can revise and  promulgate regulations but there is nothing in ERISA that would allow it to  waive preemption for state efforts. In one case, Illinois law explicitly  requires the state to request an opinion or ruling from DOL on the status  of the program with respect to ERISA before the program can be  implemented. An Illinois stakeholder said that the state does not have to  wait for a DOL opinion to implement the program, but implementation  would stop if DOL sent a letter saying the Illinois program had to comply  with ERISA. While Illinois and other states may reach out to DOL for an  opinion, in June 2015, DOL officials told us they had not received any  such requests. Even if they did, DOL officials said the department does  not have a formal process for issuing such opinions, and the opinion  would not necessarily be binding in court. As a result, DOL\u2019s opinion may  not give states the level of certainty regarding preemption they need to  proceed.", "Similarly, state and national stakeholders said state experimentation with  various approaches could help determine which work best for expanding  coverage in workplace retirement savings programs, so some have called  for increased flexibility with respect to ERISA preemption. Given the need  of many workers to increase their retirement savings, and limitations on  DOL\u2019s ability to provide flexibility regarding ERISA preemption,  stakeholders have suggested a number of ways to address uncertainty  and facilitate state efforts to expand coverage in workplace retirement  savings programs:", "Amend ERISA\u2019s preemption provision. Some stakeholders  suggested Congress could amend ERISA\u2019s preemption provision by  adding an exception for state efforts that expand coverage in  workplace retirement savings programs.", "Pilot program. DOL officials told us a pilot program proposed in the  Fiscal Year 2016 President\u2019s Budget Submission, issued February 2,  2015, could help identify actions states could take to effectively  expand coverage in workplace retirement savings programs and  determine if new, or changes to, DOL regulations or guidance are  needed. Under this proposal DOL would select a small number of  states to implement different approaches to increasing coverage in  workplace retirement savings programs. As part of such a pilot  program, DOL officials said the department would need statutory  authority from Congress to temporarily waive ERISA preemption for  the pilot program timeframe in the selected states. They said some of  the appropriations DOL may receive pursuant to the program, should  it be authorized, could be used to fund start-up costs for state efforts  given the potential implementation challenges noted by states. A key  part of the pilot program would also involve data collection on state  efforts to provide government and experts an opportunity to see which  strategies will actually increase coverage before making more  permanent changes to permit state efforts.", "Safe harbor. DOL and a national stakeholder said Congress could  authorize DOL to establish a regulatory safe harbor for certain state  efforts. DOL officials said the pilot program could even be considered  a less permanent version of a safe harbor\u2014albeit limited to a small  number of states. To address other areas of legal uncertainty under  ERISA, Congress has sometimes authorized DOL to prescribe safe  harbors setting out conditions under which entities can operate  without running afoul of the law. For example, PPA provided for DOL  to prescribe by regulation a safe harbor for plans adopting automatic  enrollment that, among other things, invest plan contributions in a  qualified default investment alternative (QDIA).

Without this coverage, a  significant number of Americans face the prospect of financial insecurity  in retirement, and federal and state safety net programs face the potential  for bearing increased financial burdens. Despite several major changes to  federal law during the last few decades, federal action has not spurred  such an increase in coverage. Recognizing this need to increase  coverage, and thereby increase retirement savings, some states have  undertaken efforts that would require or encourage employers to expand  access to workplace retirement savings programs. However, the existing  framework of federal law and regulation was not designed to foster a  state role in providing coverage to private sector workers, and the  resulting uncertainties about the application of that framework raise  questions about the future and success of such efforts. Changes at the  federal level\u2014Congressional action combined with revised regulations  and guidance within the authority of relevant agencies, particularly DOL\u2014  could help address these uncertainties. These actions would require  difficult policy choices and involve weighing the benefits of uniformity and  consistency provided by ERISA preemption against the potential value of  state efforts to adopt innovative approaches to address the lack of  sufficient retirement savings by their citizens.

It might also set a precedent for additional exceptions that  could diminish the nationwide uniformity and stability the preemption  provision is intended to create. Alternatively, a pilot program could permit  states to test, with DOL involvement, innovative approaches to increasing  coverage. However, by their very nature, pilot programs involve a limited  number of states and therefore would not create certainty for states not  included in the pilot that wish to expand coverage. Pilot programs are  generally temporary in nature so even included states may not have the  benefit of long-term certainty about the feasibility of their efforts. Finally,  through the creation of a statutorily authorized safe harbor, DOL could  identify a small number of options available to states that would not run  afoul of ERISA\u2019s preemption provision, thereby retaining some degree of  ERISA uniformity for employers.

For example, Maryland\u2019s  Task Force found that the best way to minimize administrative burden on  small employers is to use their existing payroll process. While some  stakeholders were concerned with employers\u2019 payroll deduction  capabilities, research shows that the majority of employers already use  electronic payroll services. Because of this, state and national  stakeholders told us that deducting and remitting contributions from a  worker\u2019s paycheck would not substantially increase the burden or cost for  most employers. However, California stakeholders noted that using  employers\u2019 existing payroll processes would create a large state role in  educating employers about their responsibilities and collecting payroll  deductions. For example, the California Secure Choice program would  need to be able to accept contributions from millions of small employers  and one stakeholder noted that the program would likely have to deal with  privacy issues if employers use tax identification information to remit  payments. However, some states hoped to utilize the experience of state  agencies that accept payroll deduction for other employer deductions and  payments. For example, board members said that the California Secure  Choice program may utilize the services of the state\u2019s Employment  Development Department that already collects employment taxes from  employers in the state.

Inland Revenue, New Zealand\u2019s  tax collection agency, is the interface between employers and providers,  which officials said simplifies the administrative role for employers.

As a result, each of these state efforts allows  the smallest employers to choose whether to participate in the program.  In particular, states that are considering requiring employers to offer  workplace access have exempted the smallest employers from the  requirement, but would allow them to choose to offer access to the  program. For example, Illinois law exempts employers with fewer than 25  employees and California law exempts employers with fewer than 5  employees. Stakeholders did note a drawback to allowing small  employers\u2014as well as self-employed workers\u2014to choose whether to  offer the state program. Specifically, if too few employers choose to offer  a purely voluntary program, it may not be able to achieve the scale  necessary to ensure that costs are reasonable.", "In contrast, some of the countries we studied required even small  employers to offer workplace access but they took other actions to  recognize the resource limitations of small employers, including phasing  in the employer requirement and creating specific programs that support  small employers. For example, in the U.K. the employer requirement to  offer access and automatically enroll workers is being phased in gradually  between October 2012 and February 2018 based on employer size,  which provides smaller employers additional time to prepare for meeting  the new requirements. However, without any other action by the  government, U.K officials concluded that small employers may find it  difficult to meet the automatic enrollment requirements because of a  supply gap\u2014the Pensions Commission concluded that existing providers  would find it unprofitable to serve employers that did not previously offer  workers access, the overwhelming majority of which had fewer than 15  employees, at a reasonable cost to workers. To address the supply gap,  it created the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) to ensure that  all employers, particularly small employers, would have access to a low- cost program, with the added benefit of diminishing the burden on  employers of choosing an appropriate provider (see text box 1). Similarly,  the Australian government recognized the specific needs of small  employers by creating a Small Business Superannuation Clearing House  in 2010 to simplify administrative requirements and lessen the  administrative burden on small employers. The Clearing House is a free  service that allows eligible employers to make one payment at least  quarterly on behalf of all of the employer\u2019s workers. The Clearing House  then disburses the payments to each of the worker\u2019s choice of fund (see  text box 2).", "Text Box 1: The United Kingdom\u2019s National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) has a  public service obligation to accept any employer (and any qualifying worker) that wishes to  use it, and in this way serves all those employers and workers who are unable to find  another provider of a retirement savings program. The existence of a low-cost program  with a universal public service obligation reduces the burden on small employers who  might otherwise expend considerable time and effort in identifying a provider willing to  serve them at an acceptable cost. In addition, there are no charges for employers to set  up and use NEST. Finally, NEST has worked with the major payroll software providers in  the United Kingdom to integrate their platforms with NEST in order to reduce data  compliance burdens on employers. NEST representatives thought that this effort could  make NEST even easier to use for small employers.", "Text Box 2: Australian officials explained that the Small Business Superannuation  Clearing House was set up to help employers make contributions on behalf of their  workers as required by the Australian Superannuation system. They thought that these  contributions could represent a heavy administrative burden for small employers because  workers are allowed to choose the provider to which they want the employer to send their  contributions, employers must make payments at least quarterly, and superannuation  providers all have slightly different forms and payment delivery methods. Created in 2010,  the purpose of the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House was to simplify  administrative requirements, lessening the administrative burden for small employers\u2014 those with 19 or fewer workers or, from July 1, 2015, those with total income of less than  $2 million Australian dollars (AUD) (about $1.4 million USD). Employers log onto the  Clearing House\u2019s website and are required to complete a one-time registration, after which  their involvement is low. As of July 31, 2015, about 120,000 employers are registered to  use the service, approximately 15 percent of those eligible. The majority of employers who  use the service generally have between 3 and 19 workers. The government has found that  these employers typically do not have payroll software. Officials said that employers who  use the Clearing House say it saves them time and gives them peace of mind because  use of the system guarantees they have met their obligation. The Clearing House is  funded through government appropriations and costs the government about $6 million  AUD annually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Actions to Reduce Administrative Burden for Employers", "paragraphs": ["States would also take other actions to reduce administrative burden for  employers and may be able to learn from other countries\u2019 implementation  experiences, especially those of NEST in the U.K., and their own  experiences with other state savings programs, including college savings  plans and public pension plans (see table 6).", "These actions to reduce administrative burden for employers elevate the  state\u2019s role in the programs, which could create implementation  challenges, including how to fund state actions. Stakeholders generally  noted the importance of the state\u2019s acceptance of some of the employer\u2019s  administrative duties and liability in encouraging employers to offer  workplace access. However, this state role is particularly important for  efforts that would require eligible employers to participate, such as in  California, Illinois, and Maryland. While enabling legislation provides the  intent and the direction of these state programs, the state effort\u2019s  governing body will have to make many decisions to develop and  implement the programs, including how to educate employers about their  responsibilities. In three of the four states we studied that had enacted  such legislation\u2014Massachusetts, California, and Illinois\u2014the states have  already taken or planned at least 2 years to study options and design  their programs. In addition, stakeholders noted that the six states we  reviewed would likely incur potentially significant startup and ongoing  costs and saw potential challenges in determining how to fund those  costs. For example, a California official expects the feasibility study and  related legal analysis will cost $1 million, but total startup costs could be  much larger. Since the feasibility study has to be funded without a state  appropriation, the state official said that an immediate challenge was to  raise the necessary funds for the feasibility study so they could better  determine cost estimates for developing the program and ongoing  administration. The U.K. recently dealt with this issue when it created  NEST and received a loan from the government. A NEST representative  said it had spent about 300 million British pounds (GBP) (about $459  million USD) over the last 2.5 years to (1) develop systems infrastructure  and architecture; (2) enroll employers; and (3) fund the program in the  first few years while contributions are very low. For the latter, the NEST  representative said that current members are contributing 2 percent of  their generally low wage\u2014at these rates contributions could be 20 GBP  (about $31 USD) a month\u2014so NEST does not receive revenue from  these accounts to pay back the loan and, in fact, runs into a cash flow  shortfall.

And finally, we looked at the likelihood of  participating in retirement programs among workers who were offered  programs and eligible for them. In all of these analyses, we estimated  how these different likelihoods were associated with different  characteristics of the workers, including their income, occupation,  education, age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, the size of the firm  they worked for, whether they worked full-time or part-time, whether they  worked for the full year or only part of the year, and whether they were or  were not union members.", "For our analyses, we used publicly available data from the Survey of  Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from 2012, as shown in tables  9 \u2013 12 of this appendix. To correct for under-reporting of participation we  also used W-2 data as described in appendix I. Results from the public  use data and W-2 data were very similar in the size and significance of  variables included in our analysis, as shown in table 13 at the end of this  appendix. In all of the tables, the numbers and estimates derived from  them use weighted data to reflect population estimates, using weights  provided by SIPP."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Likelihood of Participating", "paragraphs": ["Table 9 shows how various categories of workers differ in their likelihood  (expressed both as percentages and odds) of participating in retirement  programs. In the first column of numbers in the table we show the number  of workers in each group (or category) defined by the different factors.  The next two columns of numbers reflect the percentages in each group  that were and were not participating in retirement programs. The  traditional way of comparing groups involves considering the difference in  those percentages, and those differences are in many cases quite  sizable. For example, only 14 percent of the workers in the lowest income  quartile were participating in retirement programs, while 76 percent of the  workers in the highest income quartile were participating in retirement  programs. Only 18 percent of workers with less than a high school  diploma, but 62 percent of workers with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, were  participating in retirement programs. And while only 23 percent of the  workers in firms with fewer than 50 workers were participating in  retirement programs, 60 percent of workers in firms with more than 1,000  workers were retirement program participants. Sizable differences also  exist between most of the categories of workers defined by the other  characteristics shown in the table.", "An alternative method of estimating the likelihood of participating in  retirement programs and the differences in those likelihoods between  groups involves calculating odds and odds ratios. The odds on  participating (vs. not participating) in retirement programs are calculated  by taking, overall or for any one group, the number (or percent) of  workers participating in retirement programs and dividing it by the number  (or percent) of workers not participating in retirement programs. Overall,  using the percentages in the final row of table 9, the odds on participating  in retirement programs in our (weighted) sample of workers is 45.4 \u00f7 54.6  = .832, apart from rounding. While somewhat different and less  traditional than percentages, the odds have a fairly direct and simple  interpretation: In this case it implies that overall there are .83 retirement  program participants for every 1 non-participant, or 83 participants for  every 100 non-participants. In the fourth column of numbers in table 9, we  show the odds on participating for each subgroup defined by the different  worker characteristics shown in the table. There we see, for example, that  the odds on participating in retirement programs increases from 0.167 for  workers in the lowest income quartile to 0.514 for workers in the second  income quartile to 1.338 for workers in the third income quartile and,  finally, to 3.176 for workers in the highest income quartile.", "The unadjusted odds ratios in the penultimate column of table 9 show  how the odds on participating in retirement programs vary across the  different subgroups. Where the factors or worker characteristics  distinguish only two groups, like union membership, we simply take the  ratio of the odds for one group to the other \u2013 e.g., 2.103 \u00f7 0.774 = 2.72,  which implies that the odds on union members participating in retirement  programs are 2.7 times higher than the odds for workers who are not  union members. Where the factors involve more than two subgroups, we  choose one subgroup as the referent category and calculated the ratios of  the odds for the other subgroups relative to that one. To make  comparisons across income categories, for example, the lowest income  quartile was chosen as the referent category, and the ratios shown for the  other subgroups (i.e., 0.514 \u00f7 0.167 = 3.08; 1.338 \u00f7 0.167 = 8.01; and  3.176 \u00f7 0.167 = 19.01) indicate that workers in the second, third, and  highest income quartiles have higher odds on participating than workers  in the lowest quartile, by factors of 3, 8, and 19, respectively. The full set  of unadjusted odds ratios shown in the table indicate that virtually all of  the subgroups differ from one another, in most cases significantly, and in  many cases by a substantively large amount. Workers in the broad  category of occupations involving Management, Business, Science, and  Arts, for example, were 6.5 times as likely to be participating in retirement  plans (or have odds that are 6.5 times higher) as workers working in  Service occupations. Workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees were 2.7 times as  likely as workers with less than a high school education to be participating  in retirement programs. And, to offer a final example, Hispanics were less  likely than white non-Hispanics to be participating in a retirement program  by a factor of 0.37.", "These unadjusted odds ratios may seem to inflate the differences  between groups, especially to those who are accustomed to comparing  percentages. That is, while the odds ratio comparing workers in the  highest and lowest income quartiles suggests a 19-fold difference  between the two groups, there is only slightly more than a 5-fold  difference between the two groups in the percentage participating (i.e.,  76.1 \u00f7 14.3 = 5.3). Focusing on the difference between groups in the  percent participating, however, ignores the implicit difference in the  percent not participating between groups, which differed by a factor of  23.9 \u00f7 85.7 = 0.28. One advantage of the odds ratio (also referred to as  the cross-product ratio) is that in estimating the ratios of participants to  non-participants it makes fuller use of the data involved in the  comparisons, and considers both differences at once. In fact, the odds  ratio we obtain in this case, equal to 19.01, could just as easily have been  obtained by taking the ratio of these two percentage differences (i.e., 5.3  \u00f7 0.28 = 19.01, apart from rounding)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regression Results", "paragraphs": ["Another advantage of odds ratios is that, unlike percentage differences,  they can be adjusted using multivariate models (logistic regression  models) so that they reflect the net effect of each variable, rather than the  gross (or unadjusted) effect. The odds ratios in the final column of table 9  show how different the odds on participating are when we consider all of  the variables in the table simultaneously. Because of the correlations  among some of the variables in the table (like income and education), the  effects of the different variables, or the differences between the  categories of workers they define, are in many cases substantially  attenuated (or smaller) when we look at them simultaneously than when  we look at each individually.  The odds ratio estimating the income  difference just discussed, for example, is reduced when we estimate its  effect net of the other variables, from 19.0 to 6.8. Even after adjusting the  ratios to take account of the interrelatedness of many of the factors in the  table, most of the subgroups compared remain significantly different from  one another, and in many cases the differences are sizable. In addition to  the income difference mentioned above we find, even after adjustment,  that the likelihood of participating varies significantly for many of the  variables we examined (see table 9). For example:  1.  Workers in all other occupational categories have significantly higher  odds on participating in retirement programs than workers in Service  occupations, and the odds are nearly twice as high (OR = 1.95) for  workers in Management, Business, Science, and Arts occupations as  for those in Service occupations.  2.  Workers with less than a high school diploma were less likely (by a  factor of 0.6) than those with less than a high school education to be  participating, though after adjustment those with some college or with  a Bachelor\u2019s degree are not statistically distinguishable from those  with a high school diploma.  3.  Workers in larger firms had higher odds on participating in retirement  programs than workers in smaller firms. Workers in firms with 51 to  100 workers were about twice as likely (OR = 2.1) as workers in firms  with 50 or fewer workers to participate, and workers in firms with more  than 1,000 workers were about five times (OR = 4.9) as likely.  4.  The youngest category of workers (ages 18-24) were only roughly  one-third as likely (OR =0.37) as workers 25-34 to be participating in  retirement programs; workers 35-44 were not significantly different  from workers 25-34; and workers 45-54 and 55-64 were both more  likely than those 25-34 to be participating in retirement programs, in  both cases by a factor of 1.4. Workers 65 and over had lower odds on  participating than all groups except the very youngest, and odds that  were lower than workers 25-34 by a factor of 0.68.  5.  Additionally, full-time workers were 1.6 times more likely than part- time workers to be participating in retirement programs; full-year  workers were 2.5 times more likely than part-year workers to be  participating in retirement programs; and union workers were twice as  likely (OR = 2.0) as non-union workers to be participating in retirement  plans.  6.  Finally, male workers were less likely than female workers to be  participating in retirement programs, by a factor of 0.91; currently  married workers were 1.2 times more likely than never married  workers to be participating in retirement programs, while widowed,  divorced, and separated workers were not significantly different from  those who were never married; and Black, Hispanic, and Asian  workers had lower odds on participating than White, non-Hispanic  workers, by factors of 0.8, 0.6, and 0.7, respectively.", "Some of these differences in the likelihood of participating in retirement  programs are likely due to the fact that some categories of workers are  more likely than others to work for employers that offer retirement  programs. Table 10 shows that a great many categories of workers differ  in terms of whether their employer offers a program. As in the table  above, the unadjusted odds ratios indicating the differences between  groups in the odds on their employers offering a program (in the  penultimate column of the table) tend to be somewhat larger than the  adjusted odds ratios, or the odds ratios obtained from multivariate models  in which all of the different factors are considered simultaneously using a  multivariate model (in the final column). But even the adjusted odds ratios  reveal some sizable and significant differences, including the following:  1.  Workers with higher incomes are more likely to work for employers  that offer retirement programs. Workers in the 2nd, 3rd, and highest  income quartiles have higher odds on working for employers that offer  retirement programs than workers in the lowest income quartile, by  factors of 1.7, 2.7, and 3.9, respectively.  2.  Workers in all occupational categories except for Natural Resources,  Construction, and Maintenance Occupations have significantly higher  odds on working for employers that offer retirement programs than  workers in Service occupations, and the odds are nearly twice as high  (OR = 2.0) for workers in Management, Business, Science, and Arts  occupations as for those in Service occupations.  3.  Workers with less than a high school education were less likely to  work for employers that offer retirement programs than those with a  high school diploma, by a factor of 0.73, while workers with some  college or a Bachelor\u2019s degree were more likely (in both cases) by a  factor of roughly 1.2.  4.  Workers in larger firms had substantially higher odds on working for  employers that offer retirement programs than workers in smaller  firms. Workers in firms with 51 to 100 workers were about three times  as likely (OR = 2.95) as workers in firms with 50 or fewer workers to  work for employers that offer retirement programs, workers in firms  with 101 to 500 workers and with 501 to 1,000 workers were 5 and 6  times as likely, respectively, and workers in firms with more than  1,000 workers were about 9 times (OR = 9.1) as likely to work for  employers that offer retirement programs.  5.  The youngest category of workers (ages18-24) were only roughly  three-fourths as likely (OR =0.76) as workers 25-34 to be working for  employers that offer retirement programs; workers 35-44 were also  somewhat less likely than workers 25-34 to work for employers that  offer retirement programs (OR = 0.88); and workers 45-54 and 55-64  did not significantly differ from those 25-34 in working for employers  that offer retirement programs. Workers 65 and over had lower odds  on working for employers that offer retirement programs than all  groups, and odds that were lower than workers 18-24 by a factor of  0.62.  6.  Additionally, full-time workers were 1.2 times more likely than part- time workers to be working for employers that offer retirement  programs; full-year workers were 1.5 times more likely than part-year  workers to be working for employers that offer retirement programs,  and union workers were twice as likely (OR = 2.0) as non-union  workers to be working for employers that offer retirement programs.  7.  Finally, male workers and female workers did not significantly differ in  their chance of working for employers that offer retirement programs  (OR = 0.96); currently married workers were slightly but significantly  (OR = 1.1) more likely than never married workers to be working for  employers that offer retirement programs, while widowed, divorced,  and separated workers were not significantly different from those who  were never married; and Black, Hispanic, and Asian workers had  lower odds on working for employers that offer retirement programs  than White, non-Hispanic workers, by factors of 0.8, 0.6, and 0.6,  respectively.", "Some of these differences in the likelihood of participating in retirement  programs are also likely due to the fact that some categories of workers  are more likely than others to be eligible for the retirement programs that  their employers offer. Table 11 shows that a number of categories of  workers differ in terms of whether they are eligible for the retirement  programs their employers offer, though fewer factors are significantly  associated with eligibility than participation. The differences that do exist,  like those described above, are in virtually all cases somewhat smaller  when we estimate them simultaneously than when we estimate them  separately; nonetheless, the odds ratios from the multivariate models  indicate that:  1.  Workers with higher incomes are more likely to be eligible for the  retirement programs their employers offer than workers with lower  incomes. Workers in the 2nd, 3rd, and highest income quartiles have  higher odds on being eligible than workers in the lowest quartile, by  factors of 2.0, 4.4, and 7.5, respectively.  2.  Occupation was not significantly associated with whether workers  were eligible for the retirement programs their employers offer.  Education was significantly related to eligibility, however; workers with  some college and with a college degree were less likely than those  with a high school degree to be eligible, by factors of 0.8 and 0.7,  respectively.  3.  Workers in mid-size firms were not significantly different from workers  in the smallest firms in their chance of being eligible for the retirement  programs their employers offer, though workers in firms with more  than 1,000 workers were 1.3 times as likely to be eligible as workers  in firms with 50 or fewer workers.  4.  The youngest category of workers (ages 18-24) were less than one- half as likely (OR = 0.44) as workers 25-34 to be eligible for retirement  programs their employers offer, while workers 35-44, 45-54, and 55- 64 were more likely to be eligible than those 25-34, by factors of 1.4,  1.6, and 1.6, respectively. Workers 65 and over were less likely to be  eligible than workers 18-24, by a factor of 0.73.  5.  Full-time workers were 2.6 times more likely than part-time workers to  be eligible for the retirement programs their employers offer; full-year  workers were 3.1 times more likely than part-year workers to be  eligible for the retirement programs their employers offer; and union  workers were 1.4 as likely as non-union workers to be eligible for the  retirement programs their employers offer.  6.  Finally, male workers and female workers did not significantly differ in  their chance of being eligible for the retirement programs their  employers offer (OR = 1.1); currently married workers were  significantly more likely (OR = 1.4) than never married workers to be  eligible for the retirement programs their employers offer, while  widowed, divorced, and separated workers were not significantly  different from those who were never married; and race and ethnicity  was not significantly associated with eligibility.", "Given these results indicating that participation in retirement programs is  partly the result of whether programs are offered, and whether workers  are eligible for them, in table 12 we show how various categories of  workers differ in their likelihood of participating in retirement programs  when we restrict our attention to workers whose employers offer  programs for which they are eligible. While differences are in most cases  smaller than they appeared when we looked at all workers, regardless of  whether they worked for companies that offered retirement programs and  whether they were eligible for them, many still remain sizable and  statistically significant. Focusing again on the multivariate odds ratios in  the final column of the table, the results are as follows among those who  were eligible for the programs their employers offered:  1.  Workers with higher incomes are more likely to participate than  workers with lower incomes. Workers in the 2nd, 3rd, and highest  income quartiles have higher odds on participating in retirement  programs than workers in the lowest income quartile, by factors of 1.2,  2.2, and 4.4, respectively.  2.  Workers in all occupational categories except for Production,  Transportation, and Material Moving Occupations have significantly  higher odds on participating in retirement programs than workers in  Service occupations, by factors ranging from 1.3 to 1.5.  3.  Workers with less than a high school diploma were less likely (by a  factor of 0.7) than those with a high school education to be  participating, though after adjustment those with some college or with  a Bachelor\u2019s degree are not significantly different from those with a  high school diploma.  4.  Workers in firms with 51 to 100 workers were somewhat less likely  (OR = 0.75) as workers in firms with 50 or fewer workers to  participate, while workers in each of the larger firm categories (with  more than 100 workers) were not significantly different from the  smallest firms.  5.  The youngest category of workers (ages 18-24) were only roughly  one-half as likely (OR =0.46) as workers 25-34 to be participating in  retirement programs; workers 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64 were more  likely than those 25-34 to be participating in retirement programs, by  factors of 1.3, 1.7, and 1.9, respectively. Workers 65 and over had  odds of participating that were not statistically distinguishable from the  odds for workers 25-34 (OR = 0.9).  6.  Full-time workers were slightly more likely (OR =1.1) than part-time  workers to be participating in retirement programs; full-year workers  were 1.3 times more likely than part-year workers to be participating in  retirement programs, though the result was not statistically significant;  and union workers were 1.7 times as likely as non-union workers to  be participating in retirement programs.  7.  Finally, male workers were less likely than female workers to be  participating in retirement programs, by a factor of 0.8; marital status  was not statistically associated with participation; and Black and  Hispanic workers had lower odds on participating than White, non- Hispanic workers, by factors of roughly 0.7 in both cases. Asians and  other non-Hispanics were not significantly different from Whites.", "Ignoring for the moment the numbers in parentheses, table 13  summarizes how the differences in participating across groups change  when we look at the different group characteristics (1) one at a time  among all workers, (2) all at once among all workers, and (3) all at once  among workers who are eligible for the retirement programs offered by  their employers. Some of the differences that appear sizable and  significant when we look at them in isolation (column 1) diminish in size  and become insignificant when all of the different factors are considered  simultaneously (column 2). This is true of the differences between 1)  workers with more than a high school education vs. workers with only a  high school diploma, 2) workers ages 35-44 vs. workers ages 25-34, 3)  workers who are widowed, divorced, or separated vs. workers who were  never married, and 4) other non-Hispanic workers and white non-Hispanic  workers. Further, some of the differences that remain sizable and  significant even when they are considered simultaneously (column 2)  diminish and become insignificant when we restrict the sample to workers  who were offered programs and were eligible for them (column 3). Such  is the case with the differences between 1) workers in Production,  Transportation, and Material Moving Occupations vs. workers in Service  Occupations, 2) workers in each of the larger firm categories with more  than 100 workers vs. those in firms with 50 or fewer workers, 3) workers  65 and older vs. workers 25-34, 4) full-year vs. part-year workers, 5)  married vs. never married workers, and 6) Asian non-Hispanic vs. white  non-Hispanic workers. Most of the differences that remain significant after  taking account of eligibility, which are noted in the bullets above  associated with table 12, are smaller than they appeared before taking  account of eligibility, though some of the age differences are exceptions  to this. The factors that have the most pronounced effects when they are  considered jointly and restricted to eligible workers are income,  occupation, age, and union membership.", "The numbers in parentheses in the table show these same coefficients  from the same bivariate and multivariate models for the same subgroups  that we obtain when we use the \u201ccorrected\u201d data which combines W-2  information from the Census with the self-reported data from SIPP. In  virtually all cases the coefficients are very similar, and only in a few  instances, involving the adjusted education effect for all workers, and the  adjusted differences between part-time and full-time workers and workers  in firms with 1,000+ workers and in firms with fewer than 50 workers  among those who are eligible, are the estimated odds ratios significant in  one set of results but not in the other.
