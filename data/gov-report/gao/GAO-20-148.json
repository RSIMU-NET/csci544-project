However, the official also acknowledged that a  possible consequence of not managing to estimated FTEs could be a  reduction in future funding for civilian personnel because budget data  provided to Congress for civilian personnel is based on FTE workload and  not the amount of dollars spent on civilian personnel.

Marine Corps officials explained that they were aware of  the variations between their internal FTE data and the DOD budget  request data. The officials further explained that one instance of variation  in the data occurs because the Department of the Navy uses another  database, the Work Year Personnel Cost system, to prepare its annual  budget request, which includes the Marine Corps\u2019 request for civilian  personnel FTEs, before submitting the request to OUSD(C).", "According to the Marine Corps officials, the Work Year Personnel Cost  system automatically deletes error transactions while SABRS does not,  as error transactions in SABRS are manually edited. These types of error  transactions occur because they did not pass one or more edits in  SABRS, did not find the required matching transaction, or have some  other issue that is keeping the transaction from processing. The Marine  Corps corrects error transactions manually while errors transactions in the  Work Year Personnel Cost System are deleted automatically without  correction, which creates differences in the data between the two  systems. Marine Corps officials stated that, as a result, the Work Year  Personnel Cost database typically underestimates Marine Corps civilian  FTEs, and that variations in actual FTE data between the SABRS and  Work Year Personnel Cost databases explains why it appears the Marine  Corps is not reaching its requested civilian personnel FTEs.", "The Marine Corps has not identified or reconciled differences between  internal Marine Corps civilian personnel FTE data compared to data  submitted in the annual budget request.

In its report, the DOD Inspector General found that the Marine  Corps could not justify or support how it determined its civilian personnel  pay requirements for fiscal year 2017\u2019s Marine Corps budget request.  Specifically, the report noted that Marine Corps budget officials could not  fully explain the rationale for their civilian pay budget adjustments.  According to the DOD Inspector General report, the Marine Corps did not  maintain documentation to support these budget adjustments or material  showing how it calculated average basic compensation amounts and  benefit rates. The DOD Inspector General also reported that Marine  Corps officials were unable to explain or provide support regarding the  calculation of the civilian pay dollars and full-time equivalents (FTE)  associated with these adjustments.", "In its unpublished written response to the DOD Inspector General\u2019s  report, the Marine Corps concurred with the DOD Inspector General\u2019s  recommendation that the Marine Corps determine budgeted civilian pay  funding levels using full-time equivalents calculated based on projected  hours to be worked, as required by Office of Management and Budget  Circular A-11. The Marine Corps\u2019 written response also acknowledged  that having source data, assumptions, calculations, and better  documentation related to budget formulation would provide for retention  of institutional knowledge and would benefit budget officials formulating  future budgets. The Marine Corps\u2019 unpublished written response also  stated that it is reviewing other command metrics within the department,  which will be performed throughout the remainder of the present budget  cycle with a plan of implementation during the next budget cycle.", "The DOD Inspector General\u2019s report stated that the Marine Corps did not  determine civilian pay funding levels using FTEs calculated from  projected hours to be worked, as directed in Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) Circular A-11. According to the DOD Inspector General\u2019s  report, in its fiscal year 2017 budget formulation, Marine Corps officials  stated that they considered FTEs to be the same as end strength for  budget formulation purposes, assuming that one person would be on  board for an entire year even though these officials acknowledged that  this was not expected to be the reality during budget execution. As a  result, the DOD Inspector General recommended that the Marine Corps  determine its budgeted civilian pay funding levels using FTEs calculated  as required by OMB Circular A-11 requirements.", "In its unpublished written response to the DOD Inspector General\u2019s  report, the Marine Corps stated that it determines FTEs in accordance  with OMB Circular A-11. Marine Corps Programs & Resources officials  told us that they use cumulative hours paid in a fiscal year divided by the  number of work hours in that fiscal year to generate the number of FTEs  executed. These officials told us that they then divide the cumulative  amount paid by the number of FTEs to receive the average work year  cost for that fiscal year. Marine Corps officials stated that Programs &  Resources budget officials then adjust the civilian personnel budget  request during the Department of Navy pricing tool time frame, typically  reducing FTEs by the recommendation provided by the tool, which uses  18 months of execution data. Marine Corps officials told us that, as result  of the DOD Inspector General\u2019s report, they are working to provide  greater emphasis on FTEs in their budget formulation documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Brenda S.
