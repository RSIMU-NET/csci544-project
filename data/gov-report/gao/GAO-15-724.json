We based our selection of these two countries, among the  10 ASEAN countries, on the amounts of U.S. and Chinese exports and  imports, foreign direct investment (FDI), and development assistance in  each country. We also considered whether a country participated in U.S.  and Chinese trade agreements or was a negotiating partner in the Trans- Pacific Partnership, whether a country was the location of any regional  institutions, whether it was an emerging partner, and whether it was a  South China Sea claimant. The information on foreign law in this report is  not a product of GAO\u2019s original analysis but is derived from interviews  and secondary sources.", "To describe U.S. and Chinese engagement with ASEAN countries, we  analyzed data on U.S. and Chinese trade in goods, trade in services, and  FDI. We also analyzed trade and contract data to determine the extent to  which U.S. and Chinese firms compete. To assess the reliability of these  data, where possible, we cross-checked the data with other sources,  conducted checks on the data for internal consistency, and consulted with  U.S. officials. Because of the limited availability of data and the context  for different sets of data we report, the time period for each set of  reported data varied. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our report and have noted caveats where  appropriate to indicate limitations in the data.", "To obtain data on U.S. and Chinese trade in goods from 1994 through  2014, we accessed the United Nations\u2019 (UN) Commodity Trade  Statistics Database by means of the Department of Commerce\u2019s  (Commerce) Trade Policy Information System. This database  provides data for comparable categories of exports and imports of  goods for the United States and China. In reporting the value of  exports, we used data on total exports, which include re-exports\u2014 goods that are imported but then exported in substantially the same  condition. China does not report export data to the UN Commodity  Trade database that separates re-exports from total exports.  Therefore, we used data on total exports to ensure the comparability  of U.S. and Chinese data on goods exports. For imports, we used  data on general imports, which include goods that clear customs and  goods that enter into bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones. We  determined that data on trade in goods for the United States and  China were generally reliable for comparing trends over time and the  composition of trade.", "To categorize the U.S. and Chinese trade in goods into capital,  intermediate, and consumer goods, we assigned each good from the  UN Commodity Trade database to one of these three categories using  the UN\u2019s Broad Economic Categories. For goods that the UN does not  classify as capital, intermediate, and consumer goods, we created an  unclassified category. For example, the UN does not classify  passenger motor cars as capital or consumer goods.", "We analyzed data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)  on trade in value-added goods and services to illustrate the  importance of accounting for components of a country\u2019s exports that  originate in other countries.", "We analyzed data from the ASEANstats database for 2003, 2008, and  2013 to examine ASEAN countries\u2019 trade in goods with their trading  partners over time. Because some of the ASEAN countries\u2019 trading  partners do not report data to the UN Commodity Trade database, we  used data from the ASEANstats database as a comprehensive set of  data on trade in goods for all of ASEAN countries\u2019 trading partners.  We compared trade data from the ASEANstats database and the UN  Commodity Trade Database and found some differences in values of  bilateral trade between ASEAN countries and their trading partners.  Reasons for the differences include differences in the valuation of  goods and differences in data quality.", "We calculated U.S. trade in services for 2011 and 2012, based on  tabulations prepared for us by the Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic  Analysis (BEA) and other sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau.  BEA's data on trade in services for several categories\u2014travel and  passenger fares, transportation, education, and other private  services\u2014are based on data from various sources. According to BEA,  its survey data are from mandatory surveys of primarily U.S.  businesses with services trade that exceeds certain thresholds. BEA  does not survey a random sample of U.S. businesses and therefore  does not report the data with margins of error. Our estimates of U.S.  trade in services represent broad estimates rather than precise  values. We extrapolated values for certain services at the country  level from broader data (e.g., travel service data are based on  multiplying the number of travelers for a country by data on average  expenditures for travelers and average passenger fees for the region)  We calculated values for other services (e.g., business, professional,  and technical services) from a range of estimates based on survey  data. In instances where the volume of trade for a service was  presented to us as a range, we used the midpoint value to estimate  the volume of trade for that service. In instances where the volume of  trade for a service was presented as a range and described by BEA  as trending upward, we used the lowest value for the earlier years and  the highest value for the later years and assumed that the growth was  linear.", "For China\u2019s trade in services in 2011, we used estimates from the UN  Conference on Trade and Development, the World Trade  Organization (WTO), and the International Trade Centre downloaded  from the International Trade Centre\u2019s Trade Map database. The  estimates for 2009 from the Trade Map database are the same as  data on China\u2019s trade in services from a report by China\u2019s Ministry of  Commerce.", "For data on U.S. firms\u2019 investments from 2007 through 2012, we used  data that we obtained directly from BEA. For Chinese firms\u2019  investments, we used data from the UN Conference on Trade and  Development as reported by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce. To  identify patterns in, and to compare, U.S. and Chinese FDI, we report  U.S. and Chinese data on FDI while noting their limitations. First, as  we have previously reported, both U.S. and Chinese FDI may be  underreported, and experts have expressed particular concern  regarding China\u2019s data. U.S. and Chinese firms set up subsidiaries in places such as the Netherlands and the British Virgin Islands, which  can be used to make investments that are not captured by U.S. and  Chinese data on FDI. Experts state that this could be a significant  source of underreporting for China\u2019s data. For U.S. data, according to  BEA, U.S. data on FDI are based on quarterly, annual, and  benchmark surveys. BEA\u2019s benchmark survey is the most  comprehensive survey of such investment and covers the universe of  U.S. FDI. According to BEA, quarterly and annual surveys cover  samples of businesses with FDI that exceed certain thresholds. BEA  does not survey a random sample of businesses and therefore does  not report the data with margins of error; therefore, we have not  reported margins of error. Second, China does not report its definition  of FDI when reporting its data. However, the types of data included by  China in its FDI (e.g., equity investment data and reinvested earnings  data) appear similar to data reported for U.S. FDI, which the United  States defines on the basis of the OECD definition of FDI. Despite  these limitations, various reports, including those published by  international organizations such as the IMF, government agencies,  academic experts, and other research institutions, use China\u2019s  reported investment data to describe China\u2019s FDI activities. In  addition, despite some potential underreporting of FDI data, we  determined that the U.S. FDI data were reliable for reporting general  patterns, when limitations are noted.", "Given challenges in determining appropriate deflators for some data, we  used nominal rather than inflation-adjusted values for U.S. and Chinese  trade and for investments in ASEAN countries. However, we did test to  see what the impact would be of deflating these data and found that  deflating these values made a limited difference in describing the overall  trends. For example, if the goods trade values that we report were  adjusted using the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) deflator, total  Chinese trade in goods would surpass total U.S. trade in goods in 2007\u2014 similar to trends we found in nominal trade values. U.S. total trade in  goods increased by a factor of 2.4 from 1994 through 2013 if not adjusted  for inflation and by a factor of 1.7 if adjusted for inflation. Over the same  period, Chinese total trade in goods increased by a factor of 30.9 if not  adjusted for inflation and by a factor of 21.4 if adjusted for inflation.", "To determine the extent to which U.S. and Chinese firms compete in  ASEAN countries, we interviewed U.S. agency and private sector  representatives and analyzed available data. To assess the extent to  which exporters from the United States, China, and other countries  compete, we calculated an export similarity index to compare U.S.,  Chinese, and other countries\u2019 exports to ASEAN countries from 2001  through 2014. The export similarity index is a measure of the similarity of  exports from two countries to a third country. For example, to calculate  the index for U.S. and Chinese exports to ASEAN countries, for each type  of good that the United States and China exports, we first calculate the  share of that good in the United States\u2019 and China\u2019s total exports to  ASEAN countries. We then identify the minimum of the United States\u2019 and  China\u2019s shares. The index is the sum of the minimum shares for all types  of goods that the United States and China export to ASEAN countries.  We used data on goods exports from the UN Commodity Trade database  at the four-digit level and calculated each country\u2019s export of a particular  good as a share of that country\u2019s total exports to ASEAN countries.", "We also analyzed data from Commerce\u2019s Advocacy Center on host- government contracts and data for contracts funded by the Asian  Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank. Although these data  represent a small share of activity in the region, they provide insights into  the degree of competition between U.S. and Chinese firms for the  projects represented.", "Commerce\u2019s Advocacy Center data were for a limited number of  cases (184) where U.S. firms requested the agency\u2019s assistance in  bidding for host-government contracts in ASEAN countries in 2009  through 2014. Because these data included the nationality of other  firms bidding on a host-government contract, we used this information  to determine the extent to which Chinese firms or firms of other  nations were competing with U.S. firms for these contracts. We  counted the numbers of contracts and summed the value of contracts  in the Advocacy Center data for which each foreign country\u2019s firms  competed against U.S. firms. We excluded 12 contracts for which the  nationality of competitors was not identified, and in cases where the  U.S. firm(s) competed against a consortium of firms from different  countries, we counted the whole value of the contract in each  country\u2019s total. We also used the Advocacy Center\u2019s classification of  contracts by sector to determine the sectors in which Chinese firms  competed for the highest proportion of contracts. To determine the  reliability of these data, we manually checked the data for missing  values and reviewed information about how the data were collected.  In addition, we interviewed Advocacy Center staff about the data.  Advocacy Center staff told us that data from before 2010 may be less  complete, because the center switched databases at that time, and  some contracts that had been closed may not have been transferred.  Overall, we found the data to be reliable for reporting on competition  between U.S. and other firms, including Chinese firms, in ASEAN  countries.", "The World Bank publishes data on the value, sector, and suppliers of  its contracts in ASEAN countries. We used the World Bank\u2019s  classification of contracts into procurement categories (goods, civil  works, consultant services, and nonconsultant services) to compare  the value and types of contracts that U.S. and Chinese firms were  awarded from 2001 through 2014. However, we combined the  consultant services and nonconsultant services categories into one  category that we titled \u201cconsultant and other services\u201d. The data  include contracts (generally large-value) that World Bank staff  reviewed before the contracts were awarded. We analyzed all  contracts in individual ASEAN countries as well as Mekong and  ASEAN regional contracts. To determine the reliability of these data,  we electronically checked the data for missing values and possible  errors. We also contacted World Bank personnel to determine how  the data were collected and any limitations of the data. We found that  the data for contracts funded by the World Bank were generally  reliable for the purpose of demonstrating U.S. and Chinese  competition in ASEAN countries over time.", "To compare the value and types of contracts obtained by U.S. and  Chinese firms, we used ADB\u2019s published data on the value, sector,  and recipient of its contracts for consulting services, goods, and civil  works provided as technical assistance or funded by loans and grants  to ASEAN countries in 2013 and 2014. We also included regional  contracts for Southeast Asia or the Greater Mekong Subregion in our  analysis. ADB publishes data only for consulting contracts over $0.1  million in value and other contracts over $1.0 million, so our analysis  of ADB contracts does not include some smaller ADB contracts. In  addition, a portion of the ADB data did not have the contracts  classified according to the nature of the contract (construction,  consulting services, goods, turnkey, and others). Therefore, we  classified contracts obtained by U.S. and Chinese firms that were  missing these categories according to those used in the rest of the  data. To determine the reliability of these data, we checked the data  for missing values and other types of discrepancies. We found that  the ADB data were generally reliable for our purpose of reporting on  U.S. and Chinese competition in ASEAN countries in 2013 and 2014.", "To examine the actions that the U.S. and Chinese governments have  taken to further economic engagement, we reviewed regional and country  studies and U.S., Chinese, and ASEAN agency documents and  interviewed U.S. and third-country officials, officials from private sector  business associations, and experts from think tanks. We tried to arrange  visits with Chinese government officials in the ASEAN countries we  visited and in Washington, D.C.; however, they were unable to  accommodate our requests for a meeting. U.S. agencies included in the  scope of our study are the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA),  Commerce, State (State), and the Treasury; the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR); the Millennium Challenge Corporation; the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID); the Export-Import Bank of  the United States (Ex-Im); the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  (OPIC); and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.", "To obtain information about U.S. and Chinese trade agreements with  ASEAN countries, we reviewed the trade agreements; U.S., Chinese,  and ASEAN documents; academic and government studies; prior  GAO reports; and documents from multilateral organizations, such as  the WTO. We also interviewed U.S. officials in Indonesia and  Vietnam, officials from private sector business associations, and  experts from think tanks. To calculate examples of tariff reductions  from these trade agreements, we used data on trade in goods from  the UN Commodity Trade database to identify top traded goods and  data from the WTO and the U.S. International Trade Commission on  U.S., Chinese, and ASEAN countries\u2019 tariffs.", "To calculate the percentage of world goods trade for the participants  in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, the Regional  Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations, and the North  American Free Trade Agreement, we used data on trade in goods  from the UN Commodity Trade Database. As of July 2015, some  countries such as Malaysia and Italy had not reported data on trade in  goods for 2013, so we used the average of those countries\u2019 available  data from 2010 through 2012 as an estimate of its 2013 trade in  goods.so we excluded it from the calculations. To calculate the total  population and percentage of world GDP for these participants, we  used data on population and GDP from the World Bank\u2019s World  Development Indicators.", "In addition, Laos did not report data for 2010 through 2013,", "To obtain information about U.S. financing, we compiled Ex-Im and  OPIC data from these agencies\u2019 annual reports and congressional  budget justifications and interviewed agency officials to provide  additional context and to clarify elements of the data. Where relevant,  we note that additional Ex-Im insurance may include ASEAN  countries but do not include these in our totals. To determine the  reliability of these data, we interviewed agency officials and checked  their published annual reports against agency-provided summary data  to determine any limitations of the data or discrepancies in the data.  We determined that data from Ex-Im and OPIC were generally reliable  to present trends and aggregate amounts by year.", "To document U.S. efforts to provide export promotion services in  ASEAN countries, we reviewed State\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual and  information about Commerce and USDA\u2019s export promotion policies  and trade missions. We also interviewed State, Commerce, and  USDA officials in Washington, D.C., and in Vietnam and Indonesia.  We obtained data from State, Commerce, and USDA on the agencies\u2019  staffing in ASEAN countries. To determine the reliability of the data,  we obtained information about how the data were collected and  tabulated. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to  show staffing trends over time (see app. IV).", "To document Chinese financing and support for firms, we used  publicly available information from the websites of the Export-Import  Bank of China, the China Development Bank, and the China Export &  Credit Insurance Corporation. We converted financing numbers from  Chinese yuan to U.S. dollars using exchange rates reported by the  Federal Reserve. We supplemented this information with estimates  from U.S. Ex-Im on Chinese export finance in 2013.

To determine the reliability of U.S.  development assistance data, we interviewed a knowledgeable  USAID official about the definitions and collection of the data. We  determined that U.S. development assistance data were generally  reliable for showing the trends and composition of aid to ASEAN  countries over time. China\u2019s white paper does not break out the data  that it provides by country; thus, we were unable to provide data on  China\u2019s provision of aid to ASEAN countries.", "To document U.S. support for economic development and integration  in ASEAN countries, we used the USAID trade capacity building  (TCB) database to capture U.S. development assistance efforts  related to trade in ASEAN countries and at the ASEAN Secretariat.  USAID collects data to identify and quantify the U.S. government\u2019s  TCB activities in developing countries through an annual survey of  agencies on behalf of USTR. We also reviewed agency project  summaries and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C.,  Indonesia, and Vietnam. Where relevant, we noted that funds  provided in a larger region (for example, funds provided to the East  Asia and Pacific region) may include ASEAN countries, but we did not  include these regional funds in our totals.
