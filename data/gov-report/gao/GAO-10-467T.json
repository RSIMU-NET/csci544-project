California's cities and counties are also struggling with budget problems. According to officials from the City of Los Angeles and County of Sacramento, Recovery Act funds are helping to preserve essential services and repair infrastructure but have generally not helped stabilize their base budgets. (2) Transportation Infrastructure: According to California officials, 100 percent of California's $2.570 billion highway infrastructure Recovery Act apportionment has been obligated. The state has dedicated most of these funds for pavement improvements--including resurfacing and rehabilitating roadways. (3) Weatherization Assistance: As of January 25, 2010, California had awarded about $66 million to 35 local service providers throughout the state for weatherization activities. State and federal requirements, such as prevailing wage rates, as well as the implementation of these requirements, have delayed weatherization and, as of February 26, 2010, the state had weatherized only 849 homes--less than 2 percent of the 43,000 homes that are estimated to be weatherized with Recovery Act funds. (4) Education: As of February 19, 2010, California had distributed approximately $4.7 billion for three education programs, including the SFSF. Local education agencies plan to use more than half of these funds to retain jobs; however, a majority reported that they still expect job losses. Also, cash management issues, related to federal cash balances and the calculation and remittance of interest, remain, but the California Department of Education has taken preliminary steps to resolve them.(5) Accountability: California oversight entities and state agencies have taken various actions to oversee Recovery Act funds, including training, risk assessments, on-site monitoring, and audits. The Governor established the Recovery Task Force to ensure funds are spent efficiently and effectively, and the State Auditor and Inspector General also have key oversight roles. (6) Jobs Reporting: Recipients reported that 70,745 jobs were funded in California during the last quarter of 2009. However, about 70 percent of these jobs were in education and were not reported using the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) latest guidance, and therefore were not calculated consistently with other jobs reported."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman and Members of the full Committee, Madame Chairwoman  and Members of the Subcommittee:  I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work in California examining  the uses and planning for funds made available by the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).

California is estimated to receive approximately  $85 billion in Recovery Act funds, or about 10 percent of the funds  available nationally. Nearly 80 percent of Recovery Act funding to states  and localities is projected to be distributed within the first 3 years. Peak  projected outlays are in fiscal year 2010, with outlays that year projected  to be more than twice the level of fiscal year 2009 outlays. The California  Recovery Task Force (Task Force), which was established by the  Governor in March 2009, has overarching responsibility for ensuring that  the state\u2019s Recovery Act funds are spent efficiently and effectively and are  tracked and reported in a transparent manner. The Task Force reports on  the use and status of Recovery Act funds using the state\u2019s recovery Web  site (www.recovery.ca.gov). In addition to the Task Force\u2019s efforts, other  California entities with oversight responsibilities, including the State  Auditor, have expanded the scope of their work to include a focus on state  programs receiving Recovery Act funds.", "As of December 9, 2009, the Task Force estimated that approximately $53  billion has been allocated to California state agencies and local  governments, nonprofits, local education agencies, and private companies  through spending programs. The remaining portion, approximately $30  billion, is being provided to individuals and businesses in the form of  direct tax relief. Approximately $33.7 billion has been awarded and $17.8  billion has been expended. As shown in figure 1, health, education, and  labor accounted for almost 96 percent of California\u2019s Recovery Act  expenditures. The largest programs within these areas were the state  Medicaid program and SFSF.", "To help measure the impact of the Recovery Act, the act contains  numerous provisions that require recipients of Recovery Act funding to  report quarterly on several measures. Nonfederal recipients of Recovery  Act funds, such as state and local governments, private companies,  educational institutions, and nonprofits, are required to submit reports  with information on each project or activity, including amounts and a  description of the use of funds and an estimate of the jobs created or  retained. To collect this information, the U.S. Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board  created a nationwide data collection system to obtain data from recipients,  www.federalreporting.gov (FederalReporting.gov), and another site for  the public to view and download recipient reports, Recovery.gov. Shortly  before recipients could begin entering data into FederalReporting.gov for  the second quarterly reporting period, OMB issued a memorandum for the  heads of U.S. executive departments and agencies on December 18, 2009,  updating its reporting guidance on the Recovery Act, in response to  suggestions made by recipients, agencies, and our recommendations. The  updated guidance focuses on issues related to data quality, nonreporting  recipients, and reporting of job estimates, among other important  reporting requirements.", "We previously reported that the Task Force, with the assistance of the  state\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO), created and deployed a central  information technology system for state departments to report quarterly  recipient report data. For the first two rounds of recipient reporting,  California established a centralized reporting system, the California ARRA  Accountability Tool (CAAT), which state agencies receiving Recovery Act  funds used to report their data to the Task Force.

As discussed in our prior  reports, California balanced its state fiscal year 2009-2010 budget by,  among other things, making more than $31 billion in cuts, increasing taxes  by $12.5 billion, and using over $8 billion in Recovery Act funds. However,  California\u2019s long-term fiscal prospects remain of concern. For example, in  November 2009, the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office (LAO) estimated the size  of the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 budget shortfall at about $21 billion.  According to the LAO, the main reasons for the budget gaps are: the  inability of the state to achieve previous budget solutions in several areas,  the effects of several adverse court rulings and, for 2010-2011, the  expiration of various one-time and temporary budget solutions approved  in 2009. The Governor\u2019s 2010-2011 budget proposal was somewhat more  optimistic and identified a $18.9 billion budget shortfall. Nonetheless, the  budget gap constitutes roughly one-quarter of the state\u2019s annual budget  expenditures.", "The Governor declared a fiscal emergency on January 8, 2010, calling the  legislature into special session to act on his proposed solutions to address  the budget shortfall. Those proposed solutions include reductions in state  programs, shifts of state funds to pay for general fund expenses, and  requests for additional federal funds and greater flexibility. On January 22,  2010, the state Controller urged the state legislature and Governor to  address the state\u2019s projected budget and cash shortfalls for the remainder  of the current fiscal year, as well as the next fiscal year, in order to protect  California\u2019s economic recovery, continue the financing of public works  projects, and prevent even greater financial hardship. Further, the  Controller stated that, if the budget situation is not resolved, the  legislature and Governor will again face the prospect of a cash crisis  beginning in July 2010.", "Local city and county governments in California are also struggling with  declining revenues and budget problems. Additionally, local governments  are affected by the fiscal situation of the state as a number of revenue  sources\u2014such as sales tax, gas tax, vehicle license, and many others\u2014 pass through the state. For example, in order to balance the California\u2019s  fiscal year 2009-2010 budget, state leaders agreed to borrow almost $2  billion in local property tax revenue and make $877 million in local  government transportation revenue available to the state general fund for  transit debt service. Officials we met with in the City of Los Angeles (Los  Angeles) and the County of Sacramento said that they face budget  shortfalls this fiscal year due to declines in state funding for programs, tax  revenues, and fees. (Fig. 2 highlights information about the two local  governments we reviewed.) For example, a Los Angeles official told us  that, for the remainder of fiscal year 2010, they are trying to close a deficit  of $212 million and have a projected $485 million deficit for fiscal year  2011. Sacramento County officials reported that the county is facing a  nearly $14 million general fund budget shortfall for the remainder of fiscal  year 2009-2010, and faces cuts of around $149 million for next fiscal year.", "According to government officials in both localities, Recovery Act funds  are helping to preserve the delivery of essential services and repair  infrastructure but have generally not helped stabilize their base budgets.", "Overall, as of February 18, 2010, a Los Angeles official reported that the  city had been awarded about $597 million in Recovery Act grants, and  Sacramento County officials reported the county had been awarded about  $88 million in Recovery Act formula grants as of January 15. Most  Recovery Act funds to local governments flow through existing federal  grant programs. Some of these funds are provided directly to the local  government by federal agencies, and others are passed from the federal  agencies through state governments to local agencies. As shown in table 1,  local officials reported their governments\u2019 use of Recovery Act funds in  program areas including public safety (Edward Byrne Memorial Justice  Assistance Grant (JAG)) and Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block  Grant (EECBG). Other Recovery Act funds received by these localities  included formula grants for prevention of Internet crimes against children,  public housing, emergency shelter, health centers, capital improvements,  airport security and improvement, transportation, and additional  competitive grant awards.

The Recovery Act  also required that 30 percent of these funds be suballocated, primarily  based on population, for metropolitan, regional, and local use.

Fourteen percent, or 103 of these projects, were completed, 34  percent (268 projects) were under way, and about 51 percent (390  projects) had not yet started. Projects under way, which were in various  stages of completion, accounted for over $1 billion in obligations, and  projects that have been obligated funds but had not yet started, had an  estimated value of almost $953 million. (See fig. 4 for an example of  Recovery Act-funded pavement project.)", "Under both the Recovery Act and the regular Federal-Aid Highway Surface  Transportation Program, California has considerable latitude in selecting  projects to meet its transportation goals and needs. California Department  of Transportation (Caltrans) officials reported using the state portion to  fund state highway rehabilitation and maintenance projects that would not  have otherwise been funded due to significant funding limitations. In  addition to maintenance projects, the state has allocated Recovery Act  funds to large construction projects, including one of the largest  transportation investments, approximately $197.5 million for the  construction of the Caldecott Tunnel, a new two-lane, bore tunnel  connecting Contra Costa and Alameda counties. In addition, as previously  mentioned, according to state officials, a March 2009 state law provided  more funding directly to local governments, allowing a number of locally  important projects to be funded. For example, $319 million in Recovery  Act funds were obligated for 195 local projects in the Los Angeles area that  may not have otherwise been funded in 2009, such as the Compton  Boulevard resurfacing project. This project received approximately  $750,000 in Recovery Act funds and would not have been funded for many  years without these funds.", "As of February 16, 2010, $273 million of the $2.525 billion obligated to  California highway projects had been reimbursed by FHWA. Although  federal reimbursements in California have increased over time, from $22  million in September 2009 to $273 million, this rate, 11 percent, continues  to be lower than the amount reimbursed nationwide, 25 percent ($6.3  billion) of the $25.1 billion obligated. As we reported in December 2009,  Caltrans officials attributed the lower reimbursement rate to having a  majority of its projects administered by local governments, which may  take longer to reach the reimbursement phase than state projects, due to  additional steps required to approve local highway projects. For example,  highway construction contracts administered by local agencies generally  call for a local review and a local public notice period, which can add  nearly 6 weeks to the process. Additionally, Caltrans officials stated that  localities with relatively small projects tend to seek reimbursement in one  lump sum at the end of a project to minimize time and administrative cost.

If any states did not meet this requirement by March 2, 2010, the Secretary  of Transportation would withdraw and redistribute the unobligated  funding to other eligible states.

As we reported in December  2009, Caltrans revised its economically distressed areas determination  using new guidance issued to states in August 2009 by FHWA, in  consultation with the Department of Commerce, giving more direction on  \u201cspecial needs\u201d criteria for areas that do not meet the statutory criteria in  the Public Works and Economic Development Act. As a result, the  number of counties considered distressed increased from 49 to all 58  counties. According to Caltrans officials, this new determination did not  change how it funded or administered Recovery Act projects. Caltrans  officials told us that, in selecting projects for funding, they first considered  how quickly the project could be started and its potential to create and  retain jobs, then considered the extent of need with each economically  distressed area. The Recovery Act requires states to give priority to  projects that can be completed within 3 years and to projects located in  economically distressed areas. Recently, FHWA reviewed the  documentation that California used in its application of special needs  criteria and determined that the data used were not consistent with FHWA  guidance. Caltrans has been advised that the data must show a connection  between demonstrated severe job losses and actual, identified firm  closures and restructuring.

According to  CDE officials, the drawdown was in lieu of its normally scheduled  drawdown of school year 2008-2009 ESEA Title I funds and, therefore, the  schools would be ready to use the funds quickly. However, in August 2009,  we contacted the 10 LEAs in California that had received the largest  amounts of ESEA Title I, Part A Recovery Act funds and found that 7 had  not spent any of these funds and that all 10 reported large cash balances\u2014 ranging from $4.5 million to about $140.5 million.

In  response to cash management concerns, CDE implemented a pilot  program to help monitor LEA compliance with federal cash management  requirements. The program uses a Web-based quarterly reporting process  to track LEA cash balances. Currently, the pilot program collects cash  balance information from LEAs that receive funds under one relatively  small non-Recovery Act program. CDE officials told us that they plan to  expand the pilot to include regular and Recovery Act ESEA Title I, Part A,  and SFSF by October 2010.

In our previous reports on Recovery Act  implementation, we discussed the oversight roles and activities of key  entities in California for Recovery Act funds.

On December 18, 2009,  OMB updated its reporting guidance, and the Task Force advised  California recipients that there were some notable changes, specifically as  follows:    Recipients do not have to determine if a particular employee or job  classification would have been laid off without the receipt of Recovery Act  funds (i.e., retained), as they did before. If a position is being funded by  the Recovery Act, the hours should be included in the number of jobs  created;    Recipients are no longer required to sum hours across reporting quarters  or provide cumulative totals. Instead, they report jobs on a quarterly basis,  providing a quarterly snapshot; and    Recipients will find the federal reporting system open in February to  correct data reported during January.", "The new OMB guidance still required recipients to report jobs as FTE, but  it further defined FTEs as the total number of hours worked and funded by  Recovery Act dollars within the reporting quarter and provided guidance  on applying the new formula. According to Task Force officials, CDE did  not instruct LEAs to recalculate job estimates using the new OMB  guidance. CDE plans to have LEAs revise job estimates reported during  the second reporting period when CDE requests data for the third report,  which will be due on March 15, 2010, to CDE. Until that time, the data  available to the public for education-related jobs in California are not  comparable to that reported by other states. Additionally, although  CDE\u2019s uncorrected job estimates for the second reporting period remain  on the Recovery.gov Web site, the Task Force announced that it will not  include CDE\u2019s job estimates in its reports.", "In addition to not following OMB\u2019s updated guidance on calculating FTEs,  we also found that partly due to unclear guidance from CDE, LEAs we  reviewed had collected and reported job information from vendors  inconsistently. We met with seven LEAs\u2014including LA Unified, the  largest LEA in California\u2014to gain an understanding of their processes for  obtaining information necessary to meet Recovery Act reporting  requirements. LEAs told us that they received reporting guidance from  CDE, including calculating teacher and administrative jobs, but did not  receive clear guidance on how to collect and report vendor jobs funded by  the Recovery Act. As a result, LEAs we reviewed had varying jobs data  collection processes. For example, one LEA that did not report vendor  jobs for the second reporting period told us that, for future quarters, they  plan to survey vendors to estimate the range of jobs created or retained  (e.g., 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 jobs). Two other LEAs told us they did not contact  vendors to collect data on jobs created or retained but reported the  number of vendors with a Recovery Act contract. For instance, if the LEA  had four contracts using Recovery Act funds during the reporting period,  the LEA reported four vendor jobs. Officials from LEAs also reported  confusion regarding CDE\u2019s guidance to identify vendors\u2014by reporting  their name and zip code or Dun and Bradstreet Universal Numbering  System number\u2014that received payments of $25,000 or more in the  quarter. Some LEAs did not collect and report job estimates from  vendors with payments of less than $25,000 because they erroneously  applied CDE\u2019s guidance on vendor identification to determine which  vendor jobs to report. According to an official from one of these LEAs,  the number of vendor jobs it reported for the second quarter would  increase from 12 to at least 77 if it collected job estimates from all of its  vendors with Recovery Act contracts. As a result, some vendor jobs  funded by the Recovery Act were not reported.", "On February 23, 2010, CDE issued updated guidance to LEAs, and other  subrecipients, to assist them with the third Recovery Act reporting period.  However, this guidance neither provided LEAs additional information on  collecting and reporting vendor jobs, nor did it clarify that the vendor  identification guidance was not applicable to the Recovery Act\u2019s jobs  reporting requirements. As the prime recipient, CDE is responsible for  ensuring Recovery Act requirements are met, including reporting vendor  jobs funded by the Recovery Act. We plan to continue to follow these  reporting issues as part of our ongoing bimonthly work.", "Task Force officials stated that while OMB\u2019s revised guidance on calculating  FTEs for the second reporting period was easier to implement compared  with the first period, other data issues made it difficult to report timely,  accurate, and complete information. For example, the Task Force received  error messages in FederalReporting.gov when the congressional district  where the Recovery Act-funded project was located did not match the  recipient address. The Task Force reported receiving more than 1,500 error  reports for data it submitted to FederalReporting.gov related to  congressional districts and zip codes, even though California\u2019s CAAT system  had mechanisms in place to try to prevent the entry of false congressional  districts. In order to expedite these corrections, Task Force officials told us  that they decided to change their data to what FederalReporting.gov would  accept, rather than what they knew was correct in some instances. For  example, if they knew a recipient had moved and had a new zip code, but  FederalReporting.gov did not have the updated zip code for the recipient\u2019s  new address, the Task Force used the old zip code to get the report to  upload successfully to FederalReporting.gov. Issues with zip codes also  surfaced for local agencies that reported directly to Federalreporting.gov.  For example, officials from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan  Transportation Authority said they received an error message for an  incorrect congressional district, because they initially used the  congressional district in which the project was located as opposed to the  agency\u2019s headquarters office. Officials from the transportation authority  interpreted OMB\u2019s guidance as the congressional district in which the  project/activity was being performed, but they later received clarification  that the congressional district should be consistent with the recipient\u2019s  address.", "Mr. Chairman and Madame Chairwoman, this concludes my prepared  statement.
