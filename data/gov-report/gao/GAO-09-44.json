Due to the significance of the federal debt held by the public to the governmentwide financial statements, GAO audits the Bureau of the Public Debt's (BPD) Schedules of Federal Debt annually. The audit of these schedules is done to determine whether, in all material respects, (1) the schedules are reliable and (2) BPD management maintained effective internal control relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt. Further, GAO tests compliance with a significant provision of law related to the Schedule of Federal Debt (statutory debt limit). Federal debt managed by BPD consists of Treasury securities held by the public and by certain federal government accounts, referred to as intragovernmental debt holdings. The level of debt held by the public primarily reflects how much of the nation's wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior federal spending in excess of federal revenues. Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds such as Social Security, that typically have an obligation to invest their excess annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In GAO's opinion, BPD's Schedules of Federal Debt for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 were fairly presented in all material respects, and BPD maintained effective internal control relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt as of September 30, 2008. GAO found no instances of noncompliance in fiscal year 2008 with the statutory debt limit. As of September 30, 2008 and 2007, federal debt managed by BPD totaled about $10,011 billion and $8,993 billion, respectively. Total federal debt increased over each of the last 4 fiscal years. During the last 4 fiscal years, managing the federal debt has continued to be a challenge as evidenced by the growth of total federal debt by $2,632 billion, or 36 percent, from $7,379 billion as of September 30, 2004, to $10,011 billion as of September 30, 2008. In fiscal year 2008 alone, total federal debt increased by $1,018 billion, the single largest annual increase in history. Of this amount, about $760 billion was from the increase in debt held by the public, which included $300 billion in cash management bills issued in September 2008 under the Supplementary Financing Program initiated by Treasury. The remaining increase in federal debt of about $258 billion was from intragovernmental debt holdings. On July 30, 2008, legislation was enacted to raise the statutory debt limit from $9,815 billion to $10,615 billion. In addition, in response to the nation's growing financial crisis, on October 3, 2008, the President signed into law legislation authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase up to $700 billion in troubled assets from financial institutions. This legislation increased the statutory debt limit by $700 billion to $11,315 billion. These increases in the statutory debt limit were the fourth and fifth such occurrences since fiscal year 2004."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The accompanying auditor\u2019s report presents the results of our audits of the  Schedules of Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt for  the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2007.  The Schedules of  Federal Debt present the beginning balances, increases and decreases, and  ending balances for (1) Federal Debt Held by the Public and  Intragovernmental Debt Holdings, (2) the related Accrued Interest  Payables, and (3) the related Net Unamortized Premiums and Discounts  managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD).", "The auditor\u2019s report contains our (1) opinion on the Schedules of Federal  Debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, (2) opinion on  the effectiveness of relevant internal control as of September 30, 2008,   (3) conclusion on BPD\u2019s compliance in fiscal year 2008 with a selected  provision of a law we tested, and (4) conclusion on the consistency  between information in the Schedules of Federal Debt and the  accompanying Overview on Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the  Public Debt.", "As of September 30, 2008 and 2007, federal debt managed by the bureau  totaled about $10,011 billion and $8,993 billion, respectively, primarily for  moneys borrowed to fund the federal government\u2019s operations.  As shown  on the Schedules of Federal Debt, these balances consisted of  approximately (1) $5,809 billion as of September 30, 2008, and $5,049  billion as of September 30, 2007, of debt held by the public and about   (2) $4,202 billion as of September 30, 2008, and $3,944 billion as of  September 30, 2007, of intragovernmental debt holdings.", "The level of debt held by the public primarily reflects how much of the  nation\u2019s wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance  prior federal spending in excess of federal revenues.  It best represents the  cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today\u2019s economy and the  federal budget.  To finance a cash deficit, the federal government borrows  from the public. When a cash surplus occurs, the annual excess funds can  then be used to reduce debt held by the public. In other words, annual cash  deficits or surpluses generally approximate the annual net change in the  amount of federal government borrowing from the public.", "Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities  held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds (e.g.,  Social Security), that typically have an obligation to invest their excess  annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities.  Most federal trust  funds invest in special U.S. Treasury securities that are guaranteed for  principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.   The federal government uses the trust funds\u2019 invested cash surpluses to  assist in funding other federal government operations. The transactions  relating to Treasury securities held by the federal government accounts net  out on the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements because,  under current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, they  essentially represent loans from one part of the federal government to  another.  These securities are nonmarketable; however, they represent a  priority call on future federal budgetary resources.", "While both are important, debt held by the public and intragovernmental  debt holdings are very different.  Debt held by the public approximates the  federal government\u2019s competition with other sectors in the credit markets.   Federal borrowing absorbs resources available for private investment and  may put upward pressure on interest rates.  In addition, interest on debt  held by the public is paid in cash and represents a burden on current  taxpayers.  It reflects the amount the federal government pays to its outside  creditors.  In contrast, intragovernmental debt holdings perform an  accounting function but typically do not require cash payments from the  current budget or represent a burden on the current economy.  In addition,  from the perspective of the budget as a whole, interest payments to federal  government accounts by Treasury are entirely offset by the income  received by such accounts. This intragovernmental debt and related  interest represent a claim on future resources and hence a burden on future  taxpayers and the future economy. Specifically, when trust funds redeem  Treasury securities to obtain cash to fund expenditures, Treasury usually  borrows from the public to finance these redemptions. Such borrowings  result in competition for funds with the private sector and thus an effect on  the economy.", "We have audited the Schedule of Federal Debt since fiscal year 1997. Over  this period, total federal debt has increased by 92 percent. During the last 4  fiscal years, managing the federal debt has continued to be a challenge as  evidenced by the growth of total federal debt by $2,632 billion, or 36  percent, from $7,379 billion as of September 30, 2004, to $10,011 billion as  of September 30, 2008.  In fiscal year 2008, total federal debt increased by  $1,018 billion, the single largest annual increase in history.  Of this amount,  about $760 billion was from the increase in debt held by the public and  about $258 billion was from intragovernmental debt holdings.  Two primary  factors contributed to the increase in debt held by the public.  First, there  was a return to large reported deficits, which totaled $455 billion in fiscal  year 2008 compared to $162 billion in fiscal year 2007.  Second, at the  request of the Federal Reserve, Treasury initiated the Supplementary  Financing Program. As part of this program, Treasury issued cash  management bills to provide cash for Federal Reserve initiatives. As of  September 30, 2008, there were $300 billion of these cash management bills  outstanding. In addition, during fiscal year 2008, Treasury experienced a  reduction in the holdings of Treasury securities by state and local  governments, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal  Reserve. Much of this reduction can be attributed to the nation\u2019s growing  financial crisis. As a result, Treasury had to rely more on domestic and  foreign investors for purchasing Treasury securities.  Treasury met its  borrowing objectives in part by reintroducing the 52-week bill, which will  be offered each month, and increasing the amounts offered at public debt  auctions.", "Further increases in debt held by the public are expected. On July 30, 2008,  legislation was enacted to raise the statutory debt limit from $9,815 billion  to $10,615 billion.  In addition, in response to the nation\u2019s growing financial  crisis, on October 3, 2008, the President signed into law legislation  authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase up to $700 billion in  troubled assets from financial institutions. This legislation increased the  statutory debt limit by $700 billion to $11,315 billion. These increases in the  statutory debt limit were the fourth and fifth such occurrences since fiscal  year 2004.", "The slowdown in the economy and efforts to revive it reversed the recent  trend of declining annual budget deficits.  The reported fiscal year 2008  budget deficit was $455 billion compared to the fiscal year 2007 deficit of  $162 billion.  Official estimates for fiscal year 2009 show the annual deficit  approaching $500 billion.  Correspondingly, debt held by the public grew to  a reported 40.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of  fiscal year 2008, after hitting a 4-year low of 36.8 percent in fiscal year 2007.   However, the real challenge is not this year\u2019s deficit or even next year\u2019s; it is  how to change the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal path over the coming decades.", "The beginning stages of the longer-term fiscal challenge are not in the  distant future. The first of the baby boomers began collecting Social  Security retirement benefits this year and will become eligible for Medicare  in about 2 years. The budget and economic implications of the baby boom  generation\u2019s retirement have already become a factor in the Congressional  Budget Office\u2019s (CBO) 10-year budget projections and will only intensify as  the baby boomers age. GAO and CBO\u2019s long-range fiscal policy simulations  show that the federal government\u2019s current fiscal condition over the  coming decades is on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path absent  significant changes in policy. Currently, policymakers are understandably  focused on dealing with stabilizing financial markets and stimulating the  economy.  Once these issues are addressed, the nation\u2019s new and returning  leaders will need to turn their attention to the long-term challenges that lie  ahead.", "A continuing trend that we also have noted is the significant increase in  reported foreign ownership of Treasury securities. Treasury securities held  by foreign and international investors increased in fiscal year 2008,  continuing a trend dating back to 2001.  According to amounts reported in  the September 2008 Treasury Bulletin, Treasury estimates that the amount  of Treasury securities held by foreign and international investors has  increased by $1,647 billion\u2014from $1,001 billion as of June 30, 2001, to  $2,648 billion as of June 30, 2008.  As of June 30, 2008, this represents an  estimated 50 percent of debt held by the public, up from about 31 percent  as of June 30, 2001. The United States benefits from foreign purchases of  Treasury securities because foreign and international investors fill part of  the U.S. government\u2019s borrowing needs. However, to service this foreign- held debt, the U.S. government must send interest payments abroad.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate Committee on Appropriations; the Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; the  Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government  Information, Federal Services, and International Security, Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; the  Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, Senate  Committee on Appropriations; the House Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform; the House Committee on Appropriations; the  Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization, and  Procurement, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform;  and the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government,  House Committee on Appropriations.

As Figure 1 illustrates, both  intragovernmental debt holdings and debt held by the public have steadily increased since fiscal year 2004.  The primary reason for  the increases in intragovernmental debt holdings is the surpluses in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, Military Retirement Fund, and DOD  Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund.  The increases in debt held by the public are due primarily to total federal spending  exceeding total federal revenues.

The  primary components of interest expense are interest paid on the debt held by the public and interest credited to federal government  trust funds and other federal government accounts that hold Treasury securities.  The interest paid on the debt held by the public  affects the current spending of the federal government and represents the burden in servicing its debt (i.e., payments to outside  creditors).  Interest credited to federal government trust funds and other federal government accounts, on the other hand, does not  result in an immediate outlay of the Federal Government because one part of the government pays the interest and another part  receives it.  However, this interest represents a claim on future budgetary resources and hence an obligation on future taxpayers.  This  interest, when reinvested by the trust funds and other federal government accounts, is included in the programs\u2019 excess funds not currently needed in operations, which are invested in federal securities.  During fiscal year 2008, interest expense incurred totaled  $454 billion, interest expense on debt held by the public was $242 billion, and $212 billion was interest incurred for  intragovernmental debt holdings.

Large budget deficits emerged during the  1980\u2019s due to tax policy decisions and increased outlays for defense and domestic programs.

However, higher federal outlays, tax policy decisions, and recent actions to stabilize the financial markets have resulted in an increase in debt held by the public from  $3,339 billion in 2001 to $5,809 billion in 2008.", "Bank.", "Historical Perspective, cont.", "Even in those years where debt held by the public declined, total federal debt increased because of increases in  intragovernmental debt holdings.
