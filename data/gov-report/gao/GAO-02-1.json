For the three federal on-line procurement programs GAO reviewed, the dollar share of awards to small businesses exceeded the overall small business share of total federal contract dollars awarded in fiscal years 2000 and 1999. Although small businesses successfully participated in these three programs, they still face obstacles in conducting electronic procurements with the government. The federal government is taking steps to address some of these obstacles, such as implementing a single point of entry on the Internet for vendors to access information on available government business opportunities greater than $25,000. Each of the four business assistance programs GAO examined had taken steps to educate its clients on electronic commerce as part of its operations. However, GAO could not fully determine the extent of these activities because they are conducted by hundreds of local and regional offices, and only one of the programs collected performance metrics specific to electronic commerce."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This letter responds to your request that we explore issues related to small business participation in government on-line procurement programs and electronic commerce education activities covered by selected federal programs for businesses in general. Over the past several years, the federal government has pursued various electronic initiatives to strengthen its buying processes in order to reduce costs and create a competitive \u201cvirtual\u201d marketplace. These efforts have been augmented by the Administration\u2019s announcement in early 2001 that expanding the application of on-line procurements in the federal government was one of its major reform initiatives. Moreover, the use of electronic commerce in the U.S. economy at large is growing. For example, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, for the second quarter of 2001, retail electronic commerce increased 24.7 percent over the sales of the second quarter of 2000.", "Because of concerns that small businesses may be facing difficulties in participating in federal on-line procurement programs, you asked us to ascertain the share of procurement dollar awards made to small businesses in selected programs and to identify whether obstacles exist for small businesses in participating in electronic procurements. In addition, you were concerned about the extent of the government\u2019s business outreach and education programs related to electronic commerce and whether these programs are adequately coordinated.", "Accordingly, our objectives were to (1) determine, for three federal on-line procurement programs, the differences between the small business share of federal prime contract dollars awarded by these programs and the small business share of all federal contract dollars awarded and to identify what, if any, obstacles exist for small businesses in conducting electronic procurements with the federal government and (2) review what steps four federal business assistance programs have taken to educate businesses on using electronic commerce and the extent to which these programs have coordinated their efforts.", "To determine the comparative small business share of dollar awards at the three selected federal on-line purchasing sites, we calculated the percentage of small business awards to total awards for each program and compared them to the governmentwide small business share for federal procurements, as reported by the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS)\u2014the central repository for governmentwide procurement data. We addressed the reliability of the data of the selected programs by performing data consistency checks and reviewing reports on general system controls. To gather information on obstacles to small businesses in participating in federal electronic procurements, we performed a literature search and obtained comments from officials in selected federal business assistance programs and organizations representing or working with small businesses. To review what steps selected assistance programs have taken to educate businesses in using electronic commerce and the extent to which they have coordinated their efforts, we reviewed documentation and interviewed headquarters and local and regional office officials for four federally funded programs.

For example, the President has designated expanding the application of on-line procurement a major reform for fiscal year 2002. Further, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, agency Web sites provided various information on federal procurement, including bid opportunities. Moreover, procurement opportunities for small businesses and for women- and minority-owned businesses were also often identified on these Web sites. Among the major federal agencies maintaining procurement Web sites are DLA, GSA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.", "One type of on-line procurement program is a multivendor Internet-based purchasing site, sometimes called an \u201celectronic mall.\u201d An example of an electronic mall is GSA Advantage!, in which government buyers can search listings, compare prices, and purchase items on-line much as a private individual might purchase an item from an on-line retailer. As of July 1, all vendors on the GSA schedule were required to electronically submit product descriptions and price information to GSA Advantage!. Another electronic mall is DLA\u2019s Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) E-CAT program, which operates in a similar manner to GSA Advantage!, except that vendors must have an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with DLA to participate. A different type of on-line procurement program model is GSA\u2019s Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS) program, which is used for larger or more complex purchases. The ITSS on-line purchasing program maintains an inventory of contractors through which federal buyers can get quotations in response to requirements documents. Table 1 summarizes how each of these on-line programs works and the products that can be obtained using them.", "These three on-line procurement programs are small but growing in comparison to overall federal procurement dollars. According to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), the government procured about $232 billion and $209 billion in goods and services in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. The three on-line programs in our review grew as a percentage of total federal procurement dollars from about 0.5 percent in fiscal year 1999 to about 1 percent in fiscal year 2000. Table 2 shows actual and estimated dollar volumes for the three programs and their growth over three fiscal years.", "Other on-line procurement Web sites also support government purchasing. These sites include the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) EMALL program, which is planned as the single DOD electronic mall, and the National Institutes of Health Intramall program. The private sector also offers on- line procurement Web sites that support government buying activities.", "Beyond its on-line procurement programs, the federal government also supports electronic commerce by sponsoring programs that provide electronic commerce education to businesses. For example, each of the four federally funded business assistance programs that you asked us to review provides electronic commerce education as part of its operations.

At the same time, concerns about obstacles to small business participation in electronic procurements are still expressed in studies and surveys and by organizations representing and working with small businesses. These entities report that small businesses continue to face obstacles in conducting electronic procurements with the federal government, including a lack of (1) technical expertise and (2) knowledge about the government\u2019s electronic procurement strategy. Key to the success of small businesses\u2019 participation in government electronic procurements is that both parties\u2014the government and the businesses themselves\u2014continue to work on overcoming these and any future obstacles that may arise.

We calculated the percentage of small business awards to total awards for each program and compared them to the governmentwide small business share, which we calculated based on the aggregate FPDS data reported in GSA\u2019s Federal Procurement Report for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. We assessed the reliability of the GSA Advantage!, ITSS, and DMLSS E-CAT data by (1) performing electronic tests of relevant fields (for example, we tested for completeness by checking key fields for missing data and checked for accuracy and reasonableness by examining summary statistics for values that were in proper and expected ranges) and (2) requesting and reviewing, if available, related program and system design documentation, audit and system reviews, and reports. The results of our assessment showed that the DMLSS E-CAT data were reliable enough for use in this report. However, the results of our assessment of the GSA Advantage! and ITSS data were inconclusive in large part because of concerns related to limitations on available documentation and security weaknesses reported in GSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2000 Annual Report.

Our literature search and discussions with industry groups and business assistance program officials indicated that some small businesses may have difficulty in making a business case for adopting electronic commerce because of their inability to ascertain costs, benefits, and risks. They may have little working knowledge of the Internet and other electronic commerce technologies and insufficient information about the benefits and applicable implementation strategies appropriate for their business models. As a result, such businesses may be reluctant to make the investment to implement electronic commerce. For example, an August 2000 survey of 50 Idaho manufacturers\u2019 use of Internet technologies showed that of the 23 respondents with Web sites, 74 percent were not engaged in electronic commerce. The primary reasons companies with Web sites cited for not moving to electronic commerce were a lack of knowledge and a concern that implementation was too time-consuming and costly. One researcher concluded that for small businesses, adopting electronic commerce requires low, predictable cost; minimal changes in employee behavior; and compelling benefits over alternatives.", "Limited Technical Expertise. A June 2000 Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development report on enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises noted that many small businesses do not know how to profitably develop their electronic commerce capabilities or how to cope with the \u201ccomplex rules\u201d governing this area. This report and other studies point out that the lack of appropriate human resources, in terms of technical and/or managerial staff familiar with the information technology environment, constitutes a major barrier for small businesses wanting to adopt electronic commerce technologies and strategies.Business assistance program officials also noted that their small business clients lack the skill sets necessary to participate in electronic commerce. They stated that small businesses need help with building Web sites, selecting Web site designers and Internet service providers, and integrating electronic commerce into their business processes. However, small businesses may not have such experience and expertise on staff and may not be able to afford to recruit and retain technical staff with these skills.", "Internet Access Issues. PTAC, MEP, ECRC, and SBDC business assistance program officials reported that small businesses, particularly in rural areas and on Indian reservations, have difficulty obtaining affordable high-speed Internet access sufficient for electronic commerce activities. For example, a PTAC official in a rural state said that many individuals and companies in his state have only dial-up modem service. Moreover, according to an official working on programs to assist American Indian enterprise development, reservations often lack Internet infrastructure. She estimated that only 40 percent of her clients on reservations have e-mail service. The continuing expansion of electronic commerce requires widespread high-speed Internet access. However, as we noted in February 2001, there is less availability of broadband high-speed, high-capacity connection to the Internet in the rural areas of America. Similar to other studies, our survey found the availability of broadband technology to be most prevalent in large metropolitan areas.", "Concerns About Security and/or Privacy. Ensuring the security of payments and proprietary information and privacy of personal data are a top priority for small businesses considering electronic commerce as a means to sell their products and services. According to the U.S. presentation before the Free Trade Area of the Americas electronic commerce committee, because of their small size and limited financial resources, small businesses may not be prepared to take on the kinds of security and privacy risks that larger companies can more easily face.Security and privacy concerns of small businesses include inappropriate disclosure of proprietary business information that governments collect from companies, consumer fraud, and the adequacy of security over a transaction on the Internet. For example, some small businesses fear bidding on-line because they do not believe that it is secure. They want assurances that their pricing and other proprietary information would be accessed only by intended recipients and not by competitors. These concerns are not unjustified.

After subscribing, vendors can receive various announcements automatically via email, including solicitations and post-award notices. Agencies must provide access to all applicable actions by October 1, 2001. Because the requirement to use FedBizOpps is new, its impact on simplifying access to the government\u2019s procurements is not yet known.

The federal government has multiple on-line purchasing programs that federal buyers can access to search vendor catalogs and purchase goods and services from suppliers with government contracts. According to three business assistance program officials, the process for posting listings on these sites is inconsistent and time-consuming because vendors may have to upload their electronic catalogs to multiple sites, involving different formats and procedures. For example, the GSA Advantage! and DMLSS E-CAT programs have different requirements for formatting catalog data. An industry group representing companies that conduct business with the federal government told us that small businesses often must hire third- party service providers because they lack the ability to manage multiple electronic catalog formats, revisions, and uploads. Moreover, according to one research report, some commodity suppliers may perceive an on-line catalog to be impractical, due to the sheer number of their products and the complexity of their pricing. As of mid-August, GSA Advantage!, DMLSS E-CAT, and others were in the initial stages of considering implementing a single catalog process for medical materiel.", "Lack of a Single Vendor Registration System. Vendors who want to conduct business with more than one government office generally must complete multiple registrations and profiles, providing redundant business information to each site in different formats. Officials from several business assistance programs and organizations representing small businesses spoke of the need for the government to set up a single point of vendor registration. Many reiterated the point made in a 1994 government report on electronic commerce that it is much easier for a business to maintain its single repository of registration information than to submit the same information or some variation of it many times to numerous contracting activities. Moreover, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 required the establishment of a \u201csingle face to industry\u201d for conducting procurements.", "To help address concerns about multiple vendor registrations, DOD developed a centralized, electronic registration process\u2014the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system\u2014as the single registration point for vendors that want to conduct business with DOD.

According to a DLA official, SBA\u2019s PRO-Net was provided access to CCR small business vendor information data on August 24, 2001. SBA officials told us that they did not yet know how they were going to use the CCR data but that vendors cannot be automatically registered in PRO-Net without their consent. Accordingly, small businesses wanting to register in both CCR and PRO-Net will have to reenter some of the same information in both systems.", "Problems Related to Technical Data and Drawings. Posting technical data and drawings (required by businesses preparing bids) on the Web or otherwise making them available electronically is beneficial because vendors do not have to visit contracting offices to obtain copies or have technical data packages mailed to them. However, business assistance program officials and industry groups voiced concerns about the difficulties, frustration, and time involved in locating, transmitting, downloading, and printing on-line specifications and drawings. Some of the problems reported included incomplete and inadequate technical data packages for manufactured items, on-line manuals that are difficult to decipher and use, out-of-date drawings, or the lack of availability of CD- ROMs containing drawings that are too large to download. A representative from one trade organization noted that there can be technical problems with downloading specifications in that often a fast Internet connection and powerful computer system are needed, and the software versions required by different agencies may differ or conflict with one another. ECRC and PTAC officials said that many agencies fail to recognize that small businesses have limited electronic resources and need more simplification and software standardization for on-line solicitation materials to be readily accessible. In a mid-August meeting, DLA officials agreed that the quality of electronic technical data and drawings and the delivery of this information were problems.", "Difficulty in Obtaining Help With Problems and Marketing Assistance.", "Another obstacle for many small businesses attempting to participate in on-line government purchasing programs is not knowing where to go for help or not having knowledgeable contacts. According to officials of several business assistance programs and trade association representatives, small businesses often have difficulty reaching someone at the buyer\u2019s or program office who is able and willing to help, particularly with technology-related problems and/or marketing questions. For example, one trade organization representative said that small businesses trying to market in an on-line environment have problems reaching federal procurement officials to discuss their products and services. When they call to arrange meetings with buyers, they may be referred instead to Web sites, which can be complex and confusing and may not contain the information they really need. In other cases, phone calls and e-mails were not returned when there was a problem. In particular, two industry groups and five business-assistance program officials mentioned difficulties in obtaining assistance to deal with problems associated with GSA Advantage!. For example, one ECRC official said that the GSA Advantage! Web site explanations are insufficient to address vendor questions and GSA technical support staff are also unable to answer questions from vendors about getting their products listed. In mid-August, GSA officials stated that improvements in GSA Advantage! vendor support and assistance were made in the spring and summer of 2001, such as increasing help-desk staffing, employing classroom training, and implementing a lab in which vendors are helped in loading their data onto the system.", "In earlier testimony on electronic government initiatives, we pointed out that the government\u2019s use of Internet and Web-based technologies should force organizations to reconsider their customers\u2014specifically, how their customers need, perceive, and digest information and services in a viewable, electronic format. Moreover, the National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council suggests that organizations implement a customer relations management structure.", "Uncertainty About the Government\u2019s Electronic Procurement Strategy.", "Industry groups and business assistance program officials told us that since government agencies are pursuing different approaches to implementing electronic purchasing, small businesses hesitate to invest in any one electronic commerce system. According to one PTAC program official, when businesses look closely at their government customers\u2019 electronic commerce capabilities, they find a \u201cvery mixed bag.\u201d In addition, officials in four of the six ECRC offices we contacted noted that the government has pursued many different electronic commerce solutions and has not adopted a uniform \u201csingle face\u201d approach to the vendor community. ECRC officials cited the government\u2019s Federal Acquisition Computer Network\u2014better known as FACNET\u2014and electronic data interchange initiatives as examples of electronic commerce initiatives that were not fully implemented or were changed before investment returns were realized. For example, in our 1997 report on FACNET implementation, we discussed the limited use of FACNET by government agencies and the need for a coherent strategy and implementation approach for carrying out the agencies\u2019 acquisition requirements using various electronic commerce technologies and purchasing methods."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments From the Defense Logistics Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments From the U.S. Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments From the Secretary of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Barbara Johnson, Rosa Johnson, Beverly Ross, Patricia Slocum, and Glenn Spiegel made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
