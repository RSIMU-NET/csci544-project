FERC faces challenges ensuring prices are fair, however, because staff cannot monitor all of the potentially millions of transactions and because it is difficult to identify market manipulation. FERC's oversight of commodity markets has risen in importance recently because the commodity price amounted to nearly 60 percent of the total consumer price in 2005 compared with about 30 percent in 1993. FERC also directly approves interstate transportation prices. FERC has completed action on four of the six new tasks identified by EPAct 2005 related to natural gas. FERC officials said that EPAct 2005 has achieved tangible results. For example, following FERC's issuance of a policy statement on enforcement in October 2005, some industry members have self-reported instances of noncompliance with FERC-approved rules in an effort to gain consideration for a lesser penalty. States directly oversee prices for local distribution of natural gas and have a limited role approving commodity and interstate transportation prices. States directly approve utilities' charges for local delivery of natural gas, but this represented only about 30 percent of the consumer price in 2005. While states can deny gas utilities from passing on the cost of the gas commodity to consumers, state officials told us this rarely occurs. State officials rely on FERC to ensure that commodity prices are fair, but some said they are unaware of FERC's oversight efforts.

Since that time,  natural gas commodity prices have been largely determined in the market  by supply and demand. Deregulation improved the availability of natural  gas and initially lowered prices.

Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fossil fuel found underground that is  composed mainly of methane and generated through the slow  decomposition of ancient organic matter. Most natural gas consumed in  this country is produced in North America, but an increasing portion is  shipped from overseas in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Natural  gas is used in about 60 million homes and 5 million businesses in a variety  of ways, such as for heating, fueling industrial processes in manufacturing  operations, fueling electricity generation, and fueling some cars and buses.  Most natural gas consumers are residential users, but they use only about  24 percent of the gas consumed in the United States. Other natural gas  consumers include industrial consumers, electricity generators, and  transportation users.", "The natural gas industry performs three separate functions to deliver  natural gas to consumers: (1) production of the natural gas commodity, (2)  transportation of the commodity between states, and (3) local distribution  within states. These major functions are illustrated in figure 1.", "To produce the natural gas commodity, producers drill wells to reach  pockets of natural gas, either at sea (such as in the Gulf of Mexico) or on  land (such as in the Powder River Basin of the Rocky Mountain states).  Once the gas well has been drilled, the drilling rig is removed and the  natural gas flows to the surface, where it is combined with gas from other  nearby wells and moved locally through a network of progressively larger  local pipelines to processing plants. There, the raw gas is processed to  remove water vapor, hydrogen sulfide, and other compounds so that it can  be transported, bought, and sold nationally. Producers may choose to sell  the natural gas commodity to a variety of customers, including marketers,  traders, and a variety of consumers. Furthermore, the various players in  the market may, in turn, sell gas back and forth several times before it is  actually delivered.", "Eventually, the natural gas is transported via a network of larger interstate  pipelines that connect various supply regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico,  to areas where natural gas is consumed, such as large cities on the East  Coast. Interstate pipelines converge at several pipeline network  interconnections, which link gas consumers across the United States to  several different production regions. As a result of this interconnected  network, prices of natural gas at different trading locations vary  somewhat, but they generally move together as the overall supply and  demand balance changes. Some interstate pipeline intersections have  become important locations for trading natural gas, such as the \u201cHenry  Hub\u201d pipeline interconnection in Louisiana.", "Most consumers, particularly residential and small commercial  consumers, receive natural gas from local natural gas utilities. Utilities  generally operate as monopolies within service areas defined by states  and, as such, are the only entity delivering natural gas to most consumers.  In most cases, local gas utilities also purchase the natural gas commodity  for their customers. Local gas utilities receive natural gas from interstate  pipelines and route it into local delivery pipelines to homes and  businesses, where it is consumed. A smaller number of consumers\u2014such  as operators of electric power plants or operators of industrial or  manufacturing plants\u2014may completely bypass the local gas utility.  Because these consumers use large amounts of natural gas, they may  purchase gas directly from suppliers and receive natural gas directly from  interstate pipelines.", "The federal government has authority to regulate certain sales of natural  gas and its interstate transportation and does so through two agencies.  FERC has primary responsibility for natural gas oversight. FERC is led by  five commissioners appointed by the President and approved by the  Senate. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also plays  a role in federal oversight related to natural gas prices. It is responsible for  ensuring that fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices do not occur in  federally regulated financial markets, where some natural gas transactions  are conducted.", "States directly regulate the local gas utilities that fall under their  jurisdiction. Because only one utility generally provides gas to a specific  service area, utilities lack competition and could take advantage of their  monopoly by artificially raising natural gas prices for consumers or by  taking other actions. To regulate investor-owned utilities, which distribute  over 90 percent of the gas delivered by utilities, states created agencies  called public utility commissions. States generally do not allow utilities to  profit from the natural gas that they resell, although they allow utilities to  recover the costs of purchasing the natural gas commodity by passing  those costs on to customers. Traditionally, utilities sold natural gas at a  single price per unit of gas\u2014such as per thousand cubic feet\u2014approved  by a commission. However, as consumer prices have become more  variable, states have generally started to allow utilities to use a \u201cgas cost  adjustment\u201d system, where utilities independently adjust the rates they  charge consumers, as long as utilities are not profiting from the gas sales."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FERC\u2019s Role in Influencing Prices That Consumers Pay for Natural Gas Has Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["Since natural gas commodity prices were deregulated in 1993, FERC\u2019s role  ensuring that the price consumers pay for natural gas is fair has been  twofold and limited.

Relying on a wide range of energy  data sources in FERC\u2019s Market Monitoring Center, energy market analysts  in the Office of Enforcement monitor prices and volumes of natural gas  commodity transactions at many key energy market trading centers  nationwide to identify price anomalies or other unusual market activity  that might indicate market manipulation. FERC officials explained that  because natural gas prices at different locations generally move together,  FERC\u2019s monitoring of prices at key energy market trading centers allows  them to understand the overall natural gas market. In addition, they  monitor other factors that may affect the market, such as storage levels,  imports and exports, weather, supply and demand for other fuels, and  electricity transmission constraints and outages. The Office of  Enforcement also operates an enforcement hotline, through which anyone  can anonymously offer information about suspicious market activities,  such as bidding anomalies or improper transactions between a company  and an affiliate. When Office of Enforcement staff identify unexpected or  unexplained deviations in price behavior or other anomalies, they examine  the anomaly and undertake informal or formal investigations when  needed. In response to unusual circumstances resulting in short-term  market changes, the office has increased its monitoring and enforcement  efforts. For example, in response to persistent high energy prices and  Hurricane Katrina, which substantially disrupted domestic natural gas  supplies during the fall and winter of 2005, the office initiated a daily  review of market activity and intensified its investigation of unusual  trading activity, according to office officials.", "In addition, the staff conduct a variety of random and targeted audits of  individual companies to determine whether companies are following rules  and regulations regarding trading activities. For example, in 2004, FERC  completed 27 financial audits to determine compliance with its accounting  regulations and an additional 12 audits to determine compliance with  FERC standards of conduct and other requirements. Among other things,  these audits resulted in over 100 recommendations to remedy deficiencies  and uncovered $10 million in pipeline costs that were improperly  capitalized.", "To further help ensure that natural gas commodity prices are competitive  and free from manipulation, FERC also supports the development of  competitive markets. It has done this primarily by promulgating rules that  prevent pipeline companies from giving undue preference to their energy  affiliates by requiring that pipeline companies completely separate (or  \u201cunbundle\u201d) their transportation, storage, and sales services and open  access of their pipeline to other entities. Recently, it has supported the  development of competitive markets by fine-tuning existing policies rather  than making major changes:  In 2003, for example, FERC Order Number 2004 updated rules of conduct  designed to prevent natural gas pipelines and public utilities from giving  undue preference to their affiliates.", "Also in 2003, FERC developed standards and issued orders designed to  improve the information about natural gas markets published in price  indices\u2014a key source of market information that market participants use  to make informed decisions about buying and selling natural gas.", "While FERC\u2019s role overseeing natural gas commodity markets has been  limited, it has become more important in recent years because the  commodity portion of prices that consumers pay for natural gas has  increased more than the other components. As shown in figure 2, real  natural gas commodity prices accounted for almost 60 percent of the total  consumer price in 2005, compared with about 30 percent in 1993.  Specifically, real natural gas commodity prices increased from $2.59 in  1993 to $7.51 in 2005\u2014an increase of about 190 percent.

The Natural Gas Act  of 1938, as amended, mandates that FERC regulate the rates that natural  gas pipeline companies under its jurisdiction can charge for interstate  transportation of natural gas to ensure that rates are just and reasonable.  Specifically, FERC requires that every natural gas company file schedules  with FERC showing all rates, contracts, and charges for interstate  transportation of natural gas subject to FERC. FERC staff analyze the  information provided by these companies to ensure that proposed rates  are just and reasonable. However, in practice, FERC officials told us that  typically, the proposed rate for each unit of service is calculated by  dividing a pipeline\u2019s overall cost of service\u2014that is, the company\u2019s total  revenue required to cover the pipeline\u2019s operations plus a just and  reasonable return on its investment in facilities\u2014by the projected amount  of gas its customers will use. A just and reasonable return is typically  determined by evaluating the range of returns generally experienced in the  industry, and adjusted to reflect the specific investment risks of the  pipeline company as compared with the industry. Ultimately, the return on  investment must be sufficient to attract capital and compensate the  pipeline\u2019s investors for the risks of their investment, but not higher.", "FERC\u2019s role in regulating the rates charged for the interstate  transportation component of the price that consumers pay for natural gas  has become less prominent in recent years because the rates that pipeline  companies charge for transportation of natural gas along interstate  pipelines have declined relative to the other components of the price  consumers pay.

Following the enactment of EPAct  2005, FERC issued antimanipulation regulations implementing its new  authority to monitor, investigate, and impose fines and penalties on any  person under its jurisdiction that manipulated natural gas commodity  prices (action No. 3 in table 1). Previously, FERC could only penalize  behavior that manipulated natural gas commodity prices for a limited  number of transactions, such as those by owners of interstate pipeline  companies and other entities transporting natural gas on an interstate  pipeline. Under the new regulations that implement EPAct 2005, FERC\u2019s  prohibition against market manipulation applies to transactions by  producers, financial companies, local utilities, and natural gas traders,  most of which were not previously regulated by FERC. According to  Office of Enforcement officials, to implement the authority, the Office of  Enforcement has dedicated more time and staff efforts analyzing  transactions and other market behavior in venues previously outside  FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, Office of Enforcement officials told us  they are now able to examine whether financial market transactions,  which are not generally under FERC jurisdiction, affect the physical  natural gas markets over which FERC has authority.", "However, FERC has not yet imposed any penalties for violations of rules  and regulations related to its new penalty authority since the enactment of  EPAct 2005, according to Office of Enforcement officials.

Instead of  proving that the market behavior had a \u201cforeseeable\u201d effect on market  prices, conditions, and rules, FERC must now prove that the conduct that  resulted in manipulated prices is intentional or reckless, which office staff  told us is a more difficult standard.

Hedging includes such techniques as  buying gas at fixed prices in long-term contracts or storing gas purchased  when prices are relatively low, to be used during times when prices are  high. Utilities in these states often engage in some form of hedging to  insulate consumers from \u201crate shocks,\u201d where prices greatly increase from  one month to another. While hedging does not guarantee the lowest price,  it tends to smooth prices, giving consumers greater price stability.", "Second, some states offer \u201ccustomer choice\u201d programs that allow  residential consumers to choose to purchase gas from natural gas  suppliers other than the utility provider. Customer choice programs may  encourage more stable natural gas prices because nonutility suppliers  have an incentive to hedge their gas purchases to minimize the risk of high  prices\u2014unlike utilities, which fully recover their gas purchase costs from  the consumer. Therefore, nonutility suppliers may be more likely to offer  gas service to consumers at a set price for a period of months or years.

In that regard, in recent  performance reports FERC listed actions it has taken to provide  information on its oversight, such as providing copies of its market  surveillance reports to state public utility commissions. Officials in the  Office of Enforcement told us they discuss their market-monitoring and  oversight activities during twice-yearly meetings with the National  Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), a national  organization of state regulators. In addition, upon request, Office of  Enforcement officials have met with state regulators to discuss their  market oversight activities. FERC compiles data on the numbers and  subject areas of the informal and formal investigations it undertakes, and  it reports some of those data for completed investigations. For example,  FERC publicly reports the number of hotline calls it receives and some  statistics on closed investigations and audits through documents available  on its Web site, such as press releases, FERC staff reports, the agency\u2019s  annual report to Congress, and its State of the Markets Report, which  summarizes information about energy market conditions and identifying  emerging trends.", "However, FERC staff are prohibited from disclosing details about ongoing  investigations except by order from the FERC commissioners. In that  regard, FERC\u2019s practice has been to release information about the  numbers and subject areas of ongoing investigations only rarely because it  has been its view that providing overly detailed information could risk  undermining FERC\u2019s market-monitoring efforts. FERC officials recognize  that publicly disclosing some additional information about its oversight  activities, as long as it would not compromise ongoing investigations,  could serve to increase stakeholder understanding and, potentially, deter  market manipulation. In this regard, FERC has occasionally disclosed  information about ongoing oversight efforts at the commissioner\u2019s  discretion, as it did in 2002 during the Enron investigation in an effort to  increase public understanding of FERC\u2019s oversight activities and raise  public confidence in energy markets. FERC officials also told us that they  are developing a Web page to better inform the public about its oversight  activities in response to questions they received from the public.", "Despite FERC\u2019s past efforts, some stakeholders still do not have a full  understanding of FERC\u2019s oversight activities and lack confidence in the  fairness of natural gas commodity prices. Some state regulators we  interviewed told us they lacked assurance that natural gas prices are free  from manipulation. For example, regulators from one state sent a letter to  FERC expressing concern about high gas prices and that FERC\u2019s oversight  may not prevent market manipulation. In response, Office of Enforcement  officials invited the state regulators to their offices in Washington, D.C.,  for discussions and to tour FERC\u2019s Market Monitoring Center to observe  firsthand how FERC monitors the market. Between October 2005 and  February 2006, FERC received similar letters from two other states and  one municipal government requesting information about rising natural gas  prices and possible market manipulation. Other state regulators we  interviewed told us they would benefit from greater coordination with  FERC regarding natural gas prices. Moreover, according to one state  commissioner on the NARUC gas committee, state commissioners vary in  their knowledge of what FERC staff do to monitor natural gas commodity  markets\u2014and many members have limited knowledge. In addition, a  NARUC gas committee official elaborated that FERC outreach to the  states would help both FERC and the states better fulfill their respective  regulatory duties. Citing their concern over rising natural gas prices and  concerns over monitoring of commodity markets, attorneys general from  four Midwestern states commissioned a report to investigate whether  natural gas prices were artificially high as a result of market  manipulation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Oversight of natural gas markets has evolved substantially from the days  when the federal government set prices based on costs for natural gas  produced at wells and controlled, together with the states, nearly all of the  rest of the costs of delivering it to consumers. However, aside from  FERC\u2019s efforts to prevent market manipulation, neither the federal  government nor the states have much influence on the natural gas  commodity price that now accounts for the largest portion of the price  that consumers pay. As a result, the natural gas prices consumers pay will  remain highly affected by what happens in the commodity markets.", "Nevertheless, federal oversight of the commodity markets remains a work  in progress. Stakeholders, including state regulators, other government  officials, and the public, are highly affected by the commodity markets  that FERC is charged with overseeing, but some of these stakeholders  remain largely unaware of FERC\u2019s oversight processes and activities.  Because of regulatory limitations, FERC staff do not publicly disclose  information about informal and formal investigations unless the  investigations have been completed and have resulted in a formal penalty,  despite the advantages such information could have in increasing  stakeholder understanding of FERC\u2019s oversight activities and, potentially,  deterring market manipulation. However, under current regulations, FERC  commissioners have it within their authority to disclose this information.  Furthermore, because the commodity component of the price that  consumers ultimately pay for their natural gas has taken on such  prominence and because states rely on FERC to oversee the commodity  market, it is increasingly important for stakeholders to understand what  FERC is doing to police this market. In this regard, FERC recognizes the  need to provide more information to stakeholders about its oversight  efforts and has multiple ways to do so, such as through its Web site. In  providing even more information to stakeholders on its oversight efforts,  including information, as appropriate, about ongoing monitoring and  investigation activities, FERC could both increase stakeholders\u2019  understanding about FERC\u2019s efforts to ensure the fairness of natural gas  prices and better deter market manipulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given the potential benefits of providing more information on its oversight  activities, we recommend that the Chairman of FERC provide more  information to stakeholders, including state regulators, other government  officials, and the public, about actions taken by FERC to ensure that  natural gas prices are fair. This effort should be undertaken within existing  law and regulation, build upon the efforts that FERC already has under  way, and use the information FERC already compiles on its monitoring  and investigations. We agree that disclosure of information that is specific  or detailed could provide would-be market manipulators with information  about FERC\u2019s sources and methods of operation. Therefore, we believe it  prudent that the Chairman have initial discretion on how best to do this.  The information we recommend that the Chairman consider providing to  stakeholders, including state regulators and, where possible, the public,  includes the following:  information on how the Office of Enforcement staff analyze natural gas  markets and how the staff go about identifying market anomalies or  unusual market behavior; information on the types of unusual market behavior that warrant further  investigation by the Office of Enforcement; and,   more timely information on the informal and formal investigations under  way, such as the numbers and subject areas but not the identities of those  under investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with a draft copy  of this report for review and comment.", "FERC generally agreed with the report\u2019s findings, conclusions, and  recommendation and offered minor technical comments, which we have  incorporated, as appropriate.
