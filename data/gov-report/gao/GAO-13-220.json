GAO recommended that VA ensure that its NRM estimates fully account for this long-standing pattern, and VA agreed to implement this recommendation. GAO was asked to conduct additional work on NRM spending. In this report, GAO examines, for fiscal years 2006 through 2012, (1) what accounted for the pattern of NRM spending exceeding VA's budget estimates; (2) VA's allocation of resources for NRM to its health care networks; and (3) VA's process for prioritizing NRM spending and the extent to which NRM spending was consistent with these priorities.

The additional resources came from two sources. First, VA spent less than it estimated on non-NRM, facility-related activities such as administrative functions, utilities, and rent, which allowed VA to spend over $2.5 billion more than originally estimated. Lower spending for administrative functions, utilities, and rent accounted for most of the resources estimated but not spent on non-NRM activities. Given that VA has consistently overestimated the costs of such activities in recent years, VA's budget estimates for its non-NRM activities may not be reliable. Second, more than $2.3 billion of the higher than estimated spending on NRM can be attributed to VA having higher than estimated budget resources available. In some years VA received higher appropriations from Congress than requested and supplemental appropriations for NRM--such as those included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The additional budget resources VA used for NRM also included transfers of funds from the agency's appropriations account that funds health care services.", "VA allocated about $7.5 billion in resources for NRM to its 21 health care networks from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2012. VA allocated about $4.6 billion of these resources at the beginning of each fiscal year through the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation--its national, formula-driven system. In addition, VA allocated $2.9 billion during this period from higher than requested annual appropriations and its national reserve account, which is maintained to address contingencies that may develop each fiscal year. In anticipation of such resources, networks typically identify projects that can be implemented if additional funds become available. VA officials told us that they do this to better address the backlog of identified building deficiencies most recently estimated to cost over $9 billion.", "To prioritize NRM spending more centrally, VA established a new process for projects above a minimum threshold, and from fiscal years 2006 through 2012 spending on NRM was generally consistent with VA priorities. Prior to fiscal year 2012, VA provided oral guidance to networks for prioritizing NRM spending and relied on its 21 health care networks to prioritize NRM projects to maintain medical facilities in good working condition and address deficiencies. Beginning in fiscal year 2012, as part of VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process, VA headquarters assumed responsibility for prioritizing more costly NRM projects using a set of weighted criteria. For fiscal year 2012, the threshold for NRM projects to be included in this centralized process was $1 million, while networks remain responsible for prioritizing \"below-threshold\" NRM projects. NRM spending during fiscal years 2006 through 2012 was generally consistent with VA priorities: at least 85 percent of the projects funded in each year were identified by networks as priorities. However, VA has not provided written policies for networks on how to apply SCIP criteria to below-threshold projects, which represented over 40 percent of VA's fiscal year 2012 NRM spending.

One way in  which VA addresses these building deficiencies and modernizes its  medical facilities is by performing various maintenance and improvement  projects\u2014referred to as non-recurring maintenance (NRM). NRM  projects include remodeling space used to deliver mental health or other  clinical services; replacing roofing, windows, and doors; upgrading  heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; and repaving roads and  parking lots.

VA allocates about 80 percent of the health care appropriations to its   21 health care networks through VERA. VA uses methods other than  VERA to allocate the remaining resources to networks and medical  centers for such programs as prosthetics, homeless grants, and state  nursing homes. VA may also use methods other than VERA to allocate  any additional resources it may receive from Congress during the year.  The networks in turn allocate resources received through VERA and other  methods to their respective medical facilities, as part of their role in  overseeing all medical facilities within their networks. In addition to  amounts allocated to networks and medical facilities at the beginning of  the fiscal year, VA also sets aside resources from each of VA\u2019s three  health care appropriations accounts\u2014in what is known as a national  reserve\u2014so that resources are available for contingencies that may arise  during the year.

When  we asked why VA spent more on NRM projects than estimated, VA  officials said one reason was that the agency spent less than it estimated  on non-NRM activities and that the most practical use of these unspent  resources was to increase spending on NRM because of the large  backlog of FCA-identified deficiencies. VA officials further explained that  VA spent less for non-NRM activities than anticipated because of a  decrease in the demand for utilities and other weather-dependent non- NRM activities because of mild weather patterns during the last four  winters.

These additional resources derived from  lower than estimated spending for non-NRM activities and higher than  requested appropriations. Further, our work shows that spending for  administrative functions, utilities, and rent accounted for most of the lower  than estimated non-NRM spending in recent years. Thus, given the  underestimates for these activities, VA\u2019s future budget estimates for non- NRM activities in its budget justification may not be reliable if the agency  continues to determine its estimates in the same way.", "VA has taken important steps in establishing a centralized process for  prioritizing more costly NRM projects through SCIP, and during the period  we reviewed, VA\u2019s funded NRM projects were generally consistent with  agency priorities. However, VA does not have reasonable assurance that  spending on NRM will be consistent with criteria included in SCIP. Our  work shows that while networks remain responsible for prioritizing below- threshold NRM projects, VA has not provided its networks with written  policies for prioritizing these less costly NRM projects. Spending on these  projects is not insignificant: in fiscal year 2012, spending on projects  below the threshold was over $625 million or 42 percent of VA\u2019s spending  on NRM. Without written policies that clearly document VA\u2019s guidance to  networks for prioritizing below-threshold NRM projects, VA faces a  continued risk that its networks may not apply, or may inconsistently  apply, the criteria included in SCIP when funding these projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend the Secretary of Veterans Affairs take the following  actions:  to improve the reliability of information presented in VA\u2019s  congressional budget justifications that support the President\u2019s budget  request for VA health care, determine why recent justifications have  overestimated spending for non-NRM activities and incorporate the  results to improve future budget estimates for such activities; and  to provide reasonable assurance that VA\u2019s networks prioritize NRM  spending consistent with VA\u2019s overall NRM priorities, establish written  policies for its networks for applying SCIP criteria when prioritizing the  funding of NRM projects that are below the threshold for inclusion in  VA\u2019s centralized prioritization process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for  comment. In the agency\u2019s comments\u2014reprinted in appendix I\u2014VA  concurred with both of our recommendations. In concurring with our first  recommendation regarding improvements needed in its estimates for  non-NRM activities, VA noted that the budget formulation process has  been modified to include a better synchronization of events that play a  significant role in the overestimated spending for non-NRM activities. VA  stated that this modification has been incorporated in the fiscal year 2014  President\u2019s budget. In concurring with our second recommendation  regarding written guidance on the application of SCIP criteria to  prioritization of below-threshold NRM projects, VA noted that the NRM  handbook and related guidance will be updated to direct facilities and  networks to apply SCIP criteria when prioritizing below-threshold NRM  projects. In addition, networks\u2019 Capital Asset Managers, who are  responsible for monitoring and evaluating each network\u2019s NRM program,  will be required to review below-threshold NRM projects included in a  network\u2019s operating plan.
