States may provide program participants with a range of employment and training activities that qualify them for food stamp benefits. USDA data show that, in fiscal year 2001, job search accounted for about half of all participant activities. Work experience--whereby participants receive food stamp benefits in exchange for work--accounted for about 25 percent. Food Stamp E&T services are delivered through a variety of local entities, such as welfare offices or one-stop centers--sites designed to streamline the services of many federal employment and training programs. While all but 1 of the 15 states delivered at least some of their Food Stamp E&T services at the one-stops, Food Stamp E&T participants do not usually engage in intensive services provided by other programs at the one-stops. Program officials from most of the 15 states noted that Food Stamp E&T participants generally lack basic skills that allow them to use other program services successfully. No nationwide data exist on whether the Food Stamp E&T Program helps participants get a job. While some outcome data exist at the state level, it is not clear the outcomes were the result of program participation.

Most state officials told us that they did  not collect data on how many Food Stamp E&T participants were referred  to or received services from other employment and training programs at  the one-stops. However, local officials in 10 of the 15 states told us that  few, if any Food Stamp E&T participants actually receive services from  other employment and training programs at the one-stops, and a few  provided estimates. For example, a local official in New Mexico estimated  that his office referred about one-fourth of its Food Stamp E&T  participants to the WIA Adult Program in any given year, but less than half  of these are actually enrolled in the program. Local officials in Idaho, by  comparison, said that while about one-third of their Food Stamp E&T  participants are referred in any given year, only about 2 percent are  enrolled in WIA-funded intensive or training services. A Food Stamp E&T  administrator in Michigan told us that, even though the Food Stamp E&T  Program is colocated at a one-stop center in his county, the center served  only three or four clients a year.", "Program officials cited several reasons that Food Stamp E&T participants  may not receive services from other employment and training programs.  Officials from eight of the states we spoke with suggested that local WIA  staff might be reluctant to provide WIA-funded intensive and training  services to a population less likely to get and keep a job\u2014such as those in  the Food Stamp E&T Program\u2014out of concern that they would adversely  affect their performance as measured under WIA. While job seekers who  receive core services that are self-service in nature are not included in  these performance measures, participants enrolled in WIA-funded  intensive or training programs are tracked in areas such as job placement,  retention, and earnings change. WIA established these performance  measures, and states are held accountable by the U.S. Department of  Labor for their performance in these areas. If states fail to meet their  expected performance levels, they may suffer financial sanctions; if states  meet or exceed their levels, they may be eligible to receive additional  funds.", "While employment and training programs at the one-stops offer some of  the activities that Food Stamp E&T participants need, officials from 12 of  the 15 states we contacted told us that most participants are not ready for  these activities, in part, because they lack basic skills (such as reading and  computer literacy) that would allow them to successfully participate.  Officials from 5 states also noted that mental health problems often  prevent Food Stamp E&T participants from participating in other more  intensive employment and training programs at the one-stops. Program  officials told us participants often need specialized case management  services that might not be available from other program staff.", "Despite concerns about performance measures and the skill level of Food  Stamp E&T participants, program officials from all 15 states we contacted  cited advantages to colocating the Food Stamp E&T Program at the one- stops. The most frequently cited advantage was that Food Stamp E&T  participants would benefit from having access to a broader array of  employment and training services. In addition, officials from 9 of the states  noted that colocation would provide a better use of program resources  and staff, and program officials from 8 states said that the one-stops offer  a more positive environment\u2014one focused more on work and training  than might be found in local welfare offices. Finally, officials from 7 states  said that for those who may lack transportation, colocation of services  would be advantageous."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Little Is Known about What the Program Achieves", "paragraphs": ["Little information is available about whether the Food Stamp E&T  Program is effective in helping participants get and keep a job. Although  USDA does not require the reporting of outcome data, 7 of the 15 states we  contacted collected data in fiscal year 2001 on job placements, and 2 of  these states also collected data on wages. Their job placement rates  ranged from 15 percent in one state to 62 percent in another, and the  average starting wages reported by the 2 states was about $7.00 per hour  or about $1.91 above the federal minimum wage.", "In the late 1980s, USDA developed outcome measures for the Food Stamp  E&T Program, but these measures were not implemented because of  concerns among state and federal officials regarding the feasibility of  collecting outcome data. In 1988, the Hunger Prevention Act directed the  Secretary of Agriculture to work with states and other federal agencies to  develop outcome-based performance standards for the program. The  proposed measures included a targeted job placement rate (25 percent of  those completing Food Stamp E&T activities) and a targeted average  starting wage of $4.45\u2014about the same as the minimum wage in the early  1990s. FNS published the proposed performance standards in   1991. According to USDA officials, reaction to implementing the proposed  standards was overwhelmingly negative, with a consensus among state  and federal officials that data collection would impose an unreasonable  burden on state agencies and that the costs associated with collecting the  data would be disproportionate relative to the program\u2019s funding. The  mandate to collect outcome data was subsequently removed from the  legislation in 1996.", "Outcome measures became a much greater factor in how agencies assess  the effectiveness of their programs with the passage of the 1993  Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). GPRA shifted the  focus of accountability for federal programs from inputs, such as staffing  and activity levels, to outcomes. GPRA requires that each federal agency  develop a multiyear strategic plan identifying the agency\u2019s mission and  long-term goals and connecting these goals to program activities. In  addition, the President\u2019s 2004 Budget contains increased emphasis on  performance and management assessments, including a focus on short- term and long-term performance goals and the need to track performance  data in order to assess a program\u2019s achievements. For example, the Office  of Management and Budget expects agencies to submit performance-based  budgets in 2005 and is requiring that many adult employment and training  programs (25) collect performance data in four areas-job placements, job  retention, earnings gained, and program cost per job placement. This focus  may lend new urgency for programs to collect outcome data.", "While outcome measures are an important component of program  management in that they assess whether a participant is achieving an  intended outcome\u2014such as obtaining employment\u2014they cannot measure  whether the outcome is a direct result of program participation. Other  influences, such as the state of the local economy, may affect an  individual\u2019s ability to find a job as much or more than participation in an  employment and training program. Many researchers consider impact  evaluations to be the best method for determining the effectiveness of a  program\u2014that is, whether the program itself rather than other factors  leads to participant outcomes.", "In 1988, USDA commissioned an impact study to determine the  effectiveness of the Food Stamp E&T Program and found that those  required to enroll in the program did not fare any better, in terms of  employment or wages, than those excluded from participating. While the  study found that those required to enroll in the program increased their  employment and earnings during the 12 months after certification for food  stamp benefits, it found no difference between that group and those not  required to participate. The study notes, however, that only 43 percent of  those required to participate actually received employment and training  activities in 1988 and that the services received by the program  participants consisted primarily of referrals to job search activities.", "According to USDA officials, the agency has no plans to conduct another  effectiveness evaluation of the Food Stamp E&T Program. They noted that  the program is not a research priority for the agency\u2019s food and nutrition  area, and no mention of the program is noted in FNS\u2019s strategic plan. They  also noted that the cost of an evaluation might not be warranted, given the  limited funding for the program. Federal funding for the program  (including reimbursements for administrative costs) is small compared  with other programs\u2014averaging about $172 million per year between   1994 and 2001\u2014compared to about $3.8 billion for WIA programs in fiscal  year 2001. However, the federal government and the states have spent over  $2 billion since 1994 on the Food Stamp E&T Program without any  nationwide data documenting whether the program is helping its  participants.", "While impact evaluations may be expensive and complex to administer,  they are being used to assess the effectiveness of some federal programs.  For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is  conducting evaluation studies on early childhood programs, and the  Department of Labor recently evaluated the impact of the Job Corps  program on student employment outcomes. In addition, both of these  agencies are conducting research over the next 5 years that focuses on  strategies to assist the hardest-to-serve, but they do not include the Food  Stamp E&T population. HHS is commissioning an evaluation of programs  that serve the hard-to-employ low-income parents, in part, to determine  the effects of such programs on employment and earnings. And, Labor has  plans to examine the most effective strategies for addressing employment  barriers such as substance abuse and homelessness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Food Stamp E&T Program was established to help some food stamp  recipients get a job and reduce their dependence on food stamps. For  many Food Stamp E&T participants\u2014who often lack the skills to be  successful in other employment and training programs and who usually  are not eligible for most other federal assistance programs\u2014this program  is the only one focused on helping them enter the workforce. But little is  known at any level\u2014federal, state, or local\u2014about whether the program is  achieving this goal. Little nationwide data exist to tell us who is  participating or if they are getting a job. Even less is known about whether  the services provided by the program make a difference in program  outcomes. With limited knowledge of whom the program is serving, what  outcomes the program is achieving, or whether program services are  making a difference, it is difficult to make informed decisions about where  to place limited employment and training resources. Given recent  legislative changes that reduce most states\u2019 funds, while allowing more  discretion as to whom they serve, it may be even more essential to  understand what works and what does not.

To do so,  USDA should clarify its instructions for reporting the data so that  states clearly identify which food stamp recipients are in the Food  Stamp E&T Program.", "Establish uniform outcome measures for the Food Stamp E&T  Program and require states to collect and report them.", "Work with the Department of Labor and/or the Department of Health  and Human Services on a research agenda that will allow for an  evaluation of the effectiveness of the Food Stamp E&T Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA for comment.

Regarding our  recommendation for more data on whom the program is serving, FNS said  that because the Food Stamp Quality Control survey collects information  from only a sample of food stamp households\u2014and that individuals  participating in the Food Stamp E&T Program would comprise a small  percentage of those included in the sample\u2014the data collected would be  of limited use at the state level. While we agree that characteristic data  gathered from the survey may not be useful at the state level, the survey  could provide a cost-effective means to obtain nationwide data that are  currently not available and would allow FNS to better understand the  population that the program is serving.", "While FNS agreed with the need to assess what the Food Stamp E&T  Program is achieving, agency officials expressed concerns regarding the  cost of implementing our recommendation related to outcome data.   Specifically, the officials are concerned that states will find it overly  burdensome to collect outcome data given the limited funding for this  program and that costs associated with collecting these data might reduce  funding available for program participants. The officials noted that other  employment and training programs that collect outcome data, such as  WIA-funded programs, are funded at much higher levels than the Food  Stamp E&T Program and that costs associated with collecting data for  these programs might not be as onerous as for the Food Stamp E&T  Program.", "We considered the costs associated with collecting outcome data and  while we agree that collecting data will entail additional administrative  costs for the states, we believe that the benefits of collecting uniform  outcome measures outweigh the costs to states.  Having some measures of  what the program is achieving is necessary for FNS and state  administrators as they strive to improve program services\u2014about half of  the states we contacted already collect some data on program  performance. In addition, outcome data provide the Congress with key  information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of federal employment  and training programs. Many federal employment and training programs,  including ones that have funding levels similar to the Food Stamp E&T  Program, have integrated outcome measures into the administration of  their programs. The emphasis on performance evaluation is reflected in  the President\u2019s 2004 Budget and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  requirement that agencies submit performance-based budgets and that  employment and training programs collect uniform performance data.", "Finally, FNS reiterated that given its limited research funds and other high-  priority research areas, evaluation of the Food Stamp E&T Program is not  a research priority for the agency at this time.
