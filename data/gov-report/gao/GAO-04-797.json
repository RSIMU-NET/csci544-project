In particular, Congress has provided agencies with additional hiring flexibilities, OPM has taken significant steps to modernize job vacancy announcements and develop the government's recruiting Web site, and most agencies are continuing to automate parts of their hiring processes. Still, problems remain with a job classification process that many view as antiquated, and there is a need for improved tools to assess the qualifications of job candidates. On the basis of our survey of members of the interagency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council, agencies appear to be making limited use of two new hiring flexibilities that could help agencies in expediting and controlling their hiring processes. Frequently cited barriers to using the new hiring flexibilities included (1) the lack of OPM guidance for using the flexibilities, (2) the lack of agency policies and procedures for using the flexibilities, (3) the lack of flexibility in OPM rules and regulations, and (4) concern about possible inconsistencies in the implementation of the flexibilities within the department or agency. The federal government is now facing one of the most transformational changes to the civil service in half a century. Today's challenge is to define the appropriate roles and day-to-day working relationships for OPM and individual agencies as they collaborate on developing innovative and more effective hiring systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["High-performance organizations need dynamic, results-oriented  workforces with the requisite knowledge and up-to-date skills to  accomplish their missions and achieve their goals.

Improving the federal hiring process is critical given the increasing number  of new hires expected in the next few years.  In fiscal year 2003, the  executive branch hired nearly 95,000 new employees.

Under  delegated examining authority, agencies conduct competitive examinations  that comply with merit system principles, other personnel-related laws, and  regulations as set forth in OPM\u2019s Delegated Examining Operations  Handbook.  OPM is responsible for ensuring that the personnel  management functions it delegates to agencies are conducted in  accordance with merit principles and the standards it has established for  conducting those functions.", "The federal hiring process involves notifying the public that the  government will accept applications for a job, screening applications  against minimum qualification standards, and assessing applicants' relative  competencies or knowledge, skills, and abilities against job-related criteria  to identify the most qualified applicants.  Federal agencies typically  examine or assess candidates by rating and ranking them based on of their  experience, training, and education, rather than by testing them.  Figure 1  shows the typical steps for filling vacancies through the competitive  examining process.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 contained new hiring flexibilities that  could help agencies in expediting and controlling their hiring processes\u2014  category rating and direct-hire authority.

Federal hiring in the mid-1990s declined  because many agencies were downsizing and did not need to fill positions.   Increasingly, agencies began hiring new employees, particularly because of  a slowdown in downsizing and growing numbers of employees retiring.  In  fiscal year 2003, the largest federal hirer was DOD, which brought on board  more than one-third of all hires.  The number of federal hires decreased in  2003 over 2002, which was primarily because of the hiring of nearly 35,000  airport screeners in 2002 into the newly created Transportation Security  Administration.

Numerous studies and research over the past  decade by OPM, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the National  Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), the Partnership for Public  Service, the National Commission on the Public Service, and GAO have  noted concerns and problems with the federal hiring process, as the  following examples illustrate.", "In October 2001, the Partnership for Public Service released the results  of a poll it had commissioned that found \u201cmany people view the process  of seeking federal employment as a daunting one.  Three-quarters of  non-federal workers say making the application process quicker and  simpler would be an effective way of attracting talented workers to  government.\u201d", "In July 2002, NAPA reported that federal \u201chiring remains a slow and  tedious process.\u201d The report noted that \u201cMany managers are attempting  to rebuild a pipeline of entry level employees in this very competitive  labor market, yet current hiring methods do not keep pace with the  private sector.\u201d", "In September 2002, MSPB said that the federal hiring process has a  number of key problems including \u201coverly complex and ineffective  hiring authorities\u201d and \u201cinadequate, time-consuming assessment  procedures.\u201d", "In November 2002, OPM in its strategic plan for 2002 through 2007  stated, \u201cThere is a general perception that our hiring process takes too  long and may not provide well-qualified candidates.\u201d", "In January 2003, the National Commission on the Public Service said,  \u201cRecruitment to federal jobs is heavily burdened by ancient and illogical  procedures that vastly complicate the application process and limit the  hiring flexibility of individual managers.\u201d", "Our May 2003 report on federal hiring summarized these concerns and  added further evidence to confirm many of the problems and issues that  have been identified over the past decade.  As many of these and other  studies have noted, and as many human resources directors pointed out in  our prior interviews, nearly all parts of the competitive hiring process  hamper effective and efficient federal hiring.  Key problem areas identified  in our May 2003 report included the following.", "Outdated and cumbersome procedures to define a job and set the pay  are not applicable to the jobs and work of today.", "Unclear, unfriendly job announcements cause confusion, delay hiring,  and serve as poor recruiting tools.", "A key assessment tool and hiring programs used for several entry-level  positions are ineffective.", "Convening panels and the manual rating and ranking of applicants to  determine best-qualified applicants is time-consuming.", "Numerical rating and ranking and the \"rule of three\" limit the choice of  applicants and are viewed as ineffective.", "As noted previously, our prior work surveying human resources directors,  along with the work of others, indicated that the time-to-hire is too long for  most federal hires.  Comprehensive department or governmentwide data  on time-to-hire are often not available; however, in fiscal year 2002, OPM  compiled and analyzed data on time-to-hire and found that it typically took  on average about 102 days for agencies to fill a vacancy using the  competitive process.  At that time, OPM measured time-to-hire from the  period between when the request to hire or fill a position was received in  the human resources office to the appointment of an applicant to the  position.  Additional time might be needed for a manager to obtain  approval for the requested hiring action at the beginning of the process or  for the new employee to receive a security clearance at the end of the  process.

OPM has taken actions  to address federal hiring across the board and for specific parts of the  hiring process.  For example, in February of this year, the Director of OPM  issued a memorandum to the CHCOs of federal agencies offering 10 ways  that agencies can immediately improve their hiring processes using  authorities they already possess.  Steps outlined in this memo include fully  engaging the agency\u2019s human resources staff and offering recruiting  incentives such as recruitment bonuses, relocation expenses, and student  loan repayments.  In addition, to encourage agencies to improve their  hiring processes, OPM is urging agencies to implement a new 45-day hiring  model, which measures the time-to-hire period from the date the vacancy  announcement closes to the date a job offer is extended.  OPM officials  said they would work closely with agencies to deploy all appropriate  flexibilities to meet this goal.  According to OPM, agencies will be scored  under the Human Capital Initiative of the President's Management Agenda  on their progress toward reducing time-to-hire.  In addition, OPM is  administering a survey of CHCOs on agency hiring practices to identify  opportunities to use the flexibilities strategically, eliminate remaining  outmoded practices, and generally expedite the hiring process.", "OPM and agencies have also taken actions to address various key parts of  the federal hiring process.  These parts, which are discussed in this section,  include reforming the classification system, improving job announcements  and Web postings, automating hiring processes, and improving candidate  assessment tools.  Our May 2003 report on federal hiring outlined  recommendations to OPM dealing with these key parts of the hiring  process.  While OPM has placed concerted attention on three of these key  parts of the hiring process, focused attention and action by OPM to  improve assessment tools, as we recommended in our May 2003 report,  could further help agencies in identifying the best candidates for federal  jobs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reforming the Classification System Could Better Facilitate Filling Positions with the Right Employees", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported the conclusion of many that the standards and  process for defining a job and determining pay in the federal government  are a key hiring problem because they are inflexible, outdated, and not  applicable to the jobs of today.  The classification system is intended to  categorize jobs or positions according to the kind of work done, the level of  difficulty and responsibility, and the qualifications required for the position,  and is to serve as a building block to determine the pay for the position.   Generally, defining a job and setting pay in the federal government must be  based on standards in the Classification Act of 1949, which sets out 15  grade levels of the General Schedule (GS) expressed in terms of the  difficulty and level of responsibility for each specific position.  The  federal classification process and standard job classifications were  generally developed decades ago when typical jobs were more narrowly  defined and often clerical or administrative in nature.  However, jobs in  today's knowledge-based organizations often require a much broader array  of tasks that may cross over the narrow and rigid boundaries of job  classification standards and make it difficult to fit the job appropriately  into one of the over 400 federal occupations.  According to a recent OPM  study, a key problem with federal job classification is that, under present  rules, characteristics such as workload, quality of work, and results are not  classification factors that can affect the overall level of basic pay for a  position.  Given this limitation, the resulting job classifications and  related pay might hamper efforts to fill the positions with the right  employees.", "Our May 2003 report noted some actions that OPM and agencies had taken  to address the federal job classification process.  For example, we reported  that some agencies had automated their complicated classification  processes to reduce the time it takes to carry out this task.  The  Department of the Army, for instance, created a centralized database that  gives human resources managers at Army access to active position  descriptions and position-related information to help in classifying jobs.  In  addition, we noted that OPM had revised the classification standards for  several job series, including health care professions and law enforcement,  to make them clearer and more relevant to current job duties and  responsibilities.  At that time, OPM pointed out that the classification  standards and process needed to be reformed and that changes to the  Classification Act of 1949 were needed to make fundamental changes to  how jobs are defined and pay is set.  Our report noted, however, that OPM  recognized the need to maintain the GS system in the absence of an  alternative and well-managed transition to a new system.", "In our May 2003 report, we also recommended that OPM study how to  improve, streamline, and reform the classification process.  In response to  our questions about the status of OPM\u2019s actions on this recommendation,  OPM said that it has recently taken several actions to address the job  classification process.  OPM stated that most classification standards are  being issued as \u201cjob family\u201d standards, which OPM said allows it to study  related occupations together to identify both commonalities and  differences.  OPM also said that it is working closely with agencies to  ensure that classification standards reflect the current nature of federal  work.  OPM noted, for example, that it is working with a number of  agencies to develop a new job family standard for administrative work in  the occupational series covering investigative work.  In addition, OPM said  that it is exploring an integrated approach to classification and  qualification standards.  By integrating these two functions into a single  occupational standard, OPM hopes to make more clear the link between  the work conducted in an occupation, the competencies required to  perform that work, and the requirements that individuals must  demonstrate to be placed into these positions.  OPM believes an integrated  approach for classification and qualifications standards will improve the  quality of the federal workforce through competency-based qualifications  that identify the full range needed for successful job performance.  This  new approach thus could better enable federal agencies to hire the right  person at the right time.", "OPM also recently collaborated with DHS to help reform its personnel  system.  The Homeland Security Act, which created DHS, provided it with  significant flexibility to design a modern human capital system.   Specifically, DHS may deviate from the classification and most pay rate  requirements contained in Title 5 of the U.S. Code.  Under proposed  regulations, DHS would create broad pay bands for much of the  department in place of the 15-grade GS system now in place for much of the  civil service.  Several OPM-sponsored demonstration projects over the past  20 years have demonstrated the efficacy of pay banding systems that were  similar to the system being proposed by DHS.  Last September, we  reported that DHS\u2019s process for designing its new human capital system  involved significant collaboration with OPM and generally reflected the  important elements of a successful transformation, including effective  communication and employee involvement.  A new OPM initiative is to  collaborate with DOD as that department also develops and implements its  new personnel system\u2014the National Security Personnel System.  In  testimony earlier this year, we stressed that DOD could benefit from  employing a collaborative and inclusive process similar to that used by  DHS.", "Additionally, in April 2004, OPM released a draft publication entitled OPM\u2019s  Guiding Principles for Civil Service Transformation, which, as its title  suggests, proposes a set of principles for reshaping the civil service  system.  In this draft document, OPM states that the modernization of the  federal job classification process should begin with governmentwide  legislation that mirrors the flexibilities provided to DHS and DOD.  OPM  also indicates that reform in the areas of pay and performance management  systems should be a top priority, and that if agencies governmentwide do  not receive reforms similar to those that DHS and DOD have received in  this area, agencies risk being at a competitive disadvantage in recruiting a  talented workforce.  Furthermore, OPM\u2019s draft document suggests that  there is no need for further testing of pay-for-performance approaches in  the federal government and that it is now time to extend the DHS and DOD  pay-for-performance frameworks to other agencies that are ready to  modernize their human resources systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Views of the CHCO Council Members", "paragraphs": ["In our April 2004 survey of the members of the CHCO Council, 13 of the 22  respondents said that they were aware of efforts that OPM has made to  reform the federal classification process (see app. II for further  information).

Conversely, a Council member representing an independent agency said he  was not aware of any significant OPM-led reforms related to classification.   For those respondents who said they were aware of any OPM efforts to  reform the classification process, we also asked about the extent to which  OPM\u2019s efforts had helped their agencies and about their level of satisfaction  or dissatisfaction with such OPM efforts and related proposals.

OPM pointed out that it does not have the option of  accommodating the persistent broadening of work levels that has occurred  in organizations throughout the post-industrial workplace by establishing  standards that reflect fewer, broader levels of work.  OPM has noted that its  ability to more effectively reform the classification process is limited under  current law and that legislation is needed to modify the current restrictive  classification process for the majority of federal agencies.

During the work for that report, our interviews with several  agency human resources directors revealed that federal job  announcements are frequently incomprehensible and make it difficult for  applicants to determine what the jobs require, and therefore do not serve  as effective recruiting tools.  We cited reports from MSPB that said  vacancy announcements often included poor organization and readability,  unclear job titles and duties, vague or restrictive qualification standards,  and the use of negative language or tone that might deter many qualified  candidates.  MSPB also said that some job announcements were lengthy  and difficult to read online, contained jargon and acronyms, and appeared  to be written for people already employed by the government.  MSPB  further noted that many of the announcements it reviewed did not include  information on retirement and other benefits, such as vacation time and  medical and health insurance, which might entice people to apply.  As we  pointed out in our previous report, making vacancy announcements more  visually appealing, informative, and easy to access and navigate could  make them much more effective as recruiting tools.", "Prior to the issuance of our last report on federal hiring, OPM had initiated  some actions to help make job announcements easier to access and  understand.  OPM initiated an interagency project to modernize federal job  vacancy announcements, including providing guidance to agencies to  improve announcements.  OPM also worked to obtain contractor support  to enhance its USAJOBS Web site with the goals of making it easier and  quicker for people to find federal jobs and enhancing the site\u2019s \u201ceye- catching\u201d appeal.  This effort is part of the Recruitment One-Stop initiative,  which, as the name implies, would provide a one-stop Web site for federal  job seekers by implementing a single application point that includes  vacancy information, job application submission, application status  tracking, employment eligibility screening, and applicant database mining.", "More recently, OPM also has taken additional steps to make job  announcements and Web postings more user friendly and effective.  In  August 2003, OPM revamped the USAJOBS Web site to feature a quicker  job-search engine, sorting capabilities, and accessibility for disabled users.   Other new features included allowing applicants to create and save  application letters and store up to five resumes online as well as making  posted resumes searchable by agency recruiters.  In an effort to centralize  and streamline the process, OPM had also originally proposed to have  executive branch agencies shut down their agency-unique job search  engines and resume builders.  This raised concerns by competing private  vendors offering their own recruitment and hiring software to agencies.   According to OPM, in response to these concerns, it informed agencies that  they were free to adopt any online recruiting and hiring system they wish as  long as the system eventually was integrated with the governmentwide  online recruitment system.", "In March, we reported on the progress of various electronic government  initiatives, including the OPM-led Recruitment One-Stop initiative.  We  noted OPM\u2019s goal to increase customer satisfaction with the federal  application process through Recruitment One-Stop.

We also reported that a resume-mining tool to identify candidates had been  implemented as part of the Web site but the tool had not been widely used  to date.  OPM told us that the addition of the resume-mining tool was one of  many recent changes to the USAJOBS Web site and OPM had not yet fully  trained agencies on the use of this tool.  Nevertheless, according to OPM,  since launching the new USAJOBS technology in August 2003, more than  500,000 new resumes have been created and over 325,000 of the resumes  are searchable.

Prior to assessing applicants based on their relative merits,  agencies must conduct a screening process to determine if applicants meet  eligibility requirements (such as U.S. citizenship) and the basic or minimum  education or work experience qualifications that OPM established for such  a position.  As we reported, in a manual hiring system, human resources  staff would have to review all the applications and document why an  applicant did or did not meet minimum qualifications.  If there is a large  number of applicants, carrying out this process can be time consuming.  We  also pointed out that once the applicants' eligibilities are determined,  agencies typically undertake a labor-intensive effort to establish and  convene assessment panels and manually rate and rank the candidates  based on their relative merits.  Some of the delay in convening the  assessment panels is due to assembling the appropriate managers and  subject matter experts, coordinating their availability, and factoring in the  exigencies of other demands.  Once formed, the panel sorts through all of  the applicants' paperwork, assesses the applicants, and determines a  numerical score for each applicant by rating the education and experience  described by the applicant against the evaluation criteria in the crediting  plan for the position.", "The use of automation for agency hiring processes has various potential  benefits, including eliminating the need for volumes of paper records,  allowing fewer individuals to review and process job applications, and  reducing the overall time-to-hire.  Automation can facilitate almost every  step of the federal hiring process.  For example, an automated hiring  system could electronically determine if an applicant met the basic  qualifications and electronically provide timely notification to the applicant  of the status of his or her application.  Automation could also streamline  the process by electronically rating and ranking applicants, or placing them  in quality categories, eliminating the need to form panels to assess the  applicants.  In addition, automated systems typically create records of  actions taken so that managers and human capital staff can easily  document their decisions related to hiring.  Nonetheless, agencies need to  recognize the importance of careful planning and implementation when  automating their hiring processes.  As we have previously reported, agencies should first validate their requirements and look at reengineering  their administrative processes before developing any information systems  to support their processes.", "In our May 2003 report, we related that OPM had taken some actions to  help agencies automate and streamline their hiring processes.

Using the right assessment tool, or combination of tools,  can assist the agency in predicting the relative success of each applicant on  the job and selecting the relatively best person for the job.", "Our May 2003 report particularly discussed the ineffectiveness of candidate  assessment tools associated with filling occupations covered by the  Luevano consent decree.  We noted that the Administrative Careers with  America (ACWA) self-rating examination that is used to competitively fill  most positions covered by the Luevano consent decree was cumbersome,  delayed hiring, and often did not provide quality candidates.  This ACWA  rating-schedule examination contains 157 multiple-choice questions that  are designed to distinguish among qualified applicants on the basis of their  self-rated education and life experience.  In our May 2003 report, we noted  that many agencies reported that the primary reason they did not use the  ACWA examination was their past experiences with the quality of the  candidates.  For positions that are not covered by the Luevano consent  decree, agencies typically examine candidates by rating and ranking them  based on experience, training, and education, instead of administering  tests.", "Our May 2003 report also discussed the challenges associated with the  special hiring programs established under the consent decree\u2014 Outstanding Scholar and Bilingual/Bicultural.  Many agency human  resources officials we interviewed for our May 2003 report said the  Outstanding Scholar program was a quick way to hire high-quality college  graduates for positions covered by the Luevano consent decree without  using the complex OPM examination process.  However, OPM and MSPB  have commented that this is an inappropriate use of the authority.   Outstanding Scholar allows candidates who meet the eligibility criteria\u2014 baccalaureate grade point average and class standing\u2014to be directly  appointed without competition.  According to MSPB, such criteria are  questionable predictors of future performance, and they deny  consideration to many qualified applicants.  For similar reasons, MSPB also  has concerns about the Bilingual/Bicultural program, which permits  agencies to directly hire applicants who obtained a passing examination  score, without further regard to rank, when the position needs to be filled  by an incumbent with bilingual or bicultural skills and the applicant has the  requisite job skills.  MSPB has recommended abolishing both the  Outstanding Scholar and Bilingual/Bicultural programs because they are  not merit based and because other competitive hiring methods have been  more effective in hiring minorities.", "In general, both OPM and MSPB are concerned about the validity of  candidate assessment tools for all occupations and advocate that agencies  improve their assessment instruments.  OPM told us that because of budget  constraints, it has only been able to develop assessments on a reimbursable  basis when other agencies provide OPM with the needed resources.  OPM  also said that many agencies do not have the technical expertise, funding,  or time to develop valid assessment tools.  MSPB noted that the  government's interest is not well served if agencies do not have the  resources and expertise to make high-quality case examining  determinations.", "Given the problems with these key candidate assessment tools and special  hiring authorities for Luevano-covered positions, we recommended in our  May 2003 report that OPM review the effectiveness of the Outstanding  Scholar and Bilingual/Bicultural Luevano consent decree hiring authorities.   As we noted in our report, OPM recognized that it needed to do more  overall to improve candidate assessment tools.  In its fiscal year 2003  performance plan, OPM included a strategic objective that, by fiscal year  2005, governmentwide hiring selections are to be based on comprehensive  assessment tools that assess the full range of competencies needed to  perform the jobs of the future.  Since the issuance of our report last year,  OPM told us that, as part of the consent decree, it collects data annually on  how agencies used the Outstanding Scholar hiring authority; however, OPM  has not reevaluated assessment tools related to Luevano-covered positions.   OPM acknowledged that assessment tools in general need to be reviewed,  but commented that it is primarily the agency\u2019s responsibility to address  these issues and recommended that agencies perhaps form consortia to  improve their assessment tools.  OPM officials noted that several agencies,  such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs  Service, created their own assessment tools for Luevano positions.  OPM  officials also said that if agencies do not want to develop their own  assessment tools, then they could request that OPM help develop such  tools under the reimbursable service program that OPM operates.", "In technical comments to our draft report, OPM stated that the ACWA  rating schedules are valid assessments that have been approved by the  Department of Justice and that meet professional and legal requirements  for test development and validation.  OPM added that it has efforts  underway to automate the ACWA system as the second phase of its  Recruitment One-Stop initiative.

As we noted earlier, we  previously recommended that OPM, working with the CHCO Council,  should serve as a clearinghouse to foster more use of personnel  flexibilities.  In the hiring area, OPM could gather, analyze, and report on  when, where, and how agencies are using, or should use, direct hire and  category rating procedures to aid in their hiring efforts.", "The federal government is now facing one of the most transformational  changes to the civil service in half a century, which is reflected in the new  personnel systems for DHS and DOD and in new hiring flexibilities  provided to all agencies.  Today\u2019s challenge is to define the appropriate  roles and day-to-day working relationships for OPM and individual  agencies as they collaborate on developing innovative and more effective  hiring systems.  Moreover, human capital expertise within the agencies  must be up to the challenge for this transformation to be successful and  enduring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Director of OPM provided written comments on a draft of this report,  which are shown in appendix III.  In these written comments, the OPM  Director said that OPM has done much to assist agencies and increase their  knowledge about the hiring flexibilities available to them.  She highlighted,  for example, her memoranda to agencies that contain information and  guidance on the use of hiring flexibilities as well as training that OPM  provided to agencies as part of the OPM-sponsored \u201cWorking for America\u201d  recruitment fairs.  She underscored that agencies must rise to the  challenge, provide consistent leadership at the senior level, take advantage  of the training opportunities offered by OPM, and make fixing the hiring  process a priority.", "The OPM Director also commented that the report \u201cappears to rely upon  perceptions that are not consistent with the facts.\u201d  OPM explained this  concern in additional technical comments that were provided by E-mail.  In  these technical comments, OPM raised objections to our use of narrative  responses from our survey of CHCO Council members and requested that  many of these responses be deleted from the final report.  OPM said that in  some instances the opinions expressed by the CHCO Council members  made reference to situations or circumstances that were outside of the  respondent\u2019s agency or personal knowledge and were unsubstantiated.  However, consistent with OPM\u2019s position that agencies must take greater  responsibility for their own hiring processes and that it has effectively  trained agency officials on hiring, it seems to reason that the CHCOs of  these departments and agencies should be in a position to comment  knowledgeably on their agencies\u2019 efforts\u2014and OPM\u2019s efforts in assisting  them\u2014to improve hiring processes.  As noted in the description of our  scope and methodology for this report (see app. I), the results of our survey  represent the views and opinions of the responding CHCO Council  members.

That report  concluded that the federal hiring process needed improvement and made  recommendations to address problems with the job classification process,  job vacancy announcements and Web postings, manual hiring processes,  and hiring assessment tools.", "To respond to the objectives on this engagement, we interviewed officials  from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and members of the  subcommittee on the hiring process of the Chief Human Capital Officers  (CHCO) Council.  Specifically, our questions and review centered on  actions being taken to address the hiring problems and recommendations  identified in our May 2003 report, what new hiring initiatives were  underway, and an assessment of the extent to which agencies are using  category rating and direct-hire authority.  We also collected and reviewed  OPM documents related to federal hiring.", "In addition, we obtained opinions and views on efforts to improve the  federal hiring process as well as agencies\u2019 use of new hiring flexibilities by  interviewing human capital experts at the following organizations.", "The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is an independent,  quasi-judicial agency in the executive branch that hears and decides  civil service cases, reviews OPM regulations, and conducts studies of  the federal government's merit system.", "The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) is an  independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit, congressionally charted  organization that assists federal, state, and local governments in  improving their performance.", "The National Partnership for Public Service is a nonpartisan, nonprofit  organization dedicated to revitalizing the public service.", "We also conducted a survey of the members of the CHCO Council.  The  CHCO Council currently comprises 25 members:  the Director of OPM; the  Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB); CHCOs from executive branch departments, and other agency  CHCOs invited to join by the OPM Director, who serves as chair of the  Council.  We sent our questionnaire to the 23 Council members serving as  CHCOs representing federal departments and agencies; our survey did not  include the Director of OPM or the Deputy Director for Management of  OMB.  Specifically, the Council members we surveyed were the CHCOs  from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education,  Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and  Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation,  Treasury, and Veterans Affairs; and CHCOs from the Central Intelligence  Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, General Services  Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, OPM, Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation,  and Social Security Administration.  Twenty-two of the 23 Council  members responded to our questionnaire.  The CHCO Council member  from the Central Intelligence Agency did not respond to our survey because  his representative said the agency was an excepted service agency and thus  the survey questions were not relevant.", "Our survey of the CHCO Council members included questions to help us  address both engagement objectives.  For the first objective, we asked  questions about the parts of the hiring process we had identified in our May  2003 report\u2014specifically, reforming the classification process, automating  hiring processes, improving job announcements and Web postings, and  developing improved hiring assessment tools.  For the second objective, we  asked questions about the use of category rating and direct-hire authority  and the possible barriers hindering agencies\u2019 use of these two new hiring  flexibilities.", "The results of our survey reflect the views and opinions of the responding  CHCO Council members.  As noted above for objective one, we asked the  survey recipients if their agencies had made efforts in the four hiring areas;  however, we did not ask respondents to specifically identify those efforts  nor did we conduct other data collection efforts to verify the nature or  extent of such efforts.  Similarly, for objective two related to the use of  category rating or direct-hire authority, we asked the Council members  their views about the extent of use of the two flexibilities.", "The questionnaire we used contained 34 questions and was developed from  March through April 2004 by a social science survey specialist and other  individuals knowledgeable about the OPM reforms.

We  reviewed the additional barriers identified and counted the number of  instances where two or more respondents identified a similar barrier and  included those frequency counts in our report.  Given the broad scope of  the questions asking for any additional comments, we did not perform a  similar content analysis of CHCO responses to those broad questions.   However, we included some of those additional comments by individual  CHCOs in this report to illustrate the diversity of views provided by the  CHCOs on these topics.", "In addition, we used data from OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF)  to identify the total new hires by federal department and agency for fiscal  year 2003.

Data on agencies\u2019 use of category  rating is not maintained in the CPDF.  As noted in the body of this report, it  is possible that when new personnel authorities are authorized (any new  codes established for the CPDF), personnel officials might continue to use  old codes and therefore underreport the use of the new authority.  With the  exception of the concern just noted, based on previous GAO work, the  CPDF data are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of providing  background information on new hires.", "We provided a draft of this report to OPM for review and comment.
