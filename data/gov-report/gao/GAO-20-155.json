These practices are to: (1) develop an accurate inventory of telecommunications services, (2) perform a strategic analysis of telecommunications requirements, (3) develop a structured transition management approach, (4) identify the resources needed for the transition, and (5) develop a transition plan. The agencies provided several reasons for partially implementing the practices. For example, transition officials at Commerce, NASA, and VA said that they were not responsible for tracking all of the telecommunications services in use at their agencies; as such, they were unable to provide complete telecommunications inventories. The agencies also planned to implement certain practices after they issue their EIS task orders.

The most recent transition to Networx, which began in  2007, took 33 months longer than planned and the majority of agencies  experienced transition delays. In 2013, we reported that these delays led  to an increase of $66.4 million in costs to GSA and an estimated $329  million in lost savings as a result of agencies continuing to order services  from a predecessor contract even after the services were available  through Networx at generally lower rates.

Further, agencies that do not assess risks relative to their mission critical  systems and do not incorporate agency priorities related to those systems  and contingency plans into transition time lines, may encounter problems  and delays during the transition because they are not adequately  prepared to mitigate such risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although the 19 selected agencies reported that they plan to fully  transition to EIS before the current telecommunications contracts expire  in May 2023, over half of the agencies do not plan to complete the  transition by GSA\u2019s September 30, 2022, milestone to do so. By waiting  until close to the end of the current contracts to finish the transition, these  agencies are at risk of experiencing disruptions in service if any issues  arise that result in transition delays, such as inadequate human capital  resources or the need to transition previously unidentified services.  Moreover, given agencies\u2019 poor performance during the last two  transitions\u2014which resulted in significant delays and cost increases\u2014and  their lack of meeting GSA\u2019s two critical EIS transition milestones for 2019,  agencies are again at high risk of experiencing delays during this  transition. Further, agencies will miss out on potential cost savings by  delaying their transitions to the new contracts, which generally have lower  rates for services.", "The five agencies we reviewed had taken steps to prepare for the  transition of their telecommunications services to EIS contracts. However,  these agencies\u2019 lack of full implementation of established planning  practices increases the risk that they will experience adverse effects\u2014 such as schedule delays or cost increases\u2014while transitioning to the new  contracts. Several agencies stated that they intend to implement the  planning practices after they have issued their EIS task orders. However,  limited time remains to complete the transition before the current  telecommunications contracts expire. Further, inadequate project  planning was a key factor that contributed to delays during the prior  transition to Networx. Accordingly, it is critical for agencies to apply a  rigorous management approach from the start of the current transition  using the information that is currently available, even though changes  may be necessary as conditions evolve. Agencies that do not fully adopt  the comprehensive approach captured in these planning practices may  not make the most of the opportunity for change, and the potential to save  costs, that such a major telecommunications transition provides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of 25 recommendations to five agencies, which  includes five each to Commerce, HHS, NASA, State, and VA.", "The Secretary of Commerce should ensure that the agency\u2019s Chief  Information Officer updates the telecommunications inventory to include  all telecommunications assets and services in use at the agency, and  updates Commerce\u2019s process for ongoing maintenance of the inventory  to include the complete inventory.

For example, with regard to  our recommendation that HHS identify and document key  telecommunications transition roles and responsibilities, among other  things, the agency stated that it had (1) established an integrated  program team to coordinate all telecommunications transition  activities, in conjunction with its EIS program management office; (2)  assigned two legal counsel staff to support the EIS transition during its  current procurement phase, as well as for the transition; and (3)  included the agency\u2019s Office of Information Security in reviewing and  providing input into its EIS solicitation. The agency also stated that it  intends to engage the Office of Information Security throughout the  lifecycle of the EIS transition, among other things.", "HHS also provided general comments in response to the findings in  the report. Specifically, the agency described actions that it had taken  to improve its management of the EIS transition. For example, the  agency stated that the Assistant Secretary for Administration decided  to centralize HHS\u2019s EIS transition efforts in March 2019, after it had  conducted a study of risks and costs associated with the  decentralized transition approach that the agency had been taking  since 2017. HHS further stated that it had identified the issues that we  brought up during our review and had proactively worked since March  2019 to establish processes and procedures to manage its transition  in a comprehensive manner. In particular, the agency stated that it  established a fully funded, centralized EIS program management  office to support all of HHS\u2019s operating divisions during the transition.", "Establishing and effectively implementing such management  processes will be critical to the agency\u2019s successful transition to EIS.", "In written comments (reprinted in appendix IV), State concurred with  our five recommendations to the agency.", "In written comments (reprinted in appendix V), VA stated that it  agreed with our conclusions and concurred with our five  recommendations to the agency. VA also stated that it would provide  the actions it plans to take to address the recommendations in its 180- day update to the final report.", "In written comments (reprinted in appendix VI), NASA concurred with  our five recommendations to the agency. It also described actions it  has taken or plans to take to address each recommendation. For  example, the agency described actions it has taken to address our  recommendation calling for NASA to update its telecommunications  inventory to include all telecommunications assets and services in use  at the agency, among other things. Specifically, the agency stated that  the NASA communications contractor, under NASA management  oversight, maintains an inventory of telecommunications assets and  services. The agency added, nevertheless, that unique mission assets  are not included in the inventory, are managed by programs and  projects, and are available to the NASA Office of the Chief Information  Officer.", "We agree that NASA has established an inventory of certain  telecommunications assets and services in use at the agency.  However, as discussed earlier in this report, this inventory includes  only the enterprise-wide assets and services in use at the agency; it  does not include all of the assets and services that individual mission  offices ordered for their own use.

A complete inventory is  also needed for the agency to be able to strategically plan for the  transition, including fully identifying the agency\u2019s future  telecommunications needs and opportunities to optimize or share  services by consolidating them on EIS.", "In addition, NASA described actions it has taken to address our  recommendation calling for the agency to complete efforts to identify  its future telecommunications needs using a complete inventory of  existing telecommunications services. Specifically, the agency stated,  among other things, that it (1) maintains an inventory of  telecommunications services that are within the scope of the EIS  program, and (2) continually identifies and plans for future NASA  telecommunications needs using this inventory.", "However, as discussed earlier, NASA\u2019s inventory of  telecommunications assets and services is not complete because it  does not include the assets and services ordered by the agency\u2019s  individual mission offices. Identifying NASA\u2019s future  telecommunications needs using a complete inventory of  telecommunications services, as we recommended, would help to  ensure that the agency fully identifies these needs.

We then used the telecommunications billing data provided by GSA to categorize the  15 remaining agencies based on the total charges billed to the agencies for fiscal  year 2018. Specifically, in order to ensure that we would select agencies with  different levels of telecommunications spending, we used the following three cost  ranges to categorize the agencies as large, medium, or small:  large \u2013 $100 million or more, medium \u2013 $25 million to less than $100 million, and  small \u2013 less than $25 million.", "We also identified whether each agency had a centralized or decentralized structure  related to its Chief Information Officer office. Further, we identified the number of fair  opportunity EIS solicitations that each agency had released, as of October 31, 2018,  and the total number of solicitations each agency planned to release, as reported on  GSA\u2019s website for tracking agencies\u2019 EIS transition progress.", "Based on the above considerations, we selected five agencies that exhibited a  variety of sizes and structures, and a range of planned and released fair opportunity  EIS solicitations. The selected agencies were Commerce, HHS, NASA, State, and  VA.", "Because we did not review a statistically representative sample of federal agencies,  we could not conclude that our results represent the entire federal government\u2019s  level of preparation.
