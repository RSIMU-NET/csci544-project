We did not attempt to adjust these estimates to reflect changes in the Puerto Rican economy, changes in the behavior of individual taxpayers, or different compliance rates that might result from the imposition of federal income taxes. The data that we used in making our estimates also had some limitations that are explained in the scope and methodology section of this letter and in appendix I.", "Estimates of the impact of tax policy changes are inherently imprecise. Data limitations and the necessity to make certain behavioral and economic assumptions limits the precision of the estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe our analysis is adequate to provide general information about the magnitude of the potential revenue effect of extending full federal income taxation to the residents of Puerto Rico.", "The discussion of the implications of extending federal income taxes to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico should also be viewed in the context of the broader debate about the status of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. The broader issue of whether the benefits and obligations of statehood or independence should be sought for or granted to Puerto Rico is outside the scope of this analysis. However, any changes to tax policy as it affects Puerto Rico may have an impact on or be affected by this broader debate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the Jones Act, Puerto Rico is part of the United States for purposes of acquiring citizenship of the United States by place of birth. Thus, a person born in Puerto Rico is typically considered a U.S. person for U.S. tax purposes and thus is subject to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC). However, IRC has different tax rules for residents of Puerto Rico than it does for residents of the United States. Section 933 of IRC provides that income derived from sources within Puerto Rico by an individual who is a resident of Puerto Rico generally will be excluded from gross income and exempt from U.S. taxation, even if such resident is a U.S. citizen. Section 933 does not exempt residents of Puerto Rico from paying federal taxes on U.S. source income and foreign source income. Nor does section 933 affect the federal payroll taxes that residents of Puerto Rico pay. Federal employment taxes for social security, medicare, and unemployment insurance apply to residents of Puerto Rico on the same basis and for the same sources of income that they are applied to all other U.S. residents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Income Taxes", "paragraphs": ["Puerto Rico has had authority to enact its own income tax system since 1918. The current individual income tax system of Puerto Rico is broadly similar to the U.S. individual income tax system. The Puerto Rican and the U.S. corporate income tax rules have many similarities and some differences. The structure of Puerto Rico\u2019s income tax system is discussed in appendixes II and III.", "The current Puerto Rican income tax system is a significant source of revenue for the Puerto Rican government. In fiscal year 1992, individual and corporate income taxes totaled about 40 percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s total revenues, with transfers from the federal government accounting for about 30 percent of revenue and other taxes, such as excise taxes, generating about 18 percent. The balance of the Commonwealth\u2019s revenues came mainly from nontax sources. For fiscal year 1992, the Puerto Rico Treasury collected about $1.1 billion in individual income taxes and about $1.02 billion in corporate income taxes. About 42 percent of the corporate tax (about $426 million) was paid by U.S. subsidiaries covered by the possessions tax credit. The remaining 58 percent (about $594 million) was paid by corporations not covered by the credit. In addition, about $10 billion of income earned by corporations in Puerto Rico was exempted from the local corporate income tax as a result of Puerto Rico\u2019s industrial tax incentive legislation.", "Currently IRC has special income tax provisions that extend tax benefits to Puerto Rico that are not available to the states. The United States exempts from income taxation\u2014at the federal, state, and local levels\u2014all bonds issued by the Government of Puerto Rico. Corporations organized in Puerto Rico are generally treated as foreign corporations for U.S. income tax purposes. Like other foreign corporations, they are taxed on their U.S. source income, but their Puerto Rico source income is not subject to U.S. tax. Foreign corporations pay U.S. tax at two rates\u2014a flat 30-percent tax is withheld on certain forms of income not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and tax at progressive rates is imposed on income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Much interest income is exempt from the withholding tax. Also, IRC\u2019s possessions tax credit effectively exempts from federal taxation a portion of the income qualified subsidiaries of U.S. corporations (corporations organized in any state of the United States) earn in the possessions. Tax rules related to possessions source income are discussed in more detail in appendix III."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Estimated Total Federal Tax Would Have Been Substantially Reduced by EITC", "paragraphs": ["As of July 1995, 651,201 individual income tax returns for tax year 1992 had been filed with the Government of Puerto Rico. Some of the individuals filing those returns paid federal income tax because they had income from sources within the United States. However, due to section 933 of IRC, which excludes Puerto Rico source income from federal taxation, the vast majority of Puerto Rican taxpayers were not subject to the federal income tax.", "If current federal tax rules were applied to residents of Puerto Rico in the same manner as they are applied to residents of the 50 states, and if the income and demographic characteristics of Puerto Rican taxpayers were the same as they reported on their 1992 tax returns, we estimate that the 651,201 filers would have owed about $623 million in federal income tax before taking EITC into account. The aggregate amount of EITC earned by these taxpayers would have been about $574 million, thus the aggregate net federal tax liability would have been about $49 million (see table 1). We estimate that 384,107 filers, or about 59 percent of the total number, would have earned some EITC. The average amount of EITC earned by the 384,107 filers would have been about $1,494. The median EITC would have been about $1,623 (see table 2).", "Our estimates indicate that, before taking the federal child and dependent care tax credit (DCTC) into account, about 41 percent of the 651,201 households that filed Puerto Rican income tax returns in 1992 would have had positive federal income tax liabilities, about 53 percent would have received net transfers from the federal government because their EITC would have more than offset their precredit liabilities, and the remaining 6 percent would have had no federal tax liability. The lack of adequate information on the child and dependent care expenses of Puerto Rican taxpayers made it impossible for us to estimate the amount of DCTC that each taxpayer in our Puerto Rico database would have earned. The nonrefundable DCTC could only have reduced the number of households having positive tax liabilities and increased the numbers with zero liabilities or net transfers. However, it seems unlikely that the DCTC would have caused a large number of taxpayers to shift from one status to another because our estimates indicate that the average credit earned by those claiming the credit would likely be less than $500. Taxpayers would only move from having a positive tax liability to having a zero tax liability, or receiving a net transfer, if they claimed the credit and if their precredit tax liability were less than the amount of credit claimed.", "If the federal income tax had been fully extended to residents of Puerto Rico in 1992, it seems likely that additional individuals and married couples who had not filed Puerto Rican tax returns would have filed federal tax returns in order to take advantage of EITC. Individuals with AGIs less than or equal to $3,300 and married couples with AGIs less than or equal to $6,000 were not required to file Commonwealth tax returns in 1992. However, some of these individuals filed in order to claim refunds of taxes that had been withheld on their wages, dividends, or interest. Others did not file, for example, because they were not subject to withholding taxes on their wages or salaries, as is the case for domestic workers and farm laborers, or because the amount withheld was small.", "We have no way of knowing with certainty how many of these residents who currently are not required to file would file in order to claim EITC. However, to derive an estimate of what this number might be, we considered the number of people who had income levels below the income tax threshold and also were exempt from withholding as an upper limit of the number of these potential additional filers. If all of those residents claimed EITC, we estimated that they would have qualified for about $64 million.", "If the additional EITC that could have been claimed by nonfiler residents were about $64 million, our estimate of the aggregate amount of EITC that would have been earned would have increased from about $574 million to about $638 million. This additional EITC would be sufficient to eliminate the $49 million of aggregate net federal income tax liability that we estimated would exist for the population that did file.", "Our estimates do not reflect other potential behavioral responses to the availability of the credit or the imposition of the federal income tax. For example, we were not able to estimate the number of potential EITC claimants who currently are not filing, even though they are legally obligated to file."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Puerto Rico Would Have Had to Reduce Its Own Tax to Keep the Average Combined Income Tax at Its Current Level", "paragraphs": ["For tax year 1992, Puerto Rican taxpayers reported about $1.03 billion in individual income tax. We estimated that, if current federal tax rules had been fully applied to residents of Puerto Rico and, if there were no behavioral responses to this new taxation, then the aggregate federal income tax liability of Puerto Rican taxpayers in 1992 would have been about $49 million. If the Government of Puerto Rico had wanted to keep the amount of combined federal and commonwealth individual income tax the same as it was without the imposition of full federal income tax, then it would have had to reduce the aggregate liability imposed by its own individual income tax by about 5 percent. If we allowed for the potential expansion of the filing population in response to the availability of EITC (to include residents who had no withholding), then the estimated aggregate federal income tax liability would have been essentially eliminated. In that case, the Government of Puerto Rico would not have to change its own income tax to keep the aggregate combined income tax constant. There are, however, other reasons why the Government of Puerto Rico may have adjusted its own income tax under these circumstances.", "In comments on a draft of this report, the Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico stated that his government would adjust the island\u2019s fiscal system to provide relief to taxpayers who would have positive federal income tax liabilities if the federal income tax were fully extended to residents of Puerto Rico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Average Combined Individual Income Tax in Puerto Rico Was Low Relative to That in the 50 States", "paragraphs": ["There are several ways to compare individual income tax across jurisdictions. A comparison of per-capita tax shows how much, in dollars, the average resident in each jurisdiction bears. Personal income provides a better indication of a jurisdiction\u2019s tax capacity than does population because a person\u2019s ability to pay taxes rises as his or her income rises. A comparison of taxes paid as a percentage of total state or commonwealth personal income shows, approximately, the relative extent to which each jurisdiction draws upon its residents\u2019 ability to pay. When comparing individual income taxes paid, however, it is important to recognize that some jurisdictions may have relatively low individual income taxes because they rely more heavily on other revenue sources. It is also important to note that comparisons of average taxes paid across jurisdictions do not show the comparative taxes paid by specific classes of taxpayers in each jurisdiction.", "In per-capita terms, Puerto Rico\u2019s individual income tax is relatively low. In 1992, the per-capita tax burden of Puerto Rico\u2019s individual income tax was about $341. The state and local income taxes in 33 states, and the District of Columbia, were higher per capita. Moreover, since residents of Puerto Rico currently pay a relatively small amount of federal income tax, the combined federal and Commonwealth per-capita income taxes in Puerto Rico are lower than those in any of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. If residents of Puerto Rico had been fully subject to the federal income tax in the same manner as residents of the 50 states were, we estimate that the per-capita federal income tax in Puerto Rico would have been about $14 in 1992. In this case, if the Government of Puerto Rico did not adjust its own income tax in response to the imposition of the federal tax, the combined federal and Commonwealth income tax in Puerto Rico would have been about $355 per capita. This amount is about a third of the per-capita combined federal, state, and local income taxes in Mississippi, which has the lowest per-capita income taxes of any state. (See app. IV.)", "One reason why Puerto Rico\u2019s per-capita income tax is relatively low is that per-capita personal income in Puerto Rico is significantly lower than that in any of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 1992, Puerto Rico\u2019s per-capita personal income was $6,428, compared to $14,083 in Mississippi, the state with the lowest per-capita personal income.", "Puerto Rico\u2019s individual income tax collections amounted to 5.3 percent of the Commonwealth\u2019s personal income in 1992. This percentage is higher than that of the state and local income tax collections in any of the states and the District of Columbia. New York state, where state and local income taxes amounted to 4.2 percent of state personal income, ranked closest to Puerto Rico. (See app. IV).", "One reason why Puerto Rico\u2019s income tax as a percentage of personal income is high, relative to those of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, is because Puerto Rico relies more heavily on income taxes as a source of revenue than do most of those other jurisdictions. In 1992, only two states, Maryland and Massachusetts, relied more heavily on their state and local individual income taxes than Puerto Rico did. Puerto Rico\u2019s reliance on its corporate income tax was also much higher than that of any state or the District of Columbia. Puerto Rico does not levy a general sales tax and received only 5.8 percent of its general revenues from property taxes. In contrast, in the vast majority of states, general sales taxes and property taxes account for at least 25 percent of general revenues. (See app. IV).", "Despite Puerto Rico\u2019s heavy reliance on its individual income tax, the combined federal, state, and local individual income taxes, as a percentage of personal income, were significantly lower in Puerto Rico than in any of the states or the District of Columbia because residents of Puerto Rico paid little federal income tax. If residents of Puerto Rico had been fully subject to the federal income tax in 1992, and Puerto Rico did not alter its own income tax, we estimate that the combined income taxes would have amounted to about 5.5 percent of Commonwealth personal income. Combined income taxes in Mississippi amounted to 8.2 percent of state personal income in 1992. In no other state or the District of Columbia did combined income taxes amounted to less than 9 percent of personal income. (See app. IV).", "Although the combined average income tax rates paid by residents of Puerto Rico would not have changed substantially, unless the Government of Puerto Rico adjusted its own income tax rate schedule, higher income residents of Puerto Rico would face substantial increases in their combined marginal income tax rates if they were fully subject to the federal income tax. These individuals would face much higher combined marginal income tax rates than similar individuals residing in any of the 50 states or the District of Columbia face. Under Puerto Rico\u2019s current income tax law, marginal tax rates can reach as high as 38 percent over certain ranges of income. Rates for single taxpayers and married taxpayers filing joint returns in Puerto Rico reach 31 percent when taxable income is as little as $30,001. Rates for married taxpayers filing separately reach 31 percent when taxable income is as little as $15,001. In contrast, as of 1994, in no state or the District of Columbia did state and local marginal tax rates exceed 12 percent for any taxpayers at any income level. With the full imposition of the federal income tax, some residents of Puerto Rico could face combined marginal income tax rates of over 70 percent, unless the Government of Puerto Rico adjusted its own tax."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue Estimates for the Elimination or Phase-Out of the Possessions Tax Credit", "paragraphs": ["Neither the Joint Committee on Taxation nor the U.S. Department of the Treasury has made public any recent estimates of the amount of revenue that would be saved if the possessions tax credit were eliminated immediately. The last publicly available revenue estimate that the Joint Committee made for an immediate repeal of the possessions tax credit, without any phase out, was in February 1993. At that time, it estimated that the repeal of the credit would increase revenues by $4.1 billion in 1996. That estimate did not reflect the significant limitations that the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993 subsequently placed on the use of the credit. Since the 1993 changes reduced the benefits provided by the credit, the February 1993 estimate was higher than it would have been if the Joint Committee had known about the changes. The U.S. Department of the Treasury also has not publicly released a revenue estimate for the immediate repeal of the credit since the OBRA 1993 changes.", "The Seven-Year Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 (H.R. 2491) would have repealed the possessions tax credit after December 31, 1995, had it not been vetoed by the President. The act contained a grandfather rule that would have gradually phased out the credit for existing credit claimants over a period of up to 10 years. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that this phasing out of the credit would save the Treasury $255 million in 1996 and a total of $2.5 billion from 1996 through 2000. This revenue estimate is relevant only to the very specific phase-out rules contained in the act. Other phase-out schemes could have much different revenue consequences.", "The Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department have made \u201ctax expenditure\u201d estimates for the possessions tax credit as recently as September 1995 and March 1996, respectively. The latest Joint Committee estimates indicated that the tax expenditure would be $3.4 billion in 1996, growing to $4.4 billion by 2000. The Treasury Department estimated that the tax expenditure would be $2.8 billion in 1996, rising to $3.4 billion by 2000. The Joint Committee and Treasury both use a different approach for making tax expenditure estimates for specific tax preferences than they use for estimating the revenue gains that would occur if those preferences were eliminated. A revenue gain estimate reflects expected behavioral changes on the part of taxpayers in response to the elimination of a particular preference; a tax expenditure estimate, which represents the amount of tax benefit that taxpayers would receive if the preference were not repealed, does not reflect any behavioral changes.", "If a tax credit were eliminated, taxpayers would be likely to seek ways to avoid paying the full amount of tax that the credit had previously offset. For example, if the possessions tax credit were repealed, U.S. corporations might shift some of their investment out of Puerto Rico to operations in foreign countries, where some of the income might not be immediately subject to U.S. taxation. Due to the differences in behavioral assumptions, if either the Joint Committee or Treasury were to make both a tax expenditure estimate for a tax credit and a revenue gain estimate for the elimination of the credit, using the same set of economic forecasts and the same data, the revenue gain estimate could very well be smaller than the tax expenditure estimate. On the other hand, imprecisions in other assumptions and in the economic forecasts that the Joint Committee or Treasury uses could cause both the tax expenditure estimate and the revenue gain estimate to either overstate or understate the true amount of revenue that would flow into the treasury if the credit were eliminated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To calculate an estimate of the amount of personal income taxes the United States would collect from residents of Puerto Rico and to analyze issues related to EITC, we obtained individual income tax data from the Government of Puerto Rico.

On the basis of the tax law summary table in appendix II and the data provided by the Commonwealth, we prepared a computer program to estimate the federal income tax that would have been paid if each Puerto Rican 1992 individual filer had filed a U.S. individual tax return according to U.S. tax rules that had been adopted as of December 31, 1995. With one exception, we used U.S. tax rules that were effective for tax year 1995. The one exception was that we used the rules governing EITC that became fully phased in for tax year 1996.", "We did not attempt to predict how taxpayers would respond to the new incentives and disincentives they would face under U.S. tax law. Behavioral responses of corporate taxpayers to the elimination of the possessions tax credit would be of particular importance to the aggregate amount of income earned in Puerto Rico. According to officials from the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico, corporations covered by the credit directly employed about 109,000 Puerto Rican residents in 1995. As we concluded in our earlier report on the possessions tax credit, reliable estimates of the impact that the elimination of the credit would have on Puerto Rico\u2019s economy cannot be made.", "A second important limitation of our estimate of federal individual income tax liabilities results from deficiencies of the data available for our estimate. The Puerto Rican tax returns do not contain all of the information that we would need to accurately simulate certain aspects of the federal tax code. For example, under Puerto Rico tax rules, interest from U.S. federal securities is exempt from taxation. No information about this type of interest is reported on the return, and accordingly, we do not have the data to estimate its effect on a possible U.S. tax liability.", "To compare the combined income tax burden of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to the combined income tax burden of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, we analyzed federal, state, and local individual income taxes in per-capita terms and as a percentage of personal income using published data from the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and IRS statistics of income.

First, officials from both the U.S. and Puerto Rican Departments of the Treasury pointed out that we did not address the distributional effects that a full imposition of the federal income tax would have in Puerto Rico. An official from the U.S. Treasury noted that the combined marginal income tax rates of higher income individuals in Puerto Rico would be significantly higher than the combined marginal rates on similar individuals in any of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. He suggested that the Government of Puerto Rico would be compelled to modify its own tax system to avoid these extremely high rates. The Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico noted that his government would have to make significant adjustments to the island\u2019s fiscal system to provide relief for those who would have positive federal income tax liabilities. IRS\u2019 Associate Chief Counsel noted that U.S. persons who currently pay Puerto Rican income tax as well as federal income tax, such as U.S. military personnel stationed on the island, can claim a foreign tax credit against their federal income tax liability. If the Puerto Rican income tax were to be treated as a state income tax, these individuals would only be allowed to claim a deduction for that tax, not a credit. As a result, their U.S. income tax liabilities could increase significantly if Puerto Rico did not adjust its income tax.", "We agree that the full imposition of the federal income tax could have significant impacts on specific groups of taxpayers in Puerto Rico, even though the impact on aggregate federal revenue might be negligible. However, the data and our estimating methodology did not support a detailed distributional analysis. We did not mention possible policy responses by the Government of Puerto Rico because that was beyond the scope of this study. In the section of our report that compares the combined individual income taxes in Puerto Rico with those in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, we have added a comparison of the marginal tax rates for Puerto Rico\u2019s income tax with the marginal income tax rates for other U.S. jurisdictions. The top marginal income tax rate in Puerto Rico is significantly higher than the rates in the other jurisdictions.", "Officials from both the U.S. and Puerto Rican Treasuries were concerned about our discussion of local corporations operating in Puerto Rico that are not covered by the possessions tax credit. The officials felt that we improperly implied that the amount of income tax revenue that the Government of Puerto Rico currently collects from these corporations indicates roughly the amount of revenue that the federal government might collect if the corporations were subject to the full federal income tax. We tried to make clear in our draft that there are differences between Puerto Rico\u2019s corporate income tax and the federal corporate income tax and that potential federal revenues could be greater or less than the amount that the Government of Puerto Rico currently collects. In response to the comments, we moved some of the discussion of differences between the two corporate income taxes forward from an appendix to the body of the letter.", "Finally, the Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico noted that our report does not address all of the consequences that are likely to follow from a major change in the fiscal relations between Puerto Rico and the federal government.

We did our own consistency checks and, with the assistance of the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico, corrected the significant errors we detected. Some inconsistencies remain in the data, but we determined that the data is adequate to provide general information about the magnitude of the potential revenue effect of extending full federal income taxation to the residents of Puerto Rico.", "To estimate the total U.S. federal income tax related to extending the federal income tax to Puerto Rico, we documented the elements that made up Puerto Rico\u2019s taxable income, deductions, exemptions, and credits and compared them to the U.S. federal income tax. To aid that process, we have prepared a summary table tracing each line item from the U.S. 1040 return and schedule of itemized deductions to a comparable item in the 1992 Puerto Rican individual income tax return. On the basis of the tax law summary table in appendix II and the data provided by the Commonwealth, we prepared a computer program to estimate the federal income tax that would have been paid if (1) each Puerto Rican 1992 individual filer had filed a U.S. individual tax return according to U.S. tax rules that had been adopted as of the end of 1995 and (2) his or her filing behavior had not changed as a result of the imposition of U.S. income taxes. U.S. tax law was used to determine U.S. tax treatment of Puerto Rican tax return income, exemption, and deduction items. We assumed that the taxpayers took advantage of any U.S. credits or deductions that were not available under Puerto Rico law, if we had sufficient data to presume their eligibility for those credits and deductions.", "The estimate of U.S. federal tax liabilities that we produced in this manner differs in several important ways from an estimate of the amount of revenue that the United States would actually receive if the federal income tax were actually imposed on Puerto Rico residents for tax year 1995. We have not attempted to estimate how the extension of individual and corporate income taxes or any federal aid programs would affect the pretax incomes of Puerto Rican taxpayers.", "Another important limitation of our estimate results from deficiencies of the data available for our estimate. The Puerto Rican tax returns do not contain all of the information that we would need to accurately simulate certain aspects of the federal tax code. For example, under Puerto Rico\u2019s tax rules, interest from federal securities is exempt from taxation. Also, for example, unemployment compensation is not included in Puerto Rico\u2019s definition of gross income, whereas it is in U.S. tax law. Information about this interest and unemployment compensation is not reported on the return, and accordingly, we did not have the data to estimate its effect on a possible U.S. tax liability. The analysis in appendix II describes the extent to which we could or could not estimate amounts for each line item on the federal tax return from data on Puerto Rican returns.", "Finally, a study of compliance with Puerto Rico\u2019s income tax prepared for the Puerto Rico Treasury revealed that noncompliance with Puerto Rico income tax laws is significantly more extensive than noncompliance with federal income tax laws. This study indicated that the total income gap (the amount of adjusted gross income (AGI) that went unreported) in 1991 for Puerto Rico was about $3.71 billion, or 26 percent of total income, while for the United States the income gap was about $447.1 billion, or 12 percent. Our estimates reflect the compliance behavior of Puerto Rican taxpayers in 1992. They do not take into account any change in compliance rates in Puerto Rico that have occurred since 1992 or that might occur if full federal income taxation were imposed. Since the completion of that study, the Department of the Treasury of Puerto Rico has implemented new compliance initiatives that, according to Puerto Rico Treasury officials, have increased the number of individual income tax returns filed from 651,201 in 1992 to 720,000 in 1994 and increased their collections of all taxes by about $430 million in fiscal years 1994 and 1995."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EITC Estimate", "paragraphs": ["EITC is a major feature of the U.S. income tax system that would significantly affect estimates of federal tax revenues obtained from Puerto Rico if the federal income tax were extended to Puerto Rico. EITC is a refundable credit that is awarded to tax filers who meet certain earned income requirements and have qualified children residing in their households. A smaller credit is awarded tax filers who have earned incomes but no qualifying children\u2014the so-called \u201cchildless\u201d credit. Qualification requirements for the credit are discussed in table II.2. Because the credit is targeted to tax filers with relatively low earned incomes, a tax filing population with a high proportion of low-income earners, such as Puerto Rico\u2019s, would be entitled to a substantial amount of EITC in the aggregate.", "Our EITC simulation methodology relied on available information contained in Puerto Rican tax returns for 1992 to estimate proxies for earned income, unearned income, AGI, and qualifying children, as defined under federal tax law. We restated all dollar values, such as income thresholds and maximum credits, contained in the EITC computation rules as 1992 dollars. We then applied the restated rules to the estimated proxies in order to compute an EITC for each Puerto Rican taxfiler in 1992 that met the necessary conditions.", "A limitation of the simulation described above, apart from the necessity to approximate the value of certain tax elements, is the risk of significantly undercounting the potential EITC-qualified population of tax filers. The 1992 Puerto Rican tax filing population may omit potential filers either because their incomes fell below the filing threshold for the Puerto Rico income tax or because they evaded their filing obligations in 1992.Because the number of these potential filers may be substantial at the lower earned income levels, and thus cause our simulated estimate of EITC to be understated, we examined Census data in an attempt to estimate the number of nonfilers that would file if EITC were available.", "The decennial 1990 Census of Puerto Rico contains information on the incomes and family composition of households during the sample period 1989. From the family relationships contained on the Census file we constructed a data file of simulated tax filers, e.g., single, head-of-household, and married joint returns. Information about the age and incomes of nonfiling family members was used to estimate the number of EITC-qualified children. Income elements, although not complete for computing taxable incomes, seemed reasonably adequate for estimating approximations of AGI and earned income.", "From the simulated tax filing data set, we estimated the number of potential filers who would qualify for EITC by AGI classes. These counts of potential filers were compared to the count of simulated EITC filers obtained from the 1992 Puerto Rican tax return file. As expected, the number of potential filers in the Census data set in low-AGI groups, roughly those AGIs below tax filing thresholds, exceeded the number from the tax file data set. Many of the simulated filers from the Census data set, in these income groups, could be agricultural workers or domestic service workers who are exempt from tax withholding and thus need not file tax returns. However, in the higher AGI classes, the number of simulated EITC tax filers from the Census data set was lower than the number of simulated EITC filers from the 1992 tax return data set. This result is not plausible because the number of potential EITC recipients in the full Puerto Rican population cannot be lower than the number of potential recipients in the tax filing population.", "We have more confidence in our simulations based on the tax return data than those based on the Census data. The translation of Puerto Rican filing units into federal filing units is relatively straightforward from the tax data, although there is considerable uncertainty as to how households in the Census database should be translated into filing units. In addition, income amounts reported on the Census survey may differ from the amounts that the same individuals would report for tax purposes. For these reasons we concluded that we could not use the Census data to estimate the total number of nonfilers who might claim EITC if it became available to them.However, as explained in the letter, we did make an upper-bound estimate for the amount of EITC that might be claimed by taxpayers who had legitimate reasons for not filing tax returns in 1992.", "Potential noncompliance with the EITC provisions and behavioral responses to the availability of the credit could result in a larger aggregate amount of EITC being earned than we have estimated. A previous GAO report and studies by IRS have raised concerns regarding the vulnerability of EITC to noncompliance including fraud. Also, the introduction of the earned income credit could induce some welfare recipients to forego welfare and obtain employment in order to claim the tax credit. We did not adjust our estimate for these factors because there was insufficient information available to quantify their effect on EITC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Estimate", "paragraphs": ["Differences between U.S. and Puerto Rican tax rules relating to child and dependent care expenses made it impossible for us to estimate the amount of federal child and dependent care tax credit (DCTC) that each taxpayer in our Puerto Rico database would earn. The federal credit, which is nonrefundable, is equal to a percentage of the expenses that a taxpayer pays for child or dependent care in order to be able to obtain gainful employment. The maximum credit for taxpayers with AGIs of $10,000 or less is $1,440 for two or more dependents, and $720 for one dependent. The maximum credit for taxpayers with AGIs over $28,000 is $960 for two or more dependents, and $480 for one dependent. Puerto Rico allows an itemized deduction for child-care expenses but not for expenses to care for other dependents. The maximum deduction is $800 for two or more children, and $400 for one child. A large majority of Puerto Rican taxpayers do not itemize, so we were unable to determine whether they had any expenses for child care.", "In the absence of complete information on the child and dependent care expenses of Puerto Rican taxpayers, we had to rely upon the experience of U.S. taxpayers as a basis for estimating the aggregate amount of federal DCTC that Puerto Rican taxpayers might claim. Using a sample of individual tax returns compiled by IRS for tax year 1991, the latest data available, we classified U.S. returns by nine AGI categories and by the number of children claimed as qualifying for the DCTC. We classified Puerto Rican returns according to estimated U.S. AGI and the number of children claimed as dependents. We computed an average credit amount per U.S. return for each class of return. We assumed that the average credit per Puerto Rican return in a given class would be the same as the average credit for the comparable class of U.S. returns Thus, we multiplied the number of Puerto Rican returns in each class by the appropriate U.S. average credit to obtain the amount of credit earned by each class of Puerto Rican returns. We obtained our overall estimate of about $15 million by summing the estimates for the individual classes.", "We were unable to allocate the aggregate amount of DCTC across individual taxpayers.

Our conversion is based on 1992 Puerto Rican income tax rules because that was the latest year for which return information necessary for our simulation was available on computer tape. Since 1992, the Puerto Rican tax system has been changed. In October 1994, Puerto Rico enacted tax reform legislation that according to the government of Puerto Rico, was intended to achieve several objectives. These objectives include (1) establishing a more equitable tax structure, (2) encouraging equal and consistent application of tax laws, and (3) simplifying the tax structure. Generally, the 1994 tax reform lowered individual tax rates and corporate tax rates. Effective for tax years commencing after June 30, 1995, the act lowered all statutory individual income tax rates and increased the level of taxable income subject to the maximum tax rate, from $30,000 to $50,000 for married filing jointly. Tax rates were lowered from 1 to 7 percentage points, depending on the tax bracket and filing status of the taxpayer.
