For example, VA outpatient clinics are not allowed to use available resources to provide services to many veterans because (1) the services, such as prosthetics, are not covered under a particular veteran\u2019s health care benefits and (2) the clinics are not permitted under the law to sell noncovered services to veterans.", "In administering the veterans\u2019 health benefits program authorized under title 38 of the U.S. Code, some of VA\u2019s responsibilities are similar to those of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in administering Medicare benefits and to those of private insurance companies in administering health insurance policies. For example, VA is responsible for determining under the statute (1) which benefits veterans are eligible to receive, (2) whether and how much veterans must contribute toward the cost of their care, and (3) where veterans can obtain covered services (in other words, whether they must use VA-operated facilities or can obtain needed services from other providers at VA expense). Similarly, VA, like HCFA and private insurers, is responsible for ensuring that the health benefits provided to its beneficiaries\u2014veterans\u2014are (1) medically necessary and (2) provided in the most appropriate care setting (such as a hospital, nursing home, or outpatient clinic).", "In operating a health care delivery program, VA\u2019s role is similar to that of the major private sector health care delivery networks such as those operated by Columbia/HCA and Kaiser Permanente. For example, VA strives to ensure that its facilities (1) provide high quality care, (2) are used to optimum capacity, (3) are located where they are accessible to their target population, (4) provide good customer service, (5) offer potential patients services and amenities comparable to competing facilities, and (6) operate effective billing and collection systems.", "For fiscal year 1996, VA received an appropriation of about $16.6 billion to maintain and operate its facilities, which are expected to provide inpatient hospital care to 930,000 patients, nursing home care to 35,000 patients, and domiciliary care to 18,700 patients. In addition, VA outpatient clinics are expected to handle 25.3 million outpatient visits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility for Veterans\u2019 Health Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Any person who served on active duty in the uniformed services for the minimum amount of time specified by law and who was discharged, released, or retired under other than dishonorable conditions is eligible for some VA health care benefits. The amount of required active duty service varies depending on when the person entered the military, and an eligible veteran\u2019s health care benefits depend on factors such as the presence and extent of a service-connected disability, income, and period or conditions of military service.", "Persons enlisting in one of the armed forces after September 7, 1980, and officers commissioned after October 16, 1981, must have completed 2 years of active duty or the full period of their initial service obligation to be eligible for benefits. Veterans discharged at any time because of service-connected disabilities and those discharged because of personal hardship near the end of their service obligation are not held to this requirement. Also eligible are members of the armed forces\u2019 reserve components who were called to active duty and served the length of time for which they were activated.", "Although all veterans meeting the basic requirements are \u201celigible\u201d for hospital, nursing home, and at least some outpatient care, the VA law establishes a complex priority system\u2014based on such factors as the presence and extent of any service-connected disability, the incomes of veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities, and the type and purpose of care needed\u2014to determine which services are covered and which veterans receive care within available resources.", "Generally, veterans can obtain health services only in VA-operated health care facilities. There are three primary exceptions: \u2022 VA-operated nursing home and domiciliary care is augmented by contracts with community nursing homes and by per diem payments for veterans in state-operated veterans\u2019 homes. \u2022 VA pays private sector physicians and other health care providers to extend care to certain veterans when the services needed are unavailable within the VA system or when the veterans live too far from a VA facility (commonly referred to as fee-basis care). VA has limited the use of fee-basis physicians primarily to veterans with service-connected disabilities. \u2022 Veterans can obtain emergency hospitalization from any hospital and then be transferred to a VA hospital when their conditions stabilize.", "In addition, veterans being treated in VA facilities can be provided specific scarce medical resources from other public and private providers through sharing agreements and contracts between VA and non-VA providers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hospital and Nursing Home Care", "paragraphs": ["All veterans\u2019 health care benefits include medically necessary hospital and nursing home care, but certain veterans, referred to as Category A, or mandatory care category, veterans, have the highest priority for receiving care.

Only veterans who have service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or more (about 465,000 veterans) are in the mandatory care category for comprehensive outpatient care. VA may provide comprehensive outpatient care to veterans who (1) are former prisoners of war, (2) served during the Mexican Border Period or World War I, or (3) are housebound or in need of aid and attendance. In other words, all medically necessary outpatient care is covered for these groups of veterans, subject to the availability of space and resources.", "All veterans with service-connected disabilities are in the mandatory care category for treatment related to their disabilities. Veterans seeking outpatient services needed to treat medical conditions related to injuries suffered as a result of VA hospitalization or while participating in a VA rehabilitation program are also in the mandatory care category for such services.

In addition, VA can sell health care services in only a few situations. Specifically, statutes authorize VA hospitals and outpatient clinics to enter into agreements to sell \u2022 health care services to Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal \u2022 specialized medical resources to federal and nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and medical schools.", "VA cannot, however, sell health care services directly to veterans or others.", "To allow VA\u2019s resources to be more effectively used and avoid unnecessary duplication and overlap of activities, VA has been authorized for over 60 years to sell or share its resources with other federal agencies. For example, all VA medical centers within 50 miles of a DOD hospital currently have sharing agreements to provide one or more services to DOD beneficiaries. In 1989, the Congress enacted legislation specifically authorizing the use of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) funds to reimburse VA for care provided to CHAMPUS beneficiaries under sharing agreements. As of April 1996, three VA medical centers were providing services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Finally, in June 1995, VA and DOD completed work on an agreement that will allow VA facilities to compete with private sector facilities to serve as providers under DOD\u2019s new TRICARE program.", "Since 1966, VA facilities have also had limited authority to share health care resources with federal and nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and medical schools. This authority, however, is limited to sharing of \u201cspecialized medical resources,\u201d medical techniques, and education. Such resources include equipment, space, or personnel, which, because of their cost, limited availability, or unusual nature, are either unique in the medical community or can be fully used only through mutual use. VA facilities cannot provide routine patient care services to veterans\u2019 dependents or other nonveterans, even if they have the capacity to do so and the patients are willing to pay for the services.", "Similarly, VA facilities cannot sell noncovered services to veterans. This restriction primarily affects outpatient care because hospital care is a covered service for all veterans.

Specifically, it discusses the evolution of the VA health care system and VA eligibility; the problems that VA\u2019s current eligibility and health care contracting provisions create for veterans and providers; the extent to which VA provides veterans with health care services for which they are not eligible; legislative proposals to reform VA eligibility and contracting rules and their potential effect on the ease of administration, equity to veterans, costs to VA, and clarity of eligibility for veterans\u2019 health benefits; and \u2022 approaches that could be used to limit the budgetary effects of eligibility reforms.", "In addressing these objectives, we relied primarily on the results of reviews that we conducted over the last 5 years that detailed problems in administering VA\u2019s outpatient eligibility provisions, compared VA benefits and eligibility with those of other public and private health benefits programs and with the veterans\u2019 health benefits programs in other countries, and assessed VA\u2019s role in a changing health care marketplace.

About 90 percent of veterans now have public or private health insurance or both in addition to their VA health care benefits.

If, however, a decision is made that certain veterans should be given more extensive benefits than others, then such distinctions will continue to be used to define the differences in benefits. For example, certain categories of veterans might be eligible for a broader range of services or lower cost sharing. The question then would become whether to keep the same distinctions as in the current law or base the distinctions on other factors.", "In three other countries that operated direct delivery systems for veterans (United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada), declining use of veterans\u2019 hospitals prompted actions to open them to nonveterans.

Should our veterans\u2019 health care system similarly be opened to nonveterans? Among the options that could be considered would be extending veterans\u2019 benefits to more dependents.

The original formula could show either a decrease or increase in costs depending on the assumptions made.", "VA did not include a key portion of the original formula\u2014a 10-percent increase in the costs of treating those patients remaining in VA hospitals after eligibility reform\u2014in its calculations and, therefore, reported that its analysis showed that eligibility reform would result in savings of about $268 million. Including that portion of the formula in the calculation results in the claimed savings becoming a cost increase of $51 million.", "VA subsequently revised its formula to delete the adjustment for the costs of treating those patients remaining in the hospital. As a result of this change, whatever assumptions are made about the percentage of care shifted and the average days of hospital care avoided, the formula will result in net savings. Even under the assumption that no inpatients are transferred to outpatient care, the formula shows that expanding eligibility would result in savings of about $39 million. What appeared on the surface to be a formula taking many factors into account is, in its current form, actually a simple calculation\u2014eligibility reform will save 30 percent of the costs of inpatient care shifted to outpatient settings plus 10 percent of the total costs of fee-basis and travel reimbursements. The formula includes no adjustments for increased demand for outpatient care by veterans other than those shifted from inpatient to outpatient care.", "VA\u2019s revised formula for estimating the cost effects of eligibility reform is also independent of the provisions of eligibility reform.

Although the studies VA cites as supporting its assumption that 20 percent of admissions could be shifted to outpatient care addressed only acute medical and surgical admissions, VA applied the 20-percent reduction to all inpatient care, including intermediate care and both acute and long-term psychiatric admissions. Such admissions account for over 25 percent of VA admissions. Applying the 20-percent reduction only to acute medical and surgical admissions would reduce projected savings. To maintain the total number of shifted admissions, VA would have to assume that more than 27 percent of acute medical and surgical admissions would be shifted under eligibility reform.", "VA assumed a 10-percent savings in fee-basis costs.

As of April 1996, VA operated 12 access points on a pilot basis, and it is too early to tell whether they will affect fee-basis costs. Moreover, because access points are attracting new users, they may increase rather than decrease VA\u2019s fee-basis costs. VA provides no other basis for estimating that eligibility reform will reduce fee-basis costs.", "VA assumes that travel reimbursements will decline by 10 percent as a result of eligibility reform. VA indicates that travel reimbursements will decline because of the creation of access points. While travel reimbursements might decline for those veterans living near an access point, any such reduction would not result from eligibility reform. Under VA\u2019s assumption that veterans shifted from hospital care to outpatient care will receive an average of 17 additional outpatient visits, beneficiary travel could significantly increase rather than decrease.

This assumption may not be sound given VA\u2019s argument that the patients it would be diverting were admitted in order to provide them routine outpatient care.

In fiscal year 1994, about 37 percent of VA medical and surgical patients had 1- to 3-day stays.

First, current VA users are likely to seek previously noncovered services, such as preventative health care. Second, veterans who previously had not used VA because of its eligibility restrictions might begin using VA, particularly for those services not covered under their public or private health insurance. Third, some care might be shifted from inpatient to outpatient settings as patients admitted to circumvent eligibility restrictions are treated on an outpatient basis.", "VA\u2019s 1992 Eligibility Reform Task Force conducted the most comprehensive study of the potential effects of eligibility reform, but it was not based on any of the current proposals. The current VA evaluation assesses only one of three ways eligibility reforms are likely to increase demand for outpatient care and is based on questionable assumptions.", "Among the issues that could be considered in future analyses are the following: Increased demand could be lower than anticipated if VA facilities are currently circumventing the eligibility restrictions and providing noncovered services. As discussed in chapter 4, studies by VA\u2019s OIG found that VA outpatient clinics are providing significant numbers of noncovered services. This suggests that at least some current VA users may already receive comprehensive health care services from VA and, therefore, their use of VA services might not significantly increase under eligibility reforms that essentially make legal what is already happening in practice. \u2022 Expanded outpatient eligibility could result in a corresponding increase in demand for hospital care. After removing 1- and 2-day hospital stays (assumed to be shifted to outpatient care), VA\u2019s 1992 eligibility reform task force estimated that demand for inpatient care could nearly triple from 987,000 to about 2.8 million patients treated. \u2022 Eligibility reform that would authorize direct admission of veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities to contract community nursing homes could increase demand. As VA moves patients from costly inpatient care to less intensive settings, demand for nursing home care is likely to increase. The increased demand for nursing home care could, however, be offset to some degree by greater use of home care and residential care for patients requiring less intensive treatment. \u2022 Concurrent changes to make VA health care services more accessible to veterans could increase the potential effect of eligibility reform on outpatient, and, indirectly, on inpatient workload. As it strives to make the transition from a hospital-based system to an ambulatory-care-based system, VA is attempting to bring ambulatory care closer to veterans\u2019 homes. Because distance is one of the primary factors affecting veterans\u2019 use of VA health care, actions to give veterans access to outpatient care closer to their homes, either through expansion of VA-operated clinics or through contracts with community providers, will likely increase demand for services even without eligibility reform. \u2022 Giving VA broader authority to contract for health care services with private hospitals and providers might give veterans greater freedom to choose health care providers closer to their homes. If this happens, then increased demand for VA-supported health care is likely with or without eligibility reform.", "In addition to further assessing the potential effects of eligibility and other reforms on demand for outpatient care, further assessments appear warranted to determine how reforms would affect the availability of specialized services. Provisions in the major VA eligibility reform proposals could have both positive and negative effects on VA\u2019s specialized services. Reforms that increase VA\u2019s efficiency could free resources that could be reprogrammed to increase specialty services.

For fiscal year 1998, H.R. 3118 would limit the increase in budget authority to $1.7 billion over the administration\u2019s budget plan and $1.1 billion over the House budget resolution.", "The final House bill also contains provisions requiring VA to assess the effects of the bill on demand for VA health care. For example, VA would be required to include in a report to the Veterans\u2019 Affairs committees detailed information on the numbers of and costs of providing care to veterans who had not received care from VA within the preceding 3 fiscal years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The VA health care system was neither designed nor intended to be the primary source of health care services for most veterans. It was initially established to meet the special care needs of veterans injured during wartime and those wartime veterans permanently incapacitated and incapable of earning a living. Although the system has evolved since that time, even today it focuses on meeting the comprehensive health care needs of only about 465,000 of the nation\u2019s 26.4 million veterans. In other words, its primary mission is to meet the comprehensive health care needs of veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or more. For other veterans, the system is primarily intended to provide treatment for their service-connected disabilities and to serve as a safety net to provide health care to veterans with limited access to health care through other public and private programs.", "Because 9 out of 10 veterans now have other public or private health insurance that meets their basic health care needs, relatively few veterans today need to rely on VA as a safety net. Rather, most of them turn to private sector providers for all or most of their care, using VA either not at all or to supplement their use of private sector health care.", "Reforms of VA eligibility that would significantly expand veterans\u2019 eligibility for comprehensive care in VA facilities would significantly alter VA\u2019s health care mission and place VA in more direct competition with the private sector. To the extent veterans are given expanded benefits that are either free or have lower cost sharing than other public and private health insurance, the VA system will gain a competitive price advantage over its private sector competitors. Coupling eligibility reform with other changes, such as improved accessibility and customer service, could heighten the increased demand for VA services. Because most veterans currently use private sector providers, any increased demand generated by eligibility expansions would come largely at the expense of those providers.", "For most veterans, VA eligibility reform might provide an additional option for health care services or additional services not covered under their public or private insurance. For those veterans who do not have public or private health insurance, however, eligibility reform is more important. It could improve their access to comprehensive health care services, including preventive health care services.", "Historically, VA\u2019s mandatory and discretionary care workload has been fully funded. The four eligibility reform bills that would retain the discretionary nature of funding of veterans\u2019 health benefits could significantly increase demand for VA health care services by expanding all veterans\u2019 benefits to include comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care services. This could result in increased VA appropriations to fully fund at least the demand generated by the 9 million to 11 million veterans added to the mandatory care category for comprehensive free outpatient services.", "However, by not fully funding VA\u2019s anticipated increase in workload, VA would be faced with developing rationing policies that would ensure the funds appropriated are directed toward those veterans with the highest priorities for care. This would likely entail turning away many of the veterans currently using VA health care. Depending on the level of funding, those turned away could include low-income uninsured veterans. The funds needed to meet the increased demand for routine health care services could also jeopardize VA\u2019s ability to provide specialized services, such as treatment of spinal cord injuries, not readily available through other providers.", "If eligibility reforms focus on strengthening VA\u2019s safety net mission while preserving its ability to provide specialized services veterans may be unable to obtain through their public and private insurance, several approaches could be pursued that would also limit the extent to which the government competes with the private sector. These approaches generally involve placing limits on the number of veterans given expanded benefits, narrowing the range of benefits added, or increasing cost sharing to offset the costs of added benefits. The American Legion proposal contains a framework for accomplishing such changes, but is unrealistic in the number of veterans who would be covered under the entitlement it would create. A significant reduction in the number of veterans covered by the entitlement would be needed if the proposal was to be budget neutral. For example, the entitlement for low-income veterans might be restricted to those who lack other public or private insurance coverage, or the income cutoff might be lowered to reduce the number of veterans covered by the new entitlement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["VA said that GAO\u2019s report, in presenting a summation of many years of discussion concerning eligibility reform issues, shows how confusing, convoluted, and difficult even debate on the issues can be. VA noted that unanimous passage of H.R. 3118 by the House of Representatives and the recent reporting of a bill by the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs support the need for change. See appendix VII for VA\u2019s comments."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
