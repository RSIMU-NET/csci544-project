We also observed pharmacy capabilities of the  DOD systems, and how those systems access VA data, at the joint VA  and DOD health center in North Chicago, Illinois, and during two system  demonstrations in Washington, D.C.", "Additionally,  we reviewed VA documentation to see how the department  was monitoring and checking prescription drug data that is exchanged  with DOD. We also evaluated whether VA systems used national  standards for the exchange and mapping of outpatient medication  information between VA and DOD. We obtained written responses from  VA to questions on interoperability  and reviewed VA reports and  documents, including a report to Congress on interoperability  standards,  to evaluate the extent of pharmacy system conformance to national  standards for the exchange of outpatient medication information between  VA and DOD.", "Further, we selected and contacted Veterans Service Organizations to  determine whether they could provide information on the impact of  interoperability  of VA and DOD systems on veterans. We selected  organizations that (1) we had identified in our prior work related to  transitioning service members, (2) represented veterans from recent  conflicts, and (3) were referred to us by VA or other Veterans Service  Organizations. This resulted in the selection of six organizations for our  review, which we determined had not reported on the impact of VA and  DOD pharmacy information technology (IT) systems interoperability on  veterans.", "Lastly, to address the third objective we took the following steps to  identify best practices of the health care industry. We conducted literature  searches, reviewed our prior work, and consulted with the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the National Coordinator for Health  Information Technology, VA\u2019s Pharmacy Benefits Management Services  and a private provider. We reviewed the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health Information Technology 2015 Edition Health  Information Technology Certification Criteria, and its 2016  Interoperability  Standards Advisory to identify the standard for electronic  prescribing. We also reviewed the Office of the National Coordinator for  Health Information Technology\u2019s report to Congress on the prescription  drug monitoring program interoperability standards. Further, we reviewed  the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act, Gartner\u2019s Update to the  Enterprise Electronic Health Record Generation Model, standards set  by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, and  publications from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,  and the Archives of Pharmacy Practice.", "From these sources, we compiled a list of practices that the health care  industry has identified as being relevant to the implementation of an  effective pharmacy IT system and that reflect areas of relevance with  regard to VA\u2019s health information system capabilities. This action resulted  in a list of six practices that relate to (1) ordering medication  electronically, (2) receiving drug order checks, (3) tracking the dispensing  of controlled prescription drugs, (4) electronically exchanging  prescriptions, (5) using clinical decision support capabilities, and (6) using  a perpetual inventory management capability to monitor medication  inventory levels.", "We confirmed the validity and relevance of the identified practices with  the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.  We also confirmed our selection of the practices through discussions with  industry leaders, and based on the views and experiences of these  sources, we characterized the practices that we assessed in the third  objective as industry practices (rather than as best practices).", "In addition, we reviewed the pharmacy system architecture and user  documents, a VA Office of Inspector General Report on Pharmacy Re- engineering, and VA\u2019s plans to implement pharmacy system capabilities  through its Pharmacy Re-engineering project and plans to modernize its  Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture  (VistA), such as the VistA 4 Roadmap. We compared the industry  practices to current VA system capabilities and modernization plans to  identify additional practices VA could implement to enhance its pharmacy  IT system to be more aligned with those of the industry.", "We supplemented our analyses with interviews of VA, DOD, and  Department of Health and Human Services officials with knowledge of  VA\u2019s pharmacy systems and the interoperability efforts within VA and  between VA and DOD. VA officials included those in the department\u2019s  Office of Information and Technology, VHA, and its Pharmacy Benefits  Management Services, and the VA National Center for Patient Safety and  Informatics Patient Safety. We also interviewed officials from the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the National  Coordinator for Health Information Technology, as well as DOD officials  from the Defense Health Agency and DOD/VA Program Coordination  Office.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to June 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Department of Veterans Affairs Pharmacy Related Applications", "paragraphs": ["To enable the provision of health care services to veterans, the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses its integrated health information  system\u2014the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology  Architecture (VistA)\u2014which was developed in-house by VA clinicians and  information technology (IT) personnel.
