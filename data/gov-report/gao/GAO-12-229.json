The act also requires that GAO report every 60 days on TARP activities. This report examines (1) the condition and status of TARP programs; (2) Treasury\u0092s management of TARP operations, including staffing for the Office of Financial Stability (OFS) and oversight of contractors and financial agents; and (3) what is known about the direct and indirect costs of TARP. To do this work, GAO analyzed audited financial data for various TARP programs; reviewed documentation such as program terms and internal decision memos; analyzed TARP cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury; and interviewed CBO and OFS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many TARP programs continue to be in various stages of unwinding and some programs, notably those that focus on the foreclosure crisis, remain active. The figure provides an overview of selected programs and the amount disbursed and outstanding, as applicable. Treasury has articulated broad principles for exiting TARP, including exiting TARP programs as soon as practicable and seeking to maximize taxpayer returns, goals that at times conflict. Some of the programs that Treasury continues to unwind, such as investments in American International Group, Inc. (AIG), require Treasury to actively manage the timing of its exit as it balances its competing goals. For other programs, such as the Capital Purchase Program (CPP)\u0097which was created to provide capital to financial institutions\u0097Treasury\u0092s exit will be driven primarily by the financial condition of the participating institutions. Consequently, the timing of Treasury\u0092s exit from TARP remains uncertain.", "Treasury continues to manage the various TARP programs using OFS staff, financial agents, and contractors. Overall OFS staffing has declined slightly for the first time as staff responsible for managing TARP investment programs and those in term-appointed leadership positions have departed. However, staff in some offices within OFS have increased\u0097for example, in the Office of Internal Review, which helps to ensure that financial agents and contractors comply with laws and regulations. Through September 30, 2011, about half of Treasury\u0092s 116 contracts remained active, along with 14 of the 17 financial agency agreements. Treasury has continued to strengthen its management and oversight of contractors and financial agents and conflict-of-interest requirements. In response to a GAO recommendation, OFS has finalized a plan to address staffing levels and expertise that includes identifying critical positions and conducting succession planning, in light of the temporary nature of its work.", "Treasury and CBO project that TARP costs will be much lower than the amount authorized when the program was initially announced. Treasury\u0092s fiscal year 2011 financial statement, audited by GAO, estimated that the lifetime cost of TARP would be about $70 billion\u0097with CPP expected to generate the most lifetime income, or net income in excess of costs. OFS also reported that from inception through September 30, 2011, the incurred cost of TARP transactions was $28 billion. Although Treasury regularly reports on the cost of TARP programs and has enhanced such reporting over time, GAO\u0092s analysis of Treasury press releases about specific programs indicate that information about estimated lifetime costs and income are included only when programs are expected to result in lifetime income. For example, Treasury issued a press release for its bank investment programs, including CPP, and noted that the programs would result in lifetime income, or profit. However, press releases for investments in AIG, a program that is anticipated to result in a lifetime cost to Treasury, did not include program-specific cost information. Although press releases for programs expected to result in a cost to Treasury provide useful transaction information, they exclude lifetime, program-specific cost estimates.", "Consistently providing greater transparency about cost information for specific TARP programs could help reduce potential misunderstanding of TARP\u0092s results.

The crisis restricted access to credit and made the  financing on which businesses and individuals depend increasingly  difficult to obtain. Further tightening of credit exacerbated a global  economic slowdown. During the crisis, Congress, the President, federal  regulators, and others undertook a number of steps to facilitate financial  intermediation by banks and the securities markets. In addition to  Treasury\u2019s efforts, policy interventions were led by the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. While the banking crisis in the  United States no longer presents the same level of systemic concerns as  it did in 2008, the economy remains vulnerable, with unemployment  higher than in the recent past.

Holding its shares longer could have  meant realizing greater gains for the taxpayer, but only if the stock  appreciated in value. By participating in GM\u2019s November 2010 IPO,  Treasury tried to fulfill both goals, selling almost half of its shares at an  early opportunity. Treasury officials stated that they strove to balance  these competing goals, but have no strict formula for doing so. Rather,  they ultimately relied on the best available information in deciding when to  start exiting this program.", "Moreover, Treasury\u2019s ability to exercise control over the timing of its exit  from TARP programs is limited in some cases. For example, Treasury will  likely decide when to exit AIG based on market conditions but Treasury  has less control over its exit from PPIP because the program\u2019s exit  depends on the timing of each public-private investment fund (PPIF)  selling its investments. Treasury continues to face this tension in its goals  with a number of TARP programs as they continue to unwind.

Much of the $17.3 billion in  outstanding investments was concentrated in a relatively small number of  institutions. The largest single outstanding investment was $3.5 billion,  and the top four outstanding investments totaled $6.8 billion. The top 25  remaining CPP investments accounted for $11.3 billion.", "The cumulative number of financial institutions that had missed at least  one scheduled dividend or interest payment by the end of the month in  which the payments were due rose from 164 as of November 30, 2010, to  226 as of November 30, 2011. Institutions can elect whether to pay  dividends and may choose not to pay for a variety of reasons, including  decisions that they or their federal and state regulators make to conserve  cash and maintain (or increase) capital levels. Institutions are required to  pay dividends only if they declare dividends, although unpaid cumulative  dividends generally accrue and the institution must pay them before  making payments to other types of shareholders, such as holders of  common stock.", "These figures differ from the number of dividend or interest payments outstanding  because some institutions made their payments after the end of the reporting month. CPP  dividend and interest payments are due on February 15, May 15, August 15, and  November 15 of each year, or the first business day subsequent to those dates.

The number of  institutions missing payments stabilized in recent quarters; however, most  of these institutions had repeatedly missed payments. In particular, 119 of  the 158 institutions that missed payments in November 2011 had also  missed payments in each of the previous three quarters. Moreover, these  158 institutions had missed an average of 4.8 additional previous  payments, and only 7 had never missed a previous payment.", "On July 19, 2011, Treasury announced that it had, for the first time,  exercised its right to elect members to the boards of directors of two of  the remaining CPP institutions. In considering whether to nominate  directors, Treasury said that it would proceed in two steps. First, after an  institution misses five dividend or interest payments, Treasury sends OFS  staff members to observe board meetings. Second, once an institution  has missed six dividend payments, Treasury decides whether to  nominate a board member based on a variety of considerations, including  what it learns from the board meetings, the institution\u2019s financial condition,  the function of its board of directors, and the size of its investment.", "The financial strength of the participating institutions will largely determine  the speed at which institutions repay their investments and exit and the  amount of total lifetime income. Institutions will have to demonstrate that  they are financially strong enough to repay the CPP investments in order  to receive regulatory approval to exit the program. The institutions\u2019  financial strength will also be a primary factor in their decisions to make  dividend payments, and institutions that continue to miss payments may  also have difficulty exiting CPP. Moreover, dividend rates will increase for  remaining institutions beginning in late 2013, up to 9 percent, which may  prompt institutions to repay their investments as that dividend increase  approaches. If broader interest rates are low, especially approaching the  dividend reset, banks could have further incentive to redeem their  preferred shares. Treasury will need to balance the goals of protecting  taxpayer-supported investments while expeditiously unwinding the  program. Treasury officials told us that Treasury\u2019s practice was generally  to hold, rather than sell, its CPP investments. As a result, Treasury\u2019s ability to exit the program largely depends on the ability of institutions to  repay their investments. However, Treasury officials noted that if  warranted, Treasury could change its practice in the future and sell its  investments. In an upcoming report, we plan to describe the financial  condition of the remaining CPP institutions and compare them with  institutions that already exited and those that never participated.", "Treasury has disbursed $570 million to its 84 CDCI participants, 28 of  which had previously participated in CPP (see fig. 5). As we previously  reported, CDCI is structured similarly to CPP in that it provides capital to  financial institutions by purchasing equity and subordinated debt from  them. No additional funds are available through the program, as CDCI\u2019s  funding authority expired in September 2010. While no CDFIs have  repaid Treasury\u2019s investment as of September 30, 2011, Treasury has  thus far received $10 million in dividend payments from CDCI  participants. Lastly, Treasury expects CDCI will cost approximately $182  million over its lifetime, almost a third of the $570 million obligated to the  program. Officials stated that CDCI has a cost, while CPP is estimated to  result in lifetime income, in part because CDCI provides a lower dividend  rate that increases the financing costs. CDCI also does not require  warrants of participating institutions, which would otherwise offset  Treasury\u2019s costs.", "As with CPP, Treasury must continue to monitor the performance of CDCI  participants because their financial strength will affect their ability to repay  Treasury and Treasury\u2019s ability to exit the program. As of September 30,  2011, 5 of the 84 CDCI participants had missed at least one dividend or  interest payment, according to Treasury. While the continuing weak  economy could negatively affect distressed communities and the CDFIs  that serve them, the program\u2019s low dividend rates may help participants  remain current on payments. When Treasury will exit CDCI is unknown  but the dividend rate that program participants pay increases in 2018,  which provides an incentive for some borrowers to repay before that rate  change occurs. As with CPP, Treasury officials indicated that while  Treasury\u2019s current practice is to hold its CDCI investments, that strategy  could change and Treasury could opt to sell its CDCI shares.", "Treasury has received more than $40 billion for its roughly $80 billion  AIFP investment, in large part from its participation in GM\u2019s IPO and its  exit from Chrysler.

To that end,  Treasury officials said that the agency had waited to proceed with its first  underwritten offering of AIG common stock until (1) it reacquainted the  investment community with AIG and (2) AIG executed and closed other  transactions, such as the March 2011 sale of MetLife equity securities  and a subsequent March transaction that reduced the preferred interests  in the AIA SPV by approximately $5.6 billion.

Treasury officials have said that they would  continue to conduct analyses using factors such as AIG\u2019s share price,  investor interest in AIG stock, and possible future restructuring.

First, because Treasury owns a significant amount of AIG stock\u2014both as  a percentage of total company stock and in absolute terms\u2014the amount  of shares the market can absorb may be limited. Second, continued price  volatility in the domestic and global insurance markets could impede  growth in these insurance markets. Third, the continued low interest rate  environment could likely lead to lower investment incomes and overall  profits for AIG, which in turn could affect Treasury\u2019s opportunities to sell  its AIG shares.

Given the decline in AIG\u2019s stock price since  January 2011 and the recent volatility in the stock market, when  Treasury\u2019s exit will be completed is unknown.

Exiting  quickly appears to be the main consideration, although Treasury officials  stated that they balanced this with promoting financial stability and  protecting the taxpayer.

Though  some Chief Investment Office staff were replaced with staff in other OFS  offices and staff that were new to Treasury, many were not replaced  because their skill sets were no longer needed given the wind-down  phase of investment programs. Conversely, staff have increased in  certain OFS offices where OFS management had identified specific  needs. For example, the number of staff in the Office of Internal Review  (OIR), which identifies risks and develops procedures for complying with  EESA, increased from June 2010 to September 2011. Treasury had been  seeking new staff with the skill set needed for this work, as we previously  reported, and officials stated that the increase reflected a need to  continue monitoring compliance among Treasury financial agents and  contractors. Treasury filled these positions in part by streamlining the  hiring process and better targeting its job announcements. Treasury  officials anticipate that staffing levels in most OFS offices will decrease  over time, though it will continue to seek talent for OIR, the Chief  Financial Office, and the TARP housing programs that remain active.", "In addition to changes in staff numbers and office composition, OFS has  had a number of its leadership team depart since 2010.

Further, it did not have a comprehensive compliance  system to monitor and fully address vendor-related conflicts of interest.  Last year we reported that OFS had put in place an appropriate  infrastructure to manage and monitor its network of financial agents and  contractors.

For example, contract administration personnel made  improvements to OFS\u2019s contract record system, including controls and  clear deadlines for validating and certifying the completeness and  accuracy of the information. According to an OFS official responsible for  contracting, contract administration personnel audited most of the items in  the record system by tracing the items back to source documents, and  found some areas that needed to be improved. Data fields that were used  for informational purposes only, such as the contract specialist\u2019s  telephone number, were not selected for audit.

In 2009, the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that TARP could cost $356  billion. However, CBO\u2019s most recent estimate, using November 2011  data, is approximately $34 billion. Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2011 financial  statement, audited by GAO, reported that TARP would cost around $70  billion as of September 30, 2011, a decrease from about $78 billion  estimated as of September 2010. In general, the variation in CBO and  Treasury cost estimates is attributable to their timing\u2014that is, market  conditions and program activities differed when the estimates were  developed. However, program participation assumptions for TARP- funded housing programs explain the large difference between the CBO  and Treasury cost estimates. Treasury assumed that all of the $45.6  billion allocated to TARP housing programs would be utilized and, as a  result, estimated that they would cost $45.6 billion. Conversely, CBO  expected lower participation rates for the housing programs, resulting in a  cost estimate of $13 billion as of November 2011. While these differences  exist, CBO officials noted that as TARP continues to wind down,  Treasury\u2019s and CBO\u2019s lifetime cost estimates should be more similar. This  convergence of cost estimates is likely to occur as program costs become  clearer and more recipients repay their assistance\u2014reducing the number  of outstanding TARP assets and the related uncertainty about how  market risks will affect the future value of these investments.", "In our review of Treasury\u2019s lifetime cost estimates for TARP\u2019s equity  investment programs, we found that the estimates for some programs  changed only slightly, if at all, between September 2010 and September  2011, while others changed by a notable margin. For example, Treasury  estimated that CPP would result in lifetime income of $11.2 billion as of  September 2010 and its recent estimate as of September 2011 was  slightly higher at $13 billion (see fig. 15). This increase in CPP\u2019s  estimated lifetime income was the result of proceeds in excess of costs  from the sale of Citigroup common stock offset by a decline in the  estimated market value of Treasury\u2019s remaining CPP investments.  Additionally, Treasury\u2019s lifetime cost estimate of $45.6 billion for TARP- funded housing programs remained unchanged between September  2010 and September 2011 because Treasury continues to assume that  all of the $45.6 billion allocated to the housing programs will be utilized.", "On the other hand, Treasury\u2019s recent cost estimates for AIFP and  assistance to AIG changed markedly when compared to estimates as of  September 2010. Specifically, Treasury estimated a lifetime cost of $14.7  billion for AIFP as of September 2010 but that estimate increased to  $23.6 billion using September 2011 data due to a decline in the value of  Treasury\u2019s equity investments in GM and Ally Financial. Additionally,  Treasury\u2019s estimate for assistance to AIG decreased from $36.9 billion to  $24.3 billion between September 2010 and September 2011 as a result of  improvements in the financial condition of AIG since Treasury first  provided assistance and the restructuring of Treasury\u2019s AIG investment to  common stock. However, as we have seen, the ultimate cost of the  assistance to AIG could be about $11.5 billion after factoring in the  estimated lifetime income of $12.8 billion from Treasury\u2019s non-TARP  assistance to AIG. As shown, lifetime cost estimates are likely to  fluctuate, particularly for investment programs like AIFP and the AIG  Investment Program, because future results rely heavily on the market  price of common stock.", "Although Treasury regularly reports on the cost of TARP and its  programs, it could improve the clarity and consistency of its  communications on TARP costs, specifically in its press releases about  specific programs. Treasury issues several reports\u2014including the Agency  Financial Report, Monthly 105(a) Reports, and Transaction Reports\u2014that  provide updates on the funds obligated and disbursed, repayments and  income, and gains and losses. Compared to Treasury\u2019s past reporting  practices, recent versions of the Agency Financial Report and the Monthly  105(a) Reports clearly present Treasury\u2019s lifetime cost estimates for  TARP and its programs. However, Treasury\u2019s press releases do not  consistently include these cost estimates. Rather, Treasury\u2019s press  releases on specific TARP programs typically only include transaction- oriented updates, such as disbursements and returns on Treasury\u2019s  investments from repayments, dividends, and the sale of its assets. While  the transaction-oriented updates in Treasury\u2019s press releases are  important, they do not provide the general public with the greater  context\u2014the lifetime cost associated with individual programs.", "Furthermore, it appears that over the last 2 years Treasury has included  lifetime cost estimates in some of its program-specific press releases for  programs expected to result in a lifetime income, while excluding these  estimates for programs expected to result in a cost for taxpayers. For  instance, a press release from April 2011 indicated that Treasury\u2019s bank  programs were expected to result in a lifetime positive return of  approximately $20 billion. Other press releases for TARP banking  programs also include this reference to expected lifetime income.  However, during the same period Treasury did not include lifetime cost  estimates in its press releases for TARP programs that projected a cost to  the government, such as SBA 7(a), AIG, and AIFP. For example,  Treasury issued a press release in June 2011 that described its sale of  several SBA 7(a) securities. Treasury stated that the sale resulted in  overall gains and income. The content of this press release implied that  the program had earned a significant amount of money but did not  provide the more comprehensive lifetime cost estimate for the program,  which was $1 million at that time. In addition, over the last 2 years none of  Treasury\u2019s press releases for AIG and AIFP (programs expected to cost  approximately $24.3 billion and $23.6 billion respectively, as of  September 30, 2011) have included the lifetime cost estimates associated  with the programs. investment in the programs and revenues received. This inconsistent  disclosure of lifetime cost estimates raises concerns about the  consistency and transparency of Treasury\u2019s press releases and suggests  a selective approach that focuses on reporting program lifetime income  and not lifetime costs.", "As noted earlier in this report, the $24.3 billion is associated with TARP-related  assistance. Factoring in income of $12.8 billion for its non-TARP shares could result in a  net estimated cost of $11.5 billion.", "As we have previously reported, transparency is important in the context  of TARP and the unprecedented government assistance it provided to the  financial sector. In discussing our questions about the press releases with  Treasury officials, they noted that they provide cost information in other  public reports. However, by improving the clarity of its communication on  the costs of TARP through consistently incorporating lifetime cost  estimates into its program press releases, Treasury could reduce  potential confusion and misunderstanding of TARP\u2019s results.

For example, as we  have previously reported, when the government provides assistance to  the private sector, it may increase moral hazard that would then need to  be mitigated. That is, in the face of government assistance, private firms  are motivated to take risks they might not take in the absence of such  assistance, or creditors may not price into their extensions of credit the  full risk assumed by the firm, believing that the government would provide  assistance should the firm become distressed.", "EESA and the amendments made by the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 established a number of measures to mitigate  the moral hazard of TARP by requiring that participating institutions follow  certain requirements. These include providing Treasury with warrants in  exchange for TARP funds to allow taxpayers to benefit from any  appreciation of the company\u2019s stock, and limiting certain bonuses and  golden parachute payments for certain highly compensated employees  and senior executive officers, as such payments can encourage  excessive risk-taking. Even with such requirements in place, however,  government intervention in the private sector can encourage market  participants to expect similar emergency actions. This belief diminishes  market discipline as it can weaken private or market-based incentives to  properly manage risks and can in particular contribute to the perception  that some firms are \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d", "Government interventions can also have consequences for the banking  industry as a whole, including institutions that do not receive bailout  funds. For instance, investors may perceive the debt associated with  institutions that received government assistance as being less risky  because of the potential for future government bailouts. This perception  could lead them to choose to invest in such assisted institutions instead of  those that did not receive assistance. However, such effects may be  temporary, as evidenced by the recent downgrade by Moody\u2019s Investors  Service, Inc. (Moody\u2019s) of the long-term credit ratings of Bank of America  Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. after the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s new regulatory  provisions were enacted into law, which aim to avoid or at least limit  future government bailouts to financial institutions. Moody\u2019s stated that it  downgraded these credit ratings because it believes the government is  less likely to rescue these financial institutions now than it was during the  financial crisis. This rating change could affect their ability to access  financing with as favorable terms.", "The Dodd-Frank Act included a number of provisions intended to address  the problem of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d by strengthening oversight of financial  institutions. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal  Reserve to implement enhanced prudential standards for bank holding  companies that are deemed systemically important and increased  oversight of certain nonbank financial companies. Specifically, the  Federal Reserve has been given supervisory authority over any nonbank  financial company that the Financial Stability Oversight Council  determines could pose a threat to the financial stability of the country.  Also, the Dodd-Frank Act provided new reporting and resolution  authorities to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for certain large,  systemic financial institutions, and requires those institutions to write  plans for their unwinding. However, if these new provisions fail to  address the too big to fail phenomenon, future financial crises could  emerge that may be similar or worse than the financial meltdown that  escalated with the failures of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in 2008.  That is, some firms may see the government assistance that was  provided during the last crisis as a promise of similar aid in the future and  therefore have an incentive to continue engaging in risky activities.

We also provide  information on program start dates, defining them based on the start of  the first activity under a program, and we provide program end dates,  based on official announcements or program terms from the Department  of the Treasury (Treasury). Finally, we provide approximate program exit  dates\u2014either estimated by Treasury or actual if the exit already  occurred\u2014that reflect the time when a program will no longer hold assets  that need to be managed. We also used OFS cost estimates for TARP  that we audited as part of the financial statement audit and reviewed  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimates from publicly available  CBO reports. In addition, we tested OFS\u2019s internal controls over financial  reporting as it relates to our annual audit of OFS\u2019s financial statements.  The financial information used in this report is sufficiently reliable to  assess the condition and status of TARP programs based on the results  of our audits of fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 financial statements for  TARP.", "We also examined Treasury documentation such as program terms,  decision memos, press releases, and reports on TARP programs and  costs. Also, we interviewed OFS program officials to determine the  current status of each TARP program, the role of TARP staff while most  programs continue to unwind, and to update what is known about exit  considerations for TARP programs. Other TARP officials we interviewed  included those responsible for financial reporting. Additionally, in reporting  on these programs and their exit considerations we leveraged our  previous TARP reports and publications from the Special Inspector  General for TARP and the Congressional Oversight Panel, as  appropriate. In addition:", "For the Capital Purchase Program, we used OFS\u2019 reports to describe  the status of the program, including amount of investments  outstanding, the number of institutions that had repaid their  investments, and the amount of dividends paid, among other things.  In addition, we reviewed Treasury\u2019s press releases on the program.  We also relied on information that we have collected as part of our  ongoing review of the financial condition of Capital Purchase Program  institutions.", "For the Community Development Capital Initiative, we interviewed  program officials to determine how the program is managed and what  repayment or exit concerns Treasury has for the program.", "To update the status of the Automotive Industry Financing Program  (AIFP) and Treasury\u2019s plans for managing its investment in the  companies, we leveraged our past work; reviewed information on  Treasury\u2019s exit from Chrysler, including Chrysler and Treasury press  releases; reviewed information on Treasury\u2019s plans for overseeing its  remaining financial interests in General Motors (GM) and Ally  Financial, including Administration and Treasury reports. To obtain  information on the current financial condition of the companies, we  reviewed information on GM\u2019s and Ally Financial\u2019s finances and  operations, including financial statements and industry analysts\u2019  reports.", "To update the status of the American International Group, Inc. (AIG)", "Investment Program (formerly the Systemically Significant Failing  Institutions Program) we reviewed relevant documents from Treasury  and other parties. For the AIG Investment Program, these documents  included 105(a) reports provided periodically to Congress by  Treasury, as well as reports produced by the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York, and other relevant documentation such as AIG\u2019s financial  disclosures and Treasury\u2019s press releases. We also interviewed  officials from each of these agencies and AIG.", "For the Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) Securities Purchase  Program, we analyzed data on Treasury purchases and dispositions  of SBA 7(a) securities collected during our financial audit. We also  reviewed decision memos on the disposition of the SBA 7(a) portfolio.  In addition, we reviewed press releases about the program\u2019s sales  activity and income. We reviewed SBA 7(a) loan volume data   provided by Treasury and compared that to trends in our past reports  related to SBA 7(a) lending and we also interviewed program staff  about the status of the programs and plans for future sales.", "For the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), we  reviewed program terms and requested data from Treasury about  loan prepayments and TALF LLC activity. We also researched trends  in the values of commercial mortgage-backed securities. Additionally,  we interviewed OFS officials about their role in the program as it  continues to unwind.", "To update the status of the Public-Private Investment Program, we  analyzed program quarterly reports, term sheets, and other  documentation related to the public-private investment funds. We also  interviewed OFS staff responsible for the program to determine the  status of the program while it remains in active investment status.", "To determine the status of Treasury\u2019s TARP-funded housing  programs, we obtained and reviewed Treasury\u2019s published reports on  the programs and servicer performance, documentation on projected  cost estimates and disbursements for each of the programs, and  guidelines and related updates issued by Treasury for each of the  programs. In addition, we obtained information from and interviewed  Treasury officials about the status of the TARP-funded housing  programs, including numbers of borrowers helped and the actions  Treasury had taken to address our prior recommendations.", "To obtain the final status for three programs that Treasury exited and  for which Treasury no longer holds assets that it must manage\u2014the  Asset Guarantee Program, Capital Assistance Program, and Targeted  Investment Program\u2014we reviewed Treasury\u2019s recent reports and  leveraged our past work.", "To determine the proportion of permanent, term, and detailee staff in  OFS, we reviewed program data showing changes in the number of staff  over time and in each OFS office. We assessed this staffing data for  reliability by comparing it to organizational directories to ensure that the  changes were generally equivalent. We determined that the staffing data  was sufficiently reliable to show trends in OFS staffing. We also  interviewed agency officials to gain insight into the trends. Additionally,  we obtained program-specific staffing information from agency officials  during interviews to inform our discussion of the staffing needs of each  TARP program and any succession planning undertaken by OFS. Also,  we reviewed OFS documentation, such as the organizational directories,  to analyze any changes in leadership positions in OFS. To assess the  staffing challenges of OFS as TARP continues to wind down, we  reviewed past GAO reports and recommendations and the OFS staffing  and development plan, and we interviewed agency officials.", "To assess OFS\u2019s use of financial agents and contractors since TARP was  established in October 2008, we reviewed information on financial agents  and contractors from OFS\u2019s contract record system and interviewed  Treasury contract officials about financial agency agreements, contracts,  and blanket purchase agreements as of September 30, 2011, that  support TARP administration and programs. We analyzed information  from the contract record system to update key details on the status of  TARP financial agents and contractors, such as total number of  agreements and contracts, type of services being performed, obligated  values, periods of performance, and share of work by small businesses.  Through discussions with Treasury officials responsible for the contract  record system and inquiries we made about selected data items, as well  as matching OFS\u2019s contract list against data we obtained from the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation, we determined that  data in the record system were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To  assess OFS\u2019s progress in strengthening its infrastructure for managing  and overseeing the performance of TARP financial agents and  contractors and addressing conflicts of interest that could arise with the  use of private sector firms, we reviewed various documents and  interviewed OFS officials about changes in fiscal year 2011 to its policies  and procedures regarding (1) management and oversight of TARP  financial agents and contractors and (2) monitoring and oversight  activities by the OFS team responsible for financial agent and contractor  compliance with TARP conflicts-of-interest requirements. We did not  review financial agents\u2019 performance assessments or incentive payments.", "To ascertain what is known about TARP costs, we reviewed the cost  reporting of CBO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and  Treasury, including the credit reform accounting methods used to develop  cost estimates for TARP programs. For our analysis we focused on  Treasury\u2019s cost estimates for the following reasons: (1) Treasury\u2019s recent  financial statements and cost projections have been audited by GAO and  (2) estimates reported by OMB are based on numbers provided by  Treasury.methods used to calculate TARP costs and the reasons for any significant  differences among the cost estimates calculated by each agency. We  utilized data from our financial audit and leveraged other internal  resources related to credit reform accounting and the modeling of TARP  costs. We also reviewed Treasury\u2019s press releases on the costs of TARP.  For our review of the moral hazards of TARP, we reviewed pertinent  legislation such as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and utilized  previous GAO reports and Congressional Oversight Panel publications.", "We interviewed officials from CBO and Treasury on the  We conducted this performance audit from June 2011 to January 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As previously reported, Bank of America paid Treasury  and others a fee for terminating the term sheet before any assets were  segregated.
