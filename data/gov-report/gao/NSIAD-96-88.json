To address manufacturing deficiencies and performance shortcomings, Congress began requiring the Department of Defense (DOD) to obtain written warranties on all production contracts for weapon systems costing over $100,000 per unit or whose eventual acquisition cost is more than $10,000,000. Congress expected that obtaining cost-effective warranties would enable DOD to hold contractors accountable for the performance of their systems and that the risk of financial consequences would encourage contractors to improve the quality and reliability of the systems.", "In 1984, when the warranty provision was first enacted, many DOD and industry officials criticized the law as being impractical, unworkable, and potentially costly. An amended version enacted in the 1985 DOD Authorization Act and codified as 10 U.S.C. 2403, was intended to correct the problems.", "For most non-weapon system purchases, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) prescribes the procedures and purposes of obtaining a warranty. Under the FAR, the use of a warranty is not mandatory. The FAR allows contracting officers to require contractors to provide warranties on products sold to the government.

The prime contractor must warrant that items provided under the contract (1) conform to the design and manufacturing requirements delineated in the contract, (2) are free from all defects in materials and workmanship at the time of delivery, and (3) meet the essential performance requirements delineated in the contract. Contractors are not required to provide a warranty on government-furnished equipment.", "If the Secretary of Defense determines that a warranty is not in the interest of national defense or that a warranty will not be cost-effective, he may waive all or part of the warranty requirement.

Warranted defects or deficiencies may be caused by poor design, faulty manufacturing processes, or the use of materials that do not meet contract specifications. The cost and coverage of warranties are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Typical weapon system warranties fall into one of the following three categories: failure-free, threshold, and systemic.", "When a system is covered by a failure-free warranty, the contractor is obligated to correct all defects that occur during the warranty period. Although a failure-free warranty is easy to implement, it is associated with high costs due to the higher risks assumed by the contractor. A threshold warranty requires a contractor to remedy a defect when a threshold, such as a predetermined number of part or system failures, is exceeded. This type of warranty recognizes that all weapon systems malfunction to some degree, and the warranty only requires action if the weapon system does not meet the agreed-upon reliability levels.", "A systemic warranty covers a system against a defect that occurs with regularity throughout a production lot or fleet. In the case of systemic warranties, the government must prove that the defects are occurring regularly by either conducting its own investigation or supervising an investigation by the contractor. Once the government proves that a systemic defect exists, the contractor is responsible for replacing or repairing all of the items produced under the circumstances that caused the defect. Some systemic warranties also require the contractor to redesign warranted items if the defect is the result of a design problem.", "A DOD weapon system may be covered by multiple types of warranties. For example, an item may be covered by a failure-free warranty until it is transferred to a unit, and then covered by a systemic warranty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Reviews", "paragraphs": ["In 1987, we reported that the military services were obtaining warranties without assessing cost-effectiveness.

We concluded that this situation could result in warranty administration problems.", "In 1989, we reported that (1) the Office of the Secretary of Defense was not actively overseeing warranty administration by the services; (2) the services had not established a fully effective warranty administration system; (3) the procurement activities had problems performing cost-effectiveness analyses; and (4) the services, therefore, did not know whether they should seek warranty waivers. We concluded that DOD had little assurance that warranty benefits were being fully realized.", "DOD\u2019s Director for Defense Procurement, in 1992, proposed repealing the warranty law.

These reviews found that (1) waiver requests were not seriously considered, (2) the use of waivers had been \u201cvirtually nil,\u201d (3) contractor expenses for warranty repairs were less than the negotiated price for the warranty in four out of five cases, (4) only two out of seven threshold warranties ever reached the threshold, (5) no claims had been made on systemic warranties reviewed, and (6) service regulations requiring post-award reviews of warranty cost-effectiveness were not enforced. The Panel\u2019s alternate recommendation was to revise 10 U.S.C. 2403 to address the implementation problems. The Section 800 Panel sought greater flexibility in implementing and tailoring warranties, as well as limiting warranties to major weapon systems. Furthermore, the Section 800 Panel recommended that the waiver approval authority be lowered from the Assistant Secretary level and that a policy statement be issued encouraging the use of waivers when a warranty is not cost-effective.", "Congress did not repeal the warranty law. Instead, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-355) modified the congressional notification requirement so that an annual report of waivers granted is no longer required, although the defense committees are still to be notified before a waiver is granted for a major weapon system. The act also required DOD to issue guidance on negotiating cost-effective warranties and on waivers.

To obtain insight into the types of issues faced in managing a warranty program, we gathered warranty information from 22 ongoing acquisition programs and reviewed the results of warranty studies performed by the DOD Inspector General, the Office of Defense Procurement, the Acquisition Law Advisory Panel, and others. We selected systems based on the contract value and the type of weapon system for contracts awarded between 1984 and 1994.

Therefore, the warranty law allows the Secretary of Defense to waive the use of a warranty if the Secretary determines that it would not be cost-effective. However, none of the warranties we reviewed, where claim and price data was available, were cost-effective. We found that the government paid $94 million and collected $5 million on these weapon system warranties.

The program office identified 260 potential warranty claims, of which 134 were agreed to and corrected by the contractor. There were 126 claims that were not agreed to by the contractor for a variety of reasons, including the fact that failed parts were unavailable for contractor inspection.

A warranty functions contrary to the primary mission by requiring maintenance personnel to hold parts until a determination can be made as to whether the part is warranted and how it should be repaired.", "In addition, maintenance personnel sometimes replace broken parts on one system with good parts from one or more other systems to keep the maximum number of weapon systems operating and available, thereby fulfilling their primary mission. As a consequence, the broken or defective parts are moved from their original weapon system. This can void a warranty, which can require that the part submitted for a warranty claim come from the original weapon system that the contractor delivered to the service.", "The Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command official responsible for their cost-effectiveness analyses said that historically contractors only accept about 30 percent of potential claims. As a result of the claims submission problem, the Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command is primarily obtaining systemic warranties instead of threshold warranties. However, according to this official, the Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command has never successfully filed a systemic warranty claim, and the probability that claims will be filed under a systemic warranty is zero.", "A report on the Army\u2019s warranty program further supports the claims submission problem. \u201cClaims submission from the field is low. Only a fraction of the work orders are submitted for claims. For many of these, the data are inaccurate and incomplete.\u201d The report looked at several commands and weapon systems and calculated that, at the Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, only 537 actual claims were made out of 8,567 potential claims for 21 contracts.", "The Air Force faces similar low claims submission problems. Officials from the Air Force Materiel Command stated that the lack of reports filed on warranted items from the field is a serious problem. They further stated that the most important mission to field personnel is to repair the items as soon as possible so that the aircraft can resume its mission. Many Air Force warranties rely on the submission of product quality deficiency reports for filing claims. An Air Force Inspector General\u2019s reportestimated that only 15 to 20 percent of failures are actually reported on these forms because they are complicated and cumbersome for maintenance personnel to fill out. Therefore, the Air Force estimates that 80 to 85 percent of failures go unreported.", "In addition to the lack of incentives for field staff to track and report warranty claims, there is a lack of credible data systems and manpower to administer warranty claims. One Air Force official responsible for overseeing warranties at a major command said that because no system is in place to track the warranties or to process claims efficiently, administering the program is a \u201cnightmare.\u201d The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Contracting indicated in 1992 that (1) the problems with warranty administration are not new and (2) the Air Force does not possess and has not been able to develop data systems designed to track warranted items.

The contractor keeps the difference between actual claims and the warranty price as his profit. If the 1989 and 1990 F-15E contracts were considered a form of prepaid maintenance, then the government paid the contractor $12 million and made claims totaling $402,000. The contractor kept as profit $11.6 million.", "Further, the warranty provides the government a process for dealing with the contractor and delineates the contractor\u2019s responsibilities. However, the value of this process seems to vary from system to system. While several program officials told us that the contractors settled claims and fixed problems much more quickly under a warranty, other officials said that the penalties to the contractor are low under a warranty and that contractors routinely dispute government claims. According to one Air Force official, the Air Force has had poor results in getting a return on the claims it has filed. Warranty officials stated that contractors often stall and argue about claims because (1) the contractor asserts that it could have repaired the item more quickly or efficiently, if government maintenance personnel repair an item and bill the contractor; (2) the maintenance personnel did not keep the broken part for contractor inspection; (3) the contractor may believe that the weapon system was operated outside the performance parameters to which it was designed or the maintenance personnel damaged the part using improper procedures, and (4) the contractor may find that the defective part has been shifted from the original weapon system in which it was delivered to the government."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Warranty Waivers Are Not Used as Expected", "paragraphs": ["Congress included a provision in the warranty law that allows the Secretary of Defense or his designee (no lower than an Assistant Secretary of Defense or a military department) to waive the requirement for a weapon system warranty for either national defense or cost-effectiveness reasons. However, since 1985 only 21 waiver requests DOD-wide have reached the assistant secretary level. Of those, 15 have been approved. The conference report accompanying the bill repealing the 1984 warranty law and enacting the current section 2403 noted clearly that the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services did not intend DOD obtain to warranties that are not cost-effective.

The result of this reluctance to seek waivers is that warranties have become essentially mandatory for all major contracts. This was noted by the DOD Acquisition Law Advisory Panel (the Section 800 Panel) in a January 1993 report where it stated that \u201cthe reluctance of DOD to issue warranty waivers fosters the use of warranties without regard to their cost-effectiveness.\u201d", "Service officials at several major commands and at the assistant secretary level said that requests for waivers bring unwanted and often negative attention to an acquisition program. One service official stated that there is a definite \u201cstigma\u201d attached to waiver requests and another referred to it as a \u201cnightmare.\u201d Further, waiver requests impose a significant burden on the program office, which has to generate all the necessary paperwork, including cost-benefit analyses, and brief them up the chain of command to the assistant secretary level, with little or no expectation that a waiver will be approved.", "As an example, the F-16 program office sought a waiver for the essential performance warranty of the third F-16 multiyear contract in November 1991. The entire process\u2014from the completion of the cost-benefit analysis and decision to seek a waiver to the rejection of the waiver request\u2014took 11 months. This was the first attempt by this program office to obtain a waiver for the weapon system. The second attempt, on the 1994 procurement, was rejected after 8 months. The Air Force waiver approval process for the F-16 is shown in figure 2.1.", "The cost-benefit analysis for the third multiyear warranty concluded that both the design and manufacture as well as the materials and workmanship warranties would not be cost-effective. According to an Air Force program official involved in seeking these waivers, the program office did not request a waiver on these parts of the warranty because it believed it would be impossible to get approval. In addition, the official said that the program office was certain that it would be directed to renegotiate these warranties with the contractor. Rather than seek a waiver for these warranties, the program office focused on what it considered its strongest case for a waiver, the essential performance warranty. The contractor had produced approximately 1,500 F-16s when the program office began seeking a waiver and, according to an official in the program office, the program office knew how the aircraft would perform and also knew that the essential performance warranty would provide no benefit to the government. The program office therefore sought a waiver, which was denied because the warranty covered only subsystems rather than the entire weapon system. The assistant secretary indicated a warranty covering the entire weapon system was needed before a decision on whether to grant a waiver could be made.", "The F-16 program office again sought and was denied a waiver for the essential performance requirement warranty for the fiscal year 1994 procurement. According to Air Force officials, a determination was made at the assistant secretary level that, pursuant to the law, a front-line fighter (a major weapon system) should have a warranty and the F-16, because it is a system that has been in production for many years, should have enough data to craft a valid warranty. Therefore, the waiver request was rejected. The warranty obtained contained no risk to the contractor because the warranty was tied to performance measurements that the system had already passed, a fact the contractor and the government already knew. The warranty thresholds have a mission reliability of 90 percent and aircraft availability of 85 percent. The aircraft achieved a mission reliability rate of 97.2 percent and an aircraft availability rate of 91 percent during the official measurement period. This warranty was a warranty in name only.", "It was clear to us from discussions with several officials that they believe that obtaining a warranty requires a relatively small amount of time and effort for the program office compared to the amount of time and effort required to avoid spending that money by obtaining a waiver. In addition, according to officials at a major Air Force command, contractors are aware that waivers are exceedingly difficult to obtain and may insist on a high warranty price if the program office seeks an effective warranty. This in turn may drive the program office to obtain reduced warranty coverage to reduce the warranty price. Program managers do not request a waiver because they believe it will not be granted and, consequently, unnecessary or costly warranties are purchased.", "As required by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (P.L.103-355), DOD revised DFARS regarding weapon system warranties. The new regulations provide guidelines for contracting officers and program managers to use when developing and negotiating weapon system warranties. These regulations state that the use of a weapon system warranty may not be appropriate in all situations. Further, a waiver should be requested if it is determined that obtaining a warranty is not cost-effective or is inconsistent with the national defense.

For example, the 1987 Multiple Launch Rocket System final payoff assessment specifically cited the fact that the thresholds were set so that the government would repair the first four failures on each launcher, but only about one claim was actually filed per launcher. Because the performance thresholds were set so high, the warranty was unlikely to serve as an incentive to the contractor to improve the system\u2019s reliability and the warranty may have had a negative effect on reliability. The Army obtained a follow-on warranty.", "Air Force regulations covering post-award assessments require the program manager to monitor warranty feasibility and cost-effectiveness using annual warranty activity reports submitted by the contractor or the government. These assessments are to include a remarks section that \u201cidentifies the warranted tasks or services that are considered desirable or undesirable based on the claim frequency, failure mode, and dollar value.\u201d The Air Force had not completed this annual assessment on any of the 12 Air Force contracts we reviewed.", "In 1987, the Navy issued instructions on warranties and stated that the Chief of Naval Operations will develop a system for collecting and analyzing actual warranty use and claim data on an annual basis. To date, the Navy has not approved a warranty information system. We found only one of the eight naval systems we reviewed had performed a post-award assessment.", "Air Force program officials stated that final payoff assessments and post-award assessments are difficult to perform for two reasons. First, the warranty is not always separately priced. Second, the weapon system warranted may have had many engineering changes from the time the contract was initially signed until the end of the warranty period. These changes make comparing expected costs and benefits to actual costs and benefits difficult because the initially projected and actually produced weapon systems are different."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Weapon system warranties are generally not cost-effective. They have resulted in a significant cost to the government that substantially exceeds their benefit. The necessity of negotiating and administering the warranties also imposes a large, but unquantified burden on the services.", "The waiver process has resulted in a system in which warranties are virtually mandatory. In this system, the program office seeking a waiver must demonstrate why a warranty would not be cost-effective and seek approval from an assistant secretary. It is easier and less disruptive for that program office to obtain a warranty, regardless of whether it is necessary or cost-effective, than it is to seek a waiver. Because the waiver process is so burdensome and protracted, warranties are obtained without regard to their cost-effectiveness and the officials in the program offices have no incentive to conduct rigorous cost-benefit analyses. In addition, post-award assessments have little value to program officials as tools to identify desirable and undesirable warranties for future contracts because they believe warranties will have to be obtained \u201cno matter what.\u201d", "The current DFARS revision, which stresses that weapon system warranties may not be appropriate in all situations, is a step in the right direction. However, it is inadequate to resolve the difficulties in obtaining a waiver because the regulation could not change the high level required for approving waivers. The waiver approval authority is stipulated in the law itself, and the incentives that arise from it could not have been changed by this revision.

The Institute for Defense Analyses has identified three functions of a warranty in weapon system acquisitions\u2014insurance, assurance-validation, and incentivization. In the commercial marketplace, warranties have similar functions. Commercial buyers believe warranties protect them against catastrophic financial losses and excessive operating costs through a warranty\u2019s insurance aspect. A warranty may also indicate to a buyer that a product is of better quality, which can be equated to the assurance-validation function, and may motivate the contractor to maintain product quality, which equates to the incentivization function.However, these functions are not as significant in weapon system acquisitions as they are in buying a commercial product on the open market.", "For insurance to be cost-effective to the buyer, the risk must be shared and spread over many insured customers, which is not the case in weapon acquisitions. DOD is the only buyer of most weapon systems and must pay the full cost of the insurance provided by the warranty. Also, DOD already has quality assurance processes built into its contracts to ensure that the product complies with all contract specifications. This lessens the need for a warranty\u2019s assurance-validation function. Finally, in our review of 20 weapon systems, we could not find any evidence that indicated that a warranty was a factor in improving system reliability. Since none of the traditional benefits conferred by warranties apply to weapon system purchases, the main benefit that warranties seem to provide is the extension of the time period DOD has to identify defects to be corrected by the contractor."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Insurance Aspect Is Not Typically a Good Reason for Obtaining a Warranty", "paragraphs": ["Commercial buyers are interested in stabilizing their operating costs and protecting themselves against catastrophic losses. A manufacturer\u2019s warranty provides a commercial buyer with a measure of insurance against the risks of repair or replacement costs. If a warranted product does not perform as specified, the buyer whose product failed does not face a total financial loss.", "The concept of insurance is based on the principle of shared risk. In the commercial marketplace, the cost of offering a warranty is shared by many buyers who individually pay a small amount of the total warranty as part of the product\u2019s price. Manufacturers generally estimate how many of their products will be defective and price the product to cover this risk. However, because DOD is usually the only buyer for a weapon system, the contractor cannot allocate the cost of insuring against that risk among multiple buyers. The complete cost for the estimated risk must be borne by the sole buyer or absorbed by the contractor. If it is borne by the buyer it becomes the price of the warranty. If it is absorbed by the contractor then it is a cost that must be covered by the price of the system. In both cases the buyer pays. A further factor in the cost of a warranty is the extent of unproven technology or innovative design that a weapon system encompasses, which may cause the contractor to perceive its financial risk is significant. This will tend to drive up the warranty price to the government and causes the contractors to try to limit warranty coverage as much as possible. As a result, insuring against weapon system failures generally is not beneficial to the government since the government will be responsible for 100 percent of the estimated cost of that risk. The government will only achieve a positive financial result if failures in the system substantially exceed the contractor\u2019s estimates of risk.", "While it may seem that a warranty would make sense in cases where the extent of system failures exceeds the cost of the warranty, this occurs in very few instances and the cost of insuring all weapon systems to cover costs in these instances is not a good financial decision. It is for this reason that the government maintains a policy of self-insurance against losses in almost all other areas. A RAND study reported that shifting financial risk to the manufacturer is seldom an appropriate or sufficient rationale for obtaining a weapon system warranty, for the same reason that it is not to the government\u2019s advantage to buy insurance from a commercial firm.", "Another factor limiting the potential insurance benefits of warranties is the relationship of the government to major defense contractors. If a contractor were someday to incur large losses as a result of a warranty on a weapon system, the threat of insolvency might cause the government to excuse the contractor from its warranty obligation. Historically, when a defense firm incurs large losses because of a contract, the government has taken action to provide relief and prevent the firm from going out of business. DOD\u2019s ability to provide extraordinary contractual relief to a defense contractor is recognized in Public Law 85-804. From 1959 to 1993, DOD used this provision to provide over $4.3 billion (in constant 1996 dollars) in relief to assist contractors in recovering from losses. As a result, the utility of warranties may be limited to collecting small or marginal amounts from a contractor rather than making good a catastrophic loss."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Warranties Are Not Generally a Good Means of Assuring Quality Systems", "paragraphs": ["The second purpose of warranties is assurance-validation. Applied to weapon systems, assurance-validation means assuring DOD that the manufacturer\u2019s product conforms to the design, quality, and performance levels specified in the contract. Although DOD is moving more toward a commercial acquisition system, it uses many quality assurance processes to verify product quality and contract conformance independent of the warranty clauses. Since the cognizant contract administration office is responsible for verifying that the accepted product conforms to the specifications in the contract, the assurance-validation function of a weapon system warranty may not be necessary.", "In weapon system acquisitions, DOD uses many different program management tools to reduce the inherent risks of the acquisition process. DOD\u2019s weapon acquisition policies seek to reduce the risk of obtaining a poor quality product by establishing a disciplined multiphased process that (1) translates mission needs into stable and affordable programs; (2) acquires quality products; and (3) provides a program management structure that has clear lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability. As each weapon system progresses through the phases, it is subject to comprehensive programmatic reviews. During the reviews, an assessment is made of the program\u2019s accomplishments to date, plans for the next phase, and acquisition strategies for the remainder of the program. Additionally, the program risks and risk management planning is evaluated. In theory, for each of the acquisition phases, program-specific results are required before a program is permitted to proceed to the next phase. For example, a program may be required to demonstrate the maturity of a manufacturing process before being permitted to start production. Techniques available to manage risk include the use of technology demonstrations and prototyping to test hardware, software, manufacturing processes and/or critical subsystems. Another technique is to test and evaluate the weapon system or its components to determine system maturity and identify technical risks.", "Finally, DOD establishes quality assurance programs to provide confidence that a weapon system will conform to the technical requirements and provide satisfactory performance. A warranty is one more management tool at DOD\u2019s disposal to assure quality as the weapon system begins to be put in use. Given the extensive quality assurance efforts made over the whole development and production cycle, however, a warranty may actually be insurance against the failure of the quality assurance process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Warranties May Not Provide Much Incentive to Improve Product Quality", "paragraphs": ["Finally, warranties are supposed to serve as an incentive to manufacturers to improve quality. Conceptually, all warranties motivate a manufacturer to improve product quality because the goal is to maximize profits by not having to perform warranty service. However, when a commercial manufacturer provides a warranty, it generally knows the projected failure rates of the product and the probable repair costs. The costs for these failures are included in the cost of the product. Efforts to keep commercial prices competitive probably undercuts the incentive to make additional profit by pricing the warranty higher than its expected cost.", "In the commercial market, a warranty may also signal product quality to the buyer because the commercial buyer generally is not familiar with how the product was made and does not know how the product will perform.Therefore, the warranty becomes a marketing tool to help sell the product by convincing the buyer it is a superior product.", "In weapon acquisition, the contractor is generally not faced with direct price competition. Absent direct price competition, there is no incentive for the contractor to limit its ability to fully cover the estimated cost of risks of system failure being warranted. Further, the marketing aspects of a warranty are for the most part irrelevant to DOD. The warranty\u2019s indication of manufacturer confidence in product quality is not needed because, as shown in the previous section, DOD is not a typical consumer. DOD is knowledgeable about how the weapons it obtains are made and in some cases helped to design the system. Generally, DOD knows how the product will perform and uses other management techniques to maintain product quality.", "In addition, the majority of officials in the weapon system program offices we visited stated that either (1) the warranties had not induced the contractors to take actions to improve the quality of their warranted products or (2) if there were quality and reliability improvements due to the warranty, those improvements were marginal and unmeasurable. For example, the F-15 warranty manager stated that the contractor has not designed components of the weapon system differently nor is the contractor building the weapon system differently because of the warranty. The F-110 engine warranty manager also said that the warranty has not helped to improve the reliability of the engine.", "In a report issued in August 1992, the U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity, reached a similar conclusion regarding different warranties on several systems. The report stated: \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that hardware improvements that were performed under the warranty would not have been performed had there not been a warranty. Therefore, it is unlikely that any reliability growth from these improvements could be attributed to the warranty.\u201d The report stated that no models were available that could be used to measure reliability improvements resulting from a warranty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Warranties May Confer Limited Benefits at Great Expense", "paragraphs": ["With or without a warranty, a contractor is obligated to produce a product that complies with the terms delineated in the contract, including all design, manufacturing, and performance specifications.

If DOD did not obtain a warranty, the contractor could be released from any further obligation to correct problems once the government accepted the product. A warranty extends beyond acceptance the period during which the government can identify defects and require the contractor to correct them at no charge.", "Prior to acceptance, if defects are discovered, the government, even without a warranty, can (1) order the contractor to correct the defects at no additional charge, (2) reject the nonconforming product, (3) terminate the contract for default, or (4) seek a price reduction. A warranty obligates the contractor to correct defects, even if the government did not identify them before acceptance. This can reduce disputes because the warranty eliminates the need to prove where and when a defect came into existence.
