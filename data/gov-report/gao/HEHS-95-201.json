As employers negotiate for lower premiums or limit employees\u2019 access to providers, they want to ensure that their employees still receive quality care. Individual consumers want to be assured that they have access to quality providers and that they make the right health care decisions.

Health plans have been publishing reports comparing their performance to their peers or to a national standard. State governments have published comparative information, often focused on specific procedures performed in hospitals. Although the federal government was responsible for the first widespread public disclosure of hospital performance data in 1987, it discontinued this practice in 1993. As a payer of health care services on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) lags behind others in making performance data public.", "Report cards can include a variety of performance indicators, either structural, process, or outcome based. Structural indicators measure the resources and organizational arrangements in place to deliver care, such as the ratio of nurses to inpatient beds. Process indicators measure the physician and other provider activities carried out to deliver the care, such as the rates of childhood immunization. Outcome indicators measure the results of the physician and other provider activities, such as mortality, morbidity, and customer satisfaction."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Employers Took the Initiative in Report Card Development", "paragraphs": ["In 1989, a group of employers initiated one of the most significant efforts to identify uniform and standardized performance indicators. This effort resulted in the creation of a performance measurement system known as the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS). Several business coalitions and health care organizations used the first HEDIS measures in 1991. The nonprofit National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) has led the effort to revise the measures, issuing HEDIS 2.0 in 1993 and HEDIS 2.5 in 1995. Current HEDIS measures focus on process indicators.

For example, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) recently distributed to its employees a performance report about the health plans it offers. Although it had furnished some comparative information to its employees in previous years, the information generally featured cost and benefits. CalPERS\u2019 May 1995 Health Plan Quality/Performance Report is its first effort at distributing comprehensive information that includes both specific quality performance indicators and member satisfaction survey results. The quality performance data are based on HEDIS indicators measuring health maintenance organizations\u2019 (HMO) success with providing childhood immunizations, cholesterol screening, prenatal care, cervical and breast cancer screening results, and diabetic eye exams. Employee survey results include employee satisfaction with physician care, hospital care, and the overall plan, and the results of a question asking whether members would recommend the plan to a fellow employee or friend.", "Some employers are using third-party health care accrediting organizations to measure health plan performance using structural indicators. These employers are requiring the health plans they contract with to be accredited by organizations such as NCQA and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Furthermore, some accrediting agencies publicize their accreditation decisions, which allows employers and individual consumers to consider accreditation status in their health care purchasing decisions. For example, a consortium of employers has elected to exclude a Florida HMO from new business with its employer-sponsored health plans because of the HMO\u2019s failure to obtain accreditation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Plans Make Performance Data Public", "paragraphs": ["Health plans have published comparative information intended to assist individual consumers in their health care choices and health care providers in their quality improvements.

These employees were selected because their employers offered them more than one health insurance plan to choose from when making their health care insurance purchasing decisions.
