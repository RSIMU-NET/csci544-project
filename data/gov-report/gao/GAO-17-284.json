For example, one action plan is to use an updated process for reviewing troubled programs to provide support to such programs; however, DHS has not finalized its policy for this process. Until DHS ensures that these 3 plans are implemented, it will lack assurance that it is fulfilling FITARA's goals.", "DHS faces challenges in implementing certain FITARA provisions:", "Chief Information Officer (CIO) approval of contracts and agreements. FITARA requires, among other things, the agency CIO to review and approve IT contracts and agreements associated with major investments (e.g., high cost) prior to award. However, the CIO did not participate in the approval of any of the 48 contracts in GAO's sample associated with major investments. While DHS has made improvements to its review process, until the Office of the CIO determines how to increase its review of contracts and agreements, the CIO will continue to have limited visibility into planned IT expenditures.", "CIO evaluation of risk. DHS's Office of the CIO was conducting risk evaluations of major IT investments and updating the ratings on the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) public website known as the IT Dashboard, as required by FITARA. However, in October 2016, DHS changed its process for evaluating 30 of DHS's 93 major IT investments and, as a result, the CIO is no longer primarily responsible for the evaluations or associated risk ratings that are publicly reported for these investments. Instead, multiple DHS organizations and officials are to evaluate these investments and the CIO's assessment only accounts for about 18 percent of the total score. Further, while under the old process, DHS's CIO was responsible for assessing these 30 investments against criteria that OMB guidance stated CIOs may use, under the new process, the CIO is only to assess these investments against one of OMB's criteria (see table below). This process change challenges the CIO's ability to publicly report risk ratings.", "Until DHS addresses these challenges, the goal of FITARA to elevate the role of the department CIO in acquisition management will not be fully realized."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 7 recommendations to DHS to ensure that it fully and effectively implements FITARA.

However, prior IT  expenditures too often have failed to meet cost and schedule  expectations or make significant contributions to mission-related  outcomes. To address these concerns, in December 2014, Congress  enacted IT reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Federal  Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act or FITARA. In June 2015,  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released FITARA  implementation guidance that, among other things, outlined  responsibilities and authorities of federal agency chief information officers  (CIO); it also required agencies to develop action plans needed to  implement the FITARA guidance.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) relies heavily on IT to carry  out its mission. In fiscal year 2016, the department\u2019s IT budget of  approximately $6.2 billion was the third largest in the federal government.  Given the importance of implementing FITARA and the size of its budget,  we reviewed the progress that this department has made in addressing  the act. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) determine the extent to  which DHS has developed action plans that address FITARA, and the  extent to which DHS has implemented selected action plans; and (2)  determine the key challenges that DHS is facing in implementing selected  FITARA provisions.", "To address the initial part of the first objective\u2014determine the extent to  which DHS has developed action plans that address FITARA\u2014we  identified and reviewed each of the 131 action plans which DHS  developed in accordance with OMB\u2019s FITARA implementation guidance  that identified 17 topic areas of agency CIOs\u2019 roles and responsibilities,  referred to as common baseline sections. OMB\u2019s 17 baseline areas and  DHS\u2019s 131 supporting action plans are related to three of the five FITARA  sections applicable to DHS: agency CIO authority enhancements,  portfolio reviews, and the expansion of training and use of IT acquisition  cadres.", "In addition, we reviewed the department\u2019s IT acquisition human capital  plan and its data center consolidation plan, which were intended to  address FITARA\u2019s fourth and fifth applicable sections on the expansion of  training and use of IT acquisition cadres, and data center consolidation,  respectively. Further, we reviewed the department\u2019s plan for assessing IT  program risks, which was developed prior to the enactment of FITARA,  but is consistent with the act\u2019s provisions on enhanced transparency and  improved risk management. We compared the information in each of  these plans to the five applicable sections in FITARA. We did not assess  whether DHS would be in full compliance with FITARA if the plans were  implemented.", "To address the second part of the first objective\u2014determine the extent to  which DHS has implemented selected FITARA action plans\u2014we first  identified those action plans (of the 131 total plans) that DHS reported it  had fully implemented as of April 2016. This resulted in the identification  of 109 action plans. (The remaining 22 of the 131 total plans were  identified by DHS as not yet fully implemented and, thus, were not  included in our selection pool.)", "From the 109 plans that the department identified as fully implemented,  we then selected a sample of the plans for review. To create the sample,  we selected only those action plans that (1) were included in the 11  common baseline sections that DHS identified as fully implemented (out  of the 17 total sections) and (2) described later-stage implementation  steps; we did not include plans that described earlier-stage, or preliminary  steps which the department said had been implemented. For example,  we included in our sample action plans that focused on the  implementation of an updated process, rather than action plans that  focused on the preliminary identification of how a process needs to be  updated. Based on these criteria, we selected a sample of 31 action  plans.", "We then obtained and analyzed available DHS documentation supporting  the implemented actions, such as DHS policy documents, guidance  documents, concepts of operations, process models, program  management briefings, meeting minutes, memorandums, committee  charters, and relevant e-mails to and from staff in DHS\u2019s Office of the  Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and OMB. We compared the  documentation to the selected action plans to determine the extent to  which DHS had implemented the plans. We also interviewed cognizant  officials from across the department, including from the OCIO, the  Enterprise Business Management Office (EBMO), the Office of the Chief  Human Capital Officer, the Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management, and the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer. We  discussed with these officials the steps that DHS had taken to implement  the selected action plans.", "Regarding our assessments of the sample of DHS\u2019s FITARA action plans,  we determined an action plan to be fully implemented when the evidence  provided by DHS officials fulfilled all aspects of the action plan\u2019s  description. We assessed an action plan as being partially implemented  when the evidence fulfilled some, but not all, aspects of the action plan\u2019s  description. For action plans that we determined to be partially  implemented (although the department had identified them as being fully  implemented), we reviewed documentation and met with department  officials to identify the causes for why those action plans were not yet fully  implemented.", "To address the second objective, we identified the five sections within  FITARA that were applicable to DHS as a covered agency. These  sections related to agency CIO authority enhancements, enhanced  transparency and improved risk management, portfolio reviews, federal  data center consolidation, and the expansion of training and use of IT  acquisition cadres. We then selected and reviewed provisions for three of  those sections\u2014agency CIO authority enhancements, enhanced  transparency and improved risk management, and the expansion of  training and use of IT acquisition cadres. (We did not select provisions  from the sections on portfolio reviews and federal data center  consolidation because we had recently completed work that addressed  these sections.)", "To select the provisions from within the three sections, we first identified  those that would require significant coordination between DHS  headquarters and its components\u2014since such coordination is especially  important to the department\u2019s decentralized structure. We also identified  those that should have already been implemented by the department  based on the time that had passed since FITARA was enacted in  December 2014.", "Based on the criteria, we selected provisions that require:  the DHS CIO to review and approve IT contracts and agreements  before the department enters into them (part of the agency CIO  authority enhancements section);  the department CIO to evaluate each major IT investment according  to risk, in accordance with guidance issued by the Director of OMB  (part of the enhanced transparency and improved risk management  section); and  the department to develop and strengthen its IT acquisition cadre, to  include having highly skilled program and project managers (part of  the expansion of training and use of IT acquisition cadres section).", "We examined the implementation of these provisions by DHS  headquarters and the department\u2019s five operational components with the  largest planned fiscal year 2016 IT budgets, as reported on OMB\u2019s IT  Dashboard. These components were the Transportation Security  Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Coast  Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement.", "Further, to address the contract approval provision within this objective,  we selected a random sample of contracts and interagency agreements  from each of the five selected components and headquarters. To do so,  we first asked DHS to provide us with a list of contracts for IT or IT  services that met the following criteria: must have been awarded between October 1, 2015 and May 31, must have been unclassified; and must not have been identified as a contract modification.", "From the list of contracts provided by DHS, we then selected a subset of  contracts from each of the five selected components and headquarters to  review. Specifically, based on the total value of each contract, we  randomly selected 17 contracts from each of the components and  headquarters using the following cost ranges: $100,000 to less than $1 million (7 contracts), $1 million to less than $2.5 million (7 contracts), and $2.5 million and above (3 contracts).", "Two of the selected components\u2014U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2014did not have  enough contracts in each cost range for us to assess the total number of  contracts we had planned. In instances where this occurred, we reviewed  these components\u2019 available, applicable contracts within those particular  cost ranges.", "As a result, our sample consisted of a total of 92 contracts. Of the 92  contracts, DHS officials from headquarters and the five selected  components associated 48 contracts with major investments and 21 with  non-major investments. Officials from headquarters, Customs and  Border Protection, and the U.S. Coast Guard were unable to map 23  contracts in our sample to an IT investment.", "To select the sample of agreements for review, we first asked DHS to  provide us with a list of agreements for IT or IT services that met the  following criteria: must have been classified by DHS as interagency acquisitions  (rather than financial transactions); must have been entered into between October 1, 2015 and May 31, must have had a total value of greater than $100,000; and must have been unclassified.", "Based on the above criteria, DHS provided a list of 24 interagency  agreements from headquarters and the five selected components. We  included all of those agreements in our review. Of the 24 interagency  agreements, DHS officials associated 8 agreements with major  investments and 5 with non-major investments. The officials were unable  to map 11 interagency agreements in our sample to an IT investment.", "To determine whether each contract or interagency agreement was  approved prior to DHS entering into them, we obtained and analyzed  each of the contracts and agreements, as well as associated approval  documentation, such as acquisition review decision documents. We then  compared the contracts, agreements, and associated approval  documentation to the FITARA provisions to identify gaps between what  FITARA required and what DHS had implemented. Specifically, we  compared the: (1) signature date on the contract or agreement to the date  that was identified on the associated approval documentation and (2)  amount approved to the amount awarded.", "Additionally, because DHS used its governance process\u2014referred to as  the IT Acquisition Review process\u2014to approve contracts and  agreements, we assessed whether the DHS CIO (for contracts and  agreements associated with major investments) or a delegate who  reports directly to the CIO (for contracts and agreements associated with  non-major investments) was a full participant in that process, as required  by FITARA. Specifically, for contracts and agreements associated with  major investments, we analyzed the contract or agreement and  associated approval documentation to determine whether the CIO signed  off on the contract or agreement, attended a meeting where it was  discussed, or provided written comments regarding it.", "For contracts and agreements associated with non-major investments, we  analyzed the contract or agreement and associated approval  documentation to determine the position title of the official who approved  the proposed contract or agreement. We then asked officials from DHS  headquarters and the five components to identify whether the approving  official reported directly to the DHS CIO, as required by FITARA. If that  person did not directly report to the DHS CIO, we asked for  documentation demonstrating whether the DHS CIO or an official who  reports directly to the CIO was involved as a full participant in the  approval process (i.e., attended a meeting where the specific contract or  agreement was discussed, or provided written comments regarding it).", "We also interviewed cognizant DHS officials from headquarters and the  five selected components to discuss DHS\u2019s IT Acquisition Review  process, the steps DHS had taken to review and approve IT contracts  and agreements prior to award, and the reasons for any gaps we  identified to determine their challenges in fully implementing this FITARA  provision.", "Within our second objective, to address the provision of FITARA that  requires the DHS CIO to evaluate each major IT investment according to  risk and update the associated CIO ratings on OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard in  accordance with OMB guidance, we analyzed DHS\u2019s policy for updating  the CIO ratings on the Dashboard. We also analyzed DHS\u2019s assessment  template that was used for developing the ratings reported on the  Dashboard. We then compared these documents to the FITARA provision  to identify gaps between what FITARA required and what DHS had  implemented. Further, we interviewed officials from EBMO and the Office  of Program Accountability and Risk Management to discuss the steps  DHS had taken to evaluate its major IT investments and update the  associated CIO ratings on OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard. We also discussed with  these officials the reasons for the gaps we identified to determine their  challenges in addressing these gaps and fully implementing the provision.", "To identify any challenges associated with implementing the FITARA  provision that required DHS to develop and strengthen its IT acquisition  cadre, we obtained and analyzed documentation on DHS headquarters\u2019  and the five selected components\u2019 efforts to develop and deploy a skilled  IT acquisition cadre. Specifically, we assessed the department\u2019s  acquisition human capital plan and IT strategic plan, and compared them  to the FITARA provision to identify gaps between what FITARA required  and what DHS had implemented. We also interviewed cognizant DHS  officials from headquarters and the five selected components to discuss  the steps DHS had taken to implement an IT acquisition cadre. In  addition, we discussed with these officials the reasons for the gaps we  identified to determine what, if any, challenges they encountered in  addressing these gaps and fully implementing the provision.", "To assess the reliability of the data that we used to support the findings in  this report, we reviewed relevant program documentation to substantiate  evidence obtained through interviews with agency officials.

In addition, the department  documented and implemented updated processes for the planning,  programming, and budgeting phases to ensure that the CIO has, among  other things, visibility into IT resource plans and decisions. Further, the  department revised relevant documentation and processes to reflect the  CIO\u2019s responsibility to approve components\u2019 requests for reprogramming  or transferring IT resources.", "However, the remaining 3 selected action plans were not yet fully  implemented due to two factors: (1) the steps taken did not address all  planned actions and (2) DHS updated its policies with conflicting  guidance. Specifically, DHS\u2019s steps to implement action plans 19 and 20  addressed part, but not all, of these plans. Related to action 19\u2014to  leverage the updated DHS TechStat process to provide support to  failing or troubled programs\u2014OCIO officials were in the process of  updating the department\u2019s TechStat policy to comply with FITARA, but  had not completed the update. As of December 2016, the officials stated  that they could not provide a date for when the policy would be finalized.  Until the CIO, who is responsible for establishing departmental IT policies,  finalizes the TechStat policy, the department will be limited in its ability to  ensure that DHS is meeting FITARA\u2019s IT acquisition reform goals, as well  as consistently providing support to failing or troubled programs.", "With regard to action 20\u2014to ensure the IT Program/Project Manager  Center of Excellence reviews IT performance metrics and strategies\u2014 DHS developed IT performance metrics. However, as of December 2016,  EBMO officials stated that the Center of Excellence had not begun using  these metrics across all programs to identify poorly performing programs.", "These officials told us that they expected the Center of Excellence to  begin using these metrics across all programs to identify those needing  assistance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Use of these metrics  by the center will be vital to its ability to proactively identify poorly  performing programs and help them to improve their performance.", "With regards to action 24, which required that the DHS CIO certify  investments\u2019 incremental development activities, the department updated  its multiple systems engineering life-cycle policies and guidance  documents with conflicting information regarding who was to certify these  development activities. While one of the policies was updated to specify  that the DHS CIO was the certifier, another policy and a guidance  document was updated to specify that the component CIO was the  certifier.", "Officials from EBMO and the Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management stated that these documents were not written at the same  time and, as a result, reflected conflicting policies and guidance that  needed further clarification. However, the officials did not state when they  intended to make the clarifications and updates to the policies and  guidance. Until the Under Secretary for Management, who is responsible  for managing the implementation of department-wide acquisition policies,  updates DHS\u2019s relevant policies and guidance in a consistent manner to  identify that the DHS CIO is to certify investments\u2019 incremental  development activities, the department is at risk of excluding the CIO from  important investment oversight activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Faces Several Challenges in Implementing FITARA", "paragraphs": ["DHS currently faces a number of important challenges in implementing  several selected FITARA provisions.

FITARA allows the CIO to  delegate these review and approval duties if a contract or agreement is to  support a non-major IT investment. In such cases, the delegated official  must report directly to the agency CIO. Accordingly, in order to properly  distinguish the appropriate approving official, per FITARA, it is necessary  for an agency to determine whether each IT contract and agreement is  associated with a major or non-major investment.", "Alternatively, FITARA states that an agency may use its governance  processes to approve any contract or agreement (associated with major  investments), if the agency CIO is a full participant in the governance  processes. Further, when governance processes are used for review of  contracts or agreements associated with non-major IT investments, the  CIO or an individual who reports directly to the agency CIO must be a full  participant in the governance processes.", "While DHS used its governance process (e.g., the CIO\u2019s IT Acquisition  Review process, discussed earlier) to approve contracts and interagency  agreements associated with major and non-major investments, the DHS  CIO did not directly review or approve any of the contracts or interagency  agreements that we examined. Furthermore, the CIO or an appropriate  delegate was not always a full participant in the department\u2019s use of its  governance process to approve the contracts and interagency  agreements that we reviewed, as required by FITARA. Specifically,", "Of the 48 contracts and 8 interagency agreements in our sample  that department officials associated with major investments (i.e., those  requiring additional management attention because of, among other  things, their significance to the department\u2019s mission or high costs, as  defined by OMB), the DHS CIO neither directly reviewed, nor  participated in the governance process to review, any of those  contracts or agreements, as required by FITARA. Instead, all of the  contracts and interagency agreements were reviewed by either the  Executive Director or Deputy Executive Director of EBMO, or a  component official, which was not in compliance with FITARA.", "While an appropriate delegate who reported directly to the department  CIO participated in the review of 5 of the 21 selected contracts that  DHS officials associated with non-major investments, the department  CIO or an appropriate delegate did not participate in the review of the  remaining 16 contracts (about 76 percent). In addition, neither the  DHS CIO nor an appropriate delegate participated in the review of any  of the 5 interagency agreements in our sample that were associated  with non-major investments. Instead, these contracts and interagency  agreements were reviewed and approved, as part of the governance  process, by someone who did not report directly to the DHS CIO,  such as a deputy assistant commissioner or a management analyst.  Such review and approval was not consistent with FITARA.", "Table 3 summarizes the number of selected contracts and interagency  agreements that were and were not reviewed by the appropriate official  prior to award, as required by FITARA.", "Further, the department CIO did not prioritize the reviews of contracts  associated with major IT investments, even for those with known  performance problems. For example, three of the contracts in our sample  were associated with two major DHS IT investments with past or existing  performance issues: Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Automated  Commercial Environment investment and United States Citizenship and  Immigration Services\u2019 Transformation investment. We have previously  reported on significant performance problems with these investments.  However, the DHS CIO did not directly review and approve the contracts  for these troubled investments, as required by FITARA for contracts  associated with major investments. Instead, the Customs and Border  Protection CIO and the Executive Director of EBMO reviewed the  contracts for these investments, respectively.", "According to OCIO officials, the reason why the department CIO  delegated the approval of contracts and agreements in a way that was  inconsistent with FITARA was that DHS had a large volume of contracts,  which made it challenging for the department CIO and those who  reported to the CIO to review every contract and agreement. Specifically,  data provided by DHS showed that, in fiscal year 2016, the department  awarded approximately 5,100 contracts for IT or IT services. According to  DHS officials, as a work around to this resource constraint, the  department CIO delegated the review and approval of contracts and  agreements to EBMO or component officials.", "OCIO officials recognized that the department needs to make  improvements to better meet the intent of FITARA\u2019s contract and  agreement approval section and they have begun taking steps to do so.  For example, in May 2016, the department updated its department-wide  acquisition procedures to require greater participation in the acquisition  planning process by the DHS CIO and component CIOs. Specifically, the  updated procedures specify that the DHS CIO is required to review and  sign the acquisition plans\u2014which are developed early in the  procurement planning process and provide top-level plans for the overall  acquisition approach\u2014associated with major IT acquisitions that have  estimated life-cycle costs of greater than $50 million or service  acquisitions with an annual expenditure of $100 million or more.  Additionally, the updated procedures specify that the component CIOs  are to review and sign the acquisition plans for all acquisitions involving  sensitive information. Further, in October 2016, OCIO updated its  associated IT Acquisition Review governance process to implement these  new procedures.", "Nevertheless, while these updates to the department-wide acquisition  procedures and governance process represent improvements by allowing  the CIO and component CIOs insight into early procurement planning, the  CIO\u2019s visibility into contracts is limited because these top-level acquisition  plans do not include important details (e.g., the full scope of the work to  be performed) that are contained in specific contracts.", "Additionally, the department\u2019s governance process requires contracts or  agreements that are associated with major investments and that have  total estimated procurement values of at least $2.5 million to be submitted  to the DHS OCIO for review. However, these processes still do not  require contracts and agreements that are associated with major  investments and are under this threshold to be submitted for CIO review,  which is inconsistent with FITARA.", "In response to our concerns, in April 2017, OCIO officials stated that they  had begun to analyze how they could best increase the CIO\u2019s and  appropriate delegates\u2019 reviews of contracts and agreements, while  considering the department\u2019s staffing constraints. The officials also stated  that, once this analysis is complete, they plan to update their governance  process accordingly; however, they did not know when these actions  would be completed. Until the governance process is updated in a way  that increases the CIO\u2019s and appropriate delegates\u2019 reviews of contracts  and agreements associated with major and non-major investments, the  DHS CIO will continue to have limited visibility into the department\u2019s  planned IT expenditures. Additionally, the CIO may lack critical data to  make investment decisions and may not be able to use the increased  authority that FITARA\u2019s contract and agreement approval provision is  intended to provide.", "Further exacerbating this issue, FITARA does not allow agency CIOs to  delegate the review and approval of contracts and agreements  associated with major investments, but there were many contracts and  interagency agreements in our sample for which DHS officials were  unable to map to a major or non-major IT investment; as such, they could  not ensure that these contracts and agreements were reviewed by the  appropriate officials. Specifically, officials from DHS headquarters,  Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Coast Guard were unable  to map 23 of the 92 contracts (about 25 percent) and 11 of the 24  interagency agreements (about 46 percent) in our sample to a major or  non-major IT investment.", "The officials cited various reasons for why they could not map these  contracts and interagency agreements to a major or non-major IT  investment. Specifically,", "OCIO officials stated that only contracts and agreements that go  through the department\u2019s headquarters-level contract approval  process (i.e., defined by DHS as those valued at $2.5 million or over  and are associated with major investments) are required to identify  the associated investments. These officials stated that, at the  headquarters level, the department does not ask about the  investments associated with contracts and agreements that do not go  through this headquarters-level contract approval process.", "While Customs and Border Protection officials were able to identify  the IT investments associated with the majority of their contracts and  interagency agreements in our sample, these officials stated that  certain contracts were not associated with planned IT investments.  Rather, according to the officials, these contracts were to address  emerging needs (e.g., a need for new laptops) that Customs and  Border Protection offices had identified that were not originally  planned as part of an investment.", "U.S. Coast Guard officials stated that their process for accounting for  all IT costs does not include a mapping of every contract or  agreement to a major or non-major IT investment. These officials said  they were working with DHS headquarters to improve their process for  tracking contracts and agreements associated with IT investments,  but did not specify a time frame for completing this effort.", "Until the Under Secretary for Management updates DHS headquarters\u2019,  Customs and Border Protection\u2019s, and U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s processes to  track, for all contracts and agreements, the IT investment with which each  is associated (as applicable), the department will be challenged in its  ability to ensure that the contracts and agreements that are associated  with these investments receive the appropriate level of oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Recent Change in Its Risk Rating Process Creates a Barrier to Reporting the CIO\u2019s Assessment to OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard", "paragraphs": ["FITARA requires each agency CIO to categorize its major IT investments  according to risk, in accordance with guidance issued by the Director of  OMB. In this regard, OMB issued guidance in June 2015 that directed  agency CIOs to evaluate and categorize (i.e., rate) the risk of each major  IT investment. In addition, OMB\u2019s guidance directs agencies to report  their CIO risk ratings on OMB\u2019s public website known as the IT  Dashboard.", "Prior to October 2016, DHS\u2019s OCIO, on behalf of the CIO, was  conducting such evaluations on the department\u2019s major IT investments in  accordance with OMB\u2019s six criteria. The office was also regularly updating  the associated CIO risk ratings on the IT Dashboard, as required by  FITARA and OMB.", "However, as of October 2016, the CIO was no longer directly responsible  for the full evaluations or the associated risk ratings that are publicly  reported on the IT Dashboard for approximately one-third of the  department\u2019s major IT investments. This was due to DHS\u2019s Under  Secretary for Management issuing a new policy in October 2016 that  assigned responsibility for collecting the appropriate acquisition program  data for evaluating the health of all level one and level two major  acquisition programs (both IT and non-IT) that are on the department\u2019s  Master Acquisition Oversight List to the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management. According to EBMO officials, as of December  2016, these level one and level two investments that the Office of  Program Accountability and Risk Management was to facilitate the  evaluation of included 30 of DHS\u2019s 93 major IT investments. DHS\u2019s policy  further states that the department CIO is to report the ratings that are  facilitated by the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management  on these 30 IT investments to OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard. The officials also  stated that OCIO is to continue to have responsibility for the evaluations  of the 63 other IT investments not on that oversight list, and for reporting  the associated risk ratings of these investments to the IT Dashboard.", "According to the Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management\u2019s evaluation template, 39 factors, each with an associated  weight, are to be considered in conducting the evaluations, and each  factor is to be assessed by different organizations and officials within the  department. These organizations and officials include, among others, the  Offices of Program Accountability and Risk Management, the Chief  Procurement Officer, the Chief Information Officer, Systems Engineering,  and the Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Director of Operational Test  and Evaluation, and the Joint Requirements Council. After all of the  offices prepare their parts of the assessment, the Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management is to calculate a final evaluation  rating based on the 39 factors and their weights.", "For its part, the CIO is responsible for assessing the 30 IT investments  against 10 of the 39 factors, which accounts for about 18 percent of the  total assessment score. Thus, over 80 percent of the evaluation and final  assessment score for the investments included in the evaluation  facilitated by the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management  does not involve the key IT management executive\u2014the CIO.", "Moreover, DHS\u2019s CIO was previously responsible for evaluating and  reporting the associated risk ratings of the department\u2019s 30 major IT  investments on the Master Acquisition Oversight List against the criteria  that OMB\u2019s 2015 guidance stated CIOs may use to evaluate and report  the risk of their programs. However, as shown in table 4, under the new  process facilitated by the Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management, the CIO is only responsible for assessing these  investments against one of OMB\u2019s criteria.", "Further, while the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management  is responsible for facilitating the development of the risk ratings that are  reported to the IT Dashboard for these 30 IT investments, as of  December 2016, according to DHS officials, OCIO was also conducting a  separate evaluation on these investments. Specifically, OCIO officials  stated that they have continued to conduct their own evaluations in order  to meet OCIO\u2019s other investment oversight responsibilities.", "As such, the Under Secretary for Management\u2019s October 2016  assignment of responsibility for facilitating the assessment of these  investments to the Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management is not only in conflict with FITARA, but also in conflict with  guidance the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Management issued in  April 2015 in response to our prior recommendation to the department.  Specifically, in March 2015, we reported that there were overlapping  responsibilities and duplicative efforts between the Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management and the OCIO in the oversight and  management of IT investments on the Master Acquisition Oversight List.  We recommended in our 2015 report that DHS develop written guidance  to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management and OCIO for conducting oversight  of major acquisition programs.", "In response to our recommendation, in April 2015, the Acting Deputy  Under Secretary for Management issued guidance that clarified that the  CIO is responsible for performing the program assessments for the IT  investments on the Master Acquisition Oversight List, which then are to  be reported on the IT Dashboard. Accordingly, the Under Secretary for  Management\u2019s recent change suggests that the issue of overlapping  responsibilities and duplicative efforts between the Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management and the OCIO in the oversight and  management of certain IT investments that we raised 2 years ago has not  yet been adequately addressed within the department.", "Thus, rather than elevating the CIO\u2019s role per the goal of FITARA, the  recent change in DHS\u2019s evaluation of these IT investments is achieving  the opposite effect by reducing the CIO\u2019s role and creating a barrier for  this official to appropriately report investment risk ratings to the  Dashboard. According to EBMO officials, the department\u2019s goal is to use  one evaluation process that covers all major IT investments in order to  ensure consistency across all evaluations reported on the Dashboard.  However, as of December 2016, DHS officials did not know when the  department would begin using only one evaluation process for its major IT  investments, or who would be responsible for those reviews under that  single process.
