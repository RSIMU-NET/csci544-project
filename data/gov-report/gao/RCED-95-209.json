The need for such action arose from the increased use of motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATV), four-wheel drive vehicles, and other types of OHVs for recreation on federal lands. Sometimes, these vehicles damaged natural or cultural resources, or their use clashed with other forms of outdoor recreation, such as hiking, picnicking, and horseback riding. More than 20 years later, OHVs remain popular for recreation on federal lands, but concerns about the effects of their use persist.", "Responding to these concerns, you asked us to review the implementation of the executive orders on OHVs by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service. Because neither of these agencies maintains nationwide data on its OHV activities, we agreed with your office to review the OHV programs at eight locations with high OHV use\u2014four BLM resource areas and four Forest Service ranger districts. For these eight case-study locations, we obtained data on OHV program funding and staffing and examined the agencies\u2019 compliance with the executive orders\u2019 requirements that they (1) designate federal lands for OHV use, (2) monitor OHV use to identify adverse effects and any needed corrective actions and to determine compliance with regulations, and (3) address or correct adverse effects caused by OHV use. We also gathered some information at an additional location in Utah where a coalition of federal, state, and local interests has joined forces in managing a nationally recognized OHV trail.", "Appendix I more fully discusses our scope and methodology.

Executive Order 11644 was issued in February 1972 to establish policies and provide for procedures to control and direct the use of OHVs on federal lands so as to (1) protect the resources of those lands, (2) promote the safety of all users of those lands, and (3) minimize conflicts among the various uses of those lands. The order directs the agency heads responsible for managing the federal lands to issue regulations governing the designation of areas where OHVs may and may not be used. Under the order, OHV use can be restricted or prohibited to minimize (1) damage to the soil, watersheds, vegetation, or other resources of the federal lands; (2) harm to wildlife or wildlife habitats; and (3) conflicts between the use of OHVs and other types of recreation. The order closes wilderness and primitive areas to OHV use. It also requires the federal agencies to issue OHV use regulations, inform the public of the lands\u2019 designation for OHV use through signs and maps, enforce OHV use regulations, and monitor the effects of OHV use on the land.", "Executive Order 11989 was issued in May 1977 and contained three amendments to the previous order. While these amendments lifted restrictions on the use of military and emergency vehicles on public lands during emergencies, they otherwise strengthened protection of the lands by authorizing agency heads to (1) close areas or trails to OHVs causing considerable adverse effects and (2) designate lands as closed to OHVs unless the lands are specifically designated as open to them.", "Both BLM and the Forest Service have developed regulations in response to the executive orders. These regulations require the agencies to designate areas where OHVs may be used and to manage the use of OHVs on public lands through each agency\u2019s resource management planning process, which allows for public participation. The regulations also require the agencies to monitor the use of OHVs, identify any adverse effects of their use, and take appropriate steps to counteract such effects.", "Both BLM and the Forest Service follow the principles of multiple use and sustained yield in managing their lands. BLM transfers most of its authority and responsibility for day-to-day operations through its state and district offices to its over 140 resource area offices. The Forest Service manages its lands through staff assigned to its regions, forest supervisor offices (forests), and over 600 ranger districts. Both BLM and the Forest Service prepare comprehensive land and resource management plans for their public lands. BLM develops plans for its resource areas that describe the standards, guidelines, and goals for each use on the land\u2014including recreation. The section on recreation usually designates the areas within the resource area that are open, open with restrictions, or closed to OHV use. The Forest Service prepares plans for its forests that contain goals and objectives for using and protecting the resources within a forest\u2019s ranger districts. These plans provide for a mix of activities, including the use of OHVs.", "Both BLM and the Forest Service supplement their comprehensive management plans with more detailed activity plans describing the on-the-ground actions needed to implement the management plans. These activity plans generally identify specific areas or roads and trails as open, open with restrictions, or closed to OHVs; stipulate conditions for using OHVs; emphasize the use of OHVs in suitable areas; prescribe management actions; and prescribe monitoring for adverse effects.", "External and internal reviews have identified weaknesses in BLM\u2019s and the Forest Service\u2019s implementation of the executive orders on OHVs. In 1979, the Council on Environmental Quality concluded, in a report entitled Off-road Vehicles on Public Land, that both BLM and the Forest Service have been slow to address damage from OHVs to soils, vegetation, wildlife, and watershed resources. Similarly, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Inspector General, in a 1991 report on BLM\u2019s activities, and the Forest Service, in a 1986 review of its OHV program and in an ongoing review, disclosed various deficiencies, such as incomplete inventories of routes open and closed to OHV use, inadequate mapping and posting of OHV routes, untimely resolution of conflicts between OHV users and other users of the lands, and limited monitoring of the effects of OHV use on natural and cultural resources. According to the Forest Service, the current review is focusing on (1) the quality of its OHV trails\u2019 design, (2) the quality of its trails\u2019/areas\u2019 maintenance, (3) the direction of its forest plans, (4) its employees\u2019 knowledge and competency, and (5) the quality of its cooperation with the private sector and other government entities.

Four of the five states in which the eight case studies were located had state OHV programs that allocated funds through grants and other means to support OHV activities throughout the states, including those on federal lands. The states obtain most of their funds for the programs from OHV licensing fees and state gasoline taxes. Almost all of the remainder of the funding for OHV activities at the eight locations came from the federal government. Local communities and private organizations contributed funds at some locations and services and materials at all locations; the total value of these contributions, however, was not readily available.", "As table 1 indicates, the federal contribution ranged from a low of 12 percent at the Barstow Resource Area\u2014where California contributed over $700,000, or about 40 percent of the total estimated funding for the eight locations\u2014to a high of 100 percent at the Stateline Resource Area\u2014where Nevada provided no funds for the OHV program.

Historically, the Front has been one of the most popular recreation areas in Idaho. Serious conflicts have arisen between OHV use and efforts to prevent trespassing on private property, protect watersheds, and control erosion. In 1988, the Boise Front Coalition was formed to deal with these and other conflicts. The coalition, whose members include representatives of city, county, state, and federal agencies as well as private landowner and user groups, has organized volunteers to clean up litter, install hay bales and water bars to control erosion, place route signs, and maintain trails. This work has supplemented the efforts of BLM and of the state, which, between 1990 and 1993, contributed over $120,000 to reconstruct trails, enforce laws, and provide information and education for visitors. Currently, the Front\u2019s OHV roads and trails have signs, maps, information boards, and rest rooms and are patrolled by the county sheriff\u2019s department.

It was opened in 1988 and is managed by the Paiute ATV Trail Committee, a coalition of federal, state, and local interests under the Forest Service\u2019s leadership. Through 1993, the state of Utah had provided over $80,000 in OHV matching grant funds to post trail signs, relocate trails, and install bridges, sanitation stations, and erosion control measures.

The Forest Service\u2019s lands generally include more rugged, mountainous, and forested terrain, where OHV use is typically restricted to roads and trails. As table 2 indicates, about 39 percent of the lands in the four BLM resource areas were open to unrestricted cross-country use, while none of the lands in the four Forest Service ranger districts were open to such use. OHV use was restricted to existing or designated roads and trails on about 59 percent of the BLM lands and on about 53 percent of the Forest Service lands. The resource areas had closed about 2 percent of their lands to OHV use, while the ranger districts had closed about 47 percent of their lands.", "Lands designated as open (without restrictions) include areas where (1) OHVs have historically been used for recreation, (2) management and resource information gathered to date has not supported designation as closed or restricted, and/or (3) the land management planning process has indicated that further OHV use would not have significant adverse effects on natural or cultural resources.", "Lands on which OHV use is restricted to existing or designated roads and trails include natural or cultural resources that could be adversely affected by unrestricted cross-country OHV use.

For the most part, lands closed to OHV use in the four ranger districts we visited were located in watershed areas sensitive to erosion or in congressionally designated wilderness areas. For example, at the Salt Lake Ranger District in Utah, 64,000 acres were in four designated wilderness areas. At the time of our review, the four resource areas we visited had no designated wilderness areas, but they did have lands that had been studied and were being considered for possible designation as wilderness areas by the Congress. OHV use is generally allowed in such wilderness study areas so long as it does not impair an area\u2019s wilderness potential. However, we found that OHV use in some wilderness study areas was either prohibited or severely restricted. For example, in the San Rafael Resource Area in Utah, about 253,000 acres in seven wilderness study areas were being considered for possible designation as wilderness areas.

They have not completed inventories of their OHV areas, roads, and trails, and they have not finished preparing maps and posting signs to indicate where OHVs may or may not be used. Without such inventories, maps, and signs, neither the public nor the staff can be certain whether specific areas, roads, or trails are available for OHV use. For example, an OHV user on an existing but unmarked trail may inadvertently ride off of the trail, leaving new tracks. Later, other OHV users may follow the new tracks, incorrectly assuming that they represent an existing trail available for OHV use.
