The forensic section consists of forensic scientists \u2014 including document examiners and fingerprint specialists \u2014 who have completed extensive training and have been certified by a professional association within their field. Among other activities, examiners study handwriting, fingerprints, digital evidence, stamps, and seals; attempt to restore obliterated or altered documents; examine suspected counterfeit documents to identify forgeries or alterations; and process evidence submitted to the laboratory to develop latent fingerprints. In addition, examiners testify as expert witnesses in judicial proceedings and provide technical advice and assistance in developing major cases involving fraudulent documents.", "In general, FDL\u2019s intelligence section provides technical advice to domestic and foreign government officials on the authenticity of travel and identity documents and collaborates with these government officials to combat illegal immigration and international document fraud. The intelligence section operates during extended hours 7 days a week. Among their other activities, intelligence officers (1) conduct training programs on fraudulent document detection for immigration officers and other government officials; (2) produce document intelligence alerts, which are color photo bulletins that depict recently encountered fraudulent documents; (3) update and maintain FDL\u2019s library of document exemplars, and (4) provide information on a real-time basis to inquiries from INS field offices using the Image Retrieval Terminal (IRT) and Photophones. Photophones allow two users to simultaneously view an image and are used by FDL to respond to questions about suspect travel documents. They are based on a tele-imagery system that integrates a computer, video camera, printer, and a display monitor, each of which is connected to a telephone. Using the video camera, a user can capture a high-resolution image of a document, photograph, or fingerprint and transmit the image to any other photophone through a regular telephone line in approximately 20 seconds.", "The following steps are to occur in FDL\u2019s processing of forensic cases: (1) FDL receives the initial request for examination of evidence and enters preliminary information on the request (defined by FDL as a \u201ccase\u201d) into its Forensic Automated Case and Evidence Tracking System (FACETS) database; (2) depending on the type of case, FDL assigns the case to one or more specialists. A document case is assigned by country of origin of the evidence to the examiner with the greatest knowledge of that country; a case requiring fingerprint analysis is assigned to a fingerprint specialist; a case requiring intelligence analysis, such as producing photographic slides comparing a suspect document to an exemplar, is assigned to an intelligence officer for examination; (3) the examiner(s) analyze the evidence and prepare a report of findings; (4) the case findings undergo an administrative review by a supervisor and, in some cases, a technical review by a peer; and (5) when the case is complete, FDL closes the case in FACETS, packages the evidence, and returns it with a report on the case to the requester.  Figure 1 shows a comparison microscope, which forensic examiners use to compare microscopic elements of two documents side-by-side. Each microscope is connected to the computer monitor, allowing images of the two documents to be displayed for the examiner.", "Intelligence officers in FDL\u2019s intelligence section receive different types of requests for assistance. For the majority of their work, intelligence officers are asked to provide real-time responses to requests for information. These requests include Photophone and IRT inquiries, as well as requests for other assistance (e.g., requests to query other agencies\u2019 databases or check an exemplar in FDL\u2019s library). Intelligence officers may also be asked to respond to longer-term requests, such as developing training materials on document fraud detection. In these instances, the intelligence officer is to bring the request to the evidence technician and the request is to be logged into FACETS as an intelligence case. Finally, an intelligence officer may work collaboratively with a forensic examiner when a case involves both an intelligence and a forensic component (e.g., when a document is examined both for authenticity and to determine if it may be part of a document fraud scheme).

This may be a conservative estimate of the increase because, according to FDL officials, the number of cases pending at the beginning of fiscal year 1999 includes cases that were entered into FACETS during the first month of fiscal year 1999.

The officials said that cases completed before fiscal year 1999 that resulted in hearings during fiscal year 1999 were not entered into the FACETS database because the cases they pertained to were not in the database. Consequently, relative to fiscal year 1999, FDL experienced an even greater decline in testimony activity than is reflected in figure 3.

INS revised FDL\u2019s case priorities in July 1999 in an effort to ensure that criminal cases received priority attention from FDL examiners. In order of priority, FDL\u2019s four case categories are: (1) service custody cases, where individuals are being held in INS custody; (2) criminal cases, where the results of forensic examinations can be used as evidence in criminal investigations; (3) administrative cases (e.g., asylum cases) with a court deadline, such as a hearing scheduled before an immigration judge from EOIR; and (4) administrative cases without a court deadline. By priority category, table 4 shows the number and percent of cases FDL received and completed in fiscal years 2000 and 2001\u2014the 2 years for which FDL had complete data with similar case category definitions recorded by priority.", "Table 4 indicates that service custody and criminal cases each accounted for about one-fourth of the total number of cases received and completed by FDL in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Administrative cases with a court deadline represented the largest category of cases received and completed in both fiscal years. Administrative cases without a court deadline represented the smallest category of cases received and completed in both fiscal years. In general, the proportion of cases FDL completed in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 was similar to the proportion of cases FDL received by priority.", "Although we do not know what the case completion time would have been without the case priority system, FDL\u2019s data indicate that in fiscal year 2001, service custody cases took an average of 19 days to complete, 7 days longer than in fiscal year 2000. According to FDL officials, case completion time is calculated as the number of calendar days that have elapsed between a case being logged in and out of the FACETS database. Criminal cases took an average of 34 days to complete in fiscal year 2001, compared with 11 days in fiscal year 2000. As shown in figure 4, case completion time for administrative cases both with and without a court deadline increased by an even greater magnitude.", "In addition to the increase in the number of days FDL took to complete cases, there was an increase in the number and percent of cases that were overdue in fiscal year 2001 compared to fiscal year 2000. Overall, 64 percent of forensic cases were overdue in fiscal year 2001, compared with 26 percent in fiscal year 2000 (see table 5). FDL deems a case overdue if the actual number of days it took to complete a case exceeded FDL\u2019s benchmark, or internal deadline, for completing the case. The second column in table 5 shows the number of days FDL has set as a benchmark for determining whether a case is overdue in each priority category. According to FDL officials, FDL has used a 3-day deadline for service custody cases since 1980. For the remaining three case priority categories, the benchmarks were established in 1999 as reasonable internal deadlines given FDL\u2019s workload and case processing times.", "In general, FDL\u2019s benchmarks for completing cases have not been directly linked with the requester\u2019s need for a case to be completed by a given date. For example, FDL\u2019s benchmark for completing administrative cases with a court deadline is 90 days, even if the court date is more than 90 days away. According to FDL officials, they use a 90-day benchmark even if the court deadline exceeds the 90 days because it allows cases to be entered into FACETS in the order in which they are received in the laboratory. Administrative cases with a court deadline are to be completed in the order in which they are received. Considering that FDL took an average of 268 days\u2014about 3 times longer than its benchmark goal\u2014to complete these types of cases in fiscal year 2001 (see figure 4), the likelihood that it would be able to meet its internal deadline of 90 days was low.", "FDL missed its internal deadline of 3 days for its highest-priority category, service custody cases, by a greater proportion of days than for administrative cases with a court deadline. In fiscal years 2000 and 2001, respectively, FDL took an average of 12 days (or 4 times longer than its benchmark goal of 3 days) and 19 days (or more than 6 times longer than its benchmark goal), to complete its highest-priority cases (see figure 4 and table 5). Criminal cases fared better, with FDL generally completing these cases in less time than its benchmark goal of 30 days in fiscal year 2000 and slightly more than its benchmark goal in fiscal year 2001.

However, as a result of a January 2002 supplemental appropriation that will result in the addition of 17 FTE forensic examiners, FDL expected to eliminate its pending caseload by the end of fiscal year 2006.", "According to FDL officials, the number of cases that each forensic examiner completes varies depending on the number of documents to be reviewed, the complexity of the case, and the ancillary duties assigned to the examiner. In fiscal year 2001, FDL forensic examiners, which includes document examiners, contract examiners, and fingerprint specialists, each completed an average of 32 cases a month, out of an average monthly assignment of 44 cases (see table 7). This represents 74 percent of each examiner\u2019s average monthly caseload. From fiscal years 1999 to 2001, on average, FDL forensic examiners completed about three-fourths of their assigned cases each month.", "The estimates in table 7 take into account the amount of time a supervisor spent on case examination. According to FDL officials, the promotion of experienced journeyman examiners to supervisory positions has reduced the amount of time they spend on primary forensic examinations. FDL officials said that a section chief performs almost no casework and that supervisors spend approximately 30 percent of their time on casework and 70 percent of their time on management responsibilities. In fiscal years 2000 and 2001, FDL promoted five journeyman examiners to supervisor and one supervisor to chief. FDL officials said that they promoted examiners to supervisors to more closely approximate INS\u2019s standard for staff-to-supervisor ratio. The standard, contained in INS\u2019s Administrative Field Manual, states that INS managers and supervisors should make every effort to attain a ratio of eight employees to one supervisor. In fiscal year 1999, 17 forensic FTEs, including examiners and forensic support staff, reported to the chief of the forensic section. During fiscal year 2000, 14 forensic FTEs reported to three supervisors, creating a ratio of five employees to one supervisor. During fiscal year 2001, 17 forensic FTEs reported to 2 supervisors, a ratio of eight employees to one supervisor. However at the end of fiscal year 2001, with the promotion of a third supervisor, the ratio of employee to supervisor decreased to about five forensic FTEs to one supervisor.", "According to FDL officials, FDL\u2019s policies on case assignment and the use of contractors could affect case completion averages. Cases are assigned to examiners according to the country of origin of the evidence submitted and are examined in order of the priority of the case. Therefore, although some examiners have a larger workload than others, FDL officials believe that the specialized regional expertise that different forensic examiners have facilitates the timeliness and quality of their document examinations. Additionally, FDL utilizes contract document examiners to assist with case examinations, but limits them to processing lower priority casework (i.e., non-criminal cases) to minimize their need to travel to testify in judicial proceedings. According to FDL officials, contractors are able to complete more of their assigned cases, on average, than full-time FDL staff because lower priority cases are not subject to the same ASCLD requirements for documentation, and contractors, who frequently are required to testify, provide testimony telephonically.", "Although FDL plans to hire 31 additional staff, of which 17 are designated to be forensic examiners, the impact of new staff on FDL\u2019s ability to stay current with its forensic caseload will not be immediate. The majority of FDL\u2019s document examiners have masters degrees in forensic science. However, to comply with professional standards and to earn certification as a forensic document examiner, inexperienced graduates of master\u2019s programs are required to undergo a 30-month training program during which they are not allowed to independently examine cases. During the apprenticeship period, new hires receive close supervision and assistance from experienced journeyman examiners. According to the FDL training director, any time savings in case completions that may result from trainees assisting experienced examiners is offset by the amount of time that the examiners spend supervising and mentoring trainees. FDL officials said that newly hired forensic examiners who have completed equivalent training in another laboratory typically do not have to complete FDL\u2019s training program, but there are very few experienced examiners who are expected to be available for hire.", "FDL officials expect that their workload of forensic and intelligence cases will increase. They believe that the following factors, among others, will contribute to the increased workload: (1) INS\u2019s officer workforce has grown rapidly, and as these officers gain more experience recognizing potential document fraud, they will form an increasingly large customer base for FDL\u2019s services; (2) legislative changes have expanded INS\u2019s law enforcement authority and investigative tools, increasing the potential for FDL to be involved in both more and more complex forensic cases; and (3) a greater emphasis on identifying terrorists due to the attacks on September 11, 2001. FDL anticipates that its service custody and criminal cases will grow commensurate with the national effort to crack down on terrorism and that the number of administrative cases will rise due to expected increases in the prevalence of document fraud and awareness of the link between document fraud and terrorism. FDL officials said that the September 11 attacks have already resulted in an increase in forensic and intelligence cases from the Middle East.", "Although FDL anticipates that its workload will increase, its capacity to handle the increased workload will also increase. The addition of 17 full- time equivalent forensic positions will double FDL\u2019s fiscal year 2001 level of about 17 forensic FTE positions. However, it will take time for FDL to recruit, hire, and fully train the new forensic staff. In addition, to maintain FDL\u2019s targeted ratio of supervisors to examiners, FDL will likely need additional supervisors. This means that some forensic examiners will assume managerial duties and spend less time examining documents. Therefore, while the addition of new staff should help FDL address its growing pending caseload, FDL\u2019s capacity to increase its workload will not necessarily be commensurate with the increase in staffing. The extent to which FDL\u2019s staffing and funding increase will result in improvements in response time to requesters and reductions in the number of pending cases remain to be seen. According to FDL officials, FDL\u2019s pending caseload should be eliminated by the end of fiscal year 2006.

In preparation for review by ASCLD inspectors, FDL stated that it was processing cases in accordance with ASCLD standards by September 2000. FDL received accreditation in the areas of questioned documents and latent prints in February 2001. To comply with the accreditation requirements, FDL was required to carry out some additional steps in processing cases. Specifically, FDL was required to (1) conduct reviews of case reports and case notes for criminal cases, (2) conduct proficiency testing of its forensic examiner staff, (3) file an annual accreditation review report, (4) submit to external proficiency testing by test providers, (5) conduct technical reviews of a minimum of 5 percent of all forensic cases for technical accuracy and completeness, (6) conduct 100 percent administrative review of all cases, (7) conduct an annual quality audit, (8) conduct bi-annual safety inspections, and (9) conduct an annual review of quality systems.", "ASCLD and FDL officials said that ASCLD\u2019s formal documentation and peer review standards tend to increase case processing time. At FDL, the impact has been greatest on criminal cases, where officials estimated that the increased documentation and peer review requirements have increased the amount of time spent on criminal cases by an average of 20 minutes per case. According to FDL officials, this increase in the amount of time needed to process criminal (and to a lesser extent, custody) cases has, in turn, slowed the processing of other types of cases. This notwithstanding, FDL officials believe that changes made because of the accreditation requirements have improved the quality of their forensic reports, enhanced the laboratory\u2019s credibility in court settings, and improved their stature in the criminal justice community. According to INS district counsels, while FDL continues to produce high quality examinations and testimonies, FDL\u2019s reports have recently become more standardized and easier to understand, thus increasing their influence in court proceedings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations Impede FDL\u2019s Ability to Better Manage Its Workload", "paragraphs": ["FDL\u2019s database, FACETS, does not contain sufficient data for managers to know the exact size and status of FDL\u2019s pending workload at a prior point in time, how much time is spent on each forensic case by priority category, and how best to assign staff to improve case processing time.", "FACETS is a 4-year old database that uses Lotus Notes software to track cases and pieces of evidence through the case examination process at FDL. According to FDL officials, FACETS was not designed as a case management analytical tool. They said that FACETS is used to record information on (1) the evidence submitted to or transferred between FDL staff; (2) FDL activities, such as administrative activities, IRT and Photophone inquiries, photography production, and training; (3) laboratory reports; (4) case information, such as case definition and hours spent working on a case; (5) testimony provided; and (6) intelligence alerts produced.", "Better data could help FDL managers make fact-based decisions about deadlines for forensic cases. Rather than setting the same deadline for every case within a priority category, an effective case management system would enable managers to monitor when case results are needed by requesters and assign cases in a way that would increase the likelihood of responding to the requesters in a timely fashion. FDL\u2019s current practice of setting 3-, 30-, 90-, and 90-day deadlines for priority one through four cases, respectively, frequently does not reflect the requester\u2019s external deadlines for case completion. For priority 3 cases with external deadlines, the largest category of cases which FDL receives, adhering to a 90-day case completion standard when the requester may not need the results within 90 days has the effect of making FDL\u2019s performance appear worse than it may be in reality. Also, for priority 3 cases, FDL does not currently record data in FACETS on the requester\u2019s external deadline, unless the deadline is sooner than 90 days. Collecting and analyzing such data could assist FDL management in forming a more realistic match between FDL\u2019s internal and external deadlines and better ensure that cases are processed in the order that would meet requesters\u2019 needs.", "Better data could also help FDL managers make fact-based decisions about staffing and budgetary resource needs. Specifically, FDL collects limited information on the amount of time examiners take to process cases. Examiners record in FACETS the number of hours spent on direct case examination, including the amount of time it takes to conduct a technical review of a case. According to FDL, in fiscal year 2001, direct case examination time averaged 2.3 hours per document case. However, according to FDL officials, staff do not regularly record the amount of time spent on the following case processing steps: (1) time evidence technicians or other administrators spend processing a case, (2) time supervisors spend conducting administrative reviews of cases, and (3) time examiners spend in indirect case processing, for example, preparing for a testimony on a particular case or consulting with intelligence officers about a recently encountered fraudulent document. Furthermore, intelligence cases are sometimes recorded in FACETS as administrative cases without a court deadline. This mixing of intelligence and forensic cases makes it more difficult for managers to determine how long forensic cases actually take to process and how many are overdue. Absent a complete accounting of the amount of time it takes staff to process a forensic case, FDL managers are limited in the staffing projections that they make. Collecting data on total staff time spent on cases would assist FDL managers to better determine how many cases examiners can be expected to complete, how to possibly improve staff efficiency in case processing, and how long it would take and with how many additional staff, to reduce or eliminate FDL\u2019s pending caseload.", "According to FDL officials, the FACETS database is not an effective tool to help it manage staff time, justify budget requests, or set case completion goals. The officials also said that FACETS is a 4-year old system that uses outdated algorithms and has limited search capabilities, thereby limiting FDL\u2019s ability to identify patterns within its caseload statistics and produce intelligence reports. FDL officials would like to replace FACETS with an Oracle-based system that possesses advanced statistical algorithms and multivariable searching capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the federal government\u2019s only forensic laboratory dedicated almost exclusively to the examination of fraudulent documents, FDL\u2019s staff performs valuable work and provides an important service to INS and other domestic and international agencies.
