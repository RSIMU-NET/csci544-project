These inconsistencies are due in part to shortfalls in agency processes for tracking technology transition. Nevertheless, GAO's analysis of 10 selected programs identified four factors that contributed to transition success, the most important being military or commercial demand for the planned technology and linkage to a research area where DARPA has sustained interest. Both of these factors were generally evident at the time a program started, while the other two factors were observed later, once the program was underway. The figure below highlights the four factors.", "DARPA's implementation of DOD programs intended to foster technology transition has been limited and neither DOD nor DARPA have defined policies for managing transition activities. DARPA has also largely elected not to participate in DOD technology transition programs, with the exception of federally mandated small business programs, citing challenges in meeting program requirements within DARPA's typical three- to five-year timeframe for executing its research initiatives. Instead, DARPA primarily focuses its time and resources on creating radically innovative technologies that support DOD's warfighting mission and relegates technology transition to a secondary priority. DARPA leadership defers to its program managers to foster technology transition, but provides limited related training. Moreover, while its leadership conducts oversight of program managers' activities through periodic program reviews, these reviews do not regularly assess technology transition strategies. GAO has found that this approach does not consistently position programs for transition success. Further, while DARPA disseminates information on its past programs within DOD, to the public, and among private companies, it does not take full advantage of government-sponsored resources for sharing technical data, which may obscure visibility into its programs and lead to missed transition opportunities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DARPA should regularly assess technology transition strategies, refine training requirements, and increase dissemination of technical data for completed programs.

This approach shapes how the  agency defines, pursues, and tracks technology transition. DARPA  considers a successful transition to be one where its program, or a  portion of its program, influences or introduces new knowledge. This  knowledge is often passed through program performers, which DARPA  relies on to execute technology development in its programs. Typical  performers include commercial enterprises; other DOD entities, such as  military service laboratories and research agencies; and academic  institutions. Further, DARPA generally does not develop technologies to  full maturity. Instead, the agency focuses on demonstrating the feasibility  of new technologies, which includes verifying that the concepts behind  the technologies have potential for real life applications. As a result, most  DARPA technologies require additional development before they are  ready for operational or commercial use. Therefore, follow-on  development is the predominant path of technology transition at DARPA.  Table 2 highlights the different technology transition paths that DARPA  technologies can take.", "DARPA\u2019s definition of what constitutes technology transition reflects one  of many in use within DOD. In June 2005, the Office of the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts in  collaboration with the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) published  guidance defining technology transition as \u201cthe use of technology in  military systems to create effective weapons and support systems\u2014in the  quantity and quality needed by the warfighter to carry out assigned  missions at the \u2018best value\u2019 as measured by the warfighter.\u201d However,  DOD officials told us the 2005 guidance is outdated, does not constitute  department policy, and should only be considered as a useful reference  source.

The communities we identified in 2013  are similar to the transition outcomes listed in the 2005 guidance, which  broadly lists commercialization, acquisition program, and follow-on  development by the prime contractor as primary pathways of technology  transition. In a subsequent report in December 2013, we found further  differences among what the military services define as technology  transition and additional confirmation that DOD itself lacks a formal  definition for technology transition across the department. These  variations, in tandem with the absence of a standard DOD-wide definition  of technology transition, prevents the military services, DOD research  agencies, and other DOD entities from consistently defining and tracking  technology transition.

However, in the  other two cases, an immediate military need for the technology was not  as prevalent. A fifth program that transitioned, Advanced Wireless  Networks for Soldier (AWNS), initially was in demand by the Army, but  interest waned over time as other options for radio networking platforms  emerged. In addition, several programs developed technologies that  demonstrated military applicability but lacked a military or commercial  demand, which precluded successful transition.

These agreements allowed DARPA to share  development, management, and funding responsibilities with its service  partners, which facilitated shared understanding of technical goals and  mutual commitments to the program\u2019s success and transition. Equally  important to this factor though was the degree to which a program  achieved its stated technical goals.

QNT was initiated with support  from the Air Force and Navy, which helped DARPA craft clear technical  goals including size, weight, robustness, transmission rates, and other  performance attributes of the technology. Defining technical goals during  the early stages of the program also secured each organization\u2019s  commitment to playing a role in managing, developing, funding,  demonstrating, and testing QNT. As a result, stakeholders then worked  together to test QNT technical performance at several military exercises  and in theater, where the system performed to expectations and gained  added exposure within DOD.

Despite this  resistance, DARPA proceeded with the development of stealth  technologies, and today they are in use on multiple DOD weapon  systems, including the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.", "DARPA\u2019s secondary emphasis on transition is a long-standing  characteristic of the agency\u2019s culture, as evidenced in studies  commissioned by DARPA in 1985 and 2001, which found that the agency  does not place enough emphasis on technology transition. The 1985  report recommended that DARPA designate full-time technology  transition facilitators, due to problems that were identified in the transition  of technologies to the military services. The 2001 report recommended  matching program manager tenure to the expected length of the  programs to which they are assigned\u2014rather than setting arbitrary dates  of departure\u2014and defining additional training and incentives for  technology transition.", "According to DARPA officials, the Director, DARPA, has undertaken  several initiatives to improve the agency\u2019s emphasis on technology  transition, including transition-focused quarterly meetings with each of the  military service chiefs or their deputies and establishment of the Adaptive  Execution Office in 2013, which was chartered to accelerate the transition  of game-changing DARPA technologies into DOD capabilities. In addition,  DARPA officials stated that the Director has shifted the role of the  agency\u2019s military service liaisons to focus exclusively on assisting  program managers with military service engagement and transition of  DARPA technologies.

According to  DARPA officials, the scope of these reviews is reflective of and consistent  with the agency\u2019s top priority of creating innovative technologies.  However, these reviews do not assess a program\u2019s strategy for achieving  technology transition. DARPA leadership delegates oversight and review  of technology transition strategies to the agency\u2019s Adaptive Execution  Office, which coordinates with program managers to review and provide  input on technology transition strategies, particularly in the latter stages of  programs.", "DOD policy, however, assigns to the Director, DARPA, the responsibility  to pursue \u201cstrategies\u201d that \u201cincrease the impact of DARPA\u2019s research and  development programs\u201d and \u201cspeed the transition of successful research  and development programs to the military departments and defense  agencies,\u201d among other scientific and technical functions.  Consequently, by not assessing technology transition strategies at the  program milestone reviews it chairs, the Director, DARPA, is forgoing key  opportunities to perform this function.

In previous years, different components within the  Office of the Secretary of Defense have issued nonmandatory guidance  on technology transition, which has, at times, applied to DARPA  programs. However, the guidance is now outmoded in that it does not  address changes in key science, technology, and acquisition processes  that have occurred during the last 10 years. The Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which has primary  oversight of DARPA and other DOD research agencies, provides a great  deal of latitude to these agencies to define their own technology transition  policies and procedures. Most notably, officials from this office stated to  us that technology transition is no longer an explicit function of the office  and that the DOD division formerly responsible for technology transition  no longer exists. Instead, the office now limits its technology policy  responsibilities to minimizing unnecessary duplication of research efforts  within DOD, disseminating research knowledge throughout DOD, and  sharing that information with the general public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Training for Managers Does Not Consistently Position Programs for Transition Success", "paragraphs": ["DARPA\u2019s program managers receive limited training on how to effect  technology transition in their programs.

DARPA program managers are not subject to the formal training and  certification requirements applicable to permanently hired science and  technology managers at military service laboratories. DOD requires  managers in these laboratories to complete Defense Acquisition  University (DAU) training courses in science and technology, including  how they apply to technology transition. These courses lead to  progressively higher knowledge and certifications over their careers.  DARPA officials countered that the training necessary to complete these  courses and achieve science and technology manager certifications  would require DARPA program managers to devote an inordinate amount  of time to training, particularly if DAU requires DARPA staff to complete  all the typical prerequisite courses that other managers are required to  complete. Further, given the agency\u2019s unique mission, DARPA officials  stated that they do not consider the DAU training courses to be as  relevant to their program managers given the agency\u2019s broad discretion to  pursue breakthrough technologies versus specific management of  acquisition programs.", "In lieu of more robust training, DARPA officials stated that the agency  supports its program managers\u2019 transition efforts by providing them with  access to various transition planning and outreach resources. For  example, DARPA program managers are also supported by the agency\u2019s  Adaptive Execution Office, which provides them with assistance in  developing their transition plans and in communicating with the military\u2019s  transition stakeholders at DOD\u2019s combatant commands. Program  managers are further supported by DARPA\u2019s military liaison officers from  the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, who help program  managers identify and reach out to potential transition partners or other  stakeholders in the military services. These liaisons also arrange for  DARPA leadership to meet with the military\u2019s senior leaders, which is  done in part to advocate for the transition of DARPA programs to the  military services. As we found in September 2006, these liaisons can also  provide operational advice for planning and strategy development and  provide an understanding of service perspectives, issues, and needs so  that potential customers can be identified and effective agreements can  be written. Program managers also are authorized to use program funds  to hire experienced contractors and government staff from other agencies  to aid technology transition activities in their programs.", "Previous guidance and studies, including one commissioned by DARPA  in 2001, have recommended that DARPA improve its technology  transition training for program managers through additional training and  mentoring programs related to technology transition. Further, in 2005,  DOD issued guidance on technology transition stating that developing  and executing a training plan for the members of the team supporting  technology transition is essential to their success. Similarly, Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government indicates that effective  management of an organization\u2019s workforce, which includes providing  necessary training to the organization\u2019s staff, is essential to achieving  results. DARPA\u2019s limited training for program managers on technology  transition is inadequate to consistently position programs for transition  success. Without sufficient training, program managers may not develop  the skills and knowledge that they need to identify and engage potential  transition partners and facilitate transition successes.", "While DARPA does not currently rely on other DOD entities for  technology transition training, individual DARPA program managers may  voluntarily elect to take training related to technology transition in DOD or  other federal organizations. For example, the Federal Laboratory  Consortium for Technology Transfer was established by law in the  Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 to, among other things, (1)  develop training for federal lab employees engaged in technology transfer  and (2) facilitate communication and cooperation between federal  laboratories. The Consortium offers both in-person and online training  regarding commercialization of technologies, as well as guidance  regarding best practices.

These websites allow their users to  search for related technologies while considering new programs or  products that could possibly use them.", "While DARPA disseminates information on past programs through the  use of public government websites, its selective approach to posting this  information does not maximize the chances of DARPA technologies being  identified and selected by potential transition partners. Currently, DARPA  disseminates information on past programs through both internal and  external means, but does not share information with key data repositories  that the federal government sponsors, which may obscure visibility into its  programs and lead to missed transition opportunities. Since the 1960s,  DARPA has provided substantial amounts of information regarding its  technologies to the official DOD dissemination website managed by the  Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Although the majority of  DARPA-related information in this database is restricted to DOD staff, it is  by far the largest repository that private companies and the general public  can access for information on DARPA technologies. For instance, we  found that while non-DOD users can access approximately 3,600 DARPA  technical records through DTIC\u2019s public website, DOD users can access  over 30,000 of these records. DARPA also maintains an \u201cOpen Catalog\u201d  public website for disseminating information on its programs, although it  currently only has technical information on about a few dozen active and  completed programs. In comparison, DARPA\u2019s public website also  provides brief, non-technical descriptions of 194 active DARPA programs.  Two other government-sponsored websites, operated by the DOD  TechLink public-private partnership and the Federal Laboratory  Consortium for Technology Transfer, also exist to help science and  technology agencies disseminate technology information.

In February 2013, the  White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy instructed the  federal government\u2019s science and technology community to begin  planning how to disseminate information on technologies they have  developed.

The general  purpose of these programs is to facilitate the transition of technologies,  but vary in terms of what types of technology developers and operational  needs they target. For example, in partnership with the military services,  the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration program addresses joint  warfighting needs of the combatant commands by demonstrating mature  technology prototypes that may transition to acquisition programs or  directly to the warfighter in the field. Other programs such as the Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program fund small business  research and development with the goal that innovations produced will be  commercialized and eventually sold back to DOD. Table 5 lists these  programs.", "According to DARPA officials, the only programs that DARPA participates  in are the SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)  programs because it is legally required to do so. However, the agency\u2019s  knowledge of transition outcomes associated with SBIR and STTR  expenditures is limited. DARPA officials said they do not maintain a  comprehensive list of agency programs using SBIR or STTR funds\u2014or  the transition paths of technologies developed with these funds\u2014because  these data are not always reported or accessible. According to DOD  small business program management officials, who oversee the use of  these funds throughout the department, transition outcome data is not  required from any military service or agency, including DARPA. These  officials further stated that once a small business contract ends, DOD\u2019s  means for compelling contractors to identify and report on successful  transitions expires. In December 2013, we recommended that DOD  improve its tracking of technology transition outcomes in SBIR-funded  programs by establishing a common definition of technology transition for  all SBIR projects and improving the completeness, quality, and reliability  of SBIR transition data that it reports. These tracking shortfalls  precluded us from assessing the extent to which DARPA\u2019s SBIR and  STTR funds contribute to successful technology transitions. In lieu of  comprehensive transition data, DARPA officials have worked with some  of their prior program contractors\u2014who successfully developed and  transitioned technologies\u2014to identify small business program success  stories. In addition, DARPA officials stated that they are developing  contract language for future SBIR awards that would require firms to  identify their transition and commercialization outcomes as an addendum  to their final report.", "Apart from the legally required small business programs, DARPA officials  said that the processes and reporting requirements associated with  participating in DOD\u2019s other technology transition programs are generally  cumbersome and do not align with DARPA\u2019s time frames for executing  programs or mission of creating disruptive technologies over relatively  long periods of time. Conversely, DOD transition programs are mainly  intended for mature technologies, or short-term efforts that can be fielded  quickly. DARPA officials explained that technologies their programs  develop usually require additional maturation in subsequent technology  development efforts, either within DARPA or at military service  laboratories, before transitioning to acquisition programs or warfighters.  DARPA officials also said that agency leadership generally views the use  of these funds as unnecessary given that DARPA\u2019s budget currently  provides adequate funding to support its research endeavors.", "DARPA officials also indicated that they are exploring stronger  relationships with the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)  program, particularly in the area of prototyping. In previous decades,  DARPA used funds from the predecessor to the JCTD program\u2014then  known as the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration program\u2014to  develop and demonstrate technologies. These efforts include currently  fielded systems such as the Air Force\u2019s Global Hawk and Predator  unmanned aircraft and Miniature Air-Launched Decoy systems.

When DARPA places technology in the hands of a user,  operational knowledge is gained that can be used to improve the  technology and further scientific innovation. However, DARPA leadership  does not fully subscribe to this viewpoint; instead, it is satisfied with  maturing technology to the point where feasibility, but not functionality, is  proven. Today, programs progress through DARPA without the agency  head fully assessing whether transition strategies make sense. Such  assessments, if measured against key transition factors, could improve a  program\u2019s potential for transition success. Transition responsibilities then  fall almost exclusively on individual program managers, who are often not  sufficiently trained to achieve the favorable transition outcomes they seek.  Further, when the program manager\u2019s tenure expires, the primary  advocate for transitioning the program\u2019s technology is also lost. This  turnover increases the need for technical gains to be appropriately  documented and disseminated so that user communities have visibility  into potential solutions available to meet their emerging needs.

In doing so, DOD agreed with most of the principles contained  in our recommendations, but disagreed with the actions we  recommended. DOD did not agree with our recommendation to increase  the dissemination of technical data on completed DARPA programs. DOD  also separately provided technical comments, which we incorporated, as  appropriate.", "DOD agreed that assessments of technology transition strategies, which  consider the four factors we identified for transition success, would help  inform program decisions by DARPA leadership. However, DOD did not  agree that such assessments be required at milestone reviews for  DARPA programs, citing active participation by the Director, DARPA, in  technology transition discussions throughout the life of a program. We  agree that leadership is focused on technology transition and holds  discussions often; however, we found it difficult to be able to identify  transitions\u2014or changes to transition strategies\u2014that arise from these  discussions. We believe that these discussions are an inadequate  substitute for assessing technology transition strategies as part of the  comprehensive program reviews that DARPA already undertakes.  Assessing transition strategies at these reviews, as we recommended,  would provide the opportunity to coordinate and prioritize transition goals,  objectives, and planned actions in the context of scientific and technical  developments in the program. By overseeing technology transition  strategies separate from these reviews, the Director, DARPA, risks  making decisions related to a program\u2019s transition that are not  appropriately informed by other important program considerations.

Consequently, DOD did not agree  that technology transition training requirements should be increased for  DARPA program managers and stated that DARPA\u2019s current approach of  \u201ctailored curricula focused on a program\u2019s unique transition needs\u201d  remained appropriate. However, we did not find evidence of such tailored  curricula in our review. Instead, we found that DARPA program managers  all received the same limited training upon hiring, which was inadequate  to consistently position programs for transition success. DOD also stated  that DARPA continues to explore opportunities to offer tailored, concise,  and streamlined training to its program managers. Therefore, we stand by  our recommendation and continue to believe that expanded training  opportunities are necessary for achieving better transition outcomes in  DARPA programs, and we encourage DOD to capitalize on its existing  investments in this area, to the extent possible.", "Further, DOD did not agree that increased dissemination of technical data  on completed DARPA programs was warranted. DOD stated that using  multiple information repositories \u201cthins the DOD technology market by  spreading it across several venues,\u201d in turn reducing the likelihood that  technology providers and potential transition partners will find a match.  DOD also stated that it intends to make DTIC the central data storage for  all DOD technical activities, including DARPA technologies, and views the  use of multiple information repositories as unconducive to improving  technology transition outcomes. In our review, we found DARPA\u2019s  existing reliance on DTIC limited the chances of the agency\u2019s  technologies being identified and selected by potential transition partners,  particularly those outside of DOD. We fail to see how increased  dissemination of technical data would actually \u201cthin\u201d the DOD technology  market.  To the contrary, it would allow more portals with which to gain  access.  Similarly, in 2013, the White House identified a government-wide  need to broaden access to non-sensitive information on government- developed technologies, but improvements remain incomplete.

We confined our analysis to this  time frame owing to availability of data from DARPA. These data included  150 programs funded under DOD\u2019s budget activities for (1) applied  research and (2) advanced technology development that DARPA  identified as having completed as planned and producing a substantive  technological gain or innovation, regardless of whether that technology or  innovation transitioned to an end user.

In conducting our case study  analyses, we reviewed relevant program documentation to identify factors  that facilitate transition success. While reviewing these case study  programs, we identified inconsistencies between agency portfolio-level  transition outcome data and program-level information. DARPA officials  stated to us that this was due to the transition status of these programs  changing after they had collected the portfolio-level data.
