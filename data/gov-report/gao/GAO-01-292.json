Although the developer owned both parcels, the Park Service also had an interest in them. On one parcel\u2014referred to as the Alexandria parcel\u2014the Park Service held a commitment from the developer to build an interchange on the Parkway; on the other parcel\u2014 referred to as the Arlington parcel\u2014it held a development restriction known as an indenture. In the exchange, the Park Service allowed the developer to buy out its interchange commitment, lifted the indenture on the Arlington parcel, and acquired specific development restrictions on both parcels to protect the Parkway\u2019s scenic qualities.", "To estimate the fair market values of the interests being exchanged, the developer contracted with a private appraisal firm to prepare two appraisals (one for each parcel), which the Park Service reviewed and approved as conforming to federal appraisal standards. The appraisals reported that on balance the Park Service owed the developer $14 million. This represented the difference between the estimated value of potential development opportunities the developer gave up under the Park Service\u2019s restrictions (totaling $29 million) and the estimated values of the indenture and interchange (totaling $15 million) given up by the Park Service. The developer waived the difference of $14 million.", "Aware of Potomac Yard\u2019s significant development potential, you expressed concern about the appraisals and whether the Park Service had received appropriate value in the exchange.

Shortly after we began our work, we learned that lawyers representing the Park Service and the developer had advised them not to meet with us because of a pending lawsuit filed by a competing developer protesting the exchange. However, the Park Service did give us a tour of the parcels and copies of documents in the official administrative record filed in the lawsuit. The developer initiated a meeting with us in October, after certain documents pertaining to the lawsuit had been filed.

In 1938, the Department of the Interior and the developer agreed to exchange interests in several Potomac Yard parcels that both parties claimed to own, including the Arlington parcel. As part of this agreement, the developer retained title to the Arlington parcel while Interior obtained a legal restriction\u2014referred to as an indenture\u2014that prohibited the developer from using the parcel for any purpose other than a rail yard.", "In 1970, Interior\u2019s Park Service and the developer agreed to exchange interests in land adjacent to the Parkway, including the Alexandria parcel. As part of this agreement, the Park Service gave the developer the right to access the Alexandria parcel from the Parkway; without this access right, the parcel\u2019s potential development would have been limited by the access provided by existing roads. In return, the developer gave the Park Service a commitment to build an interchange\u2014bridge, ramps, and connections\u2014 on the Parkway that would provide this access.", "Since then, the developer has proposed several redevelopment options for Potomac Yard, which have at times been contentious. For example, in 1987 the developer filed a development plan for the Alexandria parcel consisting of about 2.5 million square feet (mmsf) of commercial development\u2014office and retail space. When the city did not approve the plan, the developer filed a lawsuit and in 1991 obtained a court order directing the Alexandria City Council to approve the plan (with slight modification).", "In 1992, the city created its own plan for Potomac Yard, specifying residential development as the Alexandria parcel\u2019s sole use. Over the next few years, the developer discussed options with Alexandria and others and did not proceed with the court-ordered development. In 1997, the Park Service and the developer informally agreed to the general framework of the Potomac Yard exchange\u2014that is, they agreed to the interests that would be exchanged but not the values of those interests\u2014and at about the same time, the city and the developer agreed to a predominantly residential development on the Alexandria parcel. After these agreements were reached, the developer asked the court to vacate the 1991 order, stating that it preferred the development allowed by the city to that allowed under the order.

The standards require that land (or land interests) acquired by the federal government be appraised at fair market value. According to the standards, fair market value is defined as the amount for which a property would be sold\u2014for cash or its equivalent\u2014 by a willing and knowledgeable seller with no obligation to sell, to a willing and knowledgeable buyer with no obligation to buy. Determining the fair market value requires an appraiser to first identify the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use,\u201d which is defined as the use that is physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible, and maximally profitable for the owner.", "When the federal government acquires a partial or restrictive land interest\u2014such as an indenture or building restrictions\u2014federal appraisal standards show preference for using a \u201cbefore and after\u201d method to value the interest. In this method, an appraiser estimates the value of the whole property before the transaction and reduces it by the value of the property remaining in private ownership after the transaction is completed. The resulting value becomes the interest\u2019s estimated fair market value.", "The standards explicitly allow for the application of professional judgment in the development of a fair market value estimate. According to the standards: \u201cThe appraiser should not hesitate to acknowledge that appraising is not an exact science and that reasonable men may differ somewhat in arriving at an estimate of the fair market value.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office reiterated this assessment in a 1998 study, calling real estate appraisals \u201ca mix of science and art.\u201d", "The Park Service has policies and procedures for land exchanges that include obtaining appraisals to value all federal and nonfederal land involved in an exchange.

Our analysis of the appraisals indicates that the developer could have owed the Park Service more than $15 million rather than the Park Service owing the developer $14 million, as summarized in appendix II. For the Alexandria parcel, the appraiser was instructed to assume a high level of commercial development in assessing the impact of the development restriction imposed by the Park Service; as a result, the appraiser determined that the developer would incur a loss of $26.6 million. In addition, the appraiser was instructed to use a cost of $8.5 million for the interchange\u2014a figure agreed to by the Park Service and the developer\u2014rather than appraise it. Because this appraisal assumed a level of development that was not shown to be reasonably probable, our review appraiser determined that it did not conform to federal appraisal standards. For the Arlington parcel, the appraiser did not consider all of the additional costs the developer would have faced, had the indenture stayed in place, or the additional development opportunities that would have resulted from the indenture\u2019s removal. As a result, he undervalued the indenture at $6.5 million; however, the appraisal did not provide enough information for us to reliably estimate the indenture\u2019s value. Furthermore, the appraiser determined that the restrictions would have caused a $2.4 million loss to the developer, even though zoning ordinances already restricted development.

The instructions also provided the appraiser specific levels of development to use in this calculation: the directed high level of development was 1.5 mmsf of office space, 25,000 square feet of retail space, and 232 townhomes; the directed low level of development was no office space, 10,000 square feet of retail space, and 200 townhomes.", "According to federal appraisal standards, an appraiser must develop an opinion of the best use for the property being appraised in each scenario. Furthermore, in determining fair market value, appraisers must show that the \u201cbefore and after\u201d scenarios are legally permissible and reasonably probable. In other words, there must be good reason to assume that the development could be built under current restrictions (such as zoning) or a high probability that the restrictions would be changed. For the Alexandria parcel, the instructions directed the appraiser to assume a high level of development in the \u201cbefore\u201d scenario, stating: \u201cDevelopment scenarios presented must be assumed by the appraiser to be physically feasible and legally permitted.\u201d However, as the developer stated in a letter to the Park Service prior to issuance of the instructions, this high level of development \u201cis not . . . in compliance with existing zoning regulations, and is not currently \u2018legally permissible.\u2019\u201d The developer further noted that during the course of negotiations with the Park Service, the developer \u201cmade certain\u201d of this by asking the court in 1997 to vacate the order directing the city to approve about 2.5 mmsf of development.", "Nevertheless, both the Park Service and the developer believed that the assumed high level of commercial development was appropriate. The Park Service, in a March 2000 letter responding to questions from the Chairman of the House Committee on Resources, wrote that the developer\u2019s right to access the parcel from the Parkway provided a sound basis for the assumption that the parcel could physically support intensive development. In addition, the Park Service noted that the assumed high level of development (about 1.5 mmsf) represented a significant reduction from the court-ordered level (about 2.5 mmsf) and must be considered as a viable alternative, even though the court order was no longer in effect. The Park Service further noted that the potential availability of commuter rail facilities to serve the parcel supported the conclusion that a high-density development was the highest and best use. Similarly, the developer told us that the assumed high level of development was reasonable because it was less development than had been specified under the court order. The developer indicated that both parties to the exchange stipulated the assumed high development level as one of the primary principles of the exchange framework.", "Following the instructions to use the assumed development levels, the appraiser did not evaluate whether the current zoning restrictions, which allow only residential development, might be altered to allow the \u201cbefore\u201d scenario\u2019s high level of commercial development. The appraiser determined that the value of the Park Service\u2019s restriction on the parcel\u2019s development resulted in a loss of $26.6 million to the developer, which is the difference in the value of the \u201cbefore\u201d development ($31.7 million) and the \u201cafter\u201d development ($5.1 million). However, our review appraiser found that the appraisal did not show that the \u201cbefore\u201d development had a reasonable probability of being built and concluded that the market would not pay a premium for the possible increment if the probability of rezoning were low. If the restriction did not diminish the development that would have reasonably occurred on the parcel, it would have no market value and the Park Service should not have given the developer any credit for it.", "The Park Service also obtained a no-development restriction on a 15-acre portion of the parcel adjacent to the Parkway. The appraiser determined\u2014 and our review appraiser agreed\u2014that the restriction had no market value because a prior restriction under Virginia state law already precluded construction on the 15 acres. Therefore, the building restriction had no material impact on the developer.", "The Park Service\u2019s chief appraiser determined that the appraiser\u2019s methodology was reasonable, concluded that the Alexandria appraisal met the federal appraisal standards, and approved it for Park Service\u2019s use. However, our review appraiser determined that the appraisal did not conform to all federal appraisal standards because it did not analyze the reasonableness of the \u201cbefore\u201d level of development. Furthermore, the appraisal did not clarify that a value based on an unrealistic level of development might differ from the fair market value of the property. Our review appraiser concluded that the instructions provided by the Park Service and the developer for the \u201cbefore\u201d development scenario ultimately led to the appraisal\u2019s not conforming to federal appraisal standards because of issues related to the reasonableness of the highest and best use development level prescribed by the instructions.", "As part of the exchange, the developer bought out its 1970 commitment to the Park Service to construct an interchange on the Parkway, for $8.5 million. This figure is an estimate of the cost of constructing the interchange\u2014it is not an estimate of market value that was prepared by the appraiser. The Federal Highway Administration was asked by the Park Service to prepare an initial estimate of the construction costs and determined them to be $12 million; an engineering firm hired by the developer revised this estimate, using different assumptions, to $8.5 million. The Park Service and the developer agreed to use this figure in the exchange before they sought the appraisals and then instructed the appraiser to use this figure to calculate the total amount owed to the Park Service in the exchange, by adding it to the appraised value of the Arlington parcel\u2019s indenture. Our analysis also includes this figure as an amount owed to the Park Service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arlington Appraisal Did Not Correctly Value the Indenture", "paragraphs": ["The appraiser faced two valuation determinations for the Arlington parcel. He needed to determine (1) the value of a restriction (indenture) owned by the Park Service that precluded office/retail/residential development on the parcel and (2) the value of other development restrictions imposed by the Park Service once the indenture was lifted. The appraiser applied the \u201cbefore and after\u201d methodology when making these valuation calculations.", "Unlike the Alexandria parcel, the appraisal instructions for the Arlington parcel did not provide the appraiser levels of development to use in his analysis of the indenture\u2019s fair market value and the restrictions. Instead, the appraiser relied on his professional judgment to estimate the levels of development likely to occur with or without the indenture, and with or without the other development restrictions.", "In estimating the Arlington parcel\u2019s \u201cbefore\u201d value\u2014with the indenture lifted\u2014the appraiser determined that the developer could reasonably obtain new zoning that would allow the construction of about 1.9 mmsf of office space on the parcel. In estimating the \u201cafter\u201d value\u2014with the indenture in place\u2014the appraiser noted that Arlington County allows developers to shift development density from one parcel to another. The appraiser determined that, had the indenture remained in place, the developer would have pursued this option and the county would have allowed the shift of 1.9 mmsf from the Arlington parcel to a smaller adjacent parcel (which was vacant and zoned for about 1.1 mmsf of office space). This shift would have resulted in the development of 3.0 mmsf on the adjacent parcel, and the appraiser determined that this parcel would likely have been rezoned to accommodate the additional development. Therefore, the appraiser found that the developer could have constructed the 1.9 mmsf of development associated with the Arlington parcel with or without the indenture in place.", "The appraiser calculated the indenture\u2019s value as the difference in the estimated cost of (1) building the 1.9 mmsf of office space on the Arlington parcel and (2) shifting this same square footage and combining it with 1.1 mmsf of office space on the adjacent parcel. The appraiser estimated that the developer would have had to spend $6.5 million more to construct the 1.9 mmsf on the adjacent parcel than on the Arlington parcel, to provide another level of underground parking to accommodate the additional development on the smaller parcel.", "While our review appraiser agreed that the appraisal\u2019s methodology was reasonable, he disagreed with the appraiser\u2019s conclusion that the indenture\u2019s value should be this single estimated cost. The developer would have likely incurred additional costs had it shifted the 1.9 mmsf to the adjacent parcel. We found three main reasons why the appraisal understated the value of the indenture:   According to the appraisal instructions, the adjacent parcel contained 17 acres; the appraiser assumed that all 17 acres were available for development. Our review appraiser examined the developer\u2019s site maps and determined that only 10 acres of the adjacent parcel were available for development, because 4 acres fell under railroad rights-of-way and another 3 acres were not contiguous. Shifting 1.9 mmsf of density to the remaining 10-acre site would have likely cost the developer more than the appraiser\u2019s $6.5 million estimate. For example, the appraiser determined that the developer would have to build three levels of underground parking, assuming that 98 percent of the 17-acre parcel were excavated; however, information in the appraisal indicates that five levels of underground parking would be needed if 98 percent of the 10-acre site were excavated. The appraiser told us that each additional level of underground parking increases the construction costs substantially over previous levels because of the additional expenses associated with building and strengthening the garage walls. Our review appraiser noted that\u2014while the appraisal\u2019s cost concepts as applied to parking may exceed the detail the market would know or care about\u2014the more severe the excavation needs to be, the more the market would consider it.", "The appraiser noted that the value of the 3.0 mmsf would likely decrease if the developer were unable to build on the full 46 acres, because higher- density projects generally take longer to sell and obtain lower prices per square foot. He also noted that any deficit could be offset by the lower costs of concentrating the infrastructure needed for the 3.0 mmsf on the smaller site. However, because the area actually available to accept the additional 1.9 mmsf is about 40 percent smaller than he assumed\u201410 acres rather than 17\u2014the resulting development would have been significantly more dense than he determined. Our review appraiser noted that putting all of this density on the smaller site raises questions of feasibility. At a minimum, we believe that the potential lower revenues from such a dense development could eclipse any potential cost savings that the developer might realize.", "The appraiser did not include the impact on the indenture\u2019s value of the developer\u2019s shifting an additional 1.1 mmsf of development density to the Arlington parcel and the adjacent parcel. A 1993 agreement between the developer and Arlington County allows this shift if the Park Service indenture is lifted. The appraiser reviewed the agreement and found it to be weak; interviewed the county\u2019s planning director, who suggested that the county was unlikely to approve this shift (which would result in a mixed-use development of more than 4.0 mmsf) owing to traffic-related issues; and reported finding no reliable evidence to conclude that this shift would take place. In our view, the possibility of this density shift is at least as strong as the possibility of shifting density from the Arlington parcel to the adjacent acreage, because an existing legal agreement with the county allows it. If the indenture remained in place, the developer would lose the option of shifting the 1.1 mmsf. Because the developer cannot shift this density without the removal of the indenture, the appraiser should have assigned some additional value to the indenture.", "Considering these factors, we agree with our review appraiser\u2019s conclusion that the indenture should have been assigned a higher value than $6.5 million. However, the appraisal does not provide enough information for us to reliably estimate the indenture\u2019s value.", "As a condition of having the indenture lifted, the developer agreed to restrict its construction on six areas within or adjacent to the parcel by one or more of the following factors: (1) building height; (2) proximity to the Parkway; and (3) type of building (for example, office, retail, or residential). In valuing these restrictions\u2014land interests the Park Service would acquire in the exchange\u2014the appraiser determined that restrictions in four areas would limit the amount and type of development that could be built, and that restrictions in the other two areas would not affect the developer since zoning already limited building heights. The appraiser estimated the potential economic impact of the restrictions\u2014that is, reductions in market values\u2014in each of these four areas, tallied these reductions, and concluded that the restrictions would have caused a $2.4 million loss for the developer.", "Our analysis shows that the appraisal overvalued the restrictions. The appraiser valued the areas as if they were six separate parcels, rather than analyzing the financial impact of the restrictions on the entire parcel\u2019s value, as required by federal appraisal standards. Our review appraiser further determined that the building restrictions on the Arlington parcel, in aggregate, had no detrimental impact on the parcel\u2019s value because zoning and other building restrictions limiting development predated the Park Service-imposed restrictions. Our review appraiser noted that the restrictions had the potential to affect a project\u2019s design or placement but concluded that they would probably have no impact, in aggregate, on the development. Thus, the building restrictions would not have resulted in a loss for the developer because they did not diminish the development opportunities available on the parcel and adjoining acres. Therefore, the restrictions should have been assigned no value.", "The Park Service\u2019s chief appraiser determined that the appraiser applied a reasonable methodology, concluded that the Arlington appraisal met the federal appraisal standards, and approved it for Park Service\u2019s use.

The appraiser hired by the developer agreed to talk with us, and we met with him to better understand the appraisals and his analyses. After we completed our fieldwork, we met with Park Service officials, the developer, the developer\u2019s lawyers, and the appraiser to verify the factual accuracy of the data we obtained; we then provided the Park Service and the Justice Department a draft of this report for review. The court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing in February 2001.", "Additionally, we contracted with Mr. Peter D. Bowes\u2014an independent and certified appraiser in Denver, Colorado, who has over 40 years of experience in appraising properties such as vacant urban land and has worked with various government entities\u2014to conduct a desk review of the appraisals. His review included his professional opinion on whether the appraisals appropriately valued the land interests that were exchanged and complied with federal appraisal standards. A desk review is not a reappraisal, and he did not visually inspect either the Alexandria or the Arlington parcel. In addition, he did not confirm details contained in the appraisal reports, add new data, or talk with the Park Service or the developer.", "We performed our work from April 2000 through February 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary of Exchange Figures and GAO\u2019s Adjusted Figures", "paragraphs": ["In the Potomac Yard land exchange, the appraiser reported that the Park Service owed the developer $14 million (which the developer waived).
