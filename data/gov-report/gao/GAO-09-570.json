To improve U.S. food assistance, Congress has authorized some funding for local and regional procurement (LRP)--donors' purchase of food aid in countries affected by food crises or in a country within the same region. Through analysis of agency documents, interviews with agency officials, experts, and practitioners, and fieldwork in four African countries, this requested report examines (1) LRP's impact on the efficiency of food aid delivery; (2) its impact on economies where food is procured; and (3) U.S. legal requirements that could affect agencies' use of LRP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["LRP offers donors a tool to reduce food aid costs and delivery time, but multiple challenges to ensuring cost-savings and timely delivery exist. GAO found that local procurement in sub-Saharan Africa cost about 34 percent less than similar in-kind food aid purchased and shipped from the United States to the same countries between 2001 and 2008. However, LRP does not always offer cost-savings potential. GAO found that LRP in Latin America is comparable in cost to U.S. in-kind food aid. According to World Food Program (WFP) data, from 2004 to 2008, in-kind international food aid delivery to 10 sub-Saharan African countries took an average of 147 days, while local procurement only took about 35 days and regional about 41 days. Donors face challenges with LRP, including (1) insufficient logistics capacity that can contribute to delays in delivery, (2) donor funding restrictions, and (3) weak legal systems that can limit buyers' ability to enforce contracts. Although LRP may have the added benefit of providing food that may be more culturally appropriate to recipients, evidence has yet to be systematically collected on LRP's adherence to quality standards and product specifications, which ensure food safety and nutritional content. LRP has the potential to make food more costly to consumers in areas where food is procured by increasing demand and driving up prices, but steps can be taken to reduce these risks. As GAO's review of WFP market analyses and interviews with WFP procurement officers confirmed, a lack of accurate market intelligence, such as production levels, makes it difficult to determine the extent to which LRP can be scaled up without causing adverse market impacts. Although LRP does have the potential to support local economies, for example by raising farmers' incomes, data to demonstrate that these benefits are sustainable in the long term are lacking. U.S. legal requirements to procure U.S.-grown agricultural commodities for food aid and to transport up to 75 percent of those commodities on U.S.-flag vessels may constrain agencies' use of LRP. Although Congress has appropriated funding for some LRP, agencies disagree on the applicability of certain cargo preference provisions to LRP food aid that may require ocean shipping. The 1987 interagency MOU that governs the administration of cargo preference requirements and could clarify areas of disagreement among the agencies is outdated and does not address the issues arising from LRP."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In an environment of increasing emergencies and growing global food  insecurity, the United States and other donors face intense pressures to feed  the world\u2019s expanding undernourished population.

Recently, the  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) reported that global  food insecurity could worsen, with some nutrition studies estimating that the  number of food-insecure may rise by 16 million people for every percentage  increase in the prices of staple goods. High food prices have sparked food  protests, with riots reported in more than 50 countries from January 2007 to  June 2008, including 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Most bilateral  donors of food aid have switched from commodity-based in-kind food aid  to a cash-based food assistance program in recent years. According to  some experts, providing cash rather than in-kind food commodities to  implementing partners such as the UN World Food Program (WFP)\u2014the  largest multilateral purchaser and provider of food aid in the world\u2014or to  other aid organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) can  enable them to purchase food locally or regionally and deliver it to  beneficiaries quickly and cost-effectively, while also providing  development benefits to local communities where the food is purchased.  However, other experts say that large cash purchases in some developing  countries can have detrimental effects on local market conditions, and in  such cases in-kind donations of commodities may be more beneficial.", "As the largest international food aid donor, contributing over half of all  food aid supplies to alleviate hunger and support development, the United  States plays an important role in responding to emergency food assistance  needs and ensuring global food security.  In 2008, the United States  provided more than $2.8 billion in annual and supplemental funding for  U.S. international food aid programs for more than 2.9 million metric tons  of food aid. The large majority of U.S. food assistance is for U.S.-grown  commodities purchased competitively in the United States and shipped to  recipient countries on U.S.-flag carriers.

Its 2008 Farm  Bill authorized the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to implement a  5-year, $60 million pilot LRP program for food aid. Subsequently in 2008,  Congress appropriated $50 million in bridge fund supplemental funding to  the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for LRP in  response to current emergencies, including the global food crisis.

Previously, the European Union\u2019s  food aid policies called for procuring food in the donor\u2019s domestic market.  In 1996, however, the European Union essentially eliminated restrictions  that tied procurement of food aid to European suppliers as it restructured  its food aid and food security budgets to focus on improving food security.  In 2005, Canada took similar actions, providing 50 percent of its food aid  budget in cash available for LRP. In 2008, Canada opted to provide 100  percent of its food aid budget in cash.", "Canada\u2019s stated rationale for switching to  100 percent cash funding for food aid  (which in some cases can still be used to  purchase Canadian agricultural commodi- ties) was to provide more flexibility to its  overall food security strategy, improve the  efficiency of its food assistance, and  contribute to the development of local and  regional markets from which it purchases  food aid. As one of the world\u2019s largest food  aid donors, Canada has provided an  average of about $161 million (USD) to  WFP, the Canadian Foodgrains Bank  (CFB), and other NGOs annually over the  last 4 years, with the vast majority of its  contributions going to WFP.", "Many donors place conditions on their cash contributions to WFP, such as  stating a preference for procurement of food in developing countries or for  LRP.

WFP cited two primary goals for funding LRP:  (1) to increase the efficiency of food aid delivery, expediting assistance to  save lives during food emergencies and humanitarian crises; and (2) to  support development by stimulating agricultural production and raising farm  incomes, particularly by targeting smallholder farm households.", "As shown in figure 2, WFP LRP has consistently exceeded international  procurement of food aid, principally for emergencies, from 2001 to 2008.", "WFP procurement in developing countries has been increasing, from $171  million in 2001 to over $1 billion in 2008 (see fig. 3).

Additionally, LRP can save  delivery time in emergency situations because it usually travels a shorter  distance than in-kind food aid. Local procurement can also avoid delays  that often occur when food crosses borders and has to go through permit  and inspection processes. Despite these benefits, donors face challenges  in making local and regional procurements, including insufficient logistics  capacity that can contribute to delays in delivery, and weak legal systems  that can limit buyers\u2019 ability to enforce. Besides the benefit of reducing  costs and delivery time, locally and regionally procured food may have the  added benefit of being more culturally acceptable to recipients.

We compared the cost per ton of  eight similar commodities for the same recipient countries in the same  quarter of a given year and found that the average cost of WFP\u2019s local  procurements in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia was 34 percent and 29  percent lower, respectively, than the cost of food aid shipped from the  United States (see fig. 4).  For example, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the  average cost of locally purchased wheat in Ethiopia was approximately  $194 per metric ton while the cost of U.S. wheat shipped to Ethiopia in  the same quarter was 38 percent higher, at approximately $312 per metric  ton. Additionally, about 95 percent of WFP local procurements in sub- Saharan Africa and 96 percent in Asia cost less than corresponding U.S. in- kind food aid. However, the location of procurements affects whether LRP  offers any cost-saving potential and if so, by how much. While local  procurement in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia cost much less than U.S. in- kind food aid, we found that in Latin America, the cost of WFP LRP was  comparable to the cost of food aid shipped from the United States. The  average cost of WFP local procurements in Latin America was 2 percent  higher than that of U.S. food aid, and the number of WFP\u2019s transactions  with a lower cost than U.S. food aid was close to the number of  transactions with a higher cost.  This difference is due in part to the fact  that shipping from the United States to Latin America is usually less costly  than shipping to Africa.", "Local and regional procurement can offer donors the flexibility to take  advantage of cost-saving opportunities, which exist when food is available  locally or regionally and the costs of purchasing and transporting it are  lower than the costs of purchasing and shipping it from donor countries.  Donors can purchase food aid from surplus-producing areas within the  affected country, or purchase at the subregional and regional levels to  meet localized needs. For example, to meet the needs of Uganda\u2019s large  internally displaced population in the north, WFP has been purchasing  maize and beans from the surplus-producing areas that are in close  proximity to the regions in need. In 2007, Uganda was the largest source  for WFP procurements in terms of tonnage. From 2001 to 2008, WFP  purchased over 600,000 metric tons of maize and beans locally to meet  needs in Uganda. Similarly, to meet needs in Zimbabwe in 2008, WFP  purchased a large amount of food aid that year from nearby countries  including Malawi; Zambia; Mozambique; and South Africa, a surplus- producing country. South Africa was the largest source for WFP  procurement in 2008, amounting to more than $163 million, and food from  South Africa fed people in both nearby countries and internationally (see  table 2).", "To ensure cost-effectiveness, donors can use the import parity price to  guide purchase decisions. For example, WFP compares the lowest price  potential sellers submit through its tender process with the import parity  price, which includes the costs of commodity plus shipping and handling,  from various potential procurement sites. WFP procures locally or  regionally if the costs of doing so are below the import parity price.  Recently, for a LRP funded by USAID, Save the Children compared the  cost of locally or regionally procured wheat flour, vegetable oil, and lentils  to the cost of in-kind food aid from the United States. It found that  although locally procured wheat flour in Tajikistan had a higher price than  U.S. wheat, the cost of commodity plus shipping was lower. According to  WFP, LRP\u2019s cost-effectiveness depends on many factors, such as the  commodity, season, and exchange rates. For example, WFP often procures  peas from Canada because of the availability and competitive pricing of  these commodities in this market. In addition, a strong currency can hurt a  country\u2019s competitiveness. According to WFP officials, increases in the  value of the South African currency partly contributed to WFP\u2019s decision  to decrease its purchases from South Africa in 2007 and then increase  them in 2008 when the currency devalued. (Fig. 5 shows WFP  procurement from South Africa from 2001 to 2008.)", "According to WFP data, LRPs in sub-Saharan Africa generally have a shorter  delivery time than food aid procured internationally. We compared the  median delivery time for LRP to the median delivery time for food aid either  procured or donated internationally for 10 sub-Saharan countries. We  selected these countries because they had received both LRP and  international food aid. We found that international in-kind donation took the  longest, averaging 147 days (see fig. 6). Local and regional procurements took  on average 35 and 41 days, shortening the delivery time from international  donations by 112 days and 106 days, respectively. For example, in Malawi, in- kind international donations took 4 months (167 days) while locally procured  food aid took about 1 month (32 days). Similarly, the median delivery time for  regionally procured food going to Zimbabwe was 48 days versus 114 days for  internationally procured food aid. (For the delivery times of the 10 selected  sub-Saharan African countries, see app. III.)", "Similarly, in a USAID-funded grant completed in April 2009, Save the  Children was able to obtain wheat flour from Russia and Kazakhstan and  transport it to Tajikistan within 2 months, while wheat flour from the  United States took over 5 months to arrive in Tajikistan (see illustrative  example in app. IV, which also compares the cost of U.S. in-kind food aid  with the cost of LRP). USAID sent the other two commodities\u2014yellow   peas and fortified soybean oil\u2014from its prepositioning site in Jacintoport  (Texas) and was able to shorten the delivery time. It took around the  same number of days for the yellow peas from the U.S. prepositioning site  as the lentils procured within the region to arrive.  According to DOT,  prepositioning offers significant time savings.  DOT\u2019s analysis shows that  sending U.S. prepositioned food could have reduced transit time in  comparison to a regional purchase from South Africa that was delivered to  Somalia.", "Locally and regionally procured food can take less time for delivery  because it travels a shorter distance than internationally procured food  and does not risk delays when crossing borders. Local procurement has  the benefit of avoiding import processes, such as meeting recipient  countries\u2019 sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, which can delay  delivery. For example, if imported maize does not meet a country\u2019s  moisture content requirement, delivery can be delayed. Some governments  require imported food aid to go through additional testing and certification  for genetically modified organisms (GMO). According to WFP officials in  South Africa, these requirements can take an additional 2 to 3 weeks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Reliable Suppliers, Donor Funding Restrictions, and Other Factors Have Limited the Efficiency of LRP", "paragraphs": ["Despite potential benefits, factors such as a lack of reliable suppliers,  limited logistical capacity, weak legal systems, and donor funding  restrictions have limited the efficiency of LRP, as explained below:    Lack of reliable suppliers. Of the 11 WFP procurement officers we  interviewed, 9 identified finding reliable suppliers and preventing  supplier default as a challenge to implementing LRP. A World Vision  representative in South Africa stated that the organization was involved  in a local procurement in Mozambique that took 5 months because the  supplier did not have food in stock and had to find alternative sources  to purchase enough to fulfill his contract. When food was finally  delivered, World Vision found that many bags were short of the  quantity specified in the contract.", "Poor infrastructure and logistical capacity. Limited infrastructure  and logistical capacity could delay delivery. For example, according to  some WFP officials and private traders we met with, South Africa\u2019s rail  system and ports are underinvested and have limited capacity to handle  food aid during peak seasons. Food aid could wait up to 2 months for a  warehouse at the port of Durban.  According to DOT, increasing  regional procurements from South Africa could lead to more  congestion at the port of Durban.  DOT believes that in-kind food aid  from the United States or prepositioning sites could avoid the port  congestion in South Africa by going directly to the port of entry nearest  the destination.  In addition, trade barriers in developing countries  could also delay delivery of food procured regionally.", "Weak legal systems. A weak legal system could limit buyers\u2019 ability to  enforce contracts. WFP generally requires suppliers to purchase bonds,  which they will lose if they do not fulfill their obligations under the  contracts. However, this requirement is not always feasible to  implement, especially when procuring from small suppliers. For  example, WFP usually eliminates its bond requirements for its  purchases from smallholder farmers.  Experts pointed out that it is  critical to build in the time and cost of adequate quality testing and  control, particularly in an environment where there are weak legal  requirements for the producers or the exporting countries.  For  example, WFP\u2019s procurement officer in Uganda told us that many of  the smallholder farmers WFP purchases from had never seen a  contract before, and WFP had to take actions to ensure that these  purchases were delivered on time and met the quality specified in the  applicable contracts.", "Timing and restrictions on donor funding. Timing and other  restrictions on donor funding limit the flexibility of implementing  partners to decide when, where, and how to purchase food, according  to WFP procurement officers. If donor funding is not available when  there is surplus in the market and prices are low, WFP cannot take  advantage of market opportunities. A procurement officer in Sudan, for  example, stated that, in January 2009, he was expecting 100,000 to  200,000 metric tons of high-quality commodities to be available on the  market, but that he would only be able to purchase 20,000 metric tons  due to the timing of donor funding. A WFP procurement officer in  South Africa stated that, although he may be able to convince  headquarters staff to let him use WFP\u2019s advanced financing facility to  make a purchase, he may encounter problems if the anticipated donor  funding does not come through with its commitment. With donor  support, WFP has begun to test flexible financing mechanisms that are  expected to facilitate LRP. These include the advance financing facility,  a mechanism with which WFP finances a specific project to mobilize  food based on specific forecasts of donor contributions to the project,  and a forward purchase facility, a mechanism that allows WFP to take  a market position at an optimal time without specific knowledge of  where the purchased food will go or which donor\u2019s funding will  underwrite the specific procurement action. Some officers also noted  that some donors\u2019 preference for LRP may result in procuring locally or  regionally when importing might be less expensive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LRP Can Provide More Culturally Appropriate Food, but Views on Quality Are Mixed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "LRP Can Provide More Culturally Acceptable Food", "paragraphs": ["Local and regional procurement can provide food that is more acceptable  to the dietary needs and preferences of beneficiaries in recipient  countries. People tend to be more familiar with food grown in neighboring  regions than food from different continents. For example, people in many  African countries prefer white maize, and Ethiopians who receive yellow  maize as food aid from the United States might sell it in the cattle market  as feed, according to a WFP procurement officer in Ethiopia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Views on Meeting Product Specifications and Quality Standards Are Mixed", "paragraphs": ["Experts and practitioners have mixed views on how LRP affects donors\u2019  ability to adhere to product specifications and quality standards\u2014such as  moisture content and the level of broken and foreign matter\u2014which  ensure food safety and nutritional content. However, donors have yet to  systematically collect evidence that demonstrates whether food procured  in different locations varies significantly in meeting product specifications  and quality. Some experts contend that because locally and regionally  procured food travels shorter distances and takes on average less time to  arrive at its destination than internationally procured food aid, certain  quality standards, such as moisture content, may be less critical. The  longer grain has to travel, the more critical it is to control moisture content  so that it does not become moldy and infested with insects. We have  previously reported quality problems with U.S. food aid during long transit  times. Regarding LRP food aid, 9 out of the 11 WFP procurement officers  we interviewed for this review confirmed that quality was a challenge.  They also noted, however, that some quality standards, which may often  be difficult for suppliers in developing countries to meet, may not be very  crucial to individual recipients. For example, due to the lack of modern  processing facilities, rice from some developing countries may have a  higher level of broken kernels, but some recipients may actually prefer  such rice because it is better suited to cooking porridge, a common  method of consumption. However, concerns persist about the quality of  food procured in developing countries. The U.S. Wheat Associates noted  that the ability to ensure food quality and safety could be jeopardized  when purchases occur where standards are less rigorous than those of  U.S. suppliers to food aid programs. We learned of a few examples of  locally or regionally procured food not meeting quality standards. For  example, representatives from WFP and NGOs told us that they had  received food that turned out to be of lower quality or quantity than what  was specified in the contract. A WFP procurement officer in South Africa  reported that WFP requires the plants that manufacture maize meal or  corn soy blend (CSB) to meet internationally accepted production  standards, such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP),  and hires surveyors to take samples for testing and assess whether the  facility meets those standards. However, these surveyors recently found  that 13 out of 15 maize meal plants were not in compliance with the  standards and provided a list of activities the plants should undertake in  order to improve. In addition, some factors that affect the efficiency of  LRP also affect the ability to meet quality standards and product  specifications. For example, a weak legal system limits buyers\u2019 ability to  enforce contracts, including imposing penalties when commodities  delivered do not meet the specifications outlined in the contract. However,  no evidence has been systematically collected on how LRP affects donors\u2019  ability to adhere to quality standards and product specifications. A WFP  official told us he does not believe there is any significant difference  among different procurement types in the level of post-delivery loss, which  is one measure of quality issues. However, WFP has not analyzed whether  the quality issues are more severe for food procured locally or regionally  versus food procured internationally."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Local and Regional Procurement of Food Aid Has Potential for Adverse Market Impacts That Can Be Mitigated by Better Market Intelligence", "paragraphs": ["Local and regional procurement (LRP) has the potential to make food  more costly to consumers in areas from which food is procured by  increasing demand and driving up prices. While WFP has taken actions to  help mitigate these impacts, such as coordinating with other implementing  partners to gather market information, in some cases local purchases have  adversely affected markets where the purchases were made. In particular,  lack of reliable market intelligence\u2014such as market prices, production  levels, and trade patterns\u2014makes it difficult to determine the extent to  which LRP can be increased without causing adverse market impacts.  Poorly functioning and unintegrated markets pose an additional challenge  to avoiding adverse market impacts and expanding the use of LRP.

Although most of the WFP procurement officers we  interviewed stated that local procurements of food aid generally do not  affect market prices, our review of the literature and interviews during  fieldwork show that there have been instances where LRP contributed to  price hikes and price volatility in markets from which food is procured.  However, the size of each of WFP\u2019s local procurements tends to be  small\u2014on average about 298 metric tons, as compared with 671 metric  tons for its international procurements. Additionally, WFP\u2019s local  procurements do not make up a large portion of the market for a food  commodity in many developing countries, which reduces the risk of  disrupting local markets. WFP\u2019s local procurements of about 20,000 metric  tons of maize in Burkina Faso in 2008, for example, amounted to less than  1 percent of a total market capacity of 700,000 metric tons. However, local  procurements have also contributed to price hikes. In 2003, for example,  when food aid donors tried to take advantage of low prices following 2  years of good harvests in Ethiopia, their purchases contributed to a rise in  prices. Additionally, in 2003, WFP\u2019s Uganda country office procured a  large amount of locally grown maize from large traders based in Kampala  in support of its operations in northern Uganda and in the Great Lakes  region, particularly in Burundi. Due in part to this activity, maize prices in  Kampala during this period were double those in Iganga (119 kilometers  away).  However, because maize is not a staple food in Uganda,  consumers\u2019 access to food may not have been adversely affected. WFP\u2019s  large local procurements in Uganda from a small number of large traders  may also have contributed to an increase in the market power of those  large traders.", "While local procurements of food aid have adversely affected markets in  several developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, almost all  of the WFP procurement officers we interviewed stated that they  supported the idea of the United States increasing its funding for LRP.

In addition to serving as a measure for cost-efficiency,  comparing local prices with import parity prices helps those involved in  local procurement to determine whether a local procurement will \u201cdo no  harm\u201d to local markets and consumers by not making local procurements  when local prices are higher than international prices. However, as a  USDA study on LRP has noted, this standard may be constrained in cases  where local prices for commodities are so much lower than import parity  prices that it would require substantial price increases to reach the import  parity threshold.  WFP also tries to mitigate potential adverse market  impacts by issuing tenders for small amounts of food early in the harvest  season. Then, combined with available market intelligence, WFP  determines whether its purchases have contributed to price hikes before  putting out larger tenders. In addition to these tactics, WFP country offices  work with other parties involved in food aid, such as donors, host  government agencies, and NGOs, to coordinate efforts and share market  information.

Unintegrated markets  are characterized by a lack of price transmission among markets.   Additionally, there is difficulty in tracking informal cross-border trade and  a lack of functioning commodity exchanges. When markets are not well- integrated, either within countries or regionally, large purchases of food  by WFP, other food aid organizations, or donors can cause localized price  hikes. For example, WFP officials in Burkina Faso noted that the  government\u2019s purchases for its strategic food reserve have correlated with  price spikes. Because the markets for agricultural commodities in sub- Saharan Africa, in particular, are not always clearly defined and do not  always account for natural geographic and ethnic boundaries, significant  informal cross-border trading that does not heed international and  regional trade agreements can occur. For example, approximately 30 to 50  percent of Uganda\u2019s marketable surplus for maize is traded informally,  often on bicycles across the borders to Kenya or Rwanda, according to  WFP, USAID, and foreign government officials, and others we interviewed  during fieldwork in Uganda. Additionally, WFP\u2019s Uganda country office  staff stated that it is difficult to effectively plan food aid interventions  involving LRP in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo due to  lack of information about informal cross-border trading and volatile  market conditions. The market effects of such trading can be difficult to  track and create additional constraints to understanding and avoiding  adverse price impacts when conducting LRP.

Agency responsible for determining availability of U.S.-flag vessels:  Officials from USAID, USDA, and DOT stated that their respective  agencies have independent authority to determine U.S.-flag vessels are  not available. According to USAID officials, the agency determines  U.S.-flag nonavailability based on its USAID program needs but seeks  prior concurrence from DOT\u2019s Maritime Administration (MARAD).  According to USDA officials, USDA determines the availability of U.S.- flag vessels based on programmatic needs, and DOT determines what  constitutes a fair and reasonable shipping rate. Agency officials and  industry experts noted that the availability of U.S.-flag vessels in areas  such as Africa\u2019s eastern coast is limited. DOT noted that a U.S.-flag  vessel could ship food from one African port to another if the ship  happened to be in the region conducting military operations or other  business. However, most carriers do not currently provide regular  regional service. U.S. officials in Kenya and South Africa confirmed  this lack of regular service along Africa\u2019s eastern coast. A shipping  agent in South Africa stated that she was aware of two U.S.-flag vessels  that frequent the port of Durban. Representatives of a coalition of U.S.- flag carriers indicated that U.S.-flag vessels could provide additional  service in the region in the future but their decision to relocate vessels  depends on the regularity of regional shipments. According to a 2008  report regarding efforts to improve procurement planning, USAID  and USDA compete with DOD and other exporters for space aboard  the relatively few U.S.-flag vessels, some of which are ill-suited for t carriage of food-grade commodities. Moreover, of the three  participating liner service container carriers utilizing U.S.-flag vessels,  only one services Africa, where 54 percent of international food aid  was delivered in 2007, according to INTERFAIS data. 2.  Make up requirements when U.S.-flag vessels are unavailable or an  agency uses \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d authority: Agencies disagree as to  whether shipments made on foreign vessels, because U.S.-flag vessels  were not available or because an agency waives cargo preference  requirements utilizing authority to conduct a program notwithstanding  any other provision of law, should count toward the maximum  tonnage allowed on foreign-flag vessels. DOT has stated that it  should, and any tonnage shipped on foreign-flag vessels that exceeds  the 25 percent maximum tonnage should be made up the following  year. However, USAID has the authority to implement emergency  programs, including international disaster assistance, notwithstanding  any other provision of law. With this authority, USAID has waived  cargo preference requirements to ensure food aid delivery during  emergencies. In those cases, it believes the tonnage shipped on  foreign-flag vessels should not be counted toward the maximum  foreign-flag tonnage allowed under cargo preference. DOT officials  believe otherwise. Since 2005, USAID has used notwithstanding  authority to override cargo preference four times, two of which were  in 2005 when there were extreme price disparities between U.S.-flag  and foreign-flag offers to transport emergency food aid to Kenya and  Somalia.  3.  Applicability of cargo preference requirements to public  international organizations:  Agencies also disagree on whether  grants made to international organizations, such as WFP, must  incorporate cargo preference requirements. According to DOT  officials, if public international organizations use U.S. funding to  purchase food and that food requires ocean shipping, U.S.-flag vessels  should be given cargo preference. For example, in 2006, DOT notified  the USAID West-Bank/Gaza mission that it had not conformed to the  legal mandate in a U.S.-funded grant with WFP to purchase 16,000  metric tons of wheat flour for shipment to Tel Aviv. However,  according to the USAID policy manual, public international  organizations are allowed to abide by their own procurement rules.  Therefore, international organizations that receive cash contributions  for regional procurement of food are not required to ship on U.S.-flag  vessels. 4.  Reimbursement methodology:  DOT is required to reimburse food aid  agencies for a portion of the ocean freight and transportation costs  that exceed 20 percent of their total program costs. However, agencies  disagree on whether reimbursement levels are sufficient to cover the  additional costs incurred by transporting the food on U.S.-flag vessels.  According to USDA officials, DOT has been reluctant to reimburse  USDA for any excess costs beyond 20 percent freight costs and has not  gone on the record about reimbursement for USDA\u2019s LRP pilot field- based projects. According to USAID, areas of ambiguity regarding  reimbursements include:   costs of ocean freight and transportation on U.S.-flag vessels that  exceed 20 percent of program costs,  transportation from overseas food warehouses to final destinations,  foreign inland transport costs, and    costs of ocean freight and transportation on U.S.-flag vessels when  there is no foreign-flag vessel available for cost comparison."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Clarity on Cargo Preference Requirements Could Constrain LRP", "paragraphs": ["With a lack of clarity on how to interpret cargo preference regulations,  agencies\u2019 ability to utilize LRP to respond to emergencies may be  constrained.

DOT has not yet issued  regulations governing how it will implement this new authority and USAID  faces uncertainty regarding whether increased use of LRP will trigger  imposition of make-up requirements.", "Cargo preference could also constrain USAID\u2019s and USDA\u2019s LRP pilot  programs if U.S.-flag vessels are unavailable. USAID officials indicated that  given the limited volume of regional shipments relative to regular Title II  shipments, the agency would probably not be able to meet the U.S.-flag  compliance threshold if even one shipment could not be transported on a  U.S.-flag vessel. According to a USDA official, countries chosen for its LRP  pilot field-based projects will likely receive food shipments only once in a  fiscal year. If U.S.-flag vessels are unavailable for service at that time, it is  unclear how USDA will make up tonnage by country and program the  following year since, according to officials, the pilot is of limited duration.  In addition, USDA will not cut other country program budgets in order to  make up tonnage by country for its LRP program.", "Finally, the lack of clarity when USAID waives cargo preference through  notwithstanding authority could constrain its ability to fully utilize the  authority when responding to emergencies that require regional shipment  of food in anticipation of potential sanctions by DOT.

Therefore, we recommended that USAID, USDA, and  DOT seek to minimize the cost impact of cargo preference regulations by  updating implementation and reimbursement methodologies of cargo  preference as it applies to U.S. food aid.

The recommendation does not preclude such coordination among  the agencies.  We recognize USAID\u2019s and USDA\u2019s efforts to date to  implement our 2007 recommendation to develop a coordinated  interagency mechanism to update food aid specifications and products to  improve food quality and nutritional standards.

With regard to the third recommendation,  USAID commented that MARAD\u2019s position on the applicability of the 75  percent threshold to USAID-funded LRP, rather than the 50 percent  threshold, is devoid of legal merit.  In providing information on agencies\u2019  interpretations of cargo preference requirements as they pertain to LRP,  we sought to identify areas where agencies disagree on the applicability  and interpretation of these requirements.  We did not attempt to adjudicate  the differences in interpretation among the agencies involved.  However,  in technical comments to a draft of this report, DOT changed its position  regarding thresholds and now concurs with USAID\u2019S interpretation, thus  eliminating this issue as an area of ambiguity.", "USDA generally agreed with our report, noting that our comparisons of  costs and delivery times were insightful.  However, USDA observed that  aggregating some of the commodities such as vegetable oil and beans  could cause a loss of precision in our methodology.  To obtain an overall  picture of costs, we worked to ensure that we had the largest number of  observations, over the longest possible time period, so some aggregation  was required.  USDA also stated that our report does not specify how  differences in quality or specifications were handled.  We recognize that  the price of different commodities in the same category may vary  depending on quality or specifications.  However, we noted WFP\u2019s  assertion that its commodities meet both the importing and exporting  countries\u2019 standards, and there is no systematic evidence that U.S.  commodities differ in quality compared to LRP commodities. Nonetheless,  we recognize that there may be differences in the quality of certain  commodities, and we note such differences in our illustrative example of  LRP for Tajikistan.  In addition, both USDA and DOT noted that we did not  compare delivery times for LRP and in-kind food aid from prepositioning  sites.  Although we did not differentiate prepositioned commodities in our  cost comparison, we included them in our data analysis and note that  prepositioned commodities were a very small part of U.S. food aid during  the time period we examined.", "DOT stated that additional analysis may be warranted before concluding  that LRP offers a tool to reduce costs and shorten delivery time.  Although  further analysis of LRP practices would be useful, our analysis  demonstrated consistent results across 8 years of data. For example, local  procurement in sub-Saharan Africa cost about 34 percent less than USAID  commodities procured at around the same time and delivered to the same  country. DOT also stated that it implements the cargo preference statute  through regulation, not through an interagency MOU.  While this is true,  the regulations contain ambiguities that have previously required  resolution through an MOU.  Our report describes new ambiguities that  could arise in applying cargo preference in the context of regional  procurement.  We believe that these ambiguities can be resolved by  updating the MOU.  Further, there is no requirement that establishing  regulation precede a MOU nor does a MOU preclude the issuance of new  regulation.  The updated MOU, establishing consensus among the relevant  agencies, could be reflected in any future regulation that DOT may draft  and get finalized through the rule-making process.", "WFP welcomed our timely examination of LRP as one of numerous tools  to deliver effective and efficient food assistance to those in greatest need.   However, WFP stated it was perplexed that concerns persist about the  quality of food procured in developing countries, given the lack of  evidence showing that LRP introduces quality challenges that are not  already challenges to internationally procured and donor-provided food  aid.  We note that quality is one issue that many WFP procurement officers  and several other officials we interviewed identified as a challenge for  LRP.   However, the lack of systematically collected data makes it difficult  to objectively analyze how LRPs adhere to quality standards and product  specifications.  Our first recommendation addresses this issue.   In  addition, WFP offered some qualifications to our discussion of the impact  of LRP on economies where food is procured, noting the lack of  systematic evidence to suggest that current LRP practices adversely  impact host markets.  In this report, we explain several efforts that WFP  and others have taken to significantly improve the availability and  reliability of market intelligence in developing countries.  Nonetheless,  WFP, NGOs, U.S. agencies, host governments, and experts convened for  our roundtable stated that the most significant challenge to avoiding  potential adverse markets impacts when conducting LRP is unreliable  market intelligence. Therefore, we are recommending improving the  reliability and utility of market intelligence.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa, excluding countries  with current conflict, because these regions within Africa have high  prevalence rates of undernourishment. While this selection is not  representative in any statistical sense, it ensured that we had variation in  the key factors we considered. We do not generalize the results of our  fieldwork beyond that selection, using fieldwork primarily to provide  illustrative examples.", "To understand the experiences of other donors with local and regional  food procurement and corroborate information gathered in our literature  review, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 principal WFP  procurement officers in Africa and Asia. We focused on Africa and Asia  because that is where the majority of food procurement abroad takes  place. The 11 we interviewed represented all the principal WFP  procurement officers that were in place in Asia and Africa at the time we  conducted our fieldwork. We asked each procurement officer a series of  open-ended questions on the factors impacting and actions that could be  taken to improve: cost, delivery time, quality, market impact, and  development. To ensure that the questions were clear and unambiguous,  did not place an undue burden on respondents, and that respondents had  the necessary information and time to answer the questions, we conducted  pre-tests with WFP procurement officers in Sudan and Thailand. To  determine which factors and actions were mentioned most frequently, we  coded the officer\u2019s responses to the questions. One analyst developed and  applied the codes to the interviews and another analyst reviewed both the  codes and their application. Based on that coding, we report data on the  number of officers that mentioned each factor and action.

To evaluate LRP cost  efficiency, we compared WFP\u2019s costs with USAID\u2019s. WFP\u2019s costs  are based on WFP\u2019s procurement data from 2001 to 2008 and USAID\u2019s  costs are based on USAID\u2019s Line 17 reports from fiscal year 2001 to 2008.   We did not evaluate the impact of prepositioning on U.S. food aid costs,  although we did not exclude the commodities shipped from prepositioning  sites, albeit small in value relative to overall U.S. food aid for the time  period we examined.  WFP\u2019s procurement data include information on the  commodities purchased, the date of the purchase, the origin of the  commodities, the recipient of the food aid, the contract terms, and the  purchase prices. To assess the reliability of the data, we (1) reviewed  existing documentation related to the data sources and (2) interviewed  WFP and USAID officials familiar with the data sources. Accordingly, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Since WFP\u2019s procurements are under different contract terms, the  purchase prices include different costs. For example, most of WFP\u2019s  international procurements are under the term free on board (FOB), which  normally does not include ocean shipping and handling. USAID\u2019s data  include the costs for commodities and ocean shipping and inland  transportation, storage, and handling (ITSH). To make the costs  comparable, we included different USAID cost components depending on  the contract terms of the corresponding WFP purchase. See table 4 for  details of the corresponding WFP contract terms and USAID cost  components.", "For each WFP purchase, we searched for a \u201cmatch\u201d in USAID\u2019s data. A  match is defined as a purchase transaction of a similar commodity, in the  same quarter of the same year, for the same recipient country. The  commodity groups we selected are beans, corn soy blend (CSB), maize,  maize meal, rice, sorghum/millet, vegetable oil, and wheat, which  represent the majority of food aid for both WFP and USAID. We  aggregated the more detailed commodities in USAID\u2019s data. For example,  we aggregated many types of beans (red beans, kidney beans, black beans,  pinto beans, and other beans) into the bean commodity group. We  compared the WFP\u2019s per metric ton cost with its match of USAID\u2019s cost.  See table 5 for the number of matches in our analysis, which occurred for  8 commodities out of approximately 37,000 transactions from 2001 to 2008.", "We compared the costs by region (sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin  America) and by procurement type (local, regional, and international). To  account for DOT cargo preference reimbursements, we reduced USAID  ocean freight costs from 25 to 35 percent and found that it did not change  our results significantly. Based on previous GAO work, we consider 25  percent to be a reasonable value to account for cargo reimbursements  over the 8-year period. We analyzed the percentage of WFP transactions  that had lower costs than USAID\u2019s and the cost differential. See fig. 8  below for a histogram of cost differential comparison.", "The cost differences between U.S. food aid and LRP of similar food  products, around the same time frame, and for the same countries we  identified represent potential cost-saving opportunities. However, many  factors can reduce or even eliminate the amount of savings, including  whether food is available in the local and regional markets, and how much  additional purchases in these markets will drive up prices. We discussed  this methodology at the expert roundtable we conducted, and the experts  indicated that our methodology was sufficient in controlling for various  factors that may influence costs to make the costs comparable.", "To evaluate the impact of LRP on delivery time, we relied on interviews  with WFP officials and representatives from various organizations we met  with during fieldwork in the four countries we visited. In addition, WFP  generated delivery time for 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that we  selected by procurement type. The countries that we selected had received  food aid purchased or donated internationally, as well as through LRP. Our  analysis of the aggregate delivery time consisted of the average of the  median delivery times for each of the 10 countries across the four  procurement types. To evaluate the impact of LRP on the quality, we  interviewed U.S. agency officials, WFP officials, and NGO representatives.  We reviewed assessments of WFP local and regional procurement.  We  discussed with WFP the methodology it used in order to generate the  delivery time and the limitations of the methodology. We determined the  data are sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We chose to use WFP data  because they included a substantial amount of both international and local  and regional procurements.  We did not compare WFP\u2019s delivery time to  U.S. in-kind delivery time.  We also did not evaluate the impact of  prepositioning on U.S. food aid delivery time.", "To examine the impact of LRP on the economies of countries where food  is procured, we relied on the responses of WFP procurement officers to  our semi-structured interview questions; our economic literature review of  LRP practices, reports, studies, and papers\u2019 and our interviews with WFP,  U.S. government, NGO, World Bank, and private-sector officials in  Washington, D.C.; Rome; and the countries we visited for fieldwork in sub- Saharan Africa.

However, they  represented a small part of U.S. food aid during the period of time that  we examined.   2.  The issue of quality is one that many WFP procurement officers and   others we interviewed identified as a challenge for LRP.   However, the  lack of systematically collected data makes it difficult to objectively  analyze how LRPs adhere to quality standards and product  specifications and whether LRP differs in quality from U.S.  commodities.  Our first recommendation addresses the issue of quality,  which would also include improving nutritional standards.  3.  We added information to clarify MARAD\u2019s role as the determining  agency of \u201cfair and reasonable rates\u201d but note that DOT interprets its  role as the sole agency responsible for determining U.S.-flag  availability.   4.  While we recognize that there is no widespread evidence of LRP  causing adverse impacts in markets, we believe that there is a  preponderance of information to show that in many developing  countries there is a lack of reliable market information.  Widespread  evidence of any impacts, adverse or otherwise, will not become  available in many countries until market intelligence systems are made  more reliable and widely used. Therefore, it is important to focus on  the potential risk for adverse impacts on markets in areas where LRP  is practiced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the U.S. Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the U.S. Department of  Transportation\u2019s letter received May 22, 2009.  1.  Although further analysis of LRP practices would be useful, we believe  that the results of our analysis demonstrate consistent results over 8  years of data, with 95 percent of local purchases in sub-Saharan Africa  costing less than USAID commodities to the same country around the  same time. Although we did not differentiate prepositioned  commodities in our cost comparison, they were included in our data  analysis.  However, it is important to note that prepositioned  commodities were a very small part of U.S. food aid during this time  period.  Nonetheless, we recognize that prepositioning can affect  delivery time, which was the case in the Tajikistan example where  prepositioned food from Jacintoport shortened delivery time.   Additionally, DOT questioned an illustrative example we used in this  report on potential cost savings in purchasing wheat in Ethiopia  because it believed the country had severe shortage in 2002.  Although  there may be limited capacity for local procurement, disasters are  often localized, and there may be surplus regions within the country or  in nearby countries.  This is precisely a rationale for LRP.  In fact, WFP  purchased 74,000 metric tons of wheat in Ethiopia locally in the last  quarter of 2002, and the average price was lower than wheat procured  from the United States.  2.  Ocean shipping is one of the many stages in food aid procurement and  delivery. While DOT found that the ocean transit time from a  prepositioning site averaged only 24.5 days, trans-Atlantic shipping,  which account for majority of U.S. food aid to sub-Saharan Africa  takes longer. Therefore, the ocean transit time DOT provided in its  letter does not represent the typical U.S. food aid delivery time. In  addition, other stages of food procurement and delivery add time to  the entire process. In order to do a fair comparison of delivery time  among various procurement types and to ensure comparability in the  procurement and delivery stages, we identified countries that had  received significant amount of LRP and international food aid from the  WFP.   Although the breakdown of the different elements in the  delivery time might be useful (which we could not do from the data  provided to us by WFP), it does not change our finding that LRP to  these countries took less time than international food aid.  3.  Although DOT does implement cargo preference statutes through  regulation, the regulations often contain ambiguities that have required  resolution through a MOU.  Our report describes new ambiguities that  could arise in applying cargo preference in the context of regional  procurement.  We believe that these ambiguities need to be resolved\u2014 and can be resolved\u2014by updating the MOU.  Further, there is no  requirement that establishing regulation precede an MOU nor does a  MOU preclude the issuance of new regulation.  The updated MOU,  establishing consensus among the relevant agencies, could be reflected  in any future regulation that DOT may draft and get finalized through  the rule-making process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the World Food Program", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the World Food Program\u2019s letter  dated May 15, 2009.  1.  The issue of quality is one area that many WFP procurement officers  we spoke with mentioned as a challenge in local and regional  procurement. In addition, quality is an area of concern expressed by  organizations such as the U.S. Wheat Associates. However, the lack of  systematically collected data makes it difficult to objectively analyze  how LRPs adhere to quality standards and product specifications.  Our  first recommendation addresses this issue.     2.  In our report, we explain several of the efforts that WFP and others  have taken to significantly improve the availability and reliability of  market intelligence in developing countries.  Yet, as WFP\u2019s own  documents state, in many low-income countries national market  intelligence systems are weak and unreliable, and timely data are not  always available, which may limit the effectiveness of WFP\u2019s market  intelligence efforts.  3.  We modified text, adding language in the report to explain that the use  of import parity prices to determine when to switch from local  procurement to regional or international procurement may be  constrained. Specifically, in some countries, commodity prices may be  so much lower than import parity prices that it would take substantial  price increases to reach the import parity price threshold.  4.  We recognize that WFP\u2019s market position in many countries is very  small (less than 1 percent in Burkina Faso, for example) and we state  that in the report, noting that this limits the effects that LRP can have  on prices. Also, recognizing that it is difficult to demonstrate an  absolutely causal relationship between a discrete WFP local purchase  and a discrete price increase, we note that LRP, when combined with  other market interventions, unreliable market intelligence, poorly  functioning and unintegrated markets, and other factors, has the  potential to cause price hikes and reduce consumers\u2019 access to food.  Therefore, we recommend improving the reliability and utility of  market intelligence in order to guard against the risks associated with  a lack of reliable market information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Phillip Thomas (Assistant  Director), Sada Aksartova, Kathryn Bernet, Carol Bray, Ming Chen, Debbie  Chung, Lynn Cothern, Martin De Alteriis, Mark Dowling, Etana Finkler,  Katrina Greaves, Kendall Helm, Joy Labez, Andrea Miller, Julia A.
