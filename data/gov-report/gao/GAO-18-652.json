Existing challenges related to the recruitment and retention of health care providers\u2014such as difficulty recruiting providers in rural locations\u2014are exacerbated by funding uncertainty. For example, CRs and government shutdowns can disrupt recruitment activities like application reviews and interviews.", "Administrative burden and costs. Both IHS and tribes incur additional administrative burden and costs as IHS staff calculate proportional allocations for each tribally operated health care program and modify hundreds of tribal contracts each time a new CR is enacted by Congress to conform to limits on available funding.", "Financial effects on tribes. Funding uncertainty resulting from recurring CRs and from government shutdowns has led to adverse financial effects on tribes and their health care programs. For instance, one tribe incurred higher interest on loans when the uncertainty of the availability of federal funds led to a downgraded credit rating, as it was financing construction of a health care facility.", "GAO identified various considerations for policymakers to take into account for any proposal to change the availability of the appropriations that IHS receives. These considerations include operational considerations, such as what proportion of the agency's budget would be provided in the advance appropriation and under what conditions changes to the funding provided through advance appropriations would be permitted in the following year. Additionally, congressional flexibility considerations arise because advance appropriation authority reduces what is left for the overall budget for the rest of the government. Another consideration is agency capacity and leadership, including whether IHS has the processes in place to develop and manage an advance appropriation.

They also require agencies to take the most limited  funding actions necessary to maintain operations at the prior fiscal year\u2019s  level.", "Budget authority during a funding gap. Certain federal health care  programs have various budget authorities that can allow for continued  operations during a funding gap. For example, VA\u2019s advance  appropriations authority for its health care programs allows operations to  continue after one appropriation expires, using the previously enacted  budget for the next year. Although IHS does not have this authority,  Congress has enacted longer periods of availability for certain IHS  appropriations that would allow the activities they support to continue  during a funding gap, assuming the appropriation has not run out.

According to VA officials, veterans service organizations were the primary  advocates who sought advance appropriation authority for VA\u2019s health  care program.", "In its health care budget proposal each year, VA submits a request for the  upcoming fiscal year, as well as an advance appropriation request for the  following year. In early 2018, for example, VA submitted a request for  fiscal year 2019, as well as a fiscal year 2020 advance appropriation  request. According to VA, more than 90 percent of its budget request is  developed using an actuarial model that is based in part on VA\u2019s actual  health care utilization data from prior years; for example, the 2020  advance appropriation request used fiscal year 2016 data. VHA officials  said that the agency calculates its advance appropriation request to fund  needed care as estimated by its actuarial model, with less funding  requested for other expenses (such as non-recurring maintenance) and  officials told us this is consistent with direction provided by OMB. OMB  officials told us that the amount provided in the advance appropriation is  intended to provide VA with some assurances that it will be able to  continue health care operations seamlessly across fiscal years.", "In the subsequent year (the year during which the advance appropriation  can be used), VA may request an adjustment to the amount previously  provided through advance appropriations\u2014referred to by agency officials  as a \u201csecond bite\u201d\u2014an arrangement that is intended by design to help  respond to more recent policy changes or significant events.

Both OMB and VHA officials said this  \u201csecond bite\u201d provides an opportunity to make an adjustment to VA\u2019s  advance appropriation using updated utilization data. VHA officials told us  that changes in policy (such as determining which veterans or what health  benefits can be covered) sometimes drive changes from the initial budget  request. For example, policy changes can include adding an additional  presumptive condition\u2014such as health conditions associated with Agent  Orange exposure\u2014resulting in a new health benefit, or a costly new drug  treatment, as in the case of the addition to the drug formulary of a new  Hepatitis C drug treatment.", "Despite having advance appropriation authority, VA has faced challenges  in budget formulation, in addition to the general management and  oversight challenges we cited in adding VA to our High-Risk List in  2015.

The following summarizes these  effects, along with the views of IHS officials, tribal representatives, and  other stakeholders on how advance appropriation authority could mitigate  them, and VA\u2019s related experiences:  Provision of health care services. IHS officials said that, in general,  most health care services would be expected to continue at IHS-operated  facilities during a shutdown, as health care providers would be deemed  \u201cexcepted\u201d personnel under the agency\u2019s contingency plan. However,  officials noted some health care procedures could be delayed, as  determined on a case-by-case basis at the local level. IHS officials also  acknowledged that tribal health care programs may not have access to  furloughed IHS staff who do not work during a shutdown, such as support  staff at local IHS area offices, who may carry out administrative duties on  their behalf. For example, tribal representatives told us that during a  previous government shutdown, finance employees from the local IHS  area offices were furloughed (and thus not permitted to work), which  created challenges for tribal health care operations that depended on  these IHS employees to process payments and agreements.", "IHS officials stated they believe advance appropriations could help  ensure continuity of health care services through certainty of funding. IHS  officials also said that while lapses in appropriations do not halt patient  care, they do create complications\u2014such as the determination of  excepted personnel as described above\u2014that could be eliminated by  funding provided through advance appropriations. Tribal representatives  said the certainty of funding that would come with IHS having advance  appropriations would create a sense of stability in tribal health care  programs as well.", "VA VISN officials we spoke to said having advance appropriations has  improved their ability to manage resources for continuity of services and  allowed them to avoid the substantial additional planning that occurs  before a potential government shutdown when agencies are determining  which providers and staff would be deemed excepted. According to the  VISN officials, knowing that funding is coming\u2014as opposed to having  less certainty\u2014would allow an agency to plan and prioritize its services  more efficiently.", "Health care program planning. Tribal representatives said operating  health care programs with short-term funding provided through a series of  CRs\u2014and facing potential government shutdowns\u2014rather than a full  year\u2019s apportionment hinders their ability to plan for new programs and for  improvements that need to be carried out across budget years or that  require large up-front investments, such as an electronic medical records  system or other significant information technology purchases. Tribal  representatives said there are often plans that they have to set aside  because they don\u2019t have enough funds to start a project during a CR,  and\u2014if there are multiple CRs\u2014there is not enough time left in the  budget year to start bigger projects once an annual appropriation is  passed. Tribal representatives also told us that they believe that advance  appropriations would help tribal health care programs plan for current and  future needs. For example, one tribal official told us advance  appropriations would allow tribes to plan for long-term health initiatives.  The official\u2019s specific tribe has a gestational diabetes program in  conjunction with a local university that the tribe could plan to take full  responsibility for if they had more funding stability.", "VA VISN officials we interviewed provided several examples of how they  believe advance appropriations facilitate their planning. For example,  VISN officials told us advance appropriations allow them to plan  strategically for equipment purchases: if they need to buy a CT scanner,  they would plan to do site preparation in one year\u2014for example,  reconfiguring the space for the new equipment by moving walls, electrical  rewiring, etc.\u2014and buy the scanner in the next year. With advance  appropriations, they know they are going to have funds for an expensive  equipment purchase available the next year; without an advance  appropriation, they would not be sure, and could spend funds on  preparation and then ultimately not have the funds to make the equipment  purchase. These officials also said having advance appropriations gave  them confidence in making current plans to provide the new shingles  vaccine for their over-50 population in 2019, including the ability to secure  an adequate supply of the vaccine from the manufacturer.", "Provider recruitment and retention. IHS officials and tribal  representatives said existing challenges related to their recruitment and  retention of health care providers\u2014many of which are related to the rural  and remote locations of many of IHS\u2019s facilities\u2014are exacerbated by  funding uncertainty resulting from CRs or potential government  shutdowns. IHS officials said CRs and government shutdowns can  disrupt recruitment activities such as IHS marketing efforts, job  advertisements, application review, interviews, and candidate site visits.  Additionally, when recruiting health care providers, IHS officials said CRs  and potential government shutdowns create doubt about the stability of  employment at IHS amongst potential candidates, which may result in  reduced numbers of candidates or withdrawals from candidates during  the pre-employment process. IHS officials said that many providers in  rural and remote locations are the sole source of income for their families,  and the potential for delays in pay resulting from a government shutdown  can serve as a disincentive for employees considering public service in  critical shortage areas that do not offer adequate spousal employment  opportunities. Tribal representatives said CRs create challenges for tribes  in funding planned pay increases\u2014such as cost-of-living adjustments\u2014 for health care staff at their facilities, and they may, as a result, defer  increases.", "IHS officials and tribal representatives stated they believe advance  appropriations could mitigate these challenges. For example, IHS officials  said that with advance appropriations, recruitment and outreach activities  could continue without disruption, and selected candidates could be  brought on board as scheduled. One tribal representative stated that  advance appropriations could help with recruitment by providing  perceived job stability that is similar to VA or the private sector.", "According to VA VISN officials, the agency\u2019s experience with advance  appropriation authority suggests that advance appropriations can facilitate  physician recruitment, including hiring. If, for example, they were far along  in the hiring process at the end of a fiscal year, but could not finalize the  hire before the end of the year, having advance appropriations for the  next fiscal year provides the certainty that they will be able to make the  hire in the new fiscal year.", "Commercial contracts and vendor negotiations. IHS officials and tribal  representatives said budget uncertainty can lead to vendor reluctance to  provide services to IHS and tribally operated facilities. IHS officials said  they have heard from vendors\u2014who are typically Indian- or veteran- owned small businesses in the communities being served by IHS\u2014that  they lose trust in IHS and federally-funded tribal health care programs  when they are affected by budget uncertainty. One tribal organization told  us delays in receiving full funding because of CRs has inhibited its ability  to pay invoices for pharmaceuticals in a timely manner, which has  harmed its relationship with its vendors.", "VISN officials told us that advance appropriations can provide an element  of stability to agency funding that may serve to reassure potential  vendors. According to VISN officials, vendors can be hard to find in  remote and rural areas, and their perception of funding certainty can play  a role in encouraging their participation as government contractors. As  contracting with the federal government can be burdensome, particularly  for smaller vendors, VISN officials said, any measures\u2014such as advance  appropriations\u2014that could enhance the stability of agency contracting  could make these vendors more likely to participate in government  contracting.", "Administrative burden and costs. IHS officials and tribal  representatives said the agency and tribes incur additional administrative  burden and costs when the government is funded through multiple CRs,  due to the high proportion of IHS funding that is transferred to tribes  through contracts and compacts. Specifically, IHS officials said there is  an additional administrative burden generated by each CR that results in  the distribution of funds to tribes. For each CR period, IHS headquarters  staff generate proportional funding allotments, which they provide to  individual area offices, which then also conduct processing activities to  generate payments from these allotments to the tribes in their areas. As  part of this process, IHS officials said they modify hundreds of tribal  contracts and make amendments to funding agreements associated with  tribal compacts, and those efforts represent a significant administrative  burden for IHS staff. Tribal representatives also described administrative  burden associated with CRs. As one representative of a group  representing several tribes told us, each CR requires the same  processing and manpower for each partial payment as for a full  apportionment, and moreover, CRs require tracking and reconciliation  that is not necessary for a single, full apportionment. IHS officials and  tribal representatives noted that time and money spent on these  additional administrative activities detract from other priorities, including  patient care.", "IHS officials said that advance appropriations would reduce this  administrative burden, and added that having advance appropriations  would allow for more efficiency in processing payments to tribes. IHS  officials suggested that the agency would have to do less administrative  work overall, because currently, under a single year appropriation (with  recurrent CRs), they may modify or amend agreements 7 or 8 times  within a fiscal year. Although acknowledging that advance appropriation  authority would entail the additional burden of preparing budget requests  for more than one fiscal year, they expect this administrative burden to be  less than those under repeated CRs.", "Financial effects on tribes. According to tribal representatives we spoke  with, funding uncertainty from recurring CRs and from government  shutdowns has led to particular adverse financial effects on tribes that  operate their own health care programs with funding from IHS. For  example, according to tribal representatives,", "Funding uncertainty surrounding a CR results in more expensive  commercial loans (with higher interest rates) to finance construction of  new health care facilities. Specifically, a tribal representative said the  uncertainty of the availability of funds due to a CR resulted in a  downgrading of the tribe\u2019s credit rating, and hence higher interest  rates, as it was planning a clinic expansion.", "During a government shutdown, some tribes must redistribute funds  from other budget categories to replace health care funding from IHS  in order to continue providing health care services. Some tribes have  economic development activities that provide additional funding and  facilitate this redistribution, but others do not. For example, one tribal  organization said that during the 2013 government shutdown, it had to  take out loans and maintain a line of credit in order to pay for services  and make payroll. Subsequently, that tribal organization had to pay  interest on those loans, causing greater financial hardship.", "Tribes attempt to mitigate the challenge of not knowing their final  annual payment from IHS under recurrent CRs by keeping extra funds  in reserve for emergencies, which limits the remaining funds available  for providing health care services.", "Short-term funding under CRs or delayed funding after a lapse in  appropriations can limit the ability of tribes and tribal organizations to  invest funds from IHS and generate interest that can be reinvested in  tribal health care programs.", "CRs have affected the ability of tribes to reduce costs by planning for  bulk purchases at favorable rates. For example, some tribes in Alaska  prefer to make bulk purchases of heating oil during \u201cbarge season\u2019\u2019\u2014 when waterways are still navigable and not frozen. If they do not have  enough money for a bulk purchase because of a CR\u2019s limited funding,  they must purchase fuel in smaller quantities, which is ultimately  significantly more expensive. Tribal representatives told us one  beneficial financial effect of advance appropriations for tribes could be  providing opportunities for longer term contracts with vendors, which  could result in cost savings that could be used for tribal health care  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Policymakers Related to Providing Advance Appropriation Authority to IHS", "paragraphs": ["We identified three types of considerations for policymakers related to  providing advanced appropriation authority to IHS\u2014operational,  congressional flexibility, and agency capacity and leadership  considerations.

If Congress were to grant IHS advance  appropriation authority, it would need to make operational decisions  regarding what amount of IHS funding would be provided in advance  appropriations, with input from OMB and IHS as appropriate. Specifically,  Congress could consider the following questions:  (1) What proportion of IHS\u2019s estimated budget would be provided in  the advance appropriation\u2014the full amount, or less (as is the case for  VA)? Which appropriations accounts would be included? Further,  would funds intended for transfer to tribes be handled differently?  (2) Under what conditions, if any, would there be changes to funding  provided through advance appropriations during the next budget  cycle? For example, would Congress expect to adjust the advance  appropriation amount through a \u201csecond bite,\u201d as is the case with VA?", "Congressional flexibility considerations. We reported in 2009 that  consideration of any proposal to change the availability of the  appropriations VA receives for health care should take into account the  impact of any change on congressional flexibility and oversight. These  same considerations hold merit regarding potential changes to the  appropriation status of any federal agency, including IHS. Specifically,  advance appropriation authority reduces flexibility for congressional  appropriators, because it reduces what is left for the overall budget for the  rest of the government\u2014meaning the total available for appropriations for  a budget year is reduced by the amount of advance appropriations for  that year, when budgets have caps.", "Agency capacity and leadership considerations. IHS officials told us  they believe the agency\u2019s current budget planning processes would be  adequate for estimating advance appropriation budget requests, because  IHS begins planning for its budget request 3 years in advance. Officials  added that IHS plans its budget so far in advance to have sufficient time  to work with tribes in formulating recommendations for its budget request.  IHS officials said that a downside to planning so far in advance is that  they do not necessarily have the most current information while  formulating the budget request. In addition, we noted prior to VA receiving  advance appropriation authority that advance appropriation authority  could potentially exacerbate existing challenges when developing or  managing a budget, generally, due in part to the higher risk of uncertainty  when developing estimates that are an additional 12 months out from the  actual budget year (e.g., 30 months out instead of 18 months).", "We raised certain capacity and leadership concerns based on our  previous work when we added IHS to our High-Risk List in 2017.  Further, in June 2018, we found that while IHS had taken some actions to partially address these concerns, additional progress was needed to fully  address these management weaknesses. For example, IHS still does  not have permanent leadership\u2014including a Director of IHS\u2014which is  necessary for the agency to demonstrate its commitment to improvement.  Additionally, while the agency has made some progress in demonstrating  it has the capacity and resources necessary to address the program risks  we identified in our reports, there are still vacancies in several key  positions, including in the Office of Finance and Accounting. While not  directly related to consideration of advance appropriations, IHS\u2019s high-risk  designation and continuing challenges in mitigating the deficiencies in its  program point to questions about the agency\u2019s capacity to implement  such a change to its budget formulation process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Third-Party Views", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and VA for review and  comment.
