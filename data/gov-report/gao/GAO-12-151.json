All financial regulators must analyze the paperwork burden imposed by their rules and consider the impact of their rules on small entities as part of their rulemaking process. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also required under their authorizing statutes to consider certain benefits and costs of their rules. As independent regulatory agencies, the federal financial regulators are not subject to executive orders requiring federal agencies to conduct detailed benefit-cost analysis in accordance with a guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Financial regulators are not required to follow OMB's guidance, but most told GAO that they attempt to follow the guidance in principle or spirit. GAO's review of regulators' rulemaking policies and 10 final rules found inconsistencies in the extent to which OMB's guidance was reflected."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that to the extent the regulators strive to follow OMB's guidance, they should take steps to more fully incorporate the guidance into their rulemaking policies and ensure that it is consistently followed. Although federal financial regulators have coordinated their rulemaking, they generally lacked formal policies to guide these efforts. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes interagency coordination requirements for certain agencies and for specific rules or subject matters. However, for other rules, the regulators have discretion as to whether interagency coordination should occur. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is tasked with facilitating coordination among member agencies but, to date, has played a limited role in doing so beyond its own rulemakings as it continues to define its role. Several regulators voluntarily coordinated with each other on some of the rules GAO reviewed. However, most of the regulators, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, lacked written protocols for interagency coordination, a leading practice that GAO has previously identified for interagency coordination. GAO recommends that FSOC work with the financial regulators to develop such protocols for Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking. Little is known about the actual impact of the final Dodd-Frank Act rules, given the short amount of time the rules have been in effect. Regulators are required to conduct reviews of existing regulations to assess their impact, but some have not yet developed plans to review their Dodd-Frank Act rules. To maximize the usefulness of these reviews, GAO recommends that the regulators identify what data will be needed to retrospectively assess the impact of the rules in the future. FSOC is also required to examine, among other things, financial market and regulatory developments and make recommendations to enhance the efficiency, competitiveness, and stability of U.S. financial markets. Although FSOC officials said that FSOC plans to include an impact analysis of the Dodd-Frank Act rules in its future reports, it has not yet begun identifying and collecting the data needed for this type of analysis. GAO recommends that FSOC direct the Office of Financial Research, an entity created to support the research needs of FSOC, to work with the regulators to identify and begin collecting data needed for future analyses. GAO is making four recommendations to the regulators and FSOC to strengthen the prospective and retrospective analyses of the impact of Dodd-Frank Act regulations on financial markets and improve coordination among financial regulators on rulemaking. Regulators and FSOC generally agreed with the report's findings but most neither agreed nor disagreed with the report's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The recent U.S. financial crisis is often described as the worst since the  Great Depression, resulting in the loss of trillions of dollars in household  wealth. The crisis threatened the stability of the U.S. financial system  and the solvency of some large financial institutions, prompting the U.S.  government to take extraordinary steps to moderate the adverse  economic impacts. In response to the crisis, Congress passed the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)  in 2010, which includes numerous reforms to strengthen oversight of  financial services firms and consolidate certain consumer protection  responsibilities in the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB).  The Dodd-Frank Act requires or authorizes various federal agencies to  issue hundreds of regulations to implement its reforms. As agencies have  turned their attention to developing and implementing these regulations,  some industry associations and others have raised concerns about the  potential impact of the regulations, individually and cumulatively, on  financial markets and both financial and nonfinancial institutions.", "Agencies can anticipate and evaluate the consequences of their  regulations through regulatory analysis. Such analysis provides a formal  way of organizing evidence that can help in understanding potential  effects of new regulations. Benefit-cost analysis, the primary tool used for  regulatory analysis, helps to identify the regulatory alternatives with the  greatest net benefits. We, along with the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and others, have identified benefit-cost analysis as a  useful tool that can inform decision making where agencies have  discretion to choose between regulatory alternatives, noting that the  systematic process of determining costs and benefits helps decision  makers organize and evaluate information about, and help identify trade- offs among, alternatives. Because of the merits of benefit-cost analysis,  many agencies are directed by statute or executive order to conduct such  analysis as part of rulemaking. For example, Executive Order 12866  (E.O. 12866) requires executive agencies to assess anticipated costs and  benefits not only of the proposed regulatory action but also of any  alternatives. However, this executive order does not apply to  independent regulatory agencies, including the banking, futures, and  securities regulators (i.e., federal financial regulators).", "Section 1573(a) of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing  Appropriations Act of 2011 amends the Dodd-Frank Act and directs GAO  to conduct an annual study of financial services regulations, including the  activities of CFPB. Specifically, we are directed to analyze (1) the impact  of regulations on the financial marketplace, including whether relevant  federal agencies are applying sound benefit-cost analysis in promulgating  rules; (2) efforts to avoid duplicative or conflicting rulemakings,  information requests, and examinations; and (3) other related matters that  we deem to be appropriate. As agreed with congressional staff, the focus  of our current review and future reviews will be limited to the financial  regulations promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and for this first  report, the Dodd-Frank Act regulations that were effective as of July 21,  2011. This report examines  the regulatory analyses, including benefit-cost analyses, that federal  financial regulators have performed to assess the potential impact of  selected final rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act;  consultation among federal financial regulators in implementing  selected final rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act to avoid  duplication or conflicts; and available information on the impact of the final Dodd-Frank Act  regulations.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed all final rules\u2014a total of 32\u2014 that were issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and were effective as of  July 21, 2011. We selected 10 of these for further review and compared  the analyses conducted to assess them in light of the principles outlined  in OMB Circular A-4. Circular A-4 provides guidance to federal agencies  on the development of regulatory analysis and was subject to public  comment, interagency review, and peer review. We selected the rules for  further review based primarily on the amount of discretion that agency  officials were able to exercise in implementing the specific Dodd-Frank  Act provision. We interviewed agency officials and reviewed  documentation from the agencies to determine the extent to which  benefit-cost or similar analyses were conducted. We also reviewed  statutes, regulations, and other documentation to identify the analysis  federal financial regulators were required to conduct and interviewed  agency officials about their plans to analyze the effects of their Dodd- Frank Act regulations. Further, we identified requirements in the Dodd- Frank Act and other laws for agency coordination on rulemaking and  assessed the extent to which such requirements were satisfied for select  regulations that were in effect as of July 21, 2011. We collected  information from the federal financial regulators on their policies and  practices for coordinating their rulemaking activities with other regulators  and about their coordination efforts specific to the selected Dodd-Frank  Act regulations that were effective as of July 21, 2011. We selected 18  rules based primarily on our judgment of the extent to which the rules  could overlap or duplicate rules issued by other agencies. We also  reviewed past GAO work on best practices for regulatory coordination  and compared the requirements for coordination among federal financial  regulators to these practices to identify any areas of needed  improvement.", "To examine what is known about the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act  regulations, we reviewed existing research and interviewed financial  regulators, industry representatives, academics, and others. We also  collected information from the regulators on the extent to which the Dodd- Frank Act rules effective as of July 21, 2011, could impact certain  variables (such as the safety and soundness of regulated entities, cost  and availability of credit, and costs of compliance with the rules) or  produce other costs and benefits. We examined the indicators and data  that federal financial regulators used, or planned to use, to assess the  impact of their regulations. We reviewed studies on the impact of the  Dodd-Frank Act regulations and assessed the strengths and weaknesses  of the impact analyses contained in these studies. Appendix I contains  additional information on our scope and methodology.", "This report does not independently assess the impact of the Dodd-Frank  Act regulations because (1) most of the required regulations have not  been finalized or the effective dates of finalized rules have not been  reached or (2) for the final regulations that have reached their effective  dates, adequate time has not elapsed to assess their impacts. In addition  to conducting audit work to address the objectives in this report, we also  began constructing a framework for our independent analyses in future  reports. While the construction of the framework continues, it may include  identifying and analyzing data to develop indicators or other measures to  assess the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act regulations. Developing a  methodology to assess the impact of Dodd-Frank Act regulations will be a  long-term, iterative process, during which we will seek the input of federal  financial regulators, the industry, and other stakeholders.", "We conducted this performance audit between April 2011 and November  2011, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Under the APA,  in addition to allowing for comments, an agency may choose to hold  public hearings during the comment period for informal rulemaking but is  not required to do so.

Requirements include those set  out in the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and the Regulatory Flexibility  Act (RFA), which impose regulatory analysis requirements on federal  agencies, including the federal financial regulators. In particular, PRA  requires agencies to justify any collection of information from the public to  minimize the paperwork burden the collection imposes and to maximize  the practical utility of the information collected. Under PRA, agencies  are required to submit all proposed information collections to OMB\u2019s  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for review and  approval.

Section 15(a) does not require  CFTC to quantify the costs and benefits of a new regulation or  determine whether the benefits outweigh its costs; rather, it requires  CFTC to consider the costs and benefits of its actions. Section 15(a)  further specifies that costs and benefits be evaluated in light of five  broad areas of market and public concern: (1) the protection of market  participants and the public; (2) the efficiency, competitiveness, and  financial integrity of futures markets; (3) price discovery; (4) sound risk  management practices; and (5) other public interest considerations.", "Under section 1022(b) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (Title  X of the Dodd-Frank Act), CFPB must consider the potential benefits  and costs to consumers and providers of consumer financial products  and services, including any potential reduction in consumers\u2019 access  to consumer financial products or services that might result from the  rule, as well as the impact of proposed rules on depository institutions  and credit unions with $10 billion or less in assets and consumers in  rural areas.

However, the federal financial  regulators, as independent regulatory agencies, are not subject to the  economic analysis requirements of E.O. 12866. The order contains 12  principles of regulation that direct agencies to perform specific analyses  to identify the problem to be addressed, assess its significance, assess  both the costs and benefits of the intended regulation, design the  regulation in the most cost-effective manner to achieve the regulatory  objective, and base decisions on the best reasonably obtained  information available. In 2003, OMB issued Circular A-4 to provide  guidance to federal agencies on the development of regulatory analysis  required by E.O. 12866 (now supplemented by Executive Order 13563  (E.O. 13563)). The guidance defines good regulatory analysis and  standardizes the way benefits and costs of federal regulatory actions  should be measured and reported. In particular, the guidance provides for  more systematic evaluation of qualitative and quantitative benefits and  costs, including how to monetize them (fig. 1). OMB subjected its  guidance to public comment, interagency review, and peer review.  Although federal financial regulatory agencies are not required to follow  E.O. 12866 or OMB Circular A-4, CFTC, Federal Reserve Board, FDIC,  NCUA, OCC, and SEC officials have said that their agencies follow  OMB\u2019s guidance in spirit or principle. CFPB officials also said that the  Bureau expects to follow the spirit of OMB\u2019s guidance.", "As required by statute and internal policies, federal financial regulators  conducted a variety of regulatory analyses as part of their Dodd-Frank Act  rulemakings. We reviewed the regulators\u2019 rulemaking policies and  procedures and found that they provided guidance consistent with their  statutory requirements, such as PRA and RFA. In this regard, our findings  are consistent with the recent findings of the Inspectors General of CFTC,  the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Treasury (for OCC), FDIC,  and SEC. At the request of 10 members of the U.S. Senate Committee  on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, these Inspectors General  reviewed the economic analyses done by their agencies for several  proposed Dodd-Frank Act rules. They found that the agencies largely  followed the statutory and other requirements applicable to their  rulemaking and related economic analysis.", "Although most of the federal financial regulators told us that they tried to  follow Circular A-4 in principle or spirit, their policies and procedures did  not fully reflect OMB guidance on regulatory analysis. For example, FDIC,  the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and NCUA all have general policies  that reflect the broad regulatory analysis principles associated with  Circular A-4\u2014such as determining the need for a regulation and  examining alternative approaches. CFTC\u2019s and SEC\u2019s policies also  include examples of benefit-cost analysis that reflect statutory  requirements to consider certain types of benefits and costs. However,  the regulators\u2019 policies generally do not fully address the information  challenges that regulators encounter as they draft regulations, as such  challenges are addressed by Circular A-4. In general, the regulators\u2019  policies did not include the level of detail or instruction found in Circular A- 4 for carrying out regulatory analyses. As noted, these regulators are not  subject to the economic analysis requirements of E.O. 12866 or 13563  and, in turn, the OMB guidance. Importantly, the guidance serves as best  practices for conducting regulatory analysis and, thus, provides an  objective basis for identifying areas where the regulators could improve  their policies and procedures as well as the quality of their regulatory  analyses.", "Federal financial regulators had limited or no discretion in connection with  the majority of the Dodd-Frank Act rules that we reviewed. Twenty-one of  the 32 final rules that were effective as of July 21, 2011, are mandatory\u2014  that is, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the agencies to adopt regulations  containing substantive provisions specified by the statute. As a result, the  agencies were provided with little or no discretion as to whether or how to  implement these statutory provisions. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act  eliminated the prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposit  accounts, requiring FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board to repeal  certain regulations to reflect the statutory change. Eleven of the final rules  provided the regulators with some level of discretion in implementation.  Three of the rules were identified by the regulators as \u201cmajor\u201d rules that  could have a $100 million or more annual impact on the economy and  would thus, as significant regulatory actions, be subject to formal benefit- cost analysis under E.O. 12866 if the relevant agencies were required to  follow it. See appendix III for information about the 32 Dodd-Frank Act  rules that were effective as July 21, 2011.", "Through our review of the regulatory analyses conducted by federal  financial regulators for their Dodd-Frank Act regulations, we found areas  where such analyses could have been improved if the regulators had  applied OMB\u2019s guidance more fully. We reviewed 10 of the final rules that  allowed for some level of discretion on the part of the regulator. Each of  the 10 regulations included a discussion of the regulatory analyses the  agencies performed to comply with RFA and PRA. For most of the  regulations, the regulators concluded that the regulation would not have a  \u201csignificant economic impact\u201d on small businesses per RFA. For instance,  some regulations covered a line of business (e.g., retail foreign  exchange) in which no small entities were engaged. One RFA analysis  identified cost savings for small businesses as a result of the rule. The  regulators also identified the information collection requirements that their  rules would impose on regulated entities, per PRA. For one PRA analysis  the agency monetized the costs of providing required information and five  other analyses quantified the hours needed to provide that information. In  particular, two rules promulgated by SEC had information collection  requirements that were essential to the rule. For those rules, SEC  considered alternative requirements for regulated entities and provided  reasons for choosing the alternative selected. For an OCC rule, a  separate impact analysis was conducted to determine whether the rule  would have an annual cost of $100 million or more, in accordance with  the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and the Congressional Review Act.  (See app. II for information about these statutory requirements.)", "For each of the 10 regulations, we found that the regulators identified the  problem that the regulation was intended to address and, in 6 cases,  assessed the problem\u2019s significance. In addition, we found that the  regulators used the statutory discretion allowed to examine reasonable  alternatives. In many instances, they requested public comments on  specific elements of the regulation and then examined alternative  regulatory approaches in the context of responding to the comments.  Most of the regulations also considered different compliance dates for  enforcement to begin. For example, one agency found that its regulation  would impact municipalities and thus provided a transition period for  compliance of over 3 years for municipal entities.", "For 7 of the 10 regulations we reviewed, the agencies generally assessed  benefits and costs of the alternative chosen. Specifically, SEC and CFTC  analyzed the benefits and costs of their regulations and FDIC included  discussions of benefits and costs in response to comments about specific  elements of its regulations. As recommended by OMB\u2019s guidance, the  analyses generally included: descriptions of the benefits and costs that accrue to U.S. citizens and descriptions of the benefits and costs measured against a baseline, descriptions of the reasons for choosing among reasonable descriptions of the benefits and costs that could not be monetized or  quantified, and  cross-references to data or studies on which the analysis was based.", "While these aspects of the regulators\u2019 benefit-cost analyses were  consistent with OMB\u2019s guidance, other aspects of the analyses were not.  In particular, one of the seven benefit-cost analyses monetized the costs  of the regulation, but the analysis did not monetize the benefits. None of  the other analyses monetized either the benefits or costs, identified the  type and timing of them, or expressed them in constant dollars. According  to Circular A-4, monetizing allows regulators to evaluate different  regulatory options using a common measure. When it is not possible to  monetize a benefit or cost, OMB\u2019s guidance encourages agencies to  measure it quantitatively, in terms of its physical units. Two of the seven  benefit-cost analyses quantified the benefits and costs of the regulation  that could not be monetized; the remaining five regulations that assessed  benefits and costs did not attempt to quantify either the benefits or the  costs. When it is not possible to measure benefits and costs monetarily or  quantitatively, OMB guidance instructs agencies to present qualitative  information on benefits and costs, including a discussion of the strengths  and limitations of the qualitative information. However, none of the  benefit-cost analyses of the federal financial regulators that we reviewed  either explained why benefits and costs could not be monetized or  quantified or discussed the strengths and limitations of the available  qualitative information. In addition, only two of the seven benefit-cost  analyses looked beyond direct benefits and costs and considered any  important ancillary benefits, costs, and countervailing risks, as  recommended by OMB guidance. Without monetized or quantified  benefits and costs, or an understanding of the reasons they cannot be  monetized or quantified, it is difficult for businesses and consumers to  determine if the most cost-beneficial regulatory alternative was selected  or to understand the limitations of the analysis performed. See appendix  IV for more information about the regulatory analysis, including the  benefit-cost analysis, of the 10 regulations that we reviewed.", "Although federal financial regulators said that they followed OMB\u2019s  guidance in spirit or principle, we found areas where regulators could  have improved their regulatory analyses by applying OMB\u2019s guidance  more fully. As a result, regulators may be missing an opportunity to  enhance the rigor and improve the transparency of their analyses. The  current administration has made efforts to encourage federal financial  regulatory agencies to conduct more rigorous analysis of financial  regulations. For instance, in July 2011, the President signed E.O. 13579  to encourage independent regulatory agencies to comply with E.O. 13563  (which supplements E.O. 12866) and enhance the rigor and transparency  of their analyses. In addition, in its 2011 annual report to Congress, OMB  emphasized that better information on the benefits and costs of the rules  issued by independent regulatory agencies would help in informing the  public and obtaining a full accounting of the rules\u2019 benefits and costs.

For example, representatives  from industry and consumer associations said that the regulatory  analyses done to date for the proposed and finalized Dodd-Frank Act  regulations generally focused on measuring the costs associated with  data collection and did not provide information on the possible impact of  regulations on the behavior of businesses and consumers. While they  were critical of the analyses conducted, the representatives also  recognized that the regulators faced challenges in producing meaningful  regulatory analyses, in part because of tight time frames for issuing  regulations and the lack of available data.", "Further, some academics and policy analysts have argued that benefit- cost analyses of financial regulations have not been as rigorous as those  done for other regulations. Specifically, a review of financial regulations  by one analyst led him to conclude that \u201cthe nation\u2019s financial regulators  ha largely failed to perform the rigorous analysis required of most other  government agencies, especially those in the fields of health, safety, and  environmental regulation.\u201d Other policy analysts concluded that  regulatory analyses by independent regulatory agencies, including some  federal financial regulators \u201cgenerally do not analyze economic effects in  a manner intended to meet any identifiable standards for such analysis.\u201d  However, an academic with whom we spoke stated that additional cost- benefit analysis requirements will provide only a marginal increase in  value; instead, according to the academic, the goal should be to  accomplish regulatory objectives at minimum cost. As we have reported,  the difficulty of reliably estimating the costs of regulations to the financial  services industry and the nation has long been recognized, and the  benefits of regulation generally are regarded as even more difficult to  measure. This situation presents challenges for regulators attempting to  estimate the anticipated costs of regulations and also for industries  seeking to substantiate claims about regulatory burdens. For example,  while compliance costs of financial regulations can usually be estimated  and measured, the economic costs of transactions foregone as the result  of regulation can be more difficult to anticipate and measure.", "Other entities have also identified shortcomings in some of the regulators\u2019  benefit-cost analyses. For example, the United States Court of Appeals  for the District of Columbia Circuit determined that SEC failed to  adequately assess the economic aspects of a regulation. In addition, in  the spring of 2011, the CFTC Inspector General found that for four rules it  examined, CFTC generally adopted a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach without  giving significant regard to the deliberations addressing idiosyncratic cost  and benefit issues that were shaping each rule. CFTC has since revised  its staff guidance on cost-benefit considerations for Dodd-Frank Act  rulemakings and provided guidance to address the recommendations of  the Inspector General.", "Finally, many federal financial regulators told us that it could be  challenging to obtain the best economic information available to conduct  their regulatory analyses in a timely manner. For example, a regulator  stated that much of the information is held by regulated entities and  considered proprietary, and neither the regulators nor the regulated  entities want the information made public during the public rulemaking  process. Also, some regulators note that PRA limits their ability to request  information outside of the public rulemaking process from ten or more  entities at a time unless OMB does an extensive review of and approves  the request. Furthermore, given the time constraints for performing  regulatory analysis for Dodd-Frank Act regulations, a regulator said that  the time required to complete an OMB review could preclude them from  being able to pursue information outside the rulemaking process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Financial Regulators Have Informally Coordinated Their Rulemaking Efforts but Generally Lack Policies to Guide These Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The Dodd-Frank Act requires or authorizes the federal financial regulators  to promulgate hundreds of rulemakings.

For instance, authority for developing and adopting  regulations to implement Section 619, also known as the Volcker Rule, is  divided among the CFTC, FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and  SEC. While the Dodd-Frank Act does not require all of the regulators to  issue a joint rulemaking on the Volcker Rule, it does require that the  regulators consult and coordinate with each other, in part to ensure that  their regulations are comparable.

Two of the rules required interagency coordination  under the Dodd-Frank Act, but none of the other 16 rules were joint rules  or specifically required interagency coordination. Regulators told us that  the importance of coordination was established early on by their senior  leadership, who met shortly after the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act to  identify and discuss areas in which interagency coordination could be  useful and establish interagency working groups or points of contacts  where necessary. For the two rules that required interagency  coordination, SEC staff told us that they met with staff from other  agencies and provided them with rule-related materials for their review  and comment. The staff said that they did not receive any substantive  comments and noted that the rules did not potentially duplicate or conflict  with any of the other agencies\u2019 rules. While regulators were not required  to coordinate on any of the other 16 rules that we reviewed\u2014for example,  because the rules were administrative or fell within the exclusive purview  of a single regulator\u2014they chose to coordinate or consult with other  regulators on seven rules for a variety of reasons. For instance, Section  343 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to  provide unlimited deposit insurance for \u201cnoninterest-bearing transaction  accounts\u201d for a 2-year period. Before issuing its rule to adopt this  requirement, FDIC staff told us they had held informal discussions with  Federal Reserve Board staff about whether certain types of payments to  depositors qualified as interest. FDIC staff told us that no other  consultation took place, given that the scope of the proposed rule was  minimal. For rules that raised some concerns about duplication or conflict,  however, coordination was broader in scope. For example, CFTC, FDIC,  and OCC issued separate rules to regulate off-exchange foreign  exchange transactions that their regulated entities entered into with retail  customers. OCC staff told us that the regulators\u2014including CFTC,  Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, NCUA, and SEC\u2014had voluntarily  consulted one another before issuing the rule.", "In discussing the ways in which they had coordinated with other  regulators on rulemakings to date, regulators generally described informal  processes. For example, to help facilitate coordination, a number of the  regulators said that they had identified points of contact at other  regulators for specific rules. They used those points of contact to solicit  comments on draft proposed rules or obtain other information and data  through e-mail or phone calls. Similarly, CFPB staff also said that they  had informally consulted with other regulators on rulemaking through  conference calls and by sharing portions of draft rules for review.", "Although federal financial regulators informally coordinated with each  other on some of the final rules that we reviewed, most of the regulators  lacked written policies and procedures to facilitate interagency  coordination. Specifically, seven of nine regulators included in our review  did not have written policies and procedures to facilitate coordination on  rulemaking. For example, CFPB is in the process of developing policies  and procedures for coordination on rulemaking, including how to resolve  jurisdictional or other disagreements in rulemaking. As noted earlier,  CFPB is required to consult with the appropriate prudential regulators or  other federal agencies both before proposing a rule and during the  comment process. According to CFPB officials, the Bureau is considering  various coordination issues and working to establish policies or  procedures to facilitate coordination. CFPB officials noted that they were  still setting up CFPB and that many decisions, including how CFPB would  coordinate with other regulators, remained to be determined. The officials  also said that CFPB was committed to fulfilling the coordination  requirements set for it in the Dodd-Frank Act.", "Moreover, the written policies and procedures that do exist are limited in  their scope or applicability. FDIC and OCC are the only two of the nine  regulators that have rulemaking policies that include guidance on  developing interagency rules. For example, FDIC\u2019s policy manual for  developing rules includes a section on developing an interagency rule or  statement of policy that describes the roles and responsibilities of the  agencies in the process. Similarly, OCC\u2019s rulemaking procedures manual  includes guidance on interagency rulemakings and outlines, among other  things, how staff will be designated to represent OCC in such rulemakings  and the responsibilities of the designated staff. However, neither FDIC\u2019s  nor OCC\u2019s policies describe the process for soliciting and addressing  other regulators\u2019 comments, including conflicting views. Other regulators  have procedures in place that could facilitate coordination, but these  procedures are also limited. For instance, FSOC has developed a  consultation framework that provides timeframes for holding initial  meetings to discuss potential approaches to regulation and circulating  term sheets and proposals to enact the regulation. However, the  framework applies only to rules for which consultation with FSOC is  required. Additionally, SEC and CFTC have a memorandum of  understanding that establishes a permanent regulatory liaison between  them and contains procedures to facilitate the discussion and  coordination of regulatory action on issues of common regulatory interest,  such as novel derivative products. Such regulatory actions can include  investigations, examinations, and individual rulemakings.", "Documented policies can help ensure that adequate coordination takes  place and help to improve interagency relationships, prevent the  duplication of efforts at a time when resources are extremely limited, and  avoid the potential for disruptions across financial markets caused by  regulatory uncertainty. In prior work, we have identified the establishment  of compatible policies and procedures to allow for efficiency of operations  across agency boundaries as a best practice for sustaining and  enhancing collaborative efforts across federal regulatory agencies. As  we have previously reported, the lack of compatible standards, policies,  and procedures can hinder collaboration.

First, because FSOC is made up of all the federal  financial regulators and other entities, and the regulators are all voting  members, it is an interagency body by definition and takes actions on that  basis. Second, FSOC staff told us that the council has established  committees and subcommittees to help carry out its responsibilities and  authorities, further promoting interagency coordination. These groups  are comprised of staff from FSOC member agencies and can facilitate  informal coordination outside of FSOC\u2019s explicit coordination  requirements. For example, the Systemic Risk Committee identified  mortgage servicing as a key issue that had interagency implications and  was able to get staff from the relevant agencies to work together to  prioritize this as a recommended area for regulatory action in the annual  report, according to FSOC staff. Third, as FSOC Chairperson, the  Secretary of the Treasury can also promote coordination among member  agencies. In its 2010 annual report, FSOC noted that its chairperson was  playing an active role in coordinating the agencies\u2019 work to draft  consistent and comparable regulations to implement the proprietary  trading and the joint risk retention rules, as required under the Dodd- Frank Act.", "In addition to its organizational structure, FSOC also has developed tools  to facilitate formal coordination and promote informal coordination among  its members. For example, FSOC has developed a consultation  framework for the rulemakings for which consultation with FSOC is  required. The framework establishes time frames for coordinating three  key tasks in these rulemakings: initial interagency meetings, circulation of  term sheets for interagency comments, and circulation of proposed rules  for interagency comments. In addition, in October 2010 FSOC issued an  integrated implementation roadmap for the Dodd-Frank Act that included  a comprehensive list of the rules regulators were required to promulgate,  provided a timeline for those rulemakings, and identified the agencies  responsible for each rulemaking.", "Although these tools are a positive development in facilitating  coordination, they have limited usefulness. For example, although the  FSOC consultation framework specifies the time frames for completing  major milestones in rulemakings for which consultation with FSOC is  required, it does not provide any specifics about staff responsibilities or  the processes to be used to facilitate coordination, and FSOC staff told us  the framework is not intended to do so. It also applies only to coordination  between FSOC and member agencies. Also, the roadmap does not  discuss coordination among member agencies. For example, the extent  to which interagency coordination is required or what happens when  rulemakings conflict with or duplicate each other is not mentioned.  Representatives from industry associations told us that FSOC\u2019s  coordination efforts in their view generally had not been useful and should  be strengthened. For example, according to industry representatives,  FSOC has not used its position to help agencies sequence the rules in a  logical order to give industry the ability to comment on the rules in a  meaningful way.", "Another coordination body in the federal financial arena is the Federal  Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). FFIEC, established  through statute in 1978, is a formal interagency body empowered to  prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal  examination of financial institutions by the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC,  NCUA, OCC, and the State Liaison Committee, and to make  recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of these  financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act does not require FFIEC to  play a coordinating or consultative role in any of the act\u2019s rulemaking  efforts.

Indeed, nearly half of the final  Dodd-Frank Act rules that were effective as of July 21, 2011, did not  take effect until after July 1, 2011, and will require time to implement.  For example, OCC and FDIC separately issued rules to allow banks  to engage in foreign-exchange transactions with retail customers that  became effective on July 15, 2011. Before engaging in such  transactions under the new rules, banks must take a number of  actions, such as obtaining permission from their regulators, modifying  systems to meet new disclosure and recordkeeping requirements, and  establishing and implementing internal rules, procedures, and controls  to comply with new trading and operational standards. Referring to the  yet-to-be-issued derivatives rules, representatives from a derivatives  association and a coalition of various national and state organizations  told us that it would take firms a significant amount of time, perhaps  years, to set up the infrastructure and develop the systems and  models needed to comply with those rules. Additionally, officials from  the Federal Reserve Board and two labor unions told us that the  impact and associated benefits and costs of the Dodd-Frank Act rules  could not be determined until the economy has gone through at least  one business cycle.", "Representatives from a banking association told us that the majority  of final rules that were effective as of July 21, 2011, were not  expected to have a significant effect\u2014both because of their scope  and the relatively small number of them. For example, some of the  Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings to date are orders, notices, or similar  actions rather than regulations that directly impact regulated  institutions and the markets. Industry representatives said that many  of the final rules that were in effect as of July 2011 are likely to have  minimal impact, but that some of the forthcoming rules would have a  significant impact, such as those involving mortgages, derivatives  trading and clearing, and consumer financial protection. In addition,  representatives from another banking association said that banks are  just beginning to understand the rules and that only a fraction of the  rules have been finalized. Moreover, Federal Reserve Board officials  said that estimating the cumulative impact of the Dodd-Frank Act rules  was not yet possible because few of the act\u2019s provisions had taken  effect.", "Some of the final rules are related to rules that are forthcoming; as a  result, the impact of these rules needs to be assessed in combination,  not in isolation. Regulators have not drafted and issued the rules in an  appropriate sequence, in part because of statutory deadlines, creating  a situation in which one rule will be affected by another rule that has  not yet been proposed. For example, the Federal Reserve Board  issued a rule to establish the period within which financial institutions  would need to bring their activities and investments into compliance  with the Volcker Rule. Authority for developing and adopting  regulations to implement the Volcker Rule is divided among the  Federal Reserve Board, OCC, FDIC, SEC, and CFTC, but these  agencies had not yet proposed such rules as of July 21, 2011. In  addition, federal financial regulators are drafting and implementing  Basel III and other non-Dodd-Frank Act rules that could have related  economic effects on regulated entities.", "Likely reflecting the early stages of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank  Act, our search of several economic journal databases did not identify any  retrospective studies that analyzed the economic impact of the Dodd- Frank Act regulations.

In our prior  work, we identified procedures and practices that could be particularly  helpful in improving the effectiveness of retrospective reviews. In  particular, we noted that agencies would be better prepared to undertake  reviews if they had identified the needed data before beginning a review  and, even better, before promulgating the rule. If agencies fail to plan for  how they will measure the performance of their rules and how they will  obtain the data they need to do so, they may be limited in their ability to  accurately measure the progress or true effect of the regulations. For  example, by not engaging in advance planning, an agency may realize  too late that it lacks the necessary baseline data to assess regulations  promulgated years before.

To the extent feasible,  we plan to analyze not only the specific impact of selected rules but also  the overall impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, using quantitative methods  wherever possible. However, it will be difficult to quantify all of the  potential impacts, especially those that are expected to materialize over a  longer period of time or that require the forecasting of indirect causal  relationships. As a result we plan to augment any quantitative analysis we  conduct with qualitative assessments to provide information in these  areas. We also plan to monitor and report on relevant macroeconomic  indicators, some of which will be directly related to the variables  enumerated in our mandate. To that end, we are developing criteria for  selecting rules for impact analysis and identifying potential methodologies  and data sources. Given that the rules are being promulgated on an  ongoing basis, we plan to analyze our selected rules on a similar basis  once sufficient time has passed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the immediate future, federal financial regulators will need to craft  hundreds of regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s reforms. The  breadth of the issues and the short time frames involved present  numerous challenges, including allocating sufficient time and resources to  developing and analyzing the potential effects of the rules to identify the  regulatory alternative with the greatest net benefits. To find that  alternative, regulators would ideally monetize the anticipated benefits and  costs of regulations during rulemakings. However, anticipating,  evaluating, and measuring the potential impact of financial regulations\u2014 especially the potential benefits\u2014historically have proven difficult. Indeed,  for the rules we reviewed, monetization of costs largely was limited to  paperwork-related costs and excluded other direct and indirect costs, and  monetization of benefits was nonexistent. These efforts, while positive,  fall short of what could be done to determine the potential costs and  benefits of the new rules.", "The guidelines in OMB Circular A-4 could help in addressing the  challenges involved in analyzing the potential costs and benefits. It  recognizes that benefits and costs cannot always be monetized or  quantified and provides guidance for evaluating their significance when  they cannot be. For example, it directs agencies to disclose the strengths  and limitations of unquantified benefits and costs, including why they  cannot be quantified, and explain the rationale behind a regulatory choice  that is made using unquantified information. Although the federal financial  regulators are not required to follow this guidance, most of them told us  that they did so in spirit or principle. While some regulators had  completed some of OMB\u2019s recommended analyses, we also found  inconsistencies in the extent to which the analyses\u2014and some  rulemaking policies\u2014reflected OMB\u2019s guidance. For example, the  regulators\u2019 analyses described the need for regulatory action and  described the qualitative benefits and costs of the chosen alternative.  However, the analyses did not explain why benefits and costs could not  be monetized or quantified and did not discuss the strengths and  limitations of the available qualitative information. By taking steps to more  fully incorporate OMB\u2019s guidelines in their rulemaking policies and  procedures, federal financial regulators could enhance the rigor and  transparency of their regulatory analyses. By taking such action,  regulators could demonstrate the rationale behind their regulatory  decisions and ensure that the alternatives they have chosen are in fact  the most cost-beneficial options.", "Throughout the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act rules, coordination  among the federal financial regulators will be critical because of the  breadth of issues addressed and the number of regulators issuing  concurrent rules. With adequate and timely coordination, regulators may  avoid overlapping, duplicative, or conflicting rules that could create  market inefficiencies. We found that regulators had coordinated on some  of the rules that were effective as of July 2011. Such coordination is a  positive stepping stone for future coordination. However, we also found  that most of the coordination, to date, had been informal and ad hoc. We  also found that most of the federal financial regulators included in our  review, including CFPB, did not have formal policies to guide interagency  coordination. While informal and ad hoc coordination can produce the  desired results, such coordination can break down when disagreements  arise or other work becomes pressing. Formal policies can institutionalize  informal coordination practices and provide a framework for coordinating,  helping to ensure that regulators are appropriately consulted and that  their views, including conflicting viewpoints, are addressed in a consistent  and transparent fashion. Given its membership and charge to help  facilitate coordination among its member agencies, FSOC is positioned to  work with the federal financial regulatory agencies to establish compatible  policies that would guide and facilitate interagency coordination among its  members throughout the course of Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings.", "After the regulations are implemented, federal financial regulators will  need to revisit their prospective analyses of Dodd-Frank Act regulations in  light of actual outcomes to help ensure that the Dodd-Frank Act  regulations are achieving their intended purpose without creating  unintended consequences that negatively impact the markets. The  regulators are required to conduct retrospective reviews of their  regulations, including rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act in the  future. However, some of the regulators have not yet developed plans of  how to review their Dodd-Frank Act regulations after they are  implemented. The regulators are still in the early stages of their  rulemaking processes and have issued only a small number of the  required rules, but not establishing baseline data early on could  complicate later assessments. As we have found, a common challenge to  conducting effective retrospective reviews is the lack of baseline data for  assessing regulations promulgated years before. By taking steps during  the initial rulemaking to determine how to measure the effects of the  Dodd-Frank Act regulations, including determining how and when to  collect, analyze, and report needed data, federal financial regulators  could better position themselves to conduct effective retrospective  reviews.", "Similarly, under the Dodd-Frank Act, FSOC is also required to conduct  periodic studies. As part of these future efforts, FSOC plans to assess  significant Dodd-Frank Act regulations, including some that may not have  systemic risk implications but could affect the stability, efficiency, or  competitiveness of the U.S. financial markets. Opportunities exist for  FSOC and its members to leverage and complement each other\u2019s  retrospective analyses. To date, however, FSOC has not directed the  Office of Financial Research to help it identify and collect the data that will  be needed.

FDIC, OCC, and SEC  also noted that they are not subject to E.O. 12866 and the accompanying  OMB guidance, although they each agreed to look for opportunities to  more fully incorporate the guidance into their rulemaking process. In  addition, CFPB noted its commitment to evidence-based rulemaking, and  the Federal Reserve Board said it will consider appropriate ways to  incorporate applicable recommendations into its rulemaking efforts. With  regard to the recommendation on developing coordination policies, FSOC  noted the importance of coordination and said it would consider the  recommendations as it continues to improve protocols and CFTC outlined  its coordination efforts. In addition, while agreeing that interagency  coordination is important, OCC and SEC also noted in their letters that  efforts to improve coordination through FSOC must be balanced with the  need to ensure that the independence of each regulator is not affected.   We agree that the independence of the regulators is vital to their work,  and we do not believe working with FSOC and the other regulators to  establish formal coordination policies will diminish the regulators\u2019  independence.

See appendix III. To identify these rules, we  used a Web site maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis  that tracks Dodd-Frank Act regulations. We corroborated the data with  publicly available information on Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking compiled by  the law firm Davis Polk and Wardwell.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed statutes, regulations, GAO  and inspector general studies, and other documentation to identify the  benefit-cost or similar analyses federal financial regulators are required to  conduct in conjunction with rulemaking. We selected 10 of the 32 rules for  further review, comparing the benefit-cost or similar analyses to relevant  principles outlined in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  Circular A-4. We selected the rules for further review based primarily on  the amount of discretion that agency officials were able to exercise in  implementing the specific Dodd-Frank Act provision. To determine  agency discretion, we reviewed the Federal Register notices for the  agency\u2019s determination of the discretion it was granted. To compare  these rules to the principles in Circular A-4, we developed a checklist with  the principles and applied the checklist to all 10 rules. In conducting each  individual analysis, we reviewed the Federal Register notices and any  supplemental benefit-cost or similar data prepared by the agencies during  the course of the rulemaking. Based on each individual checklist, we  prepared a summary checklist that analyzed the extent to which the rules  as a group complied with the Circular A-4 principles. We also interviewed  officials from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability  Oversight Council, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Financial Research, OMB, and  Securities and Exchange Commission to determine the extent to which  benefit-cost or similar analyses were conducted and whether the  analyses were required by statute, regulation, or executive order. Finally,  we interviewed officials from the inspectors general of several federal  financial regulators; representatives from various industry and other  associations, including the American Bankers Association, Americans for  Financial Reform, Business Roundtable, Consumer Bankers Association,  Futures Industry Association, Independent Community Bankers of  America, International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Managed  Funds Association, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce; representatives  from the American Federation of Labor-Council of Industrial  Organizations and Association of Federal, State, County, and Municipal  Employees; and others, including academics and consultants, about their  views on the benefit-cost analyses being done by federal financial  regulators in their Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed the Dodd-Frank Act,  regulations, and studies, including GAO reports, to identify the  coordination and consultation requirements federal financial regulators  are required to conduct in conjunction with rulemaking. We selected 18  rules for further review\u2014two of which required interagency coordination  under the Dodd-Frank Act. We selected the other rules for further review  based primarily on our judgment as to whether the rules could have  benefited from any interagency coordination or consultation. To make our  determination, we looked for regulations involving issues or subject  matters that were overseen by multiple federal financial regulators.  Among the 32 rules that were effective as of July 21, 2011, we identified  three notices and one list that had coordination or consultation  requirements. We did not include these agency releases in our review  because they are not regulations. We then sent out questionnaires for  each of the judgmentally selected rules to staff at the regulatory agencies  responsible for promulgating the rules. We compiled and reviewed the  completed questionnaires to assess how coordination and consultation  were taking place between or among the regulatory agencies. We also  interviewed officials from the federal financial regulatory agencies  identified above to determine the extent to which coordination occurred  during their Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking. We sent questionnaires to each  federal financial regulatory agency we interviewed to identify what broad  policies and procedures they have developed to facilitate interagency  coordination and consultation. In addition, we interviewed industry  representatives and others identified in objective one to obtain their views  on interagency coordination and consultation in connection with the  Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings.", "To address our third objective, we conducted literature searches to  identify academic and other studies that assessed the impact of the  Dodd-Frank Act, generally, or its various provisions and regulations,  specifically.
