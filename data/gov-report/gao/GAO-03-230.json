Although the national contract was intended to be a mandatory source of office supplies, the Postal Service purchased less than 40 percent of its office supplies from Boise in 2001. GAO found that the Postal Service did not perform as planned under the contract because it did not take sufficient actions to ensure that the contract would be used. As a result, the Postal Service has not been able to realize its estimated annual savings of $28 million. In fact, it was only able to provide documentation for $1 million in savings for 2001. Boise and the Postal Service have not paid sufficient attention to the subcontracting plan. The plan contains obvious ambiguities, and, in fact, Postal Service and Boise officials disagree on its goals. The Postal Service maintains that the goal is 30 percent of Boise's annual revenue from the contract. Boise has fallen far short of this goal, reporting that only 2.6 percent of subcontracting dollars were awarded to small, minority-, and woman-owned businesses in fiscal year 2001. Postal Service and Boise officials recognize that the performance on the subcontracting plan is not satisfactory and are taking a number of steps to achieve the plan's goals. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that the current subcontracting goals will be met. The Postal Service reported that its small, minority-, and woman-owned business achievements have declined from fiscal years 1999 to 2001. Despite the Postal Service's reported statistics, we could not determine the extent to which it is buying directly from these businesses because the data are unreliable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past two years, the United States Postal Service experienced growing financial difficulties and struggled to fulfill its mission of providing affordable, high-quality universal service, while remaining self-supporting. Consequently, GAO reported that the Postal Service\u2019s current business model was at risk and placed its transformation and long-term outlook on our high-risk list in April 2001. To transform the organization, reduce costs, and increase productivity, the Postal Service is, among other things, redesigning purchasing and material management functions to capture potential savings through a supply chain management initiative. The supply chain encompasses marketing, distribution, planning, manufacturing, and purchasing. One area of focus for this initiative is office supplies, on which the Postal Service spent $125 million in fiscal year 2001. To implement supply chain management for office supplies, the Postal Service awarded a national office supply contract to Boise Office Solutions (Boise) in January 2000. Under the terms of the contract, Postal Service buyers are required, with a few exceptions, to purchase all office supplies from this contract. The Postal Service estimated that this contract would enable it to save up to $28 million annually.", "The Postal Service, which is not subject to the Small Business Act, is not required to establish goals for contract awards to small businesses. However, the Postal Service has established a supplier diversity program and tracks dollars awarded to small, minority-owned, and woman-owned (SMW) businesses (minority- and woman-owned businesses can be large or small). One of the ways the Postal Service expects to increase the dollars going to these businesses is through SMW subcontracting. For example, Boise was required to submit a subcontracting plan to reach SMW businesses. In light of the potential impact of the Boise contract on small business vendors, you asked us to assess (1) the status of the Postal Service\u2019s implementation of its national contract with Boise, (2) Boise\u2019s achievement of its SMW subcontracting plan goals, and (3) the extent to which the Postal Service is buying office supplies directly from SMW businesses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Postal Service, an independent establishment of the executive branch of the U.S. government, is the largest federal civilian agency, consisting of more than 38,000 post offices, branches, and stations and 350 major mail-processing and distribution facilities. As part of its strategy for better managing its procurement of goods and services, the Postal Service has centralized the procurement of commodities that were previously decentralized. For example, all office supply procurements are now managed by the Office Products and Utilities Category Management Center in Windsor, Connecticut, which is responsible for administering the national contract. Previously, office supply procurement was decentralized, with each area managing its own procurements.", "To demonstrate its commitment to reaching SMW businesses, the Postal Service has developed a 5-year supplier diversity plan. The plan focuses on maintaining a strong supplier base that includes SMW businesses. While it does not set specific dollar goals, the plan is intended to ensure that the Postal Service spends an increasing amount of its procurement dollars on goods and services from diverse businesses through fiscal year 2003. To monitor its progress, the Postal Service measures its prime and subcontracting spending achievements with SMW businesses.", "During fiscal years 1999 through 2001, Postal Service procurement of goods and services (which includes office supplies) decreased from $3.5 billion to $2.6 billion. For the same time period, office supply procurement grew from $107 million to $125 million. Postal Service officials explained that this increase does not necessarily indicate an actual increase in office supply spending, but rather it reflects improvements in the procurement system\u2019s ability to track spending. The officials indicated that the data provided, while not perfect, are the best available information.", "In October 1999, the Postal Service issued a solicitation for a national-level office supply contract. Four vendors submitted proposals. The solicitation provided that the award would be made to the vendor that offered the best overall value to the government, considering nonprice and price factors. The proposals were evaluated based on several factors, including the vendors\u2019 demonstrated understanding of the solicitation\u2019s (1) technical requirements, including the ability to implement and maintain a Web-based procurement system, and (2) business requirements. As part of their business plan, vendors were required to demonstrate their ability to deliver items within 24 hours of receiving an order, which is considered industry standard. Other factors on which the proposals were evaluated, in descending order of importance, were the inclusion of a subcontracting plan demonstrating the vendor\u2019s commitment to use SMW businesses, the ability to address environmental and energy conservation efforts.", "An explanation of the price discounts on items offered to the Postal Service, the ability to provide financial and purchasing reports that are integrated with the Postal Service\u2019s system, and the ability to provide Postal Service items, other than office supplies, that are used in an office setting.", "Additional evaluation factors included past performance and Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day Act (JWOD) compliance.", "The Postal Service awarded the contract to Boise with a start date of April 3, 2000. The contract is a firm, fixed-price modified requirements contract for a 3-year base period, with up to three 2-year options. The contract requires, with a few exceptions, that the Postal Service order from Boise all of the approximately 13,000 items in Boise\u2019s Postal Service office supply catalog. Exceptions to the mandatory requirement are where (1) the item can be found at a lower price (and it is not a JWOD item) or (2) the requirement is urgent and the supplier cannot meet the required delivery date. The Postal Service has since exercised the first 2-year option.", "The JWOD Act requires the Postal Service to comply with its requirements.

Anticipated savings were based on the assumption that almost all supplies would be purchased from the national contract.

However, they have not determined why employees continue to buy their supplies outside the contract. Postal Service officials did not expect immediate compliance with the contract; they anticipated that some purchasing would occur outside the national contract during the implementation period because the cultural environment of the Postal Service has allowed local buyers to make purchases independently. However, they were unaware of the extent to which the contract is not being used because they did not sufficiently plan its implementation, nor have they adequately tracked and monitored office supply purchases.", "There are several indications that the Postal Service did not take sufficient action to ensure that the contract was properly implemented. First, the Postal Service continues to maintain a number of non-Boise office supply contracts. Although the number of vendors on these other contracts declined from 49 to 33 from fiscal years 1999 through 2001, the dollar value of supplies bought from these contracts has grown, as shown in figure 3.", "The Postal Service did not undertake a systematic review of all office supply contracts when it implemented the national contract. Such an assessment would have provided an indication of which non-Boise contracts should have been continued and which phased out. In fact, some of the items purchased under non-Boise contracts in fiscal year 2001\u2014such as binders, paper, and measuring tape\u2014should have been purchased from Boise, according to the terms of the national contract. According to Postal Service officials, other items\u2014such as printed envelopes and some types of rubber bands\u2014are purchased under separate contracts because the items are not part of the Boise catalog or they are unique and purchased in volume. Postal Service officials told us that the improved oversight they expect as a result of centralized office supply procurement will allow them to phase out some of the existing office supply contracts.", "Second, Postal Service employees continue to use purchase cards to buy office supplies outside the contract. Because the purchase card cannot be used to order from the Boise contract, none of the $16.8 million spent on office supplies through purchase cards in fiscal year 2001 was spent under the contract. Postal Service officials have not tracked or monitored purchase card procurements to determine why these employees are not using the contract. Postal Service managers indicated that they are able to use quarterly purchase card spending reports to identify errant purchases\u2014office supplies that should have been purchased from the national contract. However, they acknowledge that these reports are not used consistently to monitor employee purchases of office supplies.", "Finally, Postal Service employees continue to use cash and money orders to buy supplies from local vendors. As with the purchase cards, cash and money orders cannot be used to buy supplies from the Boise contract. Because the Postal Service has limited information about cash and money order purchases, it was unaware that 33 percent of office supply spending in fiscal year 2001 occurred through these methods. Postal Service officials remarked that they are encouraged by the decrease (from about $66 million in fiscal year 1999 to $41 million in fiscal year 2001) in office supply purchasing using cash and money orders. However, until the Postal Service is able to better track and monitor local office spending, it will lack the information it needs to ensure that the national contract is being used as intended.", "Postal Service officials explained that their ability to track office supply spending\u2014enabling them to better target those employees who are not using the contract\u2014should improve as Boise contract use increases because the contract requires Postal Service employees to use a Web-based purchasing system referred to as e-buy. The Postal Service\u2019s expectation is that information about e-buy purchases will be systematically and consistently collected. However, use of the contract is not being enforced, and employees continue to use other methods\u2014such as contracts outside the national contract, purchase cards, cash, and money orders\u2014to buy office supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Postal Service is Unable to Document Estimated Savings", "paragraphs": ["The Postal Service\u2019s decision to award a national-level contract to a single supplier was based, in part, on an expectation of saving up to $28 million annually.

To realize the maximum benefits and cost savings under the Postal Service\u2019s acquisition strategy, almost all office supplies must be purchased from Boise. However, the fact that employees continue to buy supplies outside the contract, combined with the lack of an established benchmark to measure savings, prevents the Postal Service from determining whether it is achieving its savings goals.", "The Postal Service\u2019s reported savings are calculated using a formula established in 1999. The formula is based on market research, Postal Service Annual Report data from 1998, and spending on an office supply contract in existence at that time. This methodology predicted transaction cost savings of up to 70 percent and item price savings of up to 10 percent on a $50 million contract. The Postal Service claimed savings of up to $28 million for fiscal year 2001 using these estimates.

In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, Boise awarded small businesses 24.6 percent of its Schedules program sales. In retrospect, Boise and Postal Service officials explained that the Schedules program was not a reliable source for an estimate because Boise\u2019s contract under the Schedules program included 1,800 items, compared to about 13,000 items in the Postal Service contract. Moreover, the total dollar sales in Boise\u2019s Schedules contract\u2014$14.3 million in fiscal year 2000\u2014were considerably lower than the total sales on the Postal Service contract\u2014$47 million in fiscal year 2001.", "Second, while Boise has a corporate supplier diversity strategy, a Boise official stated that the company\u2019s ability to achieve the subcontracting plan goals has been hampered by the fact that the Postal Service does not require its employees to target SMW businesses when ordering from the catalog. In fact, officials at one district we visited had the impression that by simply purchasing from the contract they were complying with the Postal Service\u2019s SMW business initiatives. At another district we visited, employees were not aware that the Postal Service had SMW subcontracting goals in the contract. All of the district officials we spoke with stated that they base their purchasing decisions on the lowest available price and do not search the catalog for SMW businesses.", "Third, one of the primary reasons Boise and Postal Service officials offered for the low subcontracting achievements was that compliance with the JWOD Act is taking away dollars from small businesses. However, Boise records show that of the 47 Boise vendors whose items were replaced with JWOD items in fiscal year 2001, only 7 were small businesses. These 7 vendors supply 26 out of the 404 Postal Service office supply items that are subject to the automatic JWOD replacement. Moreover, financial data from Boise show that in calendar year 2000, while total sales on JWOD items were just over $3 million, the impact of JWOD compliance on these 7 vendors was relatively small. These vendors potentially lost $167,629 in business due to the automatic substitution of JWOD items for their items. In calendar year 2001 (representing one full year of contract sales), these 7 vendors potentially lost $297,036 of sales, while the total sales on JWOD items for the year doubled to almost $6 million. This trend continued in the first 6 months of 2002.", "Finally, Postal Service officials also explained that Boise could not reach its goal because it had planned to subcontract with a woman-owned enterprise that provided cash register tapes, a technology that the Postal Service decided to phase out. They stated that although Boise had relied on this business to reach its subcontracting goal, a change in technology resulted in significantly less business with this vendor than was expected. However, neither Postal Service nor Boise officials could provide us with specific estimates of expected sales. In fact, sales to this woman-owned firm increased in 2001 and 2002. Boise records show a growth in sales of the cash register tapes from this business of approximately $283,000 in 2000 to $455,000 in 2001. Sales for the first half of 2002 indicate a dollar amount in sales similar to the total sales in 2001.

Although the following steps are being taken to improve performance, it is highly unlikely that these actions will enable Boise to reach its 30 percent subcontracting goal.", "Boise is working with the Postal Service to include additional SMW businesses as subcontractors. For example, Boise continues to work with the Postal Service to identify small business suppliers of recycled toner cartridges, who in many cases provide their products at half the price of new toner cartridges. District officials received a listing of small businesses supplying recycled toner cartridges in October 2001. However, neither the Postal Service nor Boise has determined the extent to which this information will increase Boise\u2019s subcontracting achievements.", "Boise is working with the Postal Service to reflect indirect services provided to Boise by small businesses in its reporting of subcontracting plan achievements, as it is allowed to do under the Postal Service contract. Indirect services include data entry and information management services, such as invoicing and tracking sales information.

Currently, there is no time frame for implementing this change in Boise\u2019s reporting of its subcontracting achievements.

Further, the Postal Service based its projected savings on an estimated contract amount of $50 million. Boise also noted that sales to SMW businesses with the Postal Service increased from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2001. However, Boise\u2019s analysis relies on a comparison of sales data from a previously existing Postal Service office supply contract, for 200 high-use items, to the sales data from the current contract, which covers almost 13,000 items.

Total office supply spending was identified using information from the Postal Service purchasing and materials data warehouse. We determined office supply spending for fiscal years 1999 through 2001 by using the same account codes that the Postal Service used to conduct its market research to justify the national office supply contract. We reviewed the Postal Service\u2019s total office supply spending details for all contract, purchase card, money order, and cash transactions. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the reported spending. We interviewed and obtained information from the Postal Service\u2019s contracting officer and contract administrator. In addition, we interviewed and obtained information from three area offices and three district offices based on data that indicated these locations were not using the national office supply contract. We interviewed purchasing specialists, administrative services managers, financial system coordinators, and administrative personnel with office supply purchasing responsibility. We also held discussions with and acquired information from Boise\u2019s federal business manager.", "To determine Boise\u2019s achievement of its SMW subcontracting plan, we reviewed the contract\u2019s subcontracting plan and Boise\u2019s quarterly reports on its SMW achievements. We interviewed and obtained information from the Postal Service\u2019s contracting officer, area finance officials, and district finance and purchasing officials. We also held discussions with and acquired information from Boise\u2019s federal business manager, its minority- and woman-owned business development and supplier diversity manager, and two minority-owned subcontractors.", "To assess the extent to which the Postal Service is buying office supplies directly from SMW businesses, we reviewed Postal Service supplier diversity policy and guidance. We examined the Postal Service\u2019s reported socioeconomic statistics, including the dollar amount and type of vendor for fiscal years 1999 through 2001. We interviewed and obtained information from Postal Service officials in the offices of supplier development and diversity, purchasing and materials, and the Postal Service Inspector General. We determined that the reported purchase card data were unreliable; however, we did not attempt to correct the errors in the data provided.", "Additionally, we met with representatives from the National Office Products Association and a small, woman-owned business to gain a better understanding of their views with regard to the national contract.", "We conducted our review from March 2002 to November 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressional committees; the Postmaster General of the United States; and the Senior Vice President and Federal Business Manager, Boise Office Solutions.
