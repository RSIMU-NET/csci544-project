The Forest Service manages this system through a program of sustained multiple use for forage, fish and wildlife, water, wilderness, outdoor recreation, and the production of minerals, range, and timber. To support these diverse activities, the agency contracts for a wide variety of goods and services, including road and building construction, tree planting and other reforestation activities, research studies, and aircraft and helicopters for suppressing fires. In fiscal year 1996, the Forest Service obligated about $443 million on contracts and contract modifications. The agency has by far the largest contracting activity at USDA, accounting for about 43 percent of the Department\u2019s contracting dollars (excluding commodity purchases) in fiscal years 1994 through 1996.

(See fig. 1.2.)", "The national headquarters office for contracting by the Forest Service, known as the Acquisition Management Staff, establishes and interprets procurement policy for the Forest Service, reviews field contracting activities, and awards and administers some contracts. The regional offices provide policy guidance, review national forest office activities, and award and administer contracts. The contracting staff\u2019s responsibility in the national forest offices is to award and administer contracts. Contracting is conducted by about 250 contracting officers located in 149 offices dispersed throughout the United States.", "In addition to being widely dispersed geographically, the Forest Service\u2019s local contracting staff are not organizationally aligned with the agency\u2019s regional and headquarters contracting staff in a single organizational unit with hierarchical reporting relationships and lines of authority. Although organizational arrangements vary, contracting supervisors in the national forests generally report to local administrative or program managers, not to the regional head of contracting. Regional heads of contracting report to the official in charge of regional operations, not to the head of contracting at headquarters.", "Contracting authority within USDA is delegated from the Secretary of Agriculture through several organizational levels to the Director of the Acquisition Management Staff at the Forest Service. The Director delegates contracting authority to employees known as contracting officers in the regional offices, national forests, and ranger districts. Authority is delegated to each contracting officer through an official document known as a warrant.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contains the fundamental contracting procedures for all federal executive agencies. At the Forest Service, these regulations are supplemented by the Agriculture Acquisition Regulation and the Forest Service Acquisition Regulations. These regulations must conform to the FAR but can include agency-specific requirements as well. In addition, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), establishes governmentwide procurement policies and guidance to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in federal procurement.", "In addition to the regulations governing specific contracting procedures, the Forest Service must comply with the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982. This act requires executive agencies, among other things, to (1) establish and maintain systems of internal control, (2) periodically evaluate those systems, and (3) report annually on their status. Internal control is intended to provide reasonable assurance that a program\u2019s goals and objectives are met; resources are adequately safeguarded and efficiently utilized; reliable data are obtained, maintained, and fairly disclosed in reports; and laws and regulations are complied with.", "To help program managers implement FMFIA\u2019s provisions, we issued Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government in 1983. These standards define the minimum level of quality acceptable for internal control and establish the criteria for evaluating internal control. Executive agencies are required to report annually to the President and the Congress on whether their systems of internal control comply with FMFIA and GAO standards.", "Our standards for internal control consist of five general standards, six specific standards, and one audit resolution standard. The general internal control standards require, among other things, the establishment of control objectives and techniques. Internal control objectives are the goals or targets for control that an agency wants to achieve. Control techniques are the mechanisms that an agency uses to achieve its control objectives. The specific internal control standards require, among other things, (1) the complete and accurate documentation of significant actions, (2) the proper classification of actions in summary records, and (3) qualified and continuous supervision. The audit resolution standard requires managers to promptly resolve audit findings. \u201csupport the effectiveness and the integrity of every step of the process and provide continual feedback to management . . . . For instance, good management controls can assure that performance measures are complete and accurate.\u201d", "Contracting related management initiatives have been introduced by OFPP and the Congress has enacted laws that are consistent with GPRA\u2019s principles of establishing performance goals and measuring results. In Policy Letter 91-2, effective May 9, 1991, OFPP established the policy of using performance-based contracting methods to the maximum extent possible when acquiring services. This approach emphasizes objective, measurable performance requirements and quality standards to help improve contractors\u2019 performance and achieve cost savings. Also consistent with GPRA\u2019s principles, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 established that a contractor\u2019s past performance should be considered in evaluating whether that contractor should receive future work. The FAR requires contracting officials to collect and maintain information on contractors\u2019 performance for evaluating contractors for future negotiated contract awards. Finally, in implementing GPRA, USDA established five Department-wide performance measures for the procurement system. These included OFPP\u2019s initiative to increase the use of performance-based service contracting and the Acquisition Streamlining Act\u2019s requirement to use past performance evaluations as factors in future contract awards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["At the request of the Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture, we evaluated the Forest Service\u2019s internal control and management practices aimed at minimizing fraud, waste, and abuse and maximizing effectiveness in contracting activities.

In addition, we identified obstacles to improving the contracting system.", "We focused our review on contracting for goods and services within the Forest Service\u2019s National Forest System. Our work was conducted at the headquarters office for contracting in Rosslyn, Virginia; three regional offices; and two national forest offices. We reviewed contracts at the Northern Regional Office in Missoula, Montana; the Pacific Southwest Regional Office in San Francisco, California; and the Pacific Northwest Regional Office in Portland, Oregon. We also reviewed contracts at the Lolo National Forest Office in Missoula, Montana, and the Sierra National Forest Office in Clovis, California. The three regions we visited accounted for 47 percent of the contracting dollars awarded in fiscal year 1996. In total, we reviewed 52 contracts, whose contract actions exceeded $20 million in fiscal year 1996.", "We judgmentally selected the offices we visited and the contract files we reviewed at each location. We selected contracts from the Forest Service\u2019s records of actions reported during fiscal year 1996. This approach provided us with a cross section of contracts at different stages of the contracting cycle (e.g., recently awarded contracts, multiyear contracts with numerous contract actions, and completed contracts). We generally selected contracts with larger dollar values and multiple actions to review. Our sample included contracts for a variety of goods and services, including equipment related to suppressing fires, construction, tree planting, and environmental studies.", "To determine whether the Forest Service maintained an appropriate system of internal control for contracting, we interviewed OFPP\u2019s, USDA\u2019s, and the Forest Service\u2019s procurement officials. We contacted the Forest Service\u2019s contracting managers at each of the offices we visited to discuss their policies and procedures for internal control. We also reviewed contract files to assess the adequacy of file documentation, the accuracy of management information being summarized and reported, the level of supervisory review of contracting officers, and the monitoring of contractors\u2019 performance. To supplement our file review, at each office, we also interviewed contracting officers, contracting officers\u2019 representatives, procurement analysts, and others involved in the contracting process to discuss internal control plans, supervision and contract monitoring.", "To assess whether the Forest Service manages contracting effectively, we determined if offices prepared advance acquisition plans and incorporated performance factors into the contracting process. We also reviewed relevant regulations, reports, policy circulars, and initiatives issued by OFPP, USDA, and the Forest Service. During our field visits, we reviewed advance acquisition plans prepared for fiscal year 1996 and interviewed contracting officials to determine how the plans were prepared and used. With headquarters procurement officials from USDA and the Forest Service, we discussed plans for implementing performance-based contracting and gathering data on contractor performance. We also reviewed completed contracts to determine if contractors\u2019 performance evaluations had been completed.", "To identify obstacles to improving the contracting system, we reviewed information on the Forest Service\u2019s organizational structure and the reporting relationships for the agency\u2019s contracting.

With respect to contract award actions, we found the following examples: In one office, a file was missing that was supposed to contain information on (1) which contractors submitted proposals and (2) how the proposals were evaluated to determine the contract award. Without this information, we could not determine whether the four contracts awarded from this selection process, with work orders of over $370,000, were awarded properly.", "When a contract for work being done primarily in California was modified to include a $95,000 task for work to be done in Alaska, the contract file contained no cost comparison between this approach and the award of a separate contract by the Forest Service region covering work in Alaska. Without this documentation, there was no assurance that the modified contract was the most cost-effective way to acquire these services.", "Important contract administration documentation was also lacking in the files we reviewed, as shown in the following examples:", "All 10 of the files we reviewed in one region were incomplete or so poorly organized that they did not meet the region\u2019s own standards. Many key contract administration documents were missing entirely, and other documents were filed incorrectly. For five closed contracts, two of which had been closed for more than a year, contract documents maintained at separate locations had not been consolidated into one official contract folder.

According to the FAR, each segment of work ordered should be based on a written statement defining the work needed, known as a scope of work, prepared by the contracting officer. Four of the nine IDIQ contracts also required a written cost proposal from the contractor for that scope of work and a negotiation of the final price. On all nine contracts, there was either no written scope of work from the Forest Service or no documentation of negotiation over costs for each segment of work. Without this documentation, there is no assurance that the Forest Service made a reasonable effort to obtain the lowest cost for that segment of work.", "Finally, contract monitoring by contracting officers\u2019 representatives (CORs) was also poorly documented for some types of contracts.

Incomplete files make it difficult to analyze key contract actions and put the Forest Service at risk in the event of a legal challenge. For example, in January 1997, the Forest Service lost a bid protest from a company alleging that the award of the contract was improper because the agency\u2019s evaluation of bids from competing companies was inconsistent with the criteria it had established.

Only after he left the region and others assumed responsibility for his contracts, were problems with his administration of contracts fully identified. For one of his contracts, his successor discovered that procedures for ordering and tracking work had not been completed appropriately.

The supervisory contracting officer agreed that the ordering procedures used for these contracts were inappropriate; however, she had been unaware of the problem.", "A contracting officer made a sole-source award on two contracts totaling $19 million. The market survey used to determine if other entities were capable of delivering the same services at similar or lower costs was deemed inadequate by USDA\u2019s competition advocate, who reviewed the contract. The contract was approved by USDA with the stipulation that when option years were exercised, a more comprehensive market survey would be done. However, the Forest Service awarded the option years without conducting the required market survey and without supervisory review, despite the high-dollar value of the contract and the special stipulation by USDA procurement officials.", "Despite the internal control standard for supervision, the Forest Service has not established a policy requiring the routine review of contacting officers\u2019 work by their direct supervisors. Moreover, contracting officials at all levels of the Forest Service told us that the routine supervision of experienced contracting officers was unnecessary, because the officers had been assigned contracts on the basis of their designated warrant authority and they could be trusted to do their job appropriately. Several officials told us that once assigned a contract, contracting officers are usually \u201con their own.\u201d A headquarters contracting official told us that the Forest Service\u2019s culture discourages routine supervision and that contracting officers who have the required training and warrant authority would resent supervisors \u201clooking over their shoulders\u201d to review their work.", "Supervisory contracting officers in both regional offices and forests viewed their supervisory responsibilities as primarily administrative in nature; they did not believe that they were primarily responsible for providing technical guidance or direction. These supervisors did not see their role as being responsible for routinely reviewing contracting staff\u2019s work or periodically checking key contract actions. At two locations, we were told that supervisors learn of contract awards through informal discussions and occasionally review award documents.

CORs may also designate inspectors to carry out some of these same functions for some contracts. CORs and their designated inspectors are not contracting staff.

For example, an ecologist might be assigned to administer a contract for ecological studies.", "While all of the construction contracts that we reviewed appeared to be monitored, we identified service contracts for the preparation of environmental studies, tree planting, and the installation of telephone systems, among others, that had little or no monitoring. Inadequate monitoring contributed to work that cost more than expected or was left incomplete, as shown in the following examples:", "On one computer systems support contract, the contractor did not submit progress reports as required by the contract and the COR did not insist that they be done.

According to the COR, funds were wasted because work had to be redone and the work was delayed by at least 8 months. The contracting officer said that better monitoring and earlier intervention by the COR could have prevented some of these problems.", "Some contracting officers said that because of staff shortages or a lack of understanding by CORs, contract monitoring is sometimes viewed as a low priority and therefore receives less attention from CORs than other work duties.

For example, the contracting officer had delegated monitoring responsibilities to the COR; however, the COR told us he did not monitor the contracts and had delegated that responsibility to inspectors. Both inspectors said that they too did not monitor all the contracts. We found that progress reports required by the contract provisions were not submitted by the contractor and that, for one of the contracts, work on some task orders was completed up to 2 years after the required completion dates.", "Headquarters officials and several contracting officers and CORs told us that training is needed to emphasize the importance of monitoring and to improve monitoring skills. CORs who administer construction contracts are formally trained and certified and, according to Forest Service officials, generally have a clear understanding of monitoring and documentation requirements.

In response to our observations about the lack of routine supervision, senior Forest Service officials told us that contracting officers have limits on their spending authority that are based on education and experience and that they are trusted to perform competently and ethically. Furthermore, they believed that attempts to more closely oversee staff or to change reporting relationships within the organizational structure to give the regional or headquarters offices more direct authority would likely be met with significant resistance.", "The high value placed on independence has led to a history of problems in enforcing accountability. Reporting on agencywide accountability issues in 1994, an internal Forest Service task force found that the need for increased accountability was \u201ccompelling.\u201d One of the task force\u2019s recommendations was to accelerate cultural change. A 1994 USDA procurement review recognized the need to strengthen acquisition planning and recommended that managers be held accountable for producing and using acquisition plans to the maximum extent possible.In discussing this recommendation, the report noted that implementing it would result in a major cultural change. We found no evidence that the cultural change that these reports identified as critical to improving accountability had occurred at the Forest Service.", "In another recent review, we raised serious concerns about the Forest Service\u2019s ability to hold managers accountable for their performance.Our review of the decision-making process at the Forest Service found an organizational culture of indifference toward accountability. We cited problems with, among other things, the Forest Service\u2019s accounting and financial management systems and its performance measurement and concluded that the agency\u2019s historically decentralized management and recently increased flexibility in fiscal decision-making have not been accompanied by sufficient accountability for expenditures and performance.", "Also recently, the Forest Service itself recognized the need for increased accountability. In a 1997 year-end address to headquarters staff, the Chief of the Forest Service commented that there is \u201ca common concern that the Forest Service is not demanding enough in the critical area of accountability. I am committed to improving accountability . . .  a big challenge for this agency.\u201d", "In our 1992 report on the techniques that companies use to change organizational culture, we cited two keys to successful cultural change: (1) top management must be totally committed to the change in both words and actions and (2) organizations must provide training that promotes and develops skills related to their desired values and beliefs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Despite its knowledge of many of the shortcomings in the contracting process discussed in this report, the Forest Service has not moved aggressively to make improvements. It is critical that the Forest Service establish effective internal control over contracting activities to give the agency reasonable assurance that resources are safeguarded and expended judiciously. In addition, procurement reforms that hold the promise of lowering costs and improving quality, such as performance-based service contracting, need to be more effectively implemented. The current organizational structure of the contracting function, which limits direct accountability, as well as the culture of local autonomy, appear to have resulted in an inertia that frustrates the implementation of effective internal control and important procurement reforms. Given these obstacles and the agency\u2019s history of problems with enforcing accountability, committed, aggressive leadership and sustained oversight will be required to effect significant improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on our draft report, USDA disagreed with our identification of the organizational structure for contracting as an impediment to reform.

USDA said that additional management emphasis and accountability can improve the acquisition process within the existing organizational framework.", "We are not suggesting in this report that the organizational structure should change. Rather, we believe that the organizational structure for contracting at the Forest Service does not provide clear lines of authority or effective reporting relationships between contracting staff and managers and thus impedes direct accountability.
