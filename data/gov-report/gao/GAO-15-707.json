The recent migration increase was likely triggered, according to U.S. officials, by several emergent factors such as the increased presence and sophistication of human smugglers (known as coyotes) and confusion over U.S. immigration policy. Officials also noted that certain persistent conditions such as violence and poverty have worsened in certain countries. In addition to long-standing efforts, such as U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) antipoverty programs, agencies have taken new actions. For example, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-led investigative units have increasingly sought to disrupt human smuggling operations.", "U.S. agencies have located programs based on various factors, including long-term priorities such as targeting high-poverty and -crime areas, but have adjusted to locate more programs in high-migration communities. For example, Department of State (State) officials in Guatemala said they moved programs enhancing police anticrime capabilities into such communities, and USAID officials in El Salvador said they expanded to UAC-migration-affected locations.", "Most agencies have developed processes to assess the effectiveness of programs seeking to address UAC migration, but weaknesses exist in these processes for some antismuggling programs. For example, DHS has established performance measures, such as arrests, for units combating UAC smuggling, but has not established numeric or other types of targets for these measures, which would enable DHS to measure the units' progress. In addition, DHS and State have not always evaluated information campaigns intended to combat coyote misinformation. DHS launched its 2013 campaign in April, but launched its 2014 campaign in late June after migration levels peaked. Neither agency evaluated its 2014 campaign.

Prior to fiscal year 2012, the majority of UAC  apprehended at the border were Mexican nationals. However, as figure 1  shows, more than half of the UAC apprehended at the border in fiscal  year 2013, and nearly three-fourths of UAC apprehended in fiscal year  2014, were nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.", "Recent data indicate the pace of migration from Central America remains  high, though fewer migrants are being apprehended in the United States.  According to DHS\u2019s Border Patrol\u2014a component of CBP\u2014through May  2015, there have been nearly 23,000 UAC apprehensions at the  southwest border in fiscal year 2015\u2014compared with about 24,500  through May of fiscal year 2013 and nearly 47,000 through May of fiscal  year 2014. However, according to research from the nongovernmental  organization (NGO) the Washington Office on Latin America, Central  American migrants are being detained in Mexico at a higher rate this year  compared with last year, with more than 90,000 Central American  migrants detained in Mexico during the first 7 months of fiscal year 2015  compared with around 50,000 during the same period of fiscal year 2014.  Since 2012, apprehensions of UAC at the U.S.-Mexican border have  generally increased between January and May, as shown in figure 2,  according to data from DHS\u2019s Border Patrol.", "These three countries face a variety of socioeconomic challenges. In  February 2015, we reported that U.S. officials in El Salvador, Guatemala,  and Honduras identified crime and violence, and economic and  educational concerns, as among the primary causes of UAC migration to  the United States. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and  Crime, these countries had among the top five highest homicide rates  worldwide in 2012, the most recent year for which these statistics were  available for all three countries, with Honduras ranking first, with a  homicide rate of 90.4 per 100,000 inhabitants; El Salvador fourth, with a  rate of 41.2; and Guatemala fifth, with a rate of 39.9. According to this UN  office, the surge in homicide levels in Central America in recent years is  largely a result of violence related to the control of drug trafficking routes,  turf wars between criminal groups, and conflict between organized  criminal groups and the host government. A 2014 United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees study on UAC from Central America and  Mexico noted that nearly half of the UAC interviewed for the study  reported being affected by violence committed by gangs or drug cartels,  while about a fifth reported being victims of domestic abuse. In addition,  according to 2011 World Bank data, more than 60 percent of Hondurans,  more than 50 percent of Guatemalans, and 30 percent of Salvadorans  live below the poverty level. According to a Wilson Center publication,  nearly 2 million Central Americans between the ages of 15 and 25 do not  have a job or go to school, and the highest proportion of these youth  come from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.In addition, all three  countries rank below the regional average on Transparency  International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index.", "In September 2014, the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras issued a regional plan in response to the recent migration  increase. The plan, referred to as the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity  in the Northern Triangle: A Road Map, outlines four strategic actions,  which seek to stimulate the productive sector to create economic  opportunities, develop opportunities for people, improve public safety and  enhance access to the legal system, and strengthen institutions to  increase people\u2019s trust in the state. The plan notes that income inequality  presents a major challenge to the three countries, as 20 percent of the  wealthiest segments of the population account for more than half of  overall income. In addition, the plan identifies a limited supply and quality  of services in housing, early childhood health care, nutrition, and child  development as among the main challenges to development, while also  noting that weaknesses in the countries\u2019 educational systems have  resulted in workforces with less schooling and more limited skills as  compared with those of other countries in the region.", "In addition to the problems within these countries, children who migrate  illegally can encounter other risks during the journey to the United States.  The journey to the United States may be hundreds or over a thousand  miles, and some make this journey on foot over desert terrain, where  daytime summer temperatures can exceed 110 degrees Fahrenheit.  Others travel on top of trains, such as La Bestia, or \u201cthe Beast,\u201d the name  given to the cargo trains that transport goods through Mexico to the  United States. According to NGO reports, whether traveling by foot or on  trains, child migrants are exposed to various dangers, including robbery,  extortion, forced recruitment into gangs, abandonment, rape, and murder.", "A number of U.S. agencies provide assistance to the three countries. For  example, USAID, State, DHS, IAF, and MCC have programs providing  assistance in areas such as economic development, rule of law, citizen  security, law enforcement, education, community development, and  others. In fiscal year 2014, USAID, State, DHS, and IAF allocated a  combined $44.5 million for El Salvador, $88.1 million for Guatemala, and  $78 million for Honduras. In addition, MCC signed a threshold program  agreement with Honduras in fiscal year 2013 totaling $15.6 million, a  compact agreement with El Salvador in fiscal year 2014 totaling $277  million, and a threshold program agreement with Guatemala in fiscal year  2015 totaling $28 million. The U.S. government also provides additional  assistance through CARSI, which funds activities to improve law  enforcement and justice sector capabilities, prevent crime and violence,  and deter and detect border criminal activity, among other efforts in these  three countries as well as in Belize, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama.  Between fiscal years 2008 and 2014, U.S. agencies allocated more than  $800 million for CARSI activities from various accounts. We previously  reported that, through June 2013, more than 50 percent of funds  allocated for CARSI activities had been designated for activities in El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Additional information on agency  funding to the three countries is provided in appendix II.", "The administration has taken several recent actions related to these three  countries. In December 2014, the administration started an in-country  refugee and parole program, which is intended to allow certain parents  who are lawfully present in the United States to request access to the  U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for their children still living in El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. In addition, in March 2015, the  administration issued the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central  America, which includes the primary objectives of prosperity, governance,  and security, and goals of an economically integrated Central America  that is fully democratic; provides economic opportunities to its people;  enjoys more accountable, transparent, and effective public institutions;  and ensures a safe environment for its citizens. According to the  strategy, important successes would include the establishment of strong  regional coordination mechanisms and institutions; reducing violence to a  point where no Central American country is among the top 10 countries in  terms of homicide rates; a 50 percent reduction of the youth  unemployment rate in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala; full  implementation of ongoing electrical interconnection projects and other  initiatives aimed at making energy more affordable, cleaner, and more  sustainable; and steady economic growth throughout the region such that  the poverty rate is pushed to below 40 percent over the next decade.", "In its fiscal year 2016 budget request, the administration requested $1  billion for Central America, an increase of more than 200 percent from  fiscal year 2014 levels. State and USAID have stated that the funding  would support the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America and  the priority objectives identified in the Alliance for Prosperity Plan.

Agency officials from all three countries that we spoke to said that  coyotes had proliferated and grown more influential and sophisticated in  recent years. Officials from USAID and State in all three countries noted  that coyotes were often well known and trusted in communities.  According to USAID officials, when they conducted focus group  interviews in Honduras with youth and outreach center coordinators in  high-risk communities, including San Pedro Sula, participants noted that  coyotes were easy to access. In addition, agency officials we spoke to in  all three countries noted that coyotes had instituted new marketing and  messaging tactics. For example, numerous officials in all three countries  told us that coyotes offered package deals, such as offering three  attempts to migrate to the United States for one fee\u2014known as a \u201cthree- for-one\u201d deal. Coyotes have also intentionally spread rumors and  misinformation about U.S. immigration policy. For example, agency  officials told us that, in some cases, in an effort to drive smuggling  business, coyotes led many people to believe children could migrate to  the United States and receive permission to stay indefinitely, if they  arrived by a certain date.", "According to agency officials, general perceptions concerning U.S.  immigration policy have played a growing role in UAC migration. Agency  officials noted they relied on outreach efforts, focus groups, and other  information sources to try to understand this factor. According to State  officials in El Salvador and Guatemala, local media outlets have  optimistically discussed comprehensive immigration reform efforts in the  United States and sometimes failed to discuss the complexity of  immigration reform. According to State officials, many Guatemalan  citizens believe undocumented migrants in the United States will be  encouraged to send for their children from Guatemala so they can come  to the United States and they can benefit together for any upcoming  comprehensive immigration reform, or even be eligible for Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals. In addition, according to USAID officials,  Honduran youth and coordinators of community centers who were  interviewed as part of a USAID focus group indicated they believed the  United States would allow migrant minors, mothers traveling with minors,  and pregnant women to stay for a period of time upon arrival in the United  States.", "Agency officials also noted that recent improvements in the U.S. economy  had fueled increased UAC migration, enabling family reunification in the  United States. In particular, State and USAID officials in Honduras noted  that the improving economy had enabled parents who immigrated to the  United States to send money back to their home country to pay coyotes  so their children could migrate and reunify the family in the United States.", "According to officials in El Salvador, as the economy improved there,  more Salvadorans have attempted to migrate to the United States to  reunify with family. Agency officials noted that many children have spent  years apart from their parents, being raised by a grandparent or another  family member, and that in some cases, aging grandparents were no  longer able to care for the children. This dynamic is further illustrated by  examples from an internal USAID analysis of migration causes in  Honduras, which highlighted migration-related risk factors associated with  children living with extended family or non-family members in Honduras.", "Some agency officials also noted that the increased use of social media  has enabled migrating families to be in more regular contact and to  confirm if and when family members or friends arrive in the United States.  Additionally, according to a study performed by State contractors in El  Salvador, many people advertise immigration services through social  media and offer travel services to ensure safe arrival in the United States.  The use of social media can encourage migration, according to some  agency officials. For example, officials in Guatemala noted that social  media outlets enable migrants who have arrived in the United States to  share messages and pictures with families in their home countries, an act  that can serve as a powerful and influential endorsement of the decision  to migrate. Agency officials in El Salvador similarly noted that when a  potential migrant hears from someone in the United States who has  managed to arrive and remain there undocumented, the communication  can strongly influence their decision on whether to migrate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Worsening of Pervasive Socio- economic Problems", "paragraphs": ["Violence, poverty, and poor access to education and other services have  been pervasive development challenges in all three countries, predating  the UAC migration increase. However, according to agency officials we  spoke to in all three countries, some of these problems have grown worse  in recent years and could have contributed to the rise of UAC migration.  For example, in Honduras, agency officials noted that levels and  perceptions of violence had grown worse, in part because of the rise in  extortions. Worsening security concerns also negatively affect access to  education. For example, agency officials in El Salvador noted that many  children will not attend school after the seventh grade because traveling  to some schools requires crossing gang borders, and that girls in  particular face the risk of being attacked or raped en route. In Guatemala,  agency officials stated that poor economic and social conditions in the  Western Highlands had declined even further in recent years. In  addition, agency officials noted that deteriorating climate conditions,  including several consecutive years of drought and a coffee rust blight  that has hurt coffee production and cost jobs in Honduras and  Guatemala, exacerbated long-standing economic concerns in many  communities. Agency officials told us that, on the basis of their outreach  efforts, reporting from NGOs, academics, and government officials, and  focus groups, they had determined that these longstanding problems had  intensified.", "In addition, we met with children from all three countries who offered  similar insights concerning the causes of migration. For example,  children at a USAID outreach center in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, noted  the lack of educational and job opportunities in their communities as a  reason for migrating. Children from a particularly violent neighborhood  told us it was even more difficult for them to obtain a job because  potential employers would sometimes choose not to hire them because of  where they live. Children also described the ways in which violence leads  to migration, such as by making it difficult for them to attend school if  doing so requires them to travel from one neighborhood to another and  cross a gang border. Children at an outreach center in El Salvador also  noted that sometimes, even with an education, one cannot find work in El  Salvador and that there are more opportunities and chances to succeed  in the United States. Children at this same center indicated that the desire  to migrate is even stronger for children with parents in the United States.  Children from a youth center in Guatemala also noted violence and  economic factors as motivations for migration, and many of these children  already had family or knew someone who had migrated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Actions Taken in Response to the Migration Increase Include Several Efforts to Combat Child Smuggling", "paragraphs": ["Among the various agency actions taken in response to UAC migration,  several seek to directly combat coyotes, which agency officials identified  as a key emergent factor causing migration.

USAID\u2019s CDCS documents, for example, outline development  objectives for each country that focus on specific locations. For example,  in Honduras, the CDCS contains two development objectives. The first  development objective seeks to increase citizen security for vulnerable  populations in high-density urban areas with high crime rates, and  specifies two cities\u2014Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula\u2014and  municipalities in an area referred to as the Northern Corridor as the  geographic focus. The second development objective, to reduce  extreme poverty in western Honduras, specifies the six western  departments, which all have severe rates of poverty and undernutrition,  as the focus of programming. Similarly, the CDCS for Guatemala, which  contains an overarching goal of developing a more secure Guatemala  that fosters greater socioeconomic development in the Western  Highlands and sustainably manages its natural resources, states that the  majority of USAID resources will be allocated to programming in the  Western Highlands, while USAID officials noted most of the remainder  was dedicated to security efforts in urban areas.

However, at the time of our visit to the  country, there were no active prosecutors participating in Tegucigalpa. In  El Salvador, where we visited a vocational school that, according to  USAID officials, had been established in a joint partnership between  USAID and a Salvadoran private company, we observed a computer lab  filled with computers recently provided by USAID but with no teacher  present. According to USAID officials in El Salvador, the school had  asked the Salvadoran Ministry of Education to provide a salary for the  teacher, but it had not yet done so at the time of our visit.", "Agencies have outlined approaches for seeking to ensure program  sustainability despite the challenges described above. State, USAID, IAF,  and MCC project documents emphasize the importance of prioritizing  improvements to government institutions; identifying sustainable funding  sources, such as the private sector; and advocating for legislative and  policy reforms that support program objectives. In addition, agency  officials have noted the importance of involving communities, the private  sector, and the police in program design to ensure they are invested in  and supportive of programs\u2019 objectives. For example, MCC\u2019s compact  with El Salvador outlines how MCC assistance over the duration of the  compact will decrease to ensure that the government of El Salvador  assumes an increasing percentage of related costs. IAF requires that its  grantee partners contribute and mobilize their own resources for their  projects and, according to IAF, it frequently works with its grantee  partners to put in place strategic and financial plans beyond the period of  the IAF grant. Some agency performance indicators seek to gauge  progress toward meeting sustainability goals, such as by tracking the  amount of private funds or other resources invested in community  programs in target municipalities, the passage of laws that can facilitate  key reforms, and the number of institutions with improved capacity as a  result of the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the rapid increase in migration of unaccompanied alien  children from Central America has highlighted the crises these children  and their families face. U.S. agencies have efforts in place that seek to  bring about lasting improvements in these countries and have taken  actions with the goal of reducing migration. These actions include DHS\u2019s  and State\u2019s support to Transnational Criminal Investigative Units that  seek to disrupt and dismantle smuggling operations and to public  information campaigns warning citizens of the dangers of migration and  countering misinformation on U.S. immigration policy.", "The agencies have limited information, however, on the effectiveness of  their efforts to reduce migration. While DHS/ICE has established  categories of performance measures for its investigative units, and tracks  basic statistical outputs associated with these categories, such as number  of arrests, it has not established performance targets that could be used  to gauge progress against preestablished goals for these important efforts  to combat smugglers.", "In addition, DHS and State have collected limited information on the  effectiveness of their public information campaigns, with DHS evaluating  one of two campaigns and State evaluating none. In not evaluating its  2014 campaign in particular, DHS missed an opportunity to obtain  valuable feedback on its efforts to dissuade migration during a year of  record migration levels. Because DHS does not have an active campaign,  it could go 3 years or longer between campaign evaluations. Such  feedback could have offered insight on the effectiveness of past DHS  campaign messages, and on their timing, particularly given migration  levels had already peaked and reached record highs by the time DHS  launched its 2014 Dangers of the Journey campaign in late June. This  information would have been particularly valuable in informing any future  DHS campaigns. State has conducted research that has informed its  public outreach efforts. However, State has not evaluated its campaigns\u2019  effectiveness. Timely feedback is critical as campaigns intended to deter  migration that is cyclical in nature are time-sensitive. Moreover, given the  increased presence of children in recent migration cycles, these  campaigns need to be timed right and deliver appropriate messages.  Carrying out ineffective campaigns could lead to higher levels of migration  to the United States, which is not only potentially costly in terms of U.S.  taxpayer resources but costly and dangerous to the migrants and their  families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend the following two actions to strengthen agency  performance measurement related to deterring child smuggling.

We then obtained and  analyzed documentation for these programs. To understand broader  strategies underlying these programs, we reviewed various strategic and  planning documents specific to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,  including the Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) Integrated Country Strategies ,  USAID Country Development Cooperation Strategies (CDCS), State  annual operating plans, and State Bureau of International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) country plans for each country; the  Partnership for Growth El Salvador\u2014United States Joint Country Action  Plan; and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact with El  Salvador. We also reviewed several interagency strategic and planning  documents regarding U.S. engagement with Central America, including  the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, and the U.S.  Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime.", "We also interviewed U.S. agency officials in Washington, including  officials from State, the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and  Justice (DOJ), USAID, MCC, and the Inter-American Foundation (IAF).  We also conducted fieldwork in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,  where we interviewed officials from State, DHS, and USAID in each  country, including the ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission, the  USAID mission directors, and DHS country attach\u00e9s, and met with each  embassy\u2019s interagency UAC working group. In addition, we met with DOJ  officials in El Salvador and Honduras, IAF officials and grantees in El  Salvador and Guatemala, and an MCC official in El Salvador. During our  fieldwork, we also interviewed representatives from host government  agencies in each country, and from nongovernmental organizations in  Washington and in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We also  visited U.S.-funded programs in Central America, including migration  reception centers in El Salvador and Honduras. In addition, we met with  children in all three countries who discussed their perspectives on causes  of UAC migration, experiences, and participation in U.S.-supported  programs. Their responses are nongeneralizable.", "To address our first objective on U.S. assistance in El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras addressing agency-identified causes of UAC  migration, we reviewed agency responses to a set of questions we  developed concerning what agencies identified as causes of the rapid  increase in UAC migration, and agency actions taken in response. In  addition, we asked officials we interviewed in Washington and in Central  America to discuss the causes of the rapid increase in UAC migration,  particularly seeking their perspective on what factors may have changed  or emerged in recent years to cause the rapid increase. We reviewed all  agency responses to determine the causes agency officials identified. We  also asked these officials to discuss agency responses to UAC migration,  including programs developed, modified, or planned in response, or  programs that predated the increase in migration but that agencies  identified as seeking to address underlying causes of migration. We also  reviewed agency documents concerning these programs, including  project concept papers and appraisal documents, progress-reporting  documents including weekly and quarterly reports, and embassy reporting  cables, among others. In addition, we obtained funding data from State,  USAID, DHS, and IAF on agency funding to El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and funding for specific  programs agencies identified as developed or modified in response to the  rapid increase in UAC migration. We asked agencies a series of  questions on how the funding data were produced, selected, and checked  for accuracy, among other things. We determined these data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To address our second objective, on how agencies have determined  where to locate programs that seek to address underlying causes of  migration, we reviewed agency strategy documents, including those  described earlier such as USAID and State country strategies, to  determine agency strategic development objectives and, where  applicable, priority geographic locations for these objectives. We also  reviewed agency strategy and project documents to determine the  locations of certain programs developed or modified in response to the  rapid increase in UAC migration, including whether such programs were  located in areas affected by high levels of UAC migration. We asked  agency officials to discuss the factors they considered and prioritized in  determining where to locate programs, including programs predating the  rapid increase in UAC migration and programs developed in response to  the rapid increase in migration, and the extent to which agencies  considered communities identified as having high levels of UAC migration  in locating such programs. In addition, we asked agency officials how  they identified locations with high levels of UAC migration and their  perspectives on the accuracy of available information on UAC locations of  origin.", "We also obtained information, for each country, on the location of UAC  communities of origin, of USAID and State/INL programs, and of IAF  grantees. In particular, we obtained DHS data on communities DHS  identified as having the highest levels of UAC migration between January  1, 2014, and May 15, 2014, for each country. These data included  information on UAC locations of origin at the municipal level, and were  used by DHS to create a map showing these DHS-identified top UAC  locations of origin. DHS officials noted that there were inherent limitations  in the accuracy of DHS apprehension data, which we discuss in this  report and the report we issued on this subject in February 2015. To  assess these data, we had a series of interviews with DHS officials to  discuss the process and methodology by which they obtained these data  on UAC apprehensions and used them to identify communities with the  highest levels of UAC migration and create maps showing these results.  We also discussed these DHS data with U.S. agency officials in  Washington and Central America. These officials noted they found the  DHS data to be generally accurate representations of their understanding  of the top UAC locations of origin. Moreover, some of these officials noted  that agencies also used the DHS maps in part to determine the extent to  which their programs aligned with these top UAC locations of origin.  Therefore, we determined that the DHS data on top UAC locations of  origin were contextually relevant to the agencies\u2019 own understanding of  how the locations of their programs aligned with top UAC locations of  origin. In order to analyze the locations from the DHS data, we combined  the files to create a single master list of locations. We then matched this  list to the GeoNet Names Server file from the National Geospatial  Intelligence Agency to create a standardized list of names. We then  aggregated the locations by department, and presented them in broad  ranges. By aggregating these data by department and presenting them in  map form in broad ranges, we believe they provide a reliable indication of  the relative distribution of UAC-sending locations. We also obtained from  USAID and State/INL the locations of all programs in each country, and,  from IAF, the locations of IAF grantees in each country. As with the DHS  data, we matched this list of programs and grantees to the GeoNet  Names Server file from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency to  create a standardized list of names, then aggregated the locations by  department, and presented them in broad ranges. We did not include  some program locations in our data due to a lack of specificity in agency  documents on the locations of certain programs. We provided this  information to offer context on the location of UAC communities of origin  and of U.S. agency programs and grantees.", "To address our third objective, on the extent to which agencies have  developed performance indicators to assess the effectiveness of efforts  responsive to UAC migration, we reviewed agency documents on  programs agencies identified as responsive to the rapid increase in UAC  migration, including agency evaluation policies and guides, country  strategy and planning documents for each country, monitoring and  evaluation plans, standard operating procedures, program evaluations,  and quarterly and other progress reports. We also interviewed agency  officials in Washington, D.C., and in El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras concerning steps they have taken to monitor and evaluate  programs that seek to address causes of UAC migration. We also  reviewed Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, and  prior GAO work on performance measurement. In determining the  importance of evaluating media campaigns as a good practice that  leading organizations follow, we assessed various sources, including  federal policies, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, prior GAO reports on U.S. public diplomacy, and literature  on practices for evaluating media campaigns. These sources outlined the  importance of integrating evaluations into media campaigns and noted  that while evaluations add cost, they are a worthwhile investment in  campaign success.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to July 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
