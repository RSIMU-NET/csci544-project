Hedge funds generally are recognized as important sources of liquidity and as holders and managers of risks in the capital markets. Although the market impacts of recent hedge fund near collapses were less severe than that of LTCM, they recalled concerns about risks associated with hedge funds and they highlighted the continuing relevance of questions raised over LTCM. This report (1) describes how federal financial regulators oversee hedge fund-related activities under their existing authorities; (2) examines what measures investors, creditors, and counterparties have taken to impose market discipline on hedge funds; and (3) explores the potential for systemic risk from hedge fund-related activities and describes actions regulators have taken to address this risk. In conducting this study, GAO reviewed regulators' policy documents and examinations and industry reports and interviewed regulatory and industry officials, and academics. Regulators only provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO has incorporated into the report as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under the existing regulatory structure, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission can provide direct oversight of registered hedge fund advisers, and along with federal bank regulators, they monitor hedge fund-related activities conducted at their regulated entities. Since LTCM's near collapse, regulators generally have increased reviews--by such means as targeted examinations--of systems and policies of their regulated entities to mitigate counterparty credit risks, including those involving hedge funds. Although some examinations found that banks generally have strengthened practices for managing risk exposures to hedge funds, regulators recommended that they enhance firmwide risk management systems and practices, including expanded stress testing. Regulated entities have the responsibility to practice prudent risk management standards, but prudent standards do not guarantee prudent practices. As such, it will be important for regulators to show continued vigilance in overseeing hedge fund-related activities. According to market participants, hedge fund advisers have improved disclosures and transparency about their operations since LTCM as a result of industry guidance issued and pressure from investors and creditors and counterparties (such as prime brokers). But market participants also suggested that not all investors have the capacity to analyze the information they receive from hedge funds. Regulators and market participants said that creditors and counterparties have generally conducted more due diligence and tightened their credit standards for hedge funds. However, several factors may limit the effectiveness of market discipline or illustrate failures to properly exercise it. For example, because most large hedge funds use multiple prime brokers as service providers, no one broker may have all the data necessary to assess the total leverage of a hedge fund client. Further, if the risk controls of creditors and counterparties are inadequate, their actions may not prevent hedge funds from taking excessive risk. These factors can contribute to conditions that create systemic risk if breakdowns in market discipline and risk controls are sufficiently severe that losses by hedge funds in turn cause significant losses at key intermediaries or in financial markets. Financial regulators and industry participants remain concerned about the adequacy of counterparty credit risk management at major financial institutions because it is a key factor in controlling the potential for hedge funds to become a source of systemic risk. Regulators have used risk-focused and principles-based approaches to better understand the potential for systemic risk and respond more effectively to financial shocks that threaten to affect the financial system. For instance, regulators have collaborated to examine some hedge fund activities across regulated entities. The President's Working Group has taken steps such as issuing guidance and forming two private sector groups to develop best practices to enhance market discipline. GAO views these as positive steps, but it is too soon to evaluate their effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, hedge funds have grown rapidly. According to industry  estimates, from 1998 to early 2007, the number of funds grew from more  than 3,000 to more than 9,000, and assets under management from more  than $200 billion to more than $2 trillion globally. An estimated $1.5  trillion of these assets is managed by U.S. hedge fund advisers. Hedge  funds are key players in many financial markets. For example, hedge funds  reportedly account for more than 40 percent of the trading volume in the  U.S. leveraged loan market, more than 85 percent of the distressed debt  market, and more than 80 percent of certain credit derivatives markets.  Institutional investors, such as endowments, foundations, insurance  companies, and pension plans, seeking to diversify their risks and increase  returns, have invested in hedge funds and contributed to the rapid growth  in these funds.", "As active market participants, hedge funds generally are recognized to  provide benefits to financial markets by enhancing liquidity and promoting  market efficiency and price discovery. Especially in volatile markets,  hedge funds are generally willing to assume risks that more regulated  financial institutions are unwilling or unable to assume. Additionally, they  are recognized to spur financial innovation and help to reallocate financial  risk. Nevertheless, the rapid growth of funds that may adopt similar  investment strategies in interconnected markets with rapid trading  strategies raises questions as to whether large losses from one or more  hedge funds could cause widespread difficulties at other firms, in other  market segments, or in the financial system as a whole. For example,  hedge funds may impose losses on their creditors and counterparties and  thereby disrupt the credit availability to financial markets or through  market disruptions that could accompany liquidation of funds\u2019 positions.", "Market discipline plays a primary role, supplemented by indirect  regulatory oversight of commercial banks and securities and futures firms,  in constraining risk taking and leveraging by hedge fund managers  (advisers). Market participants (e.g., investors, creditors, and  counterparties) impose market discipline by rewarding well-managed  hedge funds and reducing their exposure to risky, poorly managed hedge  funds. However, according to several sources, for market discipline to be  effective, (1) investors, creditors, and counterparties must have access to,  and act upon, sufficient and timely information to assess a fund\u2019s risk  profile; (2) investors, creditors, and counterparties must have sound risk  management policies, procedures, and systems to evaluate and limit their  credit risk exposures to hedge funds; and (3) creditors and counterparties  must increase the costs or decrease the availability of credit to their hedge  fund clients as the creditworthiness of the latter changes.", "Inadequate market discipline is often cited as a contributing factor to the  near collapse in 1998 of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a large  highly leveraged hedge fund. The subsequent 1999 report by the  President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) questioned the  adequacy of (1) market discipline that some creditors and counterparties  (commercial and investment banks, including their prime brokerage  business and futures firms) imposed on LTCM\u2019s risk-taking activities, and  (2) LTCM\u2019s disclosure and risk management practices. The report also  raised questions about the risk management practices of these entities and  the ability of federal financial regulators to supervise effectively the large  creditors and counterparties that extended credit to hedge funds. In its  1999 report, the PWG made recommendations to enhance market  discipline and the risk management practices of market participants.  Since LTCM, other hedge funds have experienced near collapses or  failures. Despite a few notable failures, hedge funds overall seem to have  held up well, and their counterparties have not sustained material losses in  the market turmoil that began in the summer of 2007. Although the market  impacts of the recent cases were less severe than that of LTCM, they  recalled concerns about risks associated with hedge funds and they  highlighted the continuing relevance of questions raised over LTCM.", "Given the growing importance and continuing evolution of the hedge fund  sector since LTCM, you asked us to study the risks hedge funds may pose  to the financial markets and how hedge fund creditors and counterparties  and the regulatory framework can address those risks. Accordingly, this  report (1) describes how federal financial regulators provide oversight of  hedge fund-related activities under their existing authorities; (2) examines  what measures investors, creditors, and counterparties have taken to  impose market discipline on hedge funds; and (3) explores the potential  for systemic risk from hedge fund-related activities and actions regulators  have taken to address this risk.

In addition, hedge funds operate to qualify  for exemptions from certain registration and disclosure requirements of  federal securities laws (including the Securities Act of 1933 and the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934). For example, hedge funds must refrain  from advertising to the general public and can solicit participation in the  fund from only certain large institutions and wealthy individuals.  Although certain advisers may be exempt from registration requirements,  they remain subject to anti-fraud (including insider trading), anti- manipulation, and large trading position reporting rules. For example,  upon acquiring a significant ownership position in a particular publicly  traded security or holding a certain level of futures or options positions, a  hedge fund adviser may be required to file a report disclosing the adviser\u2019s  or hedge fund\u2019s holdings with SEC or positions with CFTC, as applicable.", "Hedge funds have significant business relationships with the largest  regulated commercial and investment banks. Hedge funds act as trading  counterparties for a wide range of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and  other financing transactions. They also act as clients through their  purchase of clearing and other services and as borrowers through their  use of margin loans from prime brokers.", "Hedge funds generally are not restricted by regulation in their choice of  investment strategies, as are mutual funds. They may invest in a wide  variety of financial instruments, including stocks and bonds, currencies,  OTC derivatives, futures contracts, and other assets. Most hedge fund  trading strategies are dynamic, often changing rapidly to adjust to fluid  market conditions. To seek to generate \u201cabsolute returns\u201d (performance  that exceeds and has low correlation with stock and bond markets  returns), advisers may use leverage, short selling, and a variety of  sophisticated investment strategies and techniques. However, while  hedge funds frequently borrow or trade in products with leverage to  magnify their returns, leverage also can increase their losses. Appendix III  provides examples of investment strategies used by hedge funds.", "Advisers of hedge funds commonly receive a fixed compensation of 2  percent of assets under management plus 20 percent of the fund\u2019s annual  profits. Some fund advisers can command higher fees. Since this  compensation scheme rewards hedge fund advisers for exceptional  performance, but does not directly penalize them for inferior performance,  advisers could be tempted to pursue excessively risky investment  strategies that might produce exceptional returns. To discourage  excessive risk taking, investors generally insist that the advisers and  principals also personally invest in their funds to more closely align  principals\u2019 interests with those of fund investors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hedge Funds Generally Are Subject to Limited Direct Oversight, but Regulatory Focus Has Increased since LTCM", "paragraphs": ["SEC\u2019s ability to directly oversee hedge fund advisers is limited to those  that are required to register or voluntarily register with SEC as investment  advisers.

Also, under a program established in 2004, SEC oversees, on a  consolidated basis, some of the largest internationally active securities  firms that engage in significant hedge fund-related activities. CFTC directly  oversees registered CPOs and CTAs (some of which may be hedge fund  advisers) through market surveillance, regulatory compliance surveillance,  an examination program delegated to NFA, and enforcement actions.

Meanwhile, hedge funds, like other investors in publicly traded  securities, are subject to various regulatory reporting requirements. For  example, upon acquiring a 5 percent beneficial ownership position of a  particular publicly traded security, a hedge fund may be required to file a  report disclosing its holdings with SEC. Also, any institutional investment  adviser with investment discretion over accounts holding certain publicly  traded equity securities valued at $100 million or more must file on a  quarterly a report with SEC.

In August 2006, SEC estimated  that 2,534 advisers that sponsored at least one hedge fund were registered  with the agency. Since August 2006, SEC\u2019s ability to identify an adviser  that manages a hedge fund has been further limited due to changes in  filing requirements and to advisers that chose to retain registered status.  As of April 2007, 488, or about 19 percent of the 2,534 advisers, had  withdrawn their registrations. At the same time, 76 new registrants were  added and some others changed their filing status, leaving an estimated  1,991 hedge fund advisers registered.

The new examination module outlines how the examination of a hedge  fund adviser generally begins with an analysis of the adviser\u2019s compliance  program and the work of its chief compliance officer and uses a control  scorecard as a guide. As part of this review of compliance programs,  examiners inspect the typical activities of advisers and are expected to  obtain a clear understanding of all activities of affiliates and how these  activities may affect or conflict with those of the hedge fund adviser being  examined. Examiners are to focus primarily on the following activities  during their examinations of hedge fund advisers:    brokerage arrangements and trading;    personal trading by access persons;    valuation of positions and calculations of net asset value;    safety of clients\u2019 and funds\u2019 assets;  fund investors and capital introduction;    violations of domestic or foreign laws that may directly harm fund  investors or other market participants, or cause harm to prime brokers;   books and records, fund financial statements, and investor reporting;    chief compliance officer, compliance culture, and program; and    boards of directors for offshore funds (fiduciary duties to shareholders of  the hedge funds and consistent disclosure to its investors).", "In preparation for the registration of hedge fund advisers and because SEC  does not have a dedicated group of examiners that focus on hedge funds,  SEC and hedge fund industry officials noted the need for more experience  and ongoing training of examiners on hedge funds\u2019 investment strategies  and complex financial instruments. SEC developed a specialized training  program to better familiarize its examiners with the operation of hedge  funds to improve effectiveness of examinations of hedge fund advisers. In  that regard, from October 2005 through October 2006, SEC held about 20  examiner training sessions on hedge fund-related topics. Industry  participants were instructors in many of these sessions. These sessions  covered topics such as hedge fund structure, hedge fund investment  vehicles, identification and examination of conflicts of interests at hedge  fund advisers, risk management, prime brokerage, valuation, current and  future regulation, examination issues, and investment risk. SEC continues  to offer hedge fund training to examiners and other staff on an ongoing  voluntary basis.", "SEC uses a risk-based examination approach to select investment advisers  for inspections. Under this approach, higher-risk investment advisers are  examined every 3 years. One of the variables in determining risk level is  the amount of assets under management. SEC officials told us that most  hedge funds, even the larger ones, do not meet the dollar threshold to be  automatically considered higher-risk. As part of the overall risk-based  approach for conducting oversight of investment advisers, SEC uses a  database application called Risk Assessment Database for Analysis and  Reporting (RADAR), to identify the highest-risk areas designated by  examiners and to develop and recommend regulatory responses to  address these higher-risk areas. In fiscal year 2006, RADAR identified a  number of hedge fund-related risk areas, which although not exclusive to  hedge funds require additional regulatory attention, including the  following:    soft dollars (e.g., paying for a hedge fund\u2019s office space without disclosing    market manipulation (e.g., the dissemination of false information to inflate  the price of a stock);    hedge fund custody and misappropriation (e.g., theft of hedge fund assets  by its advisers);   complexity of hedge fund products and suitability (e.g., inadequacy of  policies and procedures to assess the complexity of financial instruments  and the suitability of products for investors);   prime brokerage relationships (e.g., potential conflicts of interest where  prime brokers give hedge fund clients\u2014who often pay large dollar  amounts of commissions\u2014priority over non-hedge fund clients regarding  access to information/research);   performance fees (e.g., incorrect calculation of performance fees);    hedge fund valuation (e.g., inadequate policies and procedures to ensure  that asset valuations are accurate); fund of funds\u2019 conflicts of interest (e.g., conflicts of interest between fund  of funds advisers and their recommendation to a fund of hedge fund to  invest in certain hedge funds); insider trading (e.g., trading on nonpublic information); and   hedge fund suitability (e.g., inadequate policies and procedures to ensure  the financial qualification of investors).", "According to SEC officials, they plan to address these risks by primarily  focusing on these areas during subsequent examinations.", "As part of its fiscal year 2006 routine inspection program, SEC conducted  examinations of 1,346 registered investment advisers, of which 321 were  believed to have involved hedge fund advisers. SEC used its new hedge  fund module, along with other modules as appropriate, to conduct the 321  examinations, which included 5 of the largest 78 U.S. hedge funds.  According to SEC officials, the 321 hedge fund advisers\u2019 examinations  found that these advisers had the greatest deficiencies in the following  areas: (1) information disclosures, reporting, and filing\u2014e.g., private  placement memorandum was outdated; (2) personal trading\u2014e.g.,  quarterly reports were not filed or filed late for personal trading accounts;  and (3) compliance rule\u2014e.g., policies and procedures were inadequate to  address compliance risks. Examiners also cited concerns with  performance advertising and marketing of portfolio management,  brokerage arrangement and execution, information processing and  protection, safety of clients\u2019 funds and assets, pricing of clients\u2019 portfolios,  trade allocations, and anti-money laundering.", "In our review of 9 of the 321 examinations of hedge fund advisers, we  found that examiners cited deficiencies in 8 of these examinations.  Deficiencies found included all of the above mentioned categories except  for trade allocations. For example, examiners identified concerns in 5 of  the examinations regarding disclosures and in one of the examinations, for  instance, the hedge fund adviser\u2019s marketing package did not disclose any  material conditions, objectives, or investment strategies used to obtain the  performance result portrayed. In another examination, the hedge fund  adviser failed to adequately disclose to investors that a conflict of interest  may be present when the hedge fund adviser places transactions through  broker-dealers who have invested in the hedge fund.", "According to SEC officials, 294 (or approximately 92 percent) of the 321  hedge fund advisers examined received deficiency letters. Some 292 of  them provided satisfactory responses to SEC that they had taken or would  take appropriate corrective actions. Such actions can include advisers  implementing policies and procedures to address deficiencies. Those  hedge fund advisers that do not take or propose to take corrective actions  for a material deficiency may be referred to SEC\u2019s Division of  Enforcement (Enforcement) for enforcement actions. According to SEC,  23 of the 321 examinations resulted in enforcement referrals, and most of  these referrals regarded situations in which the adviser appeared to have  engaged in fraud that harmed its clients.", "As part of its oversight activities, SEC has brought a number of  enforcement actions involving hedge fund advisers. Sources of  information that led to SEC enforcement cases included examinations,  self-regulatory organizations, referrals, and tips. From October 1, 2001, to  June 12, 2007, SEC brought a total of 3,937 enforcement cases, of which  113, or 2.9 percent, were hedge fund-related. These cases involve hedge  fund advisers who misappropriated fund assets, engaged in insider trading,  misrepresented portfolio performance, falsified their experience and  credentials, or lied about past returns. As an example, in 2006, SEC  brought a case against a hedge fund adviser and its former portfolio  manager and charged them with making investment decisions based on  nonpublic insider information that certain public offerings were about to  be publicly announced. The hedge fund adviser agreed to pay  approximately $5.7 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and  civil money penalty, and the former portfolio manager agreed to pay a civil  money penalty of $110,000 and be barred from associating with an  investment adviser for 3 years. SEC also has brought cases for inaccurate  disclosure of trading strategies, undisclosed preferential treatment of  hedge fund clients at the expense of other clients, market manipulation,  insider trading, illegal short selling, and improper valuation of assets.  During the same period, nine insider trading cases were brought against  hedge fund advisers, of which five have been settled and four remain in  litigation. The five settled cases resulted in disgorgements ranging from  $2,736 to $7.05 million, civil penalties ranging from $8,208 to $4.7 million, a  suspension, and bars from the securities industry.", "According to an SEC enforcement official, SEC recognized that hedge  funds were becoming a prominent force in the financial industry, and in  anticipation that certain hedge fund advisers would be required to register  with SEC as investment advisers when the now vacated amendment to  Rule 203(b)(3)-1 was under consideration, SEC created a hedge fund  working group composed primarily of Enforcement and Office of  Compliance Inspections and Examinations staff and participants from  other divisions. The goals of this group are to enhance SEC\u2019s staff  knowledge about the hedge fund industry to aid in its oversight role and  coordinate and strengthen the agency\u2019s efforts to combat insider trading at  hedge funds.

SEC staff oversees  some large, internationally active U.S. securities firms with significant  hedge fund activities through its Consolidated Supervised Entity program  (CSE), which was established in June 2004. Between December 2004 and  November 2005, five large securities firms have elected to become CSEs.  The CSE program consists of four components: (1) a review of the firm\u2019s  application to become a CSE; (2) a review of monthly, quarterly, and  annual filings, such as consolidated financial statements and risk reports,  substantially similar to those provided to the firm\u2019s senior management;  (3) monthly meetings with senior management (senior risk managers and  financial controllers) at the holding company level to review financial and  risk reports and share written results of these meetings among staff and  commissioners; and (4) an examination of books and records of the  ultimate holding company, the broker-dealer, and material affiliates. SEC  relies on a number of regulatory tools, including margin, capital, and  reporting requirements to oversee CSEs. Margin rules within the broker- dealer help protect against losses resulting from defaults by requiring its  hedge fund clients to provide collateral in amounts that depend on the risk  of the particular position and help maintain safety and soundness of their  firms. Capital requirements are minimum regulatory required levels of  capital that a firm must hold against its risk-taking activities. These  requirements can help a firm withstand the failure of a counterparty or a  period of market or systemic stress.", "One aspect of the CSE program involves how the securities firms manage  various risk exposures, including those from hedge fund activities such as  providing prime brokerage service and acting as creditors and  counterparties through financing and OTC derivatives trade transactions.  These large integrated financial institutions may be exposed to various  risks from hedge fund activities such as providing prime brokerage  services through a registered broker-dealer, acting as creditors and  counterparties, or owning a hedge fund. For example, the recent problems  at two hedge funds sponsored by Bear Stearns Asset Management that  invested in financial instruments tied to subprime mortgages (where Bear  Stearns ultimately provided some secured financing to the funds) highlight  such risks. As part of the application process that took place from  November 2004 through January 2006, SEC examined the five securities  firms\u2019 risk management systems (market, credit, liquidity, operational, and  legal and compliance), internal controls, and capital adequacy calculations  and continues to do so on an ongoing basis. SEC did not target hedge fund  activities specifically within the scope of the five application  examinations, because hedge funds were not products or activities judged  to pose the greatest risks to the firms. Our review of the five CSEs\u2019  application examinations found that examination findings generally were  related to firms\u2019 documentation of compliance with rules and  requirements. SEC shared the findings with the firms and has monitored  the firms\u2019 implementation of its recommendations. An SEC official said  that those issues have been resolved, but more recently, SEC\u2019s  examinations of three of the firms identified a number of issues related to  capital computations, operational controls, and risk management.  Examination staff are addressing these issues with the firms.", "SEC monitors CSEs continuously for financial and operational weakness  that might place regulated entities within the group or the broader  financial system at risk. According to an SEC official, the CSE program  allows SEC to conduct reviews across the five firms (i.e., cross-firm  reviews) to gain insights into business areas that are material by risk or  balance sheet measures, rapidly growing, pose particular challenges in  implementing the Basel regulatory risk-based capital regime, or have some  combination of these characteristics. For example, in fiscal year 2006,  SEC conducted two cross-firm reviews related to leveraged lending and  hedge fund derivatives, and in fiscal year 2007, SEC conducted two cross- firm reviews related to securitization and private equity and principal  investments. According to the official, SEC generally found that the firms  were in regulatory compliance, but there were areas where capital  computation methodology and risk management practices can be  improved. For example, four firms modified their capital computations as  a result of feedback from the leveraged lending project. For each review,  SEC produced a report that described the business model, related risk  management, and capital treatment to each review area, and provided  feedback to each firm on where it stood among the peer firms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CFTC Can Monitor Hedge Fund Activities through Its Market Surveillance, Regulatory Compliance Surveillance, and Delegated Examination Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although CFTC does not specifically target hedge funds, through its  general market and financial supervisory activities, it can provide  oversight of persons registered as CPOs and CTAs that operate or advise  hedge funds that trade in the futures markets.

A  summary of the violations cited in the actions includes misrepresentation  with respect to assets under management or profitability; failure to  register with CFTC; failure to make required disclosures, statement, or  reports; misappropriation of participants\u2019 funds; and violation of prior  prohibitions (i.e., prior civil injunction or CFTC cease and desist order).", "Pursuant to CFTC-delegated authority, NFA, a registered futures  association under the CEA and a self-regulatory organization, oversees the  activities, and conducts examinations, of registered CPOs and CTAs. As  such, hedge fund advisers registered as CPOs or CTAs are subject to direct  oversight in connection with their trading in futures markets. More  specifically, to the extent that hedge fund operators or advisers trade  futures or options on futures on behalf of hedge funds, the funds are  commodity pools and the operators of, and advisers to, such funds are  required to register as CPOs and CTAs, respectively, with CFTC and  become members of NFA if they are not exempted from registration. Once  registered, CPOs and CTAs become subject to detailed disclosure, periodic  reporting and record-keeping requirements, and periodic on-site risk- based examinations. However, regardless of registration status, all CPOs  and CTAs (including those affiliated with hedge funds) remain subject to  CFTC\u2019s anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority.", "Our review of NFA documentation found that 29 advisers of the largest 78  U.S. hedge funds (previously mentioned) are registered with CFTC as  CPOs or CTAs. In addition, 20 of the 29 also are registered with SEC as  investment advisers or broker-dealers. According to NFA officials, because  there is no legal definition of hedge funds, it does not require CPOs or  CTAs to identify themselves as hedge fund operators or advisers. NFA,  therefore, considers all CPOs and CTAs as potential hedge fund operators  or advisers. According to NFA, in fiscal year 2006 NFA examined 212  CPOs, including 6 of the 29 largest hedge fund advisers registered with  NFA. During the examinations, NFA staff performed tests of books and  records and other auditing procedures to provide reasonable assurance  that the firm was complying with NFA rules and all account balances of a  certain date were properly stated and classified. Our review of four of the  examinations found that 3 of the CPOs examined generally were in  compliance with NFA regulations and the remaining 1 was found to have  certain employees that were not properly registered with CFTC. According  to examination documentation, subsequent to the examination, the hedge  fund provided a satisfactory written response to NFA noting that it would  soon properly register the employees.", "According to an NFA official, since 2003 NFA has taken 23 enforcement  actions against CPOs and CTAs, many of which involved hedge funds.  Some of the violations found included filing fraudulent financial  statements with NFA, not providing timely financial statements to  investors, failure to register with CFTC as a CPO, failure to maintain  required books and records, use of misleading promotional materials, and  failure to supervise staff.

Where examiners identified  deficiencies, specific recommendations were made. Although credit  officers often adjusted credit terms for degree of transparency, examiners  recommended that banks\u2019 policies explicitly link transparency to credit  terms and that banks monitor evolving credit terms for hedge fund  counterparties.

OCC  generally found the overall risk management practices of these banks to  be satisfactory. However, examiners identified concerns in the lack of  transparency in the banks\u2019 hedge fund review processes and issued  recommendations accordingly. For example, examiners found in certain  banks a lack of adequate credit review policies that clearly outline risk  assessment criteria for levels of leverage, risk strategies and  concentrations, and other key parameters and documentation to support  accuracy of a bank\u2019s credit analysis and risk rating system. Examiners also  found that financial information provided by some hedge fund borrowers  has been incomplete and that banks should document the lack of such  information in their credit review process. OCC noted that the banks have  taken satisfactory steps in response to examination issues raised.", "In addition, in 2005 and 2006, FDIC conducted an examination of hedge  fund lending at one of its banks.

Market participants further noted that  the exercise moves from an initial screening to quickly identify the funds  that do meet the potential investor\u2019s investment criteria to a detailed  evaluation that involves addressing a series of questions about the  business, management, legal, and operational aspects of the hedge fund.

Consequently, investors  may seek information beyond that provided in PPMs and sometimes  beyond what hedge funds are willing to provide. For instance, they may  request from hedge fund managers a list of hedge fund securities positions  and holdings (position transparency) or information about the risks  associated with the hedge fund\u2019s market positions (risk transparency).", "However, according to market participants we interviewed, although most  hedge funds may be willing to provide information on aggregate position  and holdings, many hedge funds decline to share specific position  transparency, citing the need to keep such information confidential for  fear that disclosure might permit other market participants to take  advantage of their trading positions to the detriment of the fund and its  investors. Additionally, some prospective investors also may obtain from  hedge fund managers access to the hedge funds\u2019 prime brokers and other  service providers such as auditors, lawyers, fund administrators, and  accountants for background checks.

Institutional  investments in hedge funds have grown substantially in recent years. Over  the last 3 years, institutional investors in search of higher returns and risk  diversification, such as pension funds, endowments, and funds of hedge  funds, have accounted for a significant portion of the inflows to hedge  funds assets under management. (See app. II for information on pension  plan investments in hedge funds). According to market participants and  industry literature, the increasing popularity of hedge funds among these  institutional investors has led to changes in the industry. That is, hedge  fund advisers have responded to the requirements of these clients by  providing disclosure that allows them to meet fiduciary responsibilities.  For example, one market participant we met with stated that a trustee to a  pension plan that is subject to the \u201cprudent person\u201d standard of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is required to  make investment decisions for the plan in accordance with a \u201cprudent  person\u201d standard of care that may require plan trustees to demand greater  quality oversight of their capital; in consequence, they may demand greater  transparency, risk information, and valuation techniques than individual  investors. Market participants with whom we met also told us that the  trend toward permanent capital also has been driving hedge fund  transparency. Markets participants further noted that as hedge funds reach  a certain size, they tend to seek more permanent capital through the public  markets to avoid the liquidity risks inherent with sudden investor  redemptions.", "The ability of market discipline to control hedge funds\u2019 risk taking is  limited by some investors\u2019 inability to fully understand and evaluate the  information they receive on hedge fund activities or these investors\u2019  willingness to hire others to evaluate that information for them. An  example can be found in the Amaranth case. According to market  participants we interviewed and industry coverage that documented the  event, Amaranth noted in its periodic letters to investors that it had a large  concentration in the natural gas sector. The market participants and the  documents noted that some investors became concerned about the  potential risks associated with concentrated positions and withdrew their  money from Amaranth several months before Amaranth failed. They also  said that other investors did not heed potential warning signs included in  the investor letter and kept their money in Amaranth either in pursuit of  higher investment returns or because they did not fully comprehend the  changing risk profile of the hedge fund.", "Regulators, market participants, and academics generally agree that hedge  funds have improved disclosure and risk management practices since the  LTCM crisis and have largely adopted the guidance from various industry  groups and the PWG. Regulators told us that from their examinations of  regulated entities that transact business with hedge funds as creditors and  counterparties, they have observed that hedge fund disclosure and risk  management practices have improved since LTCM. For example, in  response to the 1999 PWG report recommendation that hedge funds  establish a set of sound practices for risk management and internal  controls, private sector entities such as the Managed Funds Association  (MFA), and the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group (CRMPG),  as well as the public sector International Organization of Securities  Commissions (IOSCO) published guidance for hedge funds and their  advisers. Market participants told us that many hedge fund advisers with  which they conduct business have adopted these best practices, including  risk management models that go beyond measuring \u201cvalue at risk,\u201d and  now regularly stress-test portfolios under a wide range of adverse  conditions.

According to market participants,  entering into contracts with hedge funds as creditors or counterparties is  the primary mechanism by which financial institutions\u2019 credit exposures to  hedge funds arise, and exercising counterparty risk management is the  primary mechanism by which financial institutions impose market  discipline on hedge funds. According to the staff of the member agencies  of the PWG, the credit risk exposures between hedge funds and their  creditors and counterparties arise primarily from trading and lending  relationships, including various types of derivatives and securities  transactions. As part of the credit extension process, creditors and  counterparties typically require hedge funds to post collateral that can be  sold in the event of default. According to market participants we  interviewed, collateral most often takes the form of cash or high-quality,  highly liquid securities (e.g., government securities), but it can also include  lower-rated securities (e.g., BBB rated bonds) and less liquid assets (e.g.,  CDOs). They told us they take steps to ensure that they have clear control  over collateral that is pledged, which according to some creditors and  counterparties we interviewed, that was not the case with LTCM.  Creditors and counterparties generally require hedge funds to post  collateral to cover current credit exposures (this generally occurs daily)  and, with some exceptions, require additional collateral, or initial margin,  to cover potential exposures that could arise if markets moved sharply.  Creditors to hedge funds said that they measure a fund\u2019s current and  potential risk exposure on a daily basis to evaluate counterparty positions  and collateral.", "To control their risk exposures, creditors and counterparties to generally  large hedge funds told us that, unlike in the late 1990s, they now conduct  more extensive due diligence and ongoing monitoring of a hedge fund  client. According to OCC, banks also conduct \u201cabbreviated\u201d underwriting  procedures for small hedge funds in which they do not conduct much due  diligence. OCC officials also told us that losses due to the extension of  credit to hedge funds were rare. Creditors and counterparties of large  hedge funds use their own internal rating and credit or counterparty risk  management process and may require additional collateral from hedge  funds as a buffer against increased risk exposure. They said that as part of  their due diligence, they typically request information that includes hedge  fund managers\u2019 background and track record; risk measures; periodic net  asset valuation calculations; side pockets and side letters; fees and  redemption policy; liquidity, valuations, capital measures, and net changes  to capital; and annual audited statements. According to industry and  regulatory officials familiar with the LTCM episode, this was not  necessarily the case in the 1990s. At that time, creditors and  counterparties had not asked enough questions about the risks that were  being taken to generate the high returns. Creditors and counterparties told  us they currently establish credit terms partly based on the scope and  depth of information that hedge funds are willing to provide, the  willingness of the fund managers to answer questions during on-site visits,  and the assessment of the hedge fund\u2019s risk exposure and capacity to  manage risk. If approved, the hedge fund receives a credit rating and a line  of credit. Several prime brokers told us that losses from hedge fund clients  were extremely rare due to the asset-based lending they provided such  funds. Also, one prime broker noted that during the course of its  monitoring the risk profile of a hedge fund client, it noticed that the hedge  fund manager was taking what the broker considered to be excessive risk,  and requested additional information on the fund\u2019s activity. The client did  not comply with the prime broker\u2019s request for additional information, and  the prime broker terminated the relationship with the client.", "Through continuous monitoring of counterparty credit exposure to hedge  funds, creditors and counterparties can further impose market discipline  on hedge fund advisers. Some creditors and counterparties also told us  that they measure counterparty credit exposure on an ongoing basis  through a credit system that is updated each day to determine current and  potential exposures. Credit officers at one bank said that they receive  monthly investor summaries from many of their hedge fund clients. The  summaries provide information for monitoring the activities and  performance of hedge funds. Officials at another bank told us that they  generally monitor their hedge fund clients on a quarterly basis and may  alter credit terms or terminate a relationship if it is determined that the  fund is not dealing with risk adequately or if it does not disclose requested  information.", "Some creditors also said that they may provide better credit terms to  hedge funds that consolidate all trade executions and settlements at their  firm than to hedge funds that use several prime brokers because they  would know more about the fund\u2019s exposure. However, large hedge funds  may limit the information they provide to banks and prime brokers for  various reasons. Unlike small hedge funds that generally depend on a  single prime broker for a large number of services ranging from capital  introductions to the generation of customized accounting reports, many  large hedge funds are less dependent on the services of any single prime  broker and, according to several market participants, use multiple prime  brokers as a means to protect proprietary trading positions and strategies,  and to diversify their credit and operational risks.", "Despite improvements in disclosure and counterparty credit risk  management, regulators noted that the effectiveness of market discipline  may be limited or market discipline may not be exercised properly for  several reasons. First, because large hedge funds use several prime  brokers as creditors and counterparties, no single prime broker may be  able to assess the total amount of leverage used by a large hedge fund  client. The stress tests and other tools that prime brokers use to monitor a  given counterparty\u2019s risk profile can incorporate only those positions  known to a trading partner. Second, the increasing complexity of  structured financial instruments has raised concerns that counterparties  lack the capacity (in terms of risk models and resources) to keep pace  with and assess actual risk, illustrating a possible failure to exercise  market discipline properly. More specifically, despite improvements in  risk modeling and risk management, the Federal Reserve believes that  further progress is needed in the procedures global banks use to manage  exposures to highly leveraged counterparties such as hedge funds, in part  because of the increasing complexity of products such as structured credit  products and CDOs in which hedge funds are active participants. The  complexity of structured credit products can add to the already complex  task of measuring and managing counterparty credit risk. For example,  another Federal Reserve official has noted that the measurement of  counterparty credit risk requires complex computer simulations and that  \u201cthe management of counterparty risk is also complicated further by hedge  funds\u2019 complicated organizational structures, legal rights, collateral  arrangements, and frequent trading. It is important that banks develop the  systems capability to regularly gather and analyze data across diverse  internal systems to manage their counterparty credit risk to hedge funds.\u201d  One regulatory official further noted the challenges faced by institutions in  finding, developing and retaining individuals with the expertise required to  analyze the adequacy of these increasingly complex models. The lack of  talented staff can affect counterparty credit risk monitoring and the ability  to impose market discipline on hedge fund risk taking activities. Third,  some regulators have expressed concerns that some creditors and  counterparties may have relaxed their counterparty credit risk  management practices for hedge funds, which could weaken the  effectiveness of market discipline as a tool to limit the exposure of hedge  fund managers. They noted that competition for hedge fund clients may  have led some to reduce the initial margin in collateral agreements,  reducing the amount of collateral to cover potential credit exposure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators View Hedge Fund Activities as Potential Sources of Systemic Risk and Are Taking Measures to Enhance Market Discipline and Prepare for Financial Disruptions", "paragraphs": ["Financial regulators and industry observers remain concerned about the  adequacy of counterparty credit risk management at major financial  institutions because it is a key factor in controlling the potential for hedge  funds to become a source of systemic risk.

In response to their concerns regarding the adequacy of  counterparty credit risk, a group of regulators have, over the past year,  been collaborating to examine particular hedge fund-related activities  across entities they regulate, mainly through international multilateral  efforts and the domestic PWG. The PWG also has established two private  sector committees to identify best practices to address systemic risk and  investor protection issues and has formalized protocols to respond to  financial shocks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Despite Intensified Market Discipline, Concerns about Hedge Funds Creating Systemic Risk Remain", "paragraphs": ["Financial regulators believe that the market discipline imposed by  investors, creditors, and counterparties is the most effective mechanism  for limiting the systemic risk from the activities of hedge funds (and other  private pools of capital). The most important providers of market  discipline are the large, global commercial and investment banks that are  hedge funds\u2019 principal creditors and counterparties. While regulators and  others recognize that counterparty credit risk management has improved  since LTCM, the ability of financial institutions to maintain the adequacy  of these management processes in light of the dramatic growth in hedge  fund activities remains a particular focus of concern. In its July 2005  report, CRMPG noted that \u201ccredit risk and, in particular counterparty  credit risk, is probably the single most important variable in determining  whether and with what speed financial disturbances become financial  shocks with potential systemic traits.\u201d CRMPG further noted that no  single hedge fund today is leveraged on a scale comparable to that of  LTCM in 1998 and that the risk management capabilities of hedge funds  had improved. Although CRMPG concluded that the chance of systemic  financial shocks had declined, Treasury officials noted that regulators  continually review whether the failure of one or more large market  participants, including hedge funds, could destabilize regulated financial  institutions or financial markets in a way that generates broader  macroeconomic consequences.", "Effective market discipline requires that the creditors and counterparties  to hedge funds obtain sufficient information to reliably assess clients\u2019 risk  profiles and that they have systems to monitor and limit exposures to  levels commensurate with each client\u2019s risk and creditworthiness. A  number of large commercial banks and prime brokers bear and manage  the credit and counterparty risks that hedge fund leverage creates.  According to a Federal Reserve official, the recent growth of hedge funds  poses formidable challenges, including significant risk management  challenges to these market participants. If market participants prove  unwilling or unable to meet these challenges, losses in the hedge fund  sector could pose significant risk to financial stability. Concerns remain  that creditors and counterparties face constant challenges in measuring  and managing counterparty credit risk exposures to hedge funds, and in  maintaining qualified staff to implement the various elements of  counterparty credit risk management, including stress testing.", "In addition to counterparty credit risk, Treasury officials noted that  regulators continually review the liquidity of markets to determine  whether the trading behavior of market participants, including hedge  funds, could serve as a source of systemic risk. While hedge funds often  provide liquidity to stressed markets by buying securities that are  temporarily distressed, herding behavior by market participants, including  hedge funds, could strain available market liquidity. According to a  Treasury official, \u201cIf numerous market participants establish large  positions on the same side of a trade, especially in combination with a  high degree of leverage, this concentration can contribute to a liquidity  crisis if market conditions compel traders to simultaneously unwind their  positions.\u201d Some market participants noted that the consequences of  these \u201ccrowded\u201d trades were difficult to anticipate.", "Some Federal Reserve officials noted in a journal article that \u201cin a crisis,  interlocking credit exposures would be the key mechanism by which risks  would be transmitted from one institution to another, potentially  transforming a run-of-the-mill disturbance into a systematic situation.\u201d  The forced sale of assets is recognized by regulators as a potential  transmission mechanism for systemic risk. According to these officials,  regulators in general share concerns that \u201cin illiquid markets, hedge funds  may be forced to sell positions to meet margin requirements, driving down  market prices. In severe cases, the hedge fund may drive down the value  of existing positions by more than they receive from the original sale,  forcing further sales.\u201d However, this transmission mechanism is not  unique to hedge funds but is a characteristic of leverage. Even when the  failure of a hedge fund does not result in a large-scale liquidation of assets,  the concerns raised by the failure can disrupt credit markets. For instance,  concerns regarding the valuation of illiquid subprime mortgages, such as  those held by Bear Stearns Asset Management\u2019s hedge funds, have  contributed to questions about credit quality in this and other markets,  and this broader questioning of credit quality may have contributed to the  subsequent tightening of credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Are Taking Steps to Strengthen Market Discipline to Address Systemic Risk Concerns Stemming from Hedge Fund Activities", "paragraphs": ["To enhance market discipline and help mitigate the potential systemic  risks that hedge fund activities could pose, financial regulators recently  have increased collaboration with each other, foreign financial regulators,  and industry participants.

As discussed earlier, hedge funds are a  potential source of systemic risk if the capacity of their creditors and  counterparties to value positions and manage risk does not keep pace with  developments such as the increasing complexity of financial instruments  and of investment strategies. Because the use of these instruments and  strategies is not exclusive to hedge funds, a regulator said that collecting  data on hedge fund activities to monitor buildup of this risk would be  difficult and not meaningful. Instead, regulators have taken a risk-focused  and principles-based approach by monitoring counterparty risk  management practices across regulated entities and issuing guidance to  help strengthen market discipline. Currently, regulators are reviewing  issues related to the valuation of complex, illiquid, and stressed  instruments by all types of entities.

According to one U.S. regulator, the  reviewers found that the current and potential credit exposures of these  banks to hedge funds were small relative to the banks\u2019 capital because of  their extensive use of collateral agreements.

The efforts for each group of stakeholders  enumerated in the principles and guidelines that the PWG issued entitled  \u201cAgreement Among PWG and U.S. Agency Principals on Principles and  Guidelines Regarding Private Pools of Capital\u201d are briefly summarized  below:  \u201cPrivate Pools of Capital: maintain and enhance information, valuation,  and risk management systems to provide market participants with  accurate, sufficient, and timely information.", "Investors: consider the suitability of investments in a private pool in light  of investment objectives, risk tolerances, and the principle of portfolio  diversification.", "Counterparties and Creditors: commit sufficient resources to maintain  and enhance risk management practices.", "Regulators and Supervisors: work together to communicate and use  authority to ensure that supervisory expectations regarding counterparty  risk management practices and market integrity are met.\u201d", "The PWG\u2019s principles and guidelines are intended to enhance market  discipline, which the PWG stated most effectively addresses systemic risk  posed by private pools of capital, without deterring the benefits such pools  of capital provide to the U.S. economy. According to a Treasury official  involved in developing the PWG guidance, the PWG believes that self- interested, more sophisticated, informed investors, creditors, and  counterparties have their own economic incentives to take actions to  reduce and manage their own risks, which will reduce systemic risk  overall and enhance investor protection. Also, the PWG continues to  believe that regulators have an important role to play in addressing these  issues.", "Further, in September 2007, the PWG established two private sector  committees. One committee comprised asset managers, and the other  comprised investors, including labor organizations, endowments,  foundations, corporate and public pension funds, investment consultants,  and other U.S. and non-U.S. investors. The first task of these committees  will be to develop best practices using the PWG\u2019s principles-based  guidance released in February 2007 as a foundation to enhance investor  protection and systemic risk safeguards. According to the mission  statement of the asset managers\u2019 committee, best practices will cover  asset advisers having information, valuation, and risk management  systems that meet sound industry practices. In turn, these systems would  enable them to provide accurate information to creditors, counterparties,  and investors with appropriate frequency, breadth, and detail. According  to the mission statement of the investors\u2019 committee, best practices would  cover information, due diligence, risk management, and reporting and  build on the PWG guidelines related to disclosure, due diligence, risk  management capabilities, the suitability of the strategies of private pools  given an investor\u2019s risk tolerance, and fiduciary duties. According to staff  of the PWG member agencies, the PWG expects both committees to have  drafts of the best practices available for public comment early in 2008 and  to issue final products in the spring.", "Finally, recognizing that financial shocks are inevitable, the PWG told us  that it adopted more formalized protocols in fall 2006 to coordinate  communications among the appropriate regulatory bodies in the event of  market turmoil, including a liquidity crisis. The protocols include a  detailed list of contact information for domestic and international  regulatory bodies, financial institutions, risk managers, and traders, and  procedures for communications. According to staff of the PWG member  agencies, the protocols were used to handle recent events such as the  fallout from the Amaranth losses in 2006 and the losses from subprime  mortgage investments by two Bear Stearns hedge funds in summer 2007.", "Addressing potential systemic risk posed by hedge fund activities involves  actions by investors, creditors and counterparties, hedge fund advisers,  and regulators. The regulators and the PWG\u2019s recent initiatives are  intended to bring together these various groups to improve current  practices related to hedge fund-related activities and to better prepare for  a potential financial crisis.

We selected for review some of the recent examinations\u2014conducted by  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve  Bank of New York (FRBNY), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and National  Futures Association (NFA)\u2014of regulated entities engaged in transactions  with hedge funds as creditors or counterparties. We reviewed  examinations of financial institutions that are creditors or counterparties  to hedge funds conducted from fiscal years 2004 through 2006 and other  supervisory materials. We reviewed 3 OCC examinations, 7 FRBNY  examinations, 1 FDIC examination, 14 (9 for hedge fund advisers and 5 for  Consolidated Supervised Entities) SEC examinations, and 4 NFA  examinations. We reviewed information that the federal financial  regulators provided on enforcement cases brought for hedge fund-related  activities. In addition, we interviewed U.S. federal financial regulatory  officials to gain an understanding of how they oversee hedge fund-related  activities at the financial institutions over which they have regulatory  authority. More specifically, we spoke with officials from the banking  regulators\u2014OCC, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  FRBNY, FDIC, and Office of Thrift Supervision; a securities regulator\u2014 SEC; and commodities regulators\u2014Commodity Futures Trading  Commission and NFA. We interviewed officials representing Department  of Treasury (Treasury), the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Services  Authority, and the President\u2019s Working Group (PWG) as well. To  determine which of the Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha Magazine 2007  Annual Hedge Fund 100 listing of global hedge fund advisers were U.S.- based and registered with SEC as a hedge fund investment adviser or with  CFTC as a commodity pool operator (CPO) or commodity trading advisor  (CTA), we asked the compliance staff at SEC and NFA to compare their  registrants\u2019 listing with the largest 100 listing. Representatives from both  organizations said that they made their best attempt to match the names in  the largest 100 listing with the registrants\u2019 listings, which was difficult  because the names were not always identical in both listings. SEC  estimates that of the 78 of the largest 100 hedge fund advisers identified by  Alpha Magazine as U.S.-based, 49 were registered with SEC as investment  advisers. NFA estimates that 29 of the 78 U.S.- based hedge fund advisers  were registered with CFTC as CPOs or CTAs. We also reviewed prior GAO  reports.", "To address the second objective (market discipline), we interviewed  relevant market participants (such as investors, creditors, and  counterparties), and regulatory officials, to get their opinions on (1) how  market participants impose market discipline on hedge funds\u2019 risk taking  and leveraging (and whether they have improved since 1998); (2) the type  and frequency of information such participants would need from hedge  fund advisers to gauge funds\u2019 risk profiles and internal controls to make  informed initial and ongoing investment decisions; and (3) the extent to  which hedge fund disclosures to market participants have improved since  the 1998 near failure of the large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital  Management. We also interviewed large hedge funds and the Managed  Funds Association\u2014a membership organization representing the hedge  fund industry. In addition, we conducted a literature search to identify  research on hedge funds and reviewed a selection of relevant regulatory  and industry studies, speeches, and testimonies on the matter.", "To address the third objective (systemic risk), we reviewed relevant  speeches, testimonies, studies, principles and guidelines that the PWG  issued about private pools of capital in 2007 entitled \u201cAgreement Among  PWG and U.S. Agency Principals on Principles and Guidelines Regarding  Private Pools of Capital,\u201d regulatory examination documents and relevant  industry best practices for investors, hedge fund advisers, creditors, and  counterparties.

Also, we reviewed Greenwich  Associates data from 2004 through 2006 that focused on pensions\u2019 hedge  fund investments. We conducted data reliability assessments on the data  from Pensions & Investments and Greenwich Associates that we used,  and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We also reviewed provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)  that changed requirements for how hedge funds hold pension plan assets.  We interviewed pension industry officials (such as pension plan sponsors  of public and private funds, trade groups, pension consultants, pension  plan and hedge fund database providers, a hedge fund law firm, and hedge  funds), an academic and regulatory officials from the Department of  Labor, SEC, and Treasury to get their opinions on the matter, including  trends in such investments over the last few years and the impact of PPA  on pension plan hedge fund investments.

By  modifying the 25 percent benefit plan investor test, the PPA amendment  has the effect of permitting hedge funds to accept unlimited investments  from certain \u201cnon-ERISA benefit plans\u201d (governmental plans, foreign  plans, and most church plans) while still accepting investments from plans  that are subject to ERISA (ERISA benefit plans) without becoming subject  to ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duty requirements. What constitutes \u201cplan assets\u201d is  significant because a person who exercises discretionary authority or  control over the assets of an ERISA benefit plan or who provides  investment advice for a fee with respect to plan assets is a \u201cfiduciary\u201d  subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA.", "As ERISA did not provide a definition for \u201cplan assets\u201d prior to the  enactment of PPA, DOL, in 1986, adopted Rule 2510.3-101 to describe the  circumstances under which the assets of an entity in which an ERISA  benefit plan invests (for example, a hedge fund) would be deemed to  include \u201cplan assets\u201d so that the manager of the entity (for example, a  hedge fund manager) would be subject to the fiduciary responsibility rules  of ERISA. Rule 2510.3-101 excludes from the definition of plan assets, the  assets of an entity in which there is no significant aggregate investment by  \u201cbenefit plan investors,\u201d which is defined to include both ERISA and non- ERISA benefit plans. Participation in an entity would be significant if 25  percent or more of the value of any class of equity securities of the entity  were held by the benefit plan investors collectively (i.e., the 25 percent  benefit plan investor rule). By now excluding from the 25 percent  calculation those equity securities held by non-ERISA benefit plans, the  allowable proportionate share of investments by ERISA benefit plans has  increased.", "We asked several large hedge funds as well as some regulators whether  hedge fund advisers were actively soliciting investments from pension  plans due to the reform. They were unable to comment on whether hedge  fund advisers were taking steps to attract these institutional investments.  However, according to one regulator and two large hedge funds, some  hedge fund advisers do not seek pension investments, and others do seek  out pension investments but are careful not to reach the 25 percent  threshold that would require hedge fund advisers to assume fiduciary  responsibilities. According to one regulator and an industry source,  pension plans are attracted to various hedge fund investment strategies,  depending on their portfolio composition. They also suggested that  pension plans tend to invest in hedge funds through funds of hedge funds.", "From 2001 through 2006, investments by defined benefit (DB) plans in  hedge funds increased, but the share of total pension plan assets invested  in hedge funds remained small. Two key reasons pension plans invest in  hedge funds are to diversify their investment risks and increase investment  returns.
