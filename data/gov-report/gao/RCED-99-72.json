Established under the National Housing Act, FHA insures private lenders against losses on mortgages for single-family homes. FHA plays a particularly large role in certain market segments, including low-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers. The loan amount that FHA can insure is based, in part, on the appraised value of the home. If a borrower defaults and the lender subsequently forecloses on the loan, the lender can file an insurance claim with HUD for nearly all of its losses, including the unpaid balance of the loan. After the claim is paid, the lender transfers the title to the home to HUD, which is responsible for managing and selling the property. Most of the mortgages are insured by FHA under its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (Fund). To cover lenders\u2019 losses, FHA deposits insurance premiums paid by borrowers in the Fund and historically, the Fund has been self-sufficient.", "The purpose of an FHA appraisal is to (1) determine the property\u2019s eligibility for mortgage insurance on the basis of its condition and location and (2) estimate the value of the property for mortgage insurance purposes. In performing these tasks, the appraiser is required to identify any visible deficiencies impairing the safety, sanitation, structural soundness, and continued marketability of the property and to assess the property\u2019s compliance with FHA\u2019s other minimum property standards. According to HUD\u2019s guidance, if an appraiser finds noncompliance with these standards, the appraiser should include in the appraisal report an appropriate and specific action to correct the deficiency.", "Private mortgage lenders making FHA-insured loans for single-family housing are required to select appraisers from FHA\u2019s roster of about 31,500 state-licensed or -certified appraisers. In fiscal year 1998, 825,539 appraisals were performed for the purposes of FHA mortgage insurance. Ninety-six percent of these appraisals were for existing homes, while the remaining 4 percent were for newly constructed homes.", "On-site assessments of completed appraisals, known as field reviews, are HUD\u2019s principal tool for monitoring the performance of the appraisers on FHA\u2019s roster. In conducting a field review, a HUD staff person or contractor visits the appraised property to evaluate all aspects of the appraisal, including whether the value determination was reasonable and whether all needed repairs were identified. The field reviewer is required to document his or her findings on a standard HUD form and recommend a score using a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being unacceptable and 5 being excellent).", "As part of its 2020 Management Reform Plan announced in 1997, HUD consolidated the single-family housing activities of its 81 field offices into four HOCs, each of which is responsible for a multistate area. These activities include processing mortgage insurance and functions related to HUD\u2019s oversight of appraisers and lenders participating in FHA\u2019s programs. The HOCs are located in Denver, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Santa Ana, California, and report directly to HUD\u2019s Office of Insured Single-Family Housing, which is responsible for implementing FHA\u2019s home mortgage insurance program. The consolidation of activities into the four HOCs was carried out in phases and was completed in December 1998. HUD has also established two new offices, the Real Estate Assessment Center and the Enforcement Center, which are expected to play important roles in HUD\u2019s oversight of the FHA appraisal process. According to HUD officials, the Assessment Center\u2019s responsibilities will include analyzing and tracking appraisal quality and appraiser performance, and the Enforcement Center\u2019s responsibilities will include sanctioning appraisers, mortgage brokers, and lenders who do not comply with HUD\u2019s requirements.", "On June 1, 1998, HUD announced a Homebuyer Protection Plan that outlined reforms that HUD intends to make to the FHA appraisal process. Specifically, the plan (1) requires that appraisals include a more thorough basic survey of the physical condition of homes; (2) requires lenders to inform potential homebuyers of defects found during appraisals; (3) requires appraisers to recommend complete, detailed inspections of homes if the appraisers find significant problems with the properties; (4) allows up to $300 of home inspection costs to be financed through FHA mortgages; and (5) imposes stricter accountability on appraisers and tougher sanctions on those who act improperly, including fines and potential prison sentences.

HOC officials told us that they had placed a high priority on completing field reviews when they assumed this responsibility from the field offices but that they were constrained by the amount of time remaining in the fiscal year and the limitations on the number of field reviews that they could ask contractors to perform each month.", "As of February 1999, HUD was piloting a new process for selecting appraisals for field review. HUD plans to use statistical analysis of appraisal quality indicators (e.g., the completeness and mathematical accuracy of the appraisal report) to identify appraisals that may be problematic and, therefore, may be candidates for field review.

This arrangement allowed HUD to field review some appraisals before the lenders closed on the loans and sent the remaining loan documents to HUD for approval of FHA mortgage insurance. However, effective November 1997, appraisers are no longer required to send their appraisal reports to HUD, and HUD does not get a copy of the appraisal report until the lender closes the loan and sends the appraisal report to HUD as part of the loan case file. According to HUD officials, the intent of this change was to reduce the amount of paperwork coming into the HOCs.

In 37 of the 96 cases, the field reviews were performed after HUD had already approved mortgage insurance for the properties.

Unlike appraisals for conventional mortgages, appraisals for FHA-insured mortgages must include an assessment of the properties\u2019 compliance with FHA\u2019s property standards as well as appropriate and specific actions to correct conditions not in compliance with these standards. In addition, the value an appraiser assigns to a property must reflect its value with all the required repairs completed. While HUD encouraged its field offices and local appraiser and lender associations to sponsor training in FHA appraisals, it decided not to make training a condition for placement on FHA\u2019s roster.

FHA relies on appraisals to ensure that the billions of dollars in mortgage loans it insures annually accurately reflect the value of the homes being purchased. FHA homebuyers rely on appraisals, in part, to avoid buying homes with major defects that are costly to fix. However, weaknesses in HUD\u2019s oversight of the FHA appraisal process have increased FHA\u2019s risk of insuring properties that are overvalued or whose owners may default on their FHA-insured loans because of unexpected repair costs. The consequence of this increased risk is higher potential losses to FHA\u2019s insurance fund.", "HUD could significantly improve its monitoring of appraisers. HUD has not ensured that the HOCs are meeting the agency\u2019s requirements to field review 10 percent of all FHA appraisals. Also, HUD\u2019s procedures do not target for field review appraisers who perform significant numbers of FHA appraisals. In addition, a procedural change by HUD has made field reviews less timely, with the result that HUD did not learn of problems with certain appraisals until after HUD had already approved mortgage insurance on the properties. Moreover, the two HOCs we visited did not regularly verify the work of field review contractors through on-site evaluations and lacked tracking systems necessary to readily determine the nature, frequency, and resolution of complaints from FHA homebuyers. These problems weaken HUD\u2019s ability to accurately assess the quality of the appraisals used to support the loans FHA insures.", "HUD\u2019s ability to sanction poorly performing appraisers was seriously impaired by the loss or misplacement of records prior to and during HUD\u2019s field consolidation. Consequently, hundreds of appraisers whose work may be creating an unreasonable underwriting risk for FHA continue to conduct appraisals for FHA-insured mortgages. However, the two HOCs we visited have taken steps toward enforcing FHA\u2019s performance standards for appraisers.", "HUD has not resolved internal disagreements about its authority and policy to hold lenders accountable for poor-quality appraisals. As a result, it has not aggressively enforced this policy. By not resolving this issue, HUD is sending a confusing message to both lenders and FHA borrowers about who is responsible for the quality of appraisals and what remedies exist when an appraisal is unsatisfactory.", "HUD\u2019s reliance on the states\u2019 licensing process and self-certification provide limited assurance that the appraisers on FHA\u2019s roster are knowledgeable of FHA\u2019s appraisal requirements. The states\u2019 minimum licensing standards do not require proficiency in FHA\u2019s guidelines, and HUD is considering, but has not implemented, its own testing requirement.

Because the report contains ample discussion of the Department\u2019s Homebuyer Protection Plan and other steps HUD has taken to improve the FHA appraisal process, we did not make any changes to the report.", "In commenting on our recommendation that HUD achieve better field review coverage of FHA\u2019s appraiser roster, HUD indicated that it will implement a revised field review process by July 1, 1999, that will improve the Department\u2019s sampling and targeting of appraisers for field review. In response to our recommendation that HUD conduct on-site evaluations of a portion of each field review contractor\u2019s work, HUD indicated that it would begin performing supervisory reviews of field review contractors in conjunction with a national field review contract scheduled to begin in July 1999. Regarding our recommendation that HUD determine its authority to hold FHA-approved lenders accountable for poor-quality appraisals, HUD responded that it would target for monitoring those lenders that used poorly performing appraisers. Because HUD\u2019s response did not address the Department\u2019s authority to hold FHA-approved lenders accountable for poor-quality appraisals, we believe that HUD still needs to clarify this matter and issue policy guidance that reflects this clarification.", "HUD disagreed with our recommendation to improve the timeliness of appraisal field reviews by obtaining copies of the appraisal reports and performing field reviews prior to loan closings and the approval of FHA mortgage insurance. HUD indicated that the collection of all appraisals and the performance of field reviews before the approval of mortgage insurance would be impractical and inconsistent with HUD\u2019s Direct Endorsement Program, which allows qualified mortgagees to process and close FHA loans without prior review by HUD. We modified this recommendation to reflect the fact that it may be difficult for HUD to field review appraisals before the lenders close on the loans. However, we continue to believe that it would be feasible for HUD to field review, in advance of approving mortgage insurance, those appraisals that the Department has selected for field review. For example, HUD could require lenders to submit copies of selected appraisal reports immediately after the Department makes the selections rather than waiting for the lenders to include the appraisal reports as part of the loan files sent to HUD prior to the endorsement of mortgage insurance. We believe that such a procedure would not infringe on the underwriting responsibilities of Direct Endorsement lenders and would improve the quality and usefulness of field reviews by (1) significantly reducing the time elapsed between appraisals and the field reviews of those appraisals and (2) reducing HUD\u2019s risk of insuring mortgages based on faulty appraisals.", "The full text of HUD\u2019s letter is presented in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We conducted our work at HUD\u2019s headquarters and its Philadelphia and Denver HOCs.
