The Privacy Office has a number of oversight and coordination functions, including developing policies to implement FOIA initiatives, providing training, and preparing annual reports. Meanwhile, components' FOIA offices are responsible for processing the vast majority of the requests received by the department, subject to regulations and policies issued by the Privacy Office. While components report FOIA processing costs to the Privacy Office, which then aggregates and reports them to the Department of Justice, reported costs are incomplete (for example, the costs do not reflect employee benefits or the salaries of staff outside the components' FOIA offices who retrieve requested documents), thus hindering accountability for total costs. Regarding duplication, GAO determined that certain immigration-related requests are processed twice by two different DHS components. The duplicate processing of such requests by the two components contributes to an increase in the time needed to respond to the requests.", "In 2011, DHS established a goal of reducing backlogged FOIA requests by 15 percent each year, and its component agencies have taken actions toward this goal, including increasing staff, reporting and monitoring backlog information, providing training, and offering incentives to staff for increased productivity. Although there was initial progress by the end of fiscal year 2012, backlog numbers do not account for an estimated 11,000 improperly closed requests, and the number of backlogged requests increased in fiscal year 2013 to a level higher than 2011 (see figure).", "DHS and its components have implemented or are planning to implement various technology capabilities to support FOIA processing based on best practices and federal requirements.

They stated that  it is difficult to collect data on costs incurred by other offices that support  their FOIA operations. According to the FOIA Officer at ICE, although a  form exists for that component\u2019s program offices to account for hours  spent on FOIA activities, ICE did not report this information to the Privacy  Office because ICE considers other FOIA activities to be a higher priority.", "Until DHS takes steps to improve its reporting of costs for its FOIA  operations, such as by providing components with guidance on reporting  costs, the department will lack critical information for effectively managing  its FOIA operations, and that is needed to inform Congress\u2019 oversight of  the department\u2019s efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Duplication Exists in Certain Components\u2019 Processing of Immigration Files", "paragraphs": ["Our work has noted that duplication exists when two or more agencies  or programs are engaged in the same activities or provide the same  services to the same beneficiaries.

These files usually  contain various types of information pertaining to immigrants, including  asylum applications, law enforcement records, and border crossing  documents. As such, they may contain information and records that are  generated by various DHS components or other agencies.", "Within DHS, three components\u2014USCIS, CBP, and ICE\u2014create most of  the documents included in immigration files. USCIS is the custodian of  the files, and all FOIA requests for such files are either initiated with, or  referred to, this component for processing. Specifically, to process a FOIA  request for an immigration file, the USCIS staff to whom the request is  assigned first manually enters the requester\u2019s data, such as a name and  address, into USCIS\u2019s FOIA system to establish a record of the request.  Next, the staff retrieves and scans the documents in the requested file  and reviews the documents. If all of the documents were generated by  USCIS, the staff makes redactions as needed, sends the documents to  the requester, and closes out the request.", "Further, if the FOIA request covers files containing documents generated  by CBP, then USCIS is able to process the request on the basis of an  agreement to that effect with CBP. By having USCIS process such  requests for CBP documents, the two components avoid duplication in  their response to a FOIA request.", "On the other hand, USCIS and ICE do not have such an agreement for  documents generated by ICE. Thus, the USCIS staff is to identify any  such documents and make them available to ICE\u2019s FOIA staff for their  separate processing. In doing so, USCIS and ICE currently engage in  duplicative processing of FOIA requests for those immigration files  containing documents related to law enforcement activities that were  generated by ICE.USCIS staff transfer copies of the ICE-generated documents to a  temporary electronic storage drive that USCIS maintains. According to  USCIS officials, ICE has been granted access to this electronic storage  drive so that it can retrieve files containing the documents that it  generates. ICE retrieves the documents, and the ICE staff then re-enters   Specifically, to facilitate ICE\u2019s review of such files,  the data to create a new FOIA request in ICE\u2019s FOIA processing system.

However, the components\u2019 officials stated that, since that agreement  ended, the components have not made plans to enter into another such  agreement. According to ICE\u2019s FOIA Officer, USCIS\u2019s processing of ICE\u2019s  documents in immigration files was viewed as being too costly.  Nonetheless, while there would be costs associated with USCIS  processing ICE\u2019s documents in immigration files, the potential exists for  additional costs to be incurred in the continued duplicate processing of  such files.", "The absence of an agreement between USCIS and ICE regarding the  handling of FOIA cases contributes to the duplicate processing of the  immigration files. Further, the duplicate processing of a single FOIA  request by USCIS and ICE staff contributes to an increase in the time  needed to respond to a FOIA request for immigration files. Because  USCIS does not send the immigration file to ICE until it has completed its  own processing of the relevant documents\u2014which, according to USCIS,  takes on average 20 working days\u2014ICE usually does not receive the file  to begin its own processing until the 20-day time frame for responding to  a request has passed.", "Re-establishing an agreement that allows USCIS to process ICE- generated documents included in requests for immigration files, to the  extent that the benefits of doing so would exceed the cost, could enable  the two components to eliminate duplication in their processes for  responding to such a request.

With these actions,  USCIS reduced its backlog consistently from 2011 through 2013. FEMA  had a lower backlog in 2012, but an overall increase by 2013, and the  Privacy Office and other selected components\u2019 backlogs increased.  Specifically, there was a total of about 41,000 backlogged requests in  fiscal year 2011 and about 47,000 in fiscal year 2013. The number of  requests received had increased from about 170,000 requests in 2011 to  about 210,000 in 2013, and the number processed increased from about  140,000 in 2011 to about 190,000 in 2013.

According to its officials, the Privacy Office holds  regularly scheduled production meetings, at which the FOIA Production  Manager reviews all pending cases, and weekly staff meetings where  roadblocks to closing backlogged requests are discussed. Further, the  FOIA Production Manager stated that weekly and, in some cases, daily  production reports are received from all processing staff. However,  despite these efforts, the number of backlogged requests grew from 4 in  2011 to 20 in 2013. Privacy Office officials attributed the backlog growth  to an increase in the number of offices for which the Privacy Office  processes FOIA requests. In 2013, the office added 3 additional  headquarters offices to those for which it processes requests and  inherited their backlogs.", "USCIS. To reduce the number of backlogged requests, USCIS increased  the number of its full-time FOIA staff from 188 to 201, and the number of  its total full-time equivalent staff from 195 to 227 from 2011 through 2013.  Further, to reduce the backlog, the agency used temporary assignments  of contractor staff; it also conducted a Lean Six Sigma project to  improve processing throughput. The effort was successful, resulting in an  increase in average monthly cases closed from 7,300 to 10,800. Specific  actions taken under this initiative included: offering awards to staff for increased production; establishing minimum page count standards for processors at enhancing communication and team development through monthly  different grade levels;  creating a GS-12 team leader position for high-performing staff; and  development sessions and leadership development.", "Lastly, according to USCIS officials, telework was expanded to 2 days a  week, leading to increased productivity among staff who telework. As a  result of these efforts, USCIS reported that it had succeeded in reducing  its backlogged requests from 35,780 in 2011 to 3,394 in 2013.", "CBP. To assist with reducing its backlog, CBP developed a management  plan for fiscal years 2013-2014 that included moving the FOIA function  organizationally from its Office of International Trade to the Privacy and  Diversity group; hiring new permanent staff to help process requests;  using temporary staff; and extending the agreement that allows USCIS to  process its documents. According to agency officials, the new  organizational placement has enabled the FOIA office to get more  management attention and better address issues related to its FOIA  operations.", "Nonetheless, CBP experienced a large increase in the number of its  backlogged requests from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2013\u2014 from 4,356 requests to 37,848 requests. According to CBP officials, two  problems, in particular, contributed to the higher numbers. First,  approximately 11,000 FOIA cases that were improperly closed in 2012  had to be reopened and reprocessed. Second, after its reorganization, a  new manager found a stack of boxes containing 12,000 paper requests  from 2012 that had never been entered into their processing system. The  officials stated that CBP subsequently cleared all of these requests.", "ICE. In April 2012, ICE opened a new office in Florida to process referrals  from USCIS. It also trained 20 temporary staff to help process the  backlogged requests. Further, in April 2013, the agency engaged a  contractor to process backlogged requests. Lastly, the agency developed  performance work plans for staff, which specified the number of FOIA  requests or document pages that staff should process weekly.", "Even with these steps, however, ICE\u2019s backlog grew from 18 requests in  fiscal year 2011 to 4,714 in 2013. Officials attributed this increase, in part,  to increased public interest due to immigration reform, increases in the  complexity of requests received, and the expiration of its agreement with  USCIS to process ICE documents contained in immigration files.", "FEMA. During its \u201cnon-disaster season\u201d (February to May 2014), FEMA  used 10 staff redeployed from other areas in the agency to help process  its FOIA backlog.

In the 2014 Chief FOIA officer report, Coast  Guard officials reported that factors impacting their ability to reduce the  backlog included a lack of full-time professional FOIA staff, which results  in reliance on part-time military staff who process FOIA requests as a  collateral duty, may not be trained, and rotate frequently. The  consequence, according to the FOIA office, is confusion, delays,  backlogged requests, and errors.

We purposefully selected the components by analyzing the  department\u2019s fiscal year 2012 data on FOIA requests received, backlogs,  and reported costs. We then selected U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS),  and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) because they were  highest in all three categories\u2014requests, backlogs, and reported costs.  Next, we selected the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard) because it is the  component with the fifth highest volume of requests and backlogged  requests and currently uses a manual process to track and process its  FOIA requests. We purposefully selected the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) because it was the fourth highest in  reported total costs and had unusually high reported costs for the number  of requests it processed as compared to USCIS, CBP, and ICE. We  included the DHS Privacy Office because it has overall responsibility for  FOIA at the department level. Collectively, our selections account for  about 95 percent of total reported DHS requests received, 87 percent of  reported backlogged requests, and 76 percent of reported costs.", "To determine the responsibilities of DHS and the selected components in  managing and processing FOIA requests, we reviewed organization  charts; the department\u2019s and components\u2019 policies and procedures;  service level agreements; and published materials, such as DHS FOIA  annual reports and DHS Chief FOIA Officer reports. We interviewed DHS  and component officials about their responsibilities and management  practices.", "To determine the total costs incurred by DHS and its selected  components in managing and processing FOIA requests, we examined  overall costs as reported in the 2013 annual FOIA report, as well as  detailed cost breakdowns used by the Privacy Office and the selected  components to calculate their reported costs. To determine if all required  cost categories were being reported, we analyzed the categories of costs  reported and compared them to the cost categories required by the  Department of Justice (Justice) and federal management cost accounting  standards to determine the extent to which required cost elements were  being reported. Further, we analyzed cost documentation provided, and  interviewed agency officials to determine how costs were collected and  what steps were taken to assure that cost figures were reliable. In  assessing whether DHS and the selected components reported cost  categories, we applied the following criteria: \u201cyes\u201d if reporting of costs was  complete and was deemed reliable, \u201cpartial\u201d if reported costs were  incomplete or were judged not completely reliable, and \u201cno\u201d if they were  not reported. Due to the non-reporting of particular cost categories and  concerns about the accuracy of certain reported cost data, including data  with obvious errors and inconsistent accounts of how data were collected,  we concluded that, overall, the cost data provided were not sufficiently  reliable, based on federal management cost accounting standards, to  determine DHS\u2019s total FOIA costs, but that our analysis allowed us to  conclude that overall costs were underreported.", "To determine if duplication exists in managing and processing FOIA  requests, we examined policies and procedures, viewed demonstrations  of how automated systems are used to manage and process requests,  and interviewed agency officials to clarify workflow.

We examined DHS annual FOIA reports and Chief FOIA Officer reports,  analyzed published statistics, and reviewed monthly backlog reports by  the components to determine whether reduction goals were met. We  interviewed agency officials and collected documents to determine what  specific actions have been taken to reduce backlogs, identify actions that  had been successful in reducing backlogs, and determine the underlying  causes for the backlogged requests.", "To determine the status of DHS\u2019s and selected components\u2019 efforts to  acquire and implement automated systems, we assessed the capabilities  of automated systems in use by the Privacy Office and the selected  components. Specifically, we viewed demonstrations of systems used for  tracking and processing requests and obtained documentation, such as  user manuals and screen prints. We compared the capabilities of these  systems to relevant statutory requirements, such as the OPEN  Government Act requirement to assign tracking numbers to FOIA  requests, and 13 systems capabilities considered to be best practices for  FOIA processing compiled by the National Archives and Records  Administration\u2019s Office of Government Information Services in conjunction  with the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection  Agency. In assessing DHS\u2019s and the components\u2019 actions to implement  these capabilities, we applied the following criteria: \u201cyes\u201d means the  capability had been implemented; \u201cpartially\u201d means the capability was not  implemented in its entirety, and \u201cno\u201d means the capability was not  implemented.

First, we found that  a FOIA request may be recorded and counted more than once. For  example, USCIS may receive a request for an immigration file, which it  counts. It may then refer to ICE for processing certain documents in the  file that were created by that component. ICE then enters this referral in  its FOIA processing system as a new request. Thus, even though the  department may have received one request for one immigration file, it  may be reported as two requests received and closed by both USCIS and  ICE. Similarly, a request sent to more than one component may be  entered separately by each component that responds. Nonetheless, while  this double counting may result in an inaccurate number of total requests  received by DHS, it did not affect our findings, since we have no findings  related to the overall volume of requests handled by DHS.", "The second issue involved a group of FOIA requests that were improperly  closed by CBP in fiscal year 2012. CBP counted the requests as closed,  although they should have remained open and been counted as part of  the component\u2019s backlog of requests. As a result, the component  reported a lower number of backlogged requests for 2012 than actually  existed. CBP officials did not know exactly how many requests were  involved, but estimated that there were about 11,000. The underreporting  of the backlog of requests does not, however, affect our observation that  CBP\u2019s backlog increased over the time period from 2011 through 2013  because CBP processed all of these requests during this time frame.", "We conducted our work from November 2013 to November 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
