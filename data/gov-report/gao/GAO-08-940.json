Immigration judges (IJ) from the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) decide whether to grant or deny asylum to aliens in removal proceedings. Those denied asylum may appeal their case to EOIR's Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). GAO was asked to assess the variability of IJ rulings, and the effects of policy changes related to appeals and claims. This report addresses: (1) factors affecting variability in asylum outcomes; (2) EOIR actions to assist applicants and IJs; (3) effects associated with procedural changes at the BIA; and (4) effects of the requirement that asylum seekers apply within 1 year of entering the country. GAO analyzed DOJ asylum data for fiscal years 1995 through mid-2007, visited 5 immigration courts in 3 cities, including those with 3 of the top 4 asylum caseloads; observed asylum hearings; and interviewed key officials. Results of the visits provided additional information but were not projectable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the 19 immigration courts that handled almost 90 percent of asylum cases from October 1994 through April 2007, nine factors affected variability in asylum outcomes: (1) filed affirmatively (originally with DHS at his/her own initiative) or defensively (with DOJ, if in removal proceedings); (2) applicant's nationality; (3) time period of the asylum decision; (4) representation; (5) applied within 1 year of entry to the United States; (6) claimed dependents on the application; (7) had ever been detained (defensive cases only); (8) gender of the immigration judge and (9) length of experience as an immigration judge. After statistically controlling for these factors, disparities across immigration courts and judges existed. For example, affirmative applicants in San Francisco were still 12 times more likely than those in Atlanta to be granted asylum. Further, in 14 of 19 immigration courts for affirmative cases, and 13 of 19 for defensive cases, applicants were at least 4 times more likely to be granted asylum if their cases were decided by the judge with the highest versus the lowest likelihood of granting asylum in that court. EOIR expanded its programs designed to assist applicants with obtaining representation and has attempted to improve the capabilities of some IJs. EOIR has conducted two grant rate studies and was using information on IJs with unusually high or low grant rates, together with other indicators of IJ performance, to identify IJs who might benefit from additional training and supervision. However, EOIR lacked the expertise to statistically control for factors that could affect asylum outcomes, and this limited the completeness, accuracy, and usefulness of grant rate information. Without such information, to be used in conjunction with other performance indicators, EOIR's ability to identify IJs who may need additional training and supervision was hindered. EOIR assigned some IJ supervisors to field locations to improve oversight of immigration courts, but EOIR has not determined how many supervisors it needs to effectively supervise IJs and has not provided supervisors with guidance on how to carry out their supervisory role. Following streamlining (procedural changes) at the BIA in March 2002, BIA's appeals backlog decreased, as did the number of decisions favoring asylum seekers. Such decisions were more than 50 percent lower in the 4 years after streamlining compared to 4 years prior. The authority to affirm the IJ's' decisions without writing an opinion was used in 44 percent of BIA's asylum decisions. In June 2008, EOIR proposed regulatory changes to the streamlining rules, but it is too soon to tell how they will affect appeals outcomes. Data limitations prevented GAO from determining the (1) effect of the 1-year rule on fraudulent applications and denials and (2) resources adjudicators have spent addressing related issues. EOIR lacked measures of fraud, data on whether the 1-year rule was the basis for asylum denials, and records of time spent addressing such issues. Congress would need to direct EOIR to develop a cost-effective method of collecting data to determine the effect of the rule."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Globally, the total number of refugees reached an estimated 11.4 million  people at the end of 2007, of whom tens of thousands from over 100  countries came to the United States to apply for asylum. U.S. immigration  law provides that non-citizens who are in this country\u2014regardless of  whether they entered legally or illegally\u2014may be granted humanitarian  protection in the form of asylum if they demonstrate that they cannot  return to their home country because they have a well-founded fear of  persecution.", "Those who seek to apply for asylum generally go through an affirmative or  defensive asylum process. Affirmative applications are voluntarily initiated  by the applicants themselves, and their cases are reviewed by an asylum  officer from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Affirmative  applicants generally receive either a grant, a notice of intent to deny, or, if  they do not have lawful immigration status, a referral to immigration court  for removal proceedings and a second review of their claim. Defensive  applications are filed by applicants against whom removal proceedings  have been initiated, and their cases are presented to an immigration judge  from the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration  Review (EOIR). The accuracy of an asylum decision is critical because of  the decision\u2019s potential impact on the safety of the asylum seeker and the  security of our nation. An incorrect denial may result in an applicant  being returned to a country where he or she had been persecuted or where  future persecution might occur. At the other extreme, an incorrect  approval of an asylum application may allow a terrorist to remain in the  United States, a concern that was heightened by the attacks of September  11, 2001.", "Given the potential consequences of asylum decisions, it is important to  ensure that the asylum system is not misused and that asylum decisions  are being made consistently and fairly. Among other things, the REAL ID  Act of 2005 was a legislative effort to provide consistent standards for  adjudicating asylum applications and to limit fraud. Several recently  published reports have documented the existence of wide disparities in  asylum decisions within and across particular asylum offices and  immigration courts for cases brought by applicants from the same  nationalities and during the same general time periods. These reports  have raised concerns that adjudicators may not be evaluating asylum  claims in a consistent or fair manner.", "Concerns have also been raised by Congress and immigration advocates  about the effects of various policy changes intended to expedite asylum  appeals and reduce fraudulent asylum claims. In 2002, DOJ attempted to  address a large backlog of asylum appeals at EOIR\u2019s Board of Immigration  Appeals (BIA) by streamlining certain appeals procedures with the goal of  improving timeliness and efficiency. This has prompted questions about  whether streamlined procedures have affected the ability of applicants  appealing immigration judges\u2019 decisions to get a fair hearing and to obtain  a well-reasoned opinion from the BIA. Further, the Illegal Immigration  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 included a provision  requiring asylum seekers to apply within the first year of entering the  country. While the 1 year requirement was intended to discourage asylum  fraud, Congress and other stakeholders have raised questions about  whether the resources expended on adjudicating the rule outweigh its  effectiveness in deterring fraud, and about the numbers of people who  were persecuted or tortured who may be denied the benefits of asylum  because of the rule. In response to your interest in these issues, this  report addresses the following objectives:    What factors have affected variability in asylum outcomes in EOIR\u2019s  immigration courts?", "What actions has EOIR taken to assist applicants in obtaining  representation and immigration judges in rendering asylum decisions,  and how, if at all, could they be improved?", "What changes in asylum backlogs and outcomes occurred following the  streamlining of appeals procedures at the BIA?", "What information exists on the effects of the 1-year rule on reducing  fraudulent asylum applications and preventing applicants from being  granted asylum, and what resources have been expended in  adjudicating it?", "To address the first objective, we analyzed data from EOIR on all  decisions rendered by immigration judges from October 1, 1994, through  April 30, 2007, that involved asylum seekers from the 20 countries that  produced the most asylum cases and the 19 immigration courts that  handled the largest numbers of asylum cases. Each of the 20 countries and  19 immigration courts contributed a minimum of 800 affirmative and 800  defensive asylum cases to our analyses. The combination of countries and  immigration courts yielded more than 198,000 cases for our analyses and  constituted 66 percent of all asylum cases decided during the 12 \u00bd year  period. We used EOIR\u2019s case management database to identify  immigration court proceedings where an immigration judge had made a  decision to grant or deny an applicant\u2019s asylum claim. We statistically  controlled for the effects of a number of asylum applicant and immigration  judge characteristics that were potentially related to asylum outcomes in  order to determine whether the likelihood that an immigration judge  would grant or deny an asylum application could be statistically attributed  to those characteristics. In examining potential differences in asylum  outcomes across immigration courts, we analyzed the following seven  factors available in the EOIR immigration court proceedings data: (1) filed  affirmatively or defensively; (2) the nationality of the applicant; (3) the  time period in which the asylum decision was made; (4) whether the  applicant had representation; (5) filed the application within 1 year of  entry to the United States; (6) claimed dependents on the asylum  application; and (7) had ever been detained (defensive cases only).  In  examining potential differences in asylum decisions across immigration  judges, we analyzed an additional nine factors available from EOIR  immigration court proceedings and biographical data, and the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data File. These included  immigration judges\u2019 (1) age, (2) caseload size, (3) gender, (4) length of  experience as an immigration judge, (5) race/ethnicity, (6) veteran status,  (7) prior government immigration experience, (8) prior experience doing  immigration work for a nonprofit organization, and (9) the presidential   administration under which the judges were appointed. Our analyses did  not control for factors related to the merits of asylum claims because such  data were not available. Further, our findings on asylum outcomes cannot  be generalized beyond the 20 countries and 19 immigration courts  included in our analysis. We assessed the reliability of the data used in our  analyses through electronic testing, analyzing related database  documentation, and working with agency officials to reconcile  discrepancies between the data and documentation that we received. We  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We also interviewed officials from EOIR\u2019s Office of the Chief Immigration  Judge and visited five immigration courts in three cities containing three  of the four immigration courts with the highest asylum caseloads. At these  immigration courts, we interviewed immigration judges with varying  asylum grant rates, court administrators, DHS trial attorneys with varying  levels of experience handling cases in the immigration courts, members of  the private bar who represented asylum applicants in immigration court,  and immigration advocates and pro bono legal providers. We also  observed proceedings at each immigration court, including hearings on  asylum cases, to enhance our understanding of the role of immigration  judges. Because we selected nonprobability samples of immigration courts  and stakeholders associated with these immigration courts, the  information we obtained at these locations may not be generalized either  within the immigration courts or to all immigration courts nationwide.  However, the information we obtained at these locations provided us with  a perspective on circumstances associated with asylum proceedings.", "For the second objective, we reviewed the Attorney General\u2019s 2006  reforms directed to the immigration courts and information from EOIR  regarding its implementation of the reforms. Regarding initiatives designed  to assist applicants, we reviewed agency guidance on facilitating pro bono  programs and evaluation reports on EOIR\u2019s Legal Orientation and BIA\u2019s  pro bono programs. We also interviewed the EOIR official responsible for  coordinating these programs. Regarding actions to assist immigration  judges in adjudicating asylum cases, we reviewed agency guidance  regarding processing asylum cases and preparing decisions and orders,  training materials for immigration judges, and the legal examination  administered to new immigration judges. We also interviewed EOIR\u2019s  Assistant Chief Immigration Judges (ACIJ) for Conduct and  Professionalism and for Training, and cognizant officials knowledgeable  about EOIR\u2019s studies of immigration judge grant rates.", "For the third objective, regarding changes in the asylum backlog and  asylum outcomes following the streamlining of adjudication procedures at  the BIA, we obtained and analyzed data from EOIR on the size of the  pending asylum appeals caseload at the BIA for fiscal years 1995 through  2007, and the results of the BIA\u2019s decisions on appeals from immigration  judge decisions for the period from October 1, 1997, through September  30, 2006. We assessed the reliability of the data used in our analyses by  performing electronic testing, analyzing related database documentation,  and working with agency officials to reconcile any discrepancies in the  data and found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We did not use EOIR data on the number of board members at the  BIA who were involved in deciding asylum appeals prior to fiscal year  2004 because of concerns regarding the reliability of the field in those  years. We also interviewed federal circuit court judges in the two circuits  handling the largest number of petitions for review of BIA decisions (the  2nd and 9th Circuits), and officials in DOJ\u2019s Office of Immigration  Litigation (OIL) and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of  New York who defend the Department of Justice in appeals of BIA  decisions to the federal courts.", "Regarding the fourth objective, we reviewed the applicable law and  regulations and discussed their impact on agency resources and applicants  with the same immigration judges, attorneys, and members of advocacy  groups whom we had selected to interview regarding our first objective.  We also added questions about immigration judges\u2019 views of the 1-year  rule to a Web-based survey of immigration judges that was being  conducted as part of another GAO review, and obtained a 77 percent  response rate.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2005 through  September 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

It is an immigration benefit that enables such  individuals to remain in the United States and apply for lawful permanent  residence 1 year after receiving the grant of asylum. Responsibility for  adjudicating asylum applications is shared between U.S. Citizen and  Immigration Services (USCIS) in DHS and EOIR in DOJ. Asylum officers in  8 USCIS Asylum Offices and immigration judges in 54 immigration courts  within EOIR\u2019s Office of the Chief Immigration Judge adjudicate asylum  and other cases. In fiscal year 2008, the Asylum Division received about  $61 million from USCIS fee-based funding and EOIR received about $238  million from congressional appropriations for its entire operation, of  which asylum adjudications are part.", "There are two main avenues for applying for asylum in the United States:  Affirmative asylum process: DHS\u2019s asylum adjudication process  involves affirmative asylum claims\u2014that is, claims that are made at  the initiative of aliens who are in the country either legally or  illegally and who file directly with USCIS. Asylum officers are to  conduct non-adversarial interviews in which they verify the  applicant\u2019s identity, determine whether the applicant is eligible for  asylum, and evaluate the credibility of the applicant\u2019s asylum  claim. The asylum officer may (1) grant asylum, (2) deny asylum to  applicants who are in legal status and issue a Notice of Intent to  Deny, or (3) refer applicants not in legal status to the immigration  court for a de novo review of their claim by an immigration judge.  Upon referral to the immigration court, the applicant is placed in  removal proceedings.", "Defensive asylum process: Defensive claims are those that are first  filed after removal proceedings have been initiated against an alien.  An alien making a defensive claim may have been placed in  removal proceedings after having been stopped at the border  without proper documentation, identified as being in the United  States illegally, or identified as deportable on one or more grounds,  such as certain kinds of criminal convictions.", "Immigration judges hear affirmative asylum claims referred to them by  asylum officers, as well as defensive claims first raised before them.  Adjudication of asylum claims in immigration court is adversarial in that  aliens appear before EOIR immigration judges to defend themselves from  removal from the United States. Immigration judges hear testimony given  during direct and cross-examinations and review the evidence submitted.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Assistant Chief Counsels  (also known as ICE trial attorneys) represent DHS in these proceedings.  Figure 1 illustrates the steps involved in the immigration proceedings  process for affirmative and defensive claims.", "As shown in figure 1, EOIR\u2019s asylum process generally consists of the  following steps. The applicant is to appear before an immigration judge for  an initial, or master calendar, hearing, during which the immigration judge  is to, among other things, (a) ensure that the applicant understands the  contents of the charging document, or Notice to Appear, (b) provide the  applicant with information on available free of charge or low-cost legal  representation in the area, and (c) schedule a subsequent date to hear the  merits of the asylum claim and requests for other alternative forms of  relief from persecution or torture, including withholding of removal and  protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Prior to the  merits hearing, both the ICE trial attorney and the applicant or his or her  representative must submit applications, exhibits, motions, a witness list,  and criminal history to the immigration court. At the merits hearing, where  EOIR is to provide interpreters when necessary, parties present the case  before the immigration judge by generally making opening statements,  presenting witnesses who are subject to cross examination and evidence  to the immigration judge, and making closing statements. The immigration  judge may participate in the questioning of the applicant and other  witnesses. At the end of the hearing, the immigration judge generally  issues an oral decision that should include a statement of facts that were  found to be true, the substantive law and the application of the law to the  facts, what factors were considered, and what weight was given to the  evidence presented (including the credibility of witnesses).", "EOIR\u2019s asylum adjudication process can result in one of the following  outcomes for applicants and their qualifying dependents:  Grant of asylum: Immigration judges may grant asylum to  applicants, enabling them to remain in the United States  indefinitely, unless DOJ terminates asylum. Asylees are eligible to  apply for certain benefits, such as an Employment Authorization  Document, a Social Security card, medical and employment  assistance, lawful permanent residence, and ultimately citizenship.  Within 2 years of being granted asylum, asylees can also petition  for a spouse or child to obtain derivative asylum status.", "Withholding of removal prohibits removal if the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be  threatened because of persecution. Generally, individuals apply for asylum and withholding  of removal at the same time, but only the immigration judge can grant withholding of  removal. The applicant must demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he or she  would be persecuted if returned to the country of origin, a higher standard than the  \u201creasonable possibility\u201d standard for asylum. Protection under regulations implementing  the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment or Punishment (CAT) is another form of relief for individuals fearing torture. As  with withholding of removal based on persecution, the applicant must establish that it is  \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he or she would be tortured if returned to the country of origin.", "Denial of asylum: Immigration judges may deny asylum to  applicants and order them to be removed from the United States  unless they qualify for another form of relief, s such as withholding  or deferral of removal.

The asylum caseload of these  196 immigration judges consisted of more than three-quarters of all  affirmative cases and nearly 90 percent of all defensive cases from the 19  different immigration courts we considered. (See fig. 5, below, and tables  17 and 18 in app. III, for the grant and denial rates of all the immigration  judges included in our review.)", "We examined the data to determine if variability in grant rates across  immigration judges was at least partly because of the fact that different  immigration courts have proportionately different numbers of cases from  different countries. We found that even within immigration courts, there  were pronounced differences in grant rates across immigration judges.  This was the case even though asylum and other immigration cases were  reportedly assigned to immigration judges largely at random.

The variation across immigration judges in many of the remaining  courts was similarly large. For defensive cases, there was also large  variability in the grant rates of immigration judges within the same  immigration court, but the difference between the highest and lowest  granting immigration judge within each immigration court was somewhat  lower than for affirmative cases (see app. III, fig. 13).", "The likelihood of being granted asylum differed considerably across  immigration judges within the same immigration court even after we  statistically controlled simultaneously for the effects of applicants\u2019  nationality; the time period in which their case was decided; and whether  they had representation, claimed dependents, filed within 1 year of entry,  and, among defensive cases, if they were ever detained. For example, in  the New York immigration court, the likelihood of an affirmative applicant  being granted asylum was 420 times greater if the applicant\u2019s case were  handled by the immigration judge who had the highest likelihood of  granting asylum than if the applicant\u2019s case were handled by the  immigration judge who had the lowest likelihood in that immigration  court. If we consider the two immigration judges at the highest and lowest  ends of the granting spectrum to be outliers, and instead compare  immigration judges who were second highest and second lowest, the  disparity was still great. The likelihood of being granted asylum in New  York was 122 times greater for applicants whose cases were decided by  the immigration judge with the second highest versus the second lowest  likelihood of granting asylum. Even when we compared the third highest  and third lowest asylum granting immigration judges in New York,  applicants were still 35 times more likely to be granted asylum by the  former than the latter. For defensive cases in New York, the likelihood of  being granted asylum was 93 times greater for applicants whose cases  were decided by the immigration judge with the highest versus the lowest  likelihood of granting asylum in the immigration court.

Our analysis used more comprehensive statistical procedures, examined a  longer period of time, and had data on more potential explanatory factors  than the analyses reported in EOIR\u2019s grant rate studies. Because data were  not available on the facts, evidence, and testimony presented in each  asylum case, nor on immigration judges\u2019 rationale for deciding whether to  grant or deny a case, we could not measure the effect of case merits on  case outcomes. However, the size of the disparities in asylum grant rates  creates a perception of unfairness in the asylum adjudication process  within the immigration court system.", "We commend EOIR for taking actions to collect information on the  variation of asylum outcomes across immigration judges and to attempt to  integrate that information into its oversight of immigration judges.  However, we believe that EOIR\u2019s grant rate studies have weaknesses that  limit their ability to identify immigration judges who have unusually high  or low rates in the granting of asylum. Although EOIR has attempted to  take into account a few of the factors that may be associated with  variation in asylum grant rates among immigration judges, we believe that  the statistical methods we applied to EOIR\u2019s data provide a more  complete, accurate, and useful picture of asylum rulings for the  immigration judges included in our analysis. Without statistically  controlling for factors that could affect asylum decisions, including  variations in the types of cases immigration judges adjudicate, some of the  immigration judges who EOIR\u2019s grant rate studies determined to be  unusually high granters and deniers of asylum may actually be less  extreme than they appear, while others who do not appear to be outliers  may actually be more extreme after statistical adjustment. Consequently,  some immigration judges identified as needing supervisory assistance and  attention when EOIR uses its grant rate results in combination with other  performance indicators may sometimes not be the same individuals who  are identified once certain factors associated with asylum decisions are  taken into account. We recognize that decisions about whether and which  immigration judges\u2019 skills need improvement should not depend entirely  on statistical disparities in asylum decisions, as there are other indicators  (including high remand and reversal rates) that should be taken into  account in making such decisions. Nevertheless, we believe that the  information we produced, in conjunction with other indicators of  immigration judge performance that EOIR is collecting and considers to  be important, would put EOIR in a better position to identify immigration  judges who would benefit from supervisory attention and assistance.", "While the information we produced through our analyses can be useful to  EOIR for a limited amount of time, it represents an analysis of immigration  judges\u2019 decisions during a 12 \u00bd year period ending in April 2007. As time  goes on, there will be turnover in immigration judges, changes in country  conditions that will prompt changes in the composition of applicants  seeking asylum in this country, and possibly other unanticipated changes  that could affect variability in asylum outcomes. Periodic updates using  the types of multivariate analyses that we did would provide EOIR with a  more complete, accurate, and useful picture of immigration judge decision  making over time than the current approach. These analyses would also  facilitate EOIR\u2019s goal of using data on grants and denials, in combination  with other information about immigration judges, to identify those whose  skills may need to be improved through training or other means. We  recognize that EOIR currently does not have the expertise or the budget to  perform sophisticated statistical analyses and that acquiring the expertise  would involve some cost. We believe that such an effort should be  considered, however, because ensuring both the reality and perception of  fairness in the asylum system is a worthwhile goal.", "With regard to supervision, EOIR has made efforts to improve oversight  and management of the immigration courts by redeploying some ACIJs  from headquarters to field locations.

An  alternative approach to assessing the variability in granting asylum across  immigration courts is to use logistic regression models, which allow us to  estimate the differences across immigration courts in a multivariate  context, or while controlling statistically (and simultaneously) for the  effects of these other factors. In tables 13 and 14, we show the results of  fitting logistic regression models to the data for affirmative and defensive  cases respectively, in both cases after excluding those cases that were in  absentia.", "Before describing the results of the multivariate regression models, we  first note one fundamental difference between them and our foregoing  results, which is that in logistic regression models we use odds and odds  ratios, rather than percentages and percentage differences, to compare  countries (or differences by period, between cases represented, and so  on). The odds themselves are fairly straightforward and can, when we are  looking at the effect of one factor at a time on the likelihood of cases being  granted asylum, be calculated directly from the percentages granted. To  estimate the differences across immigration courts, for example, we can  calculate the odds on cases\u2019 being granted in each immigration court,  which is simply the percentage granted divided by the percentage not  granted. In the case of the Atlanta immigration court, the odds on being  granted would be 6.1/93.9 = 0.07 (see table 13). This odds has a  straightforward interpretation, and indicates that 0.07 cases were granted  for every 1 case that was not, or that 7 cases were granted for every 100  that were not. The odds on being granted can be similarly calculated and  interpreted for the other immigration courts, and at the bottom of Tables  13 and 14, we also show the odds on cases\u2019 being granted across  categories of the other factors as well (i.e., period, representation, etc.).", "To compare immigration courts or different categories of the other  variables, we choose one immigration court or one category of the other  variables as a referent category, and calculate odds ratios that indicate  how different the odds are for other immigration courts or other  categories versus that one. In assessing immigration courts, we arbitrarily  chose Denver as the referent category. As shown in columns 4 and 5 in  table 13, by dividing, for example, the odds on being granted asylum in  Atlanta (0.07) and the same odds in Baltimore (0.90) by the odds in Denver  (0.51), we find that the odds on granting asylum (in affirmative cases) are  lower in Atlanta than in Denver, by a factor of 0.13, but higher in Baltimore  than in Denver, by a factor of 1.79. Without adjusting for the effects of  immigration court, nationality, time period, representation, dependents,  timeliness of application, and detention status, this means that for  affirmative cases, the odds on asylum being granted in Baltimore were  about 14 times greater than in Atlanta (1.79 unadjusted odds ratio in  Baltimore divided by .13 unadjusted odds ratio in Atlanta, which are  shown in column 5 in table 13).", "The full set of \u201cunadjusted\u201d odds ratios comparing all immigration courts  with Denver are given in column 5 of table 13 for affirmative cases, and  column 5 of table 13 for defensive cases. These unadjusted odds ratios  indicate the differences in the odds on being granted asylum across the  various categories of the different factors, when factors are considered  one at a time. Tables 13 and 14 also show unadjusted odds ratios  comparing differences across countries, periods, representation  categories, dependents categories, entry-to-application categories and, in  table 16, categories that indicate whether the applicants for asylum in  defensive cases had ever been detained.", "When considering one factor at a time, these unadjusted odds ratios can  be directly calculated from the percentages granted and denied across the  categories of each factor. However, when we want to consider the effects  of the different factors simultaneously\u2014that is, to estimate differences  across immigration courts after taking account of which countries the  asylum seekers came from, when their case was heard, whether they were  represented, etc., we use multivariate logistic regression models which  involve an iterative statistical estimation procedure to obtain a net effect  estimate for each factor. These are referred to as \u201cadjusted odds ratios,\u201d  shown in column 6 of tables 13 and 14.", "The adjusted odds ratios tell us that even after adjusting for the sizable  differences in the odds on asylum\u2019s being granted across countries, across  the different periods, and across categories of representation, dependents,  entry-to-application time, and whether ever detained (for defensive cases  only), there remain sizable differences across immigration courts. That is,  even after we take account of the effects of all these other factors and  how, for example, immigration courts differ in terms of the asylum  seekers\u2019 nationalities and when asylum seekers\u2019 cases were heard, we find  sizable differences across immigration courts in the odds on granting  asylum. After controlling for all of these factors, the net effect was that in  comparison with Denver, the likelihood of affirmative cases\u2019 being granted  asylum was 2.15 times greater in San Francisco, half as likely in  Bloomington, and less than one-fifth as likely in Atlanta. This implies that,  for affirmative cases, the odds on asylum\u2019s being granted were about 4  times greater in San Francisco than in Bloomington (2.15 adjusted odds  ratio in San Francisco divided by .5 adjusted odds ratio in Bloomington,  which are shown in column 6 of table 13), and almost 13 times greater in  San Francisco than in Atlanta (2.15 odds ratio in San Francisco divided by  .17 odds ratio in Atlanta), even after the other differences in claimant  characteristics, including where they came from, were controlled. Other  large differences are implied by these adjusted odds ratios, for both  affirmative and defensive cases. The adjusted odds comparing each  immigration court with every other immigration court are shown in table  15 (for affirmative cases) and table 16 (for defensive cases).", "While controlling for these other factors sometimes alters the relative  likelihoods in granting asylum across the different immigration courts, it  does not diminish the overall finding that there are substantial differences  across immigration courts. Figures 11 and 12 show the odds ratios (with  their 95 percent confidence intervals) that indicate how much different the  odds on granting asylum were across immigration courts before and after  adjusting for the other factors, for affirmative and defensive cases  respectively. Figure 11 shows that for affirmative decisions, even after  adjustments, three immigration courts (Orlando, San Francisco, and New  York) had significantly higher odds than the referent immigration court  (Denver), by factors ranging from roughly 1.6 to 2.2. Four other  immigration courts (Atlanta, Detroit, Bloomington, and San Diego) had  significantly lower odds of granting asylum than the Denver immigration  court, by factors ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. This implies that all of the former  three immigration courts had significantly higher odds of granting asylum  than the latter four immigration courts, by factors ranging from roughly 3  to 13. Figure 12 shows fairly similar disparities across immigration courts  for defensive decisions, with the Orlando, San Francisco, and New York  courts again being significantly more likely and the Atlanta, Detroit, and  Bloomington (but not San Diego) courts being significantly less likely than  other courts to grant asylum."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Differences in Asylum Grant Rates across Immigration Judges", "paragraphs": ["In this appendix, we present information on how asylum decisions differed  across immigration judges. First, we look at all immigration judges across  the 19 immigration courts in our study who heard 50 or more affirmative  or defensive cases in their primary immigration court. Then, we look at  how decisions were affected by characteristics of the different  immigration judges. And finally we look at selected immigration courts by  country combinations to see how sizable differences were when different  immigration judges heard cases involving applicants for the same country  in the same immigration court. In the immigration court by country  analyses, we limited the analysis to immigration judges who saw 20 or  more affirmative and defensive cases.

We  selected these country- immigration court combinations because they had  a sufficiently large number of immigration judges rendering a sufficiently  large number of decisions to produce reliable estimates in our logistic  regression analyses. We examined differences across immigration judges  within the same immigration court in judges\u2019 likelihood of granting asylum  to applicants of the same nationality. Because the number of immigration  judges in these analyses ranged from only 25 to 47, we looked at the effect  of immigration judge characteristics one at a time, while controlling for  the full set of claimant characteristics. The results of these analyses are  summarized in table 21, below. Immigration judges used in the analysis  had seen at least 20 cases during this time period, and we excluded  immigration judges who had all grants or all denials.", "Many and often most of the immigration judges in the same immigration  court differed significantly in their likelihood of granting asylum to  applicants from the same nationality when compared to the immigration  judge who represented the average likelihood of granting asylum in that  immigration court (the \u201caverage immigration judge\u201d). This was the case  both before and after we statistically controlled for the effects of five  claimant characteristics (represented, claimed one or more dependents on  application, filed for asylum within 1 year of entry to the United States,  time period in which application was filed, ever detained). When the  effects of these 5 factors were accounted for, it was still the case that  relative to the grant rate of the \u201caverage immigration judge\u201d who ruled on  similar cases in each immigration court, the grant rates of many  immigration judges in the same immigration court were significantly  different (either in the direction of having grant rates that were  significantly higher or lower than that of the average immigration judge).  Specifically,  the decisions of 77 percent of immigration judges in New York differed  significantly from that of the average immigration judge for affirmative  applicants from China,  the decisions of 55 percent of immigration judges in Los Angeles  differed significantly from that of the average immigration judge for  affirmative applicants from China.  the decisions of 70 percent of immigration judges in Miami differed  significantly from that of the average immigration judge for affirmative  applicants from Haiti,  the decisions of 79 percent of immigration judges in San Francisco  differed significantly from that of the average immigration judge for  affirmative applicants from India,  the decisions of 41 percent of immigration judges in New York differed  significantly from that of the average immigration judge for defensive  applicants from China, and  the decisions of 39 percent of immigration judges in Miami differed  significantly from that of the average immigration judge for defensive  applicants from Haiti.", "We found that certain claimant and immigration judge characteristics did  not have significant effects on asylum outcomes for the nationalities  examined within the same immigration court, while others did.  Specifically, after simultaneously controlling for the effects of the other  factors, we found that for the six specific immigration court/nationality  combinations in our analysis, asylum outcomes were generally not  significantly affected by    whether or not an immigration judge had previous experience doing  immigration work for a nonprofit organization;    whether or not an immigration judge had previous immigration  the immigration judge\u2019s gender (except for Haitians in Miami, where  both affirmative and defensive applicants were 30 percent as likely to  be granted asylum if the immigration judge was male rather than  female);    The immigration judge\u2019s race/ethnicity (except for Chinese in Los  Angeles and Haitians in Miami, where affirmative applicants were more  than twice as likely to be granted asylum if the immigration judge was  white, nonHispanic rather than other race/ethnicity);  the immigration judge\u2019s veteran status (except for Haitians in Miami,  where defensive applicants were 40 percent as likely to be granted  asylum if the immigration judge was a veteran);    whether the immigration judge was appointed during a Democratic or  Republican presidential administration (except for Chinese in New  York, where affirmative applicants were more than twice as likely to be  granted asylum, and defensive applicants were almost 3 times as likely  to be granted asylum by immigration judges who were appointed  during a Republican presidential administration); or  the age of the immigration judge (except for Haitians in Miami where  affirmative applicants were nearly twice as likely to be granted asylum  by older rather than younger immigration judges).", "In contrast, certain characteristics did have significant effects on asylum  outcomes, and we found the size of these effects in the six immigration  court/nationality combinations to be similar to those found across all  immigration judges and all immigration courts. Specifically, asylum grants  were generally significantly higher when the following circumstances were  present:    Applicants were represented. This was the case in five of the six  immigration court/nationality combinations we examined. For  example, representation was associated with a six-fold increase in  asylum grants for affirmative applicants from India who filed their  cases in San Francisco and a two-fold increase in asylum grants for  affirmative applicants from China who filed their cases in Los Angeles,  as well as defensive applicants from Haiti who filed their case in Miami.

Of  the six, only defensive Haitian applicants in Miami failed to obtain  significantly more grants of asylum when claiming one or more  dependents on the asylum application.", "Results for other characteristics were mixed.
