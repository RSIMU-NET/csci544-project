To help reduce the risk of improper receipt or use of SNAP benefits, states use data analytics, including data matching and data mining, to identify patterns or trends indicative of potential fraud in SNAP purchases. Based on concerns about potential SNAP benefit trafficking across state lines, GAO was asked to review out-of-state transactions and states' efforts to combat such fraud.", "This report examines (1) the extent to which SNAP households in selected states made out-of-state purchases that may indicate potential fraud, (2) the advantages and challenges selected states have experienced in using data analytics to identify potential fraud, and (3) how FNS has assisted states in implementing leading practices for data analytics. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2017 data on SNAP purchases for North Dakota, Washington, and the District of Columbia, which had large percentages of non-border out-of-state purchases and interviewed FNS officials and officials in these states as well as in Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Wisconsin about their use of data analytics compared with leading practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients are allowed to spend their benefits outside their state of residence, and GAO's analysis of fiscal year 2017 SNAP data in three selected states found that overall about 2 percent of households made purchases, both in state and out-of-state, potentially indicative of trafficking\u2014the prohibited exchange of benefits for cash or nonfood goods or services. Also, GAO found little difference in potential trafficking behaviors between households that made one or more purchases out-of-state and those that shopped only in their home state.", "Officials in all seven states GAO reviewed said they conducted data matching. Officials in five of these states stated that they use more sophisticated data analytics including data mining to help identify potential fraud (see figure). These officials cited advantages to using more sophisticated analytics to automate fraud detection and prioritize cases, allowing them to focus investigative resources on cases most likely to involve fraud. For example, officials in Mississippi reported that overpayment collections increased $2 million since the state incorporated more data techniques into its fraud detection efforts. However, officials in all seven selected states cited factors such as high cost, resource demands, data limitations and organizational support as challenges that affect their ability to use or maintain more advanced data-analytics techniques.", "The U. S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has helped some states adopt certain leading practices for data analytics, but its current outreach is limited. FNS has provided assistance to some states through pilot projects, grants, and training, but, beyond a recently issued guide, FNS has done little to disseminate information more broadly about successful efforts to adopt data analytics. FNS officials said they are in the early stages of promoting data analytics for SNAP fraud prevention and detection, and their efforts have focused on assessing the current capability of states to use data analytics and determining analytic practices that are effective. State officials GAO interviewed said that training provided was helpful but expressed concern about their access to information on successful data analytic approaches.

In  recent years, the size and costs of the program have raised questions  about the extent of the controls in place to combat fraud. Program officials  have long-standing concerns that some recipients falsify information  about their household circumstances to improperly receive benefits or  misuse their benefits to solicit or obtain non-food goods, services, and  cash\u2014a practice known as trafficking. For example, according to a press  release from the Department of Justice, in 2018, an individual operating  as a retailer in Maryland was convicted in federal district court for food  stamp and wire fraud relating to the exchange of benefits for cash. The  retailer redeemed over $1.5 million in SNAP benefits for transactions in  which he paid recipients approximately half the value of the benefits in  cash and kept the rest of the proceeds.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service  (FNS), in partnership with the states, administers SNAP.

Out-of-state purchases occur for varied reasons, such as  temporary travel or employment in another state. Those who live near  state borders may spend their benefits in the neighboring state if retailers  are more conveniently located or food prices are lower. However, long- term out-of-state purchases, particularly in states that do not border the  state where the recipient is enrolled in SNAP, may raise questions about  a recipient\u2019s actual residence and how the benefits are being used.", "You asked us to examine the out-of-state use of SNAP benefits. In this  report, we answer the following questions:  1.  To what extent are SNAP households in selected states making out- of-state purchases that may indicate potential recipient fraud?  2.  How are selected states using data analytics\u2014including analyses of  out-of-state transactions\u2014to identify potential SNAP recipient fraud,  and what advantages and challenges, if any, have they experienced?  3.  How has FNS assisted states in implementing leading practices for  data analytics?", "For all three objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations,  program guidance, and reports. For objective 1, we analyzed all out-of- state SNAP transactions for fiscal year 2017 using data provided by FNS.  We selected the District of Columbia and two states\u2014North Dakota and  Washington\u2014with large amounts of non-border out-of-state transactions  (compared to all SNAP benefits issued in the state) for further review.  For these states, we reviewed fiscal year 2017 transaction data for  households that spent all their benefits in a non-border state in that year.  We also analyzed all transaction data for households in these states for  indicators of potential trafficking.", "For objective 2, we selected these three states as well as Massachusetts,  Mississippi, New Mexico, and Wisconsin for our review. We selected  these seven states to reflect a range of individual state experiences  based on the percentage of non-border state transactions, receipt of  related technical assistance, and FNS\u2019s reports on their capacity to  conduct data analysis. We interviewed knowledgeable officials from the  seven state SNAP agencies about their efforts to use data analytics to  detect potential recipient fraud and the advantages and challenges states  face in doing so. We obtained related documentation when possible.  While information from these seven state SNAP agencies is non- generalizable, it provides illustrative examples of state agencies\u2019 efforts to  use data analytics.", "For objective 3, we obtained documentation of FNS\u2019s efforts to assist  states in implementing data analytics and interviewed FNS officials in  headquarters and all seven regional offices as well as officials from the  seven states and others representing state associations. We compared  these efforts to leading practices for data analytics described in GAO\u2019s  Fraud Risk Framework. We focused primarily on FNS\u2019s efforts to assist  states beginning in fiscal year 2015, which follows our 2014 report on  SNAP recipient fraud.

The overarching rules governing SNAP are set at the federal level.  Accordingly, FNS is responsible for promulgating program regulations  and ensuring that state officials administer the program in compliance  with program rules. FNS officials in seven regional offices assist  headquarters officials in this oversight work. FNS also determines which  retailers are eligible to accept SNAP benefits for food purchases and  investigates and resolves cases of retailer fraud. The states, or in some  cases counties, administer the program by determining whether  households meet the program\u2019s eligibility requirements, calculating  monthly benefits for qualified households, and issuing benefits to  participants on an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card. States are also  responsible for investigating possible violations by benefit recipients and  pursuing and acting on those violations that are deemed intentional."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of SNAP Fraud and State Anti-Fraud Mitigation Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Intentional program violations include acts of fraud, which involve  obtaining something of value through willful misrepresentation. Eligibility  fraud involves individuals making false or misleading statements in order  to obtain benefits, including statements about household composition,  household expenses, and income. Failing to report changes to household  circumstances that may affect benefits can also result in eligibility fraud  under certain circumstances. When recipients are certified for SNAP,  state agencies assign them to a reporting system for notifying the state of  certain changes.  These changes include when they have a change of  address, both in-state or out-of-state. Some systems require recipients to  report within a certain period of time of the change occurring, often within  10 days.  Other reporting systems\u2013 including simplified reporting \u2013 require  recipients to submit reports periodically.  Households subject to reporting  on a periodic basis must generally submit reports not less often than once  every 6 months.   One type of eligibility fraud is dual participation, in  which a recipient receives benefits in more than one state in the same  month.", "Another type of SNAP fraud is trafficking, in which benefits are  exchanged for cash or non-food goods and services. Trafficking may  occur when recipients collaborate with retailers who pay cash for SNAP  benefits. For example, a retailer might allow a recipient to charge $100 on  his or her EBT card and then pay the recipient $50 instead of providing  food. Trafficking also occurs when a recipient exchanges an EBT card  and the corresponding Personal Identification Number (PIN) for cash or  non-food goods or services (e.g., rent or transportation) from another  individual.", "According to a September 2012 USDA Office of Inspector General (OIG)  report, the magnitude of program abuse due to recipient fraud is unknown  because states do not have uniform ways of compiling such data. OIG  recommended that FNS determine the feasibility of creating a uniform  methodology for states to calculate their recipient fraud rate. In 2014,  FNS responded that it would be infeasible to implement the  recommendation as it would require legislative authority mandating  significant state investment of time and resources in investigating,  prosecuting, and reporting fraud beyond current requirements.", "States must adhere to various federal requirements for detecting SNAP  recipient fraud, conducting investigations, and providing due process prior  to disqualifying recipients from participating in the program.

Data matching  is the large scale comparison of records and files to detect errors or  incorrect information. It can be used to verify information provided by  recipients or detect unreported changes. Data mining is the use of  automated computer algorithms to detect otherwise hidden patterns,  correlations, or anomalies within large data sets indicative of potential  fraud, thus assisting programs in recovering these dollars (see fig. 2).", "Federal laws and regulations require states to conduct certain data  matches when an application for benefits is submitted and other times to  verify an individual\u2019s reported employment and immigration status, as well  as to ensure the information provided is not for an individual who is  incarcerated, deceased, or disqualified from the program (see table 1).", "GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework identifies the following leading practices to  help managers effectively use data to mitigate the likelihood and impact  of fraud (see table 2).", "While these leading practices can help managers design and implement  effective data-analytic tools and techniques to prevent and detect  potential fraud, as discussed in the Fraud Risk Framework, these  techniques alone may not be sufficient to ensure that ineligible individuals  do not fraudulently enroll in a program or receive benefits.

For example, District of Columbia recipients  spent about half of their SNAP benefits out of state in fiscal year 2017. All  District of Columbia residents are in close proximity to both Maryland and  Virginia, which are no more than approximately 7 miles from any point in  the District. In general, about a third (34 percent) of households  nationwide with out-of-state purchases spent $50 or less on those  purchases in fiscal year 2017. See Appendix II for a detailed listing of out- of-state purchases by state. Out-of-state purchases may also indicate  potential program violations, including eligibility fraud or trafficking.

The total value of SNAP transactions by  households in our three selected states that made all purchases in non- border states in fiscal year 2017 was approximately $1.9 million. These  purchases represent about 0.1 percent of all SNAP benefits for fiscal year  2017 in the three selected states.", "When SNAP benefits are used in a non-border state over an extended  period of time, this could indicate possible intentional program violations  such as an unreported move and other household changes that could  impact eligibility. SNAP officials we interviewed said that in some cases a  recipient may delay reporting a move if they are enrolled in SNAP in a  state with a lower barrier to entry to the program. At the same time, the  rules around reporting a move and residency may make it difficult to  determine when a recipient has violated program rules. Recipients are not  required to immediately report a move in some cases due to simplified  reporting rules that allow a recipient to report household changes only  periodically, generally every 6 months. Also, officials we interviewed in  the three selected states told us that there are no set time limits for a  SNAP recipient to reside in a new state before the former state revokes  the recipient\u2019s residency. For example, a recipient may be out of state for  an extended period of time for personal reasons, such as helping a  relative, but still intend to reside in the state where they are enrolled in  SNAP. In that case, according to state officials, the recipient would not  necessarily need to report a move and may not be violating program  rules.", "In addition to the program violations related to an unreported move, use  of SNAP benefits in a non-border state over extended periods of time  could bring into question whether a recipient is also enrolled in SNAP in  another state (i.e., dual participation). Also, it may indicate changes in the  household that could impact eligibility, including questions about whether  a recipient is earning unreported income in the state where they are using  their benefits. While state SNAP agencies stated that they conduct data  matching meant to detect dual participation and unreported income,  states also noted challenges with these matches. State agencies told us  that they use the PARIS system to detect possible dual participation, and  both NDNH and the Work Number to identify recipient income.  However, challenges officials cited in using these systems included lags  in the data provided, and additional work required to confirm data. The  use of data analytics to review recipient transaction data may help states  identify suspicious household activity more easily than with data matching  alone given the challenges associated with these systems. In addition,  data analytics may be another tool to help states identify suspicious  activities in a timely manner.

Overall, we found that approximately 2 percent of all  households in the three selected states, including both households that  shopped out-of-state and those that shopped in state only, had a high  number of purchases potentially indicative of SNAP trafficking. However,  for two selected states, there was little to no difference in the percentage  of households with this activity when we compared households that only  shopped in their home state and households that shopped out-of-state.  For one state, a greater percentage of households that shopped out-of- state had purchases indicative of SNAP trafficking, but households in this  state also had different shopping patterns in general, as discussed below.  In addition, for households that shopped out-of-state, few of the  transactions we flagged as indicators of potential trafficking occurred  outside the home state. Although we found that rates of trafficking  indicators were generally similar between households that shopped out- of-state and those that only shopped in their state of residence, the  analysis of transaction data for other factors may allow states to identify  households at risk of trafficking and make them a higher priority for  investigation. Our prior work reported on the benefits of SNAP transaction  data analysis for this purpose.", "Specifically, we found that for North Dakota and Washington, households  that made one or more purchases out of state had similar rates of  purchases flagged for potential trafficking compared to households that  shopped only in their home state. This held true both for households that  only shopped in border states, as well as for households that shopped in  non-border states (see table 4). For example, 1.4 percent of Washington  SNAP households that only shopped in their home state had purchases  resulting in 20 or more trafficking flags in fiscal year 2017, and 1.8  percent of Washington households that also shopped in border states had  20 or more trafficking flags. For Washington households that also  shopped in non-border states, 1.5 percent made purchases resulting in  20 or more flags.", "Our analysis of District of Columbia households identified higher rates of  potential trafficking indicators for households that shopped out-of-state,  compared to the other two selected states.

For District of Columbia households that  also shopped in non-border states, 8 percent made purchases resulting in  20 or more flags. However, the difference in rates for District of Columbia  trafficking indicators may reflect the different shopping patterns of its  households when compared to other states. As stated previously, District  of Columbia households made about half of their SNAP purchases out-of- state, which is a significantly higher amount compared to any other state.  And all District of Columbia households are in close proximity to the  bordering states of Maryland and Virginia, approximately 7 miles or less.  Also, a small percentage of District of Columbia households shopped only  in their home state in fiscal year 2017\u2014approximately 7 percent of all  households reviewed.

Federal law and regulations require  states to conduct certain data matches when determining SNAP eligibility,  including matches that provide information on people who may be  incarcerated, deceased, or disqualified from receiving SNAP benefits due  to intentional program violations. The five databases that state SNAP  agencies are required to conduct matches against when determining  SNAP eligibility are the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  (HHS) National Directory of New Hires, the Social Security  Administration\u2019s (SSA) Prisoner Verification System, SSA\u2019s Death Master  File, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 Systematic Alien  Verification for Entitlements and FNS\u2019s Electronic Disqualified Recipient  System (eDRS). As we previously reported, state SNAP agencies use  data matching to obtain information about households\u2019 income, verify  information provided by households, or identify potential discrepancies.  Specifically, agencies are required to verify household data electronically  by matching their data with specific government sources and have the  option to match against additional data sources.", "In addition to the required data matching, officials we interviewed in all  seven selected states also reported conducting other data matching with  a range of internal and external data sources. These matches used  information from federal, state, and commercial data sources on earned  income from employment or self-employment or unearned income from  other government benefit programs. According to state officials, these  sources included Unemployment Insurance information from state  workforce agencies, the PARIS file from HHS, and The Work Number, a  commercial verification service. Other sources that could be used include  Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance income information and  Supplemental Security Income information from multiple data matches  with the SSA. In addition to verifying applicants\u2019 initial eligibility, data  matching can identify changes in key information that could affect  continued eligibility.", "Beyond data matching, officials in all seven selected states said that they  had access to EBT reports notifying them of suspicious transactions,  although the type and frequency of use of these reports varied. For  example, while some state officials said that they manually generated  reports on an ad hoc basis, other state officials said that they had  automated reports that they received and reviewed on a weekly or  monthly basis. As we previously reported, automating data analytics tests  can allow agencies to monitor large amounts of data more efficiently than  with manual tests. Furthermore, officials in all seven selected states  reported that they had examined out-of-state transactions to some extent.  Some states had access to out-of-state reports as part of their suite of  EBT reports but did not review them often, while other states  automatically received alerts if households consistently used benefits out  of state over a certain extended period of time, such as 70 or 90 days.  For example, officials from Massachusetts told us that they flag certain  transactions to help ensure recipients comply with the state\u2019s residency  requirements for eligibility. Specifically, after a client spends their benefits  out of state for 70 days or more, the state agency will send a letter asking  the client to prove they are still a Massachusetts resident.

For example, officials in the District of Columbia  reported using location mapping to identify households that spent their  benefits long distances from home. Officials we interviewed in Wisconsin  reported developing an automated check intended to flag particular types  of case characteristics indicative of potential fraud. According to the  Wisconsin officials, if a particular case is flagged, a caseworker must  follow up and provide extra scrutiny before the case can move forward in  the eligibility process.

Four states reported that  data analytics helped them prioritize and enhance fraud  investigations. For example, officials in Washington said that they had  a system in place that used an algorithm to rank each fraud referral  based on a number of factors and moved higher-risk referrals to the  top of the list of investigations. Officials in Wisconsin said that they  combined eligibility, transaction, and retailer data and analyzed it to  produce a prioritized list of individuals who appeared most likely to  have trafficked at a specific retailer, allowing them to focus their  investigative resources on cases most likely to be fraud.", "Preventing fraud. Finally, two states reported that data analytics had  the advantage of improving the return on investment of anti-fraud  activities through the prevention of fraud before it occurs. For  example, officials in Wisconsin estimated that data analytics has  helped them prevent a large proportion of fraud before it occurs,  thereby improving the cost-benefit of their anti-fraud practices.  Officials in Mississippi noted that data analytics can be an effective  deterrent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Reported Organizational and Resource Challenges in Effectively Using Data Analytics", "paragraphs": ["Officials we interviewed in all seven selected states reported a range of  organizational and resource challenges that either prevented them from  using more advanced data analytics techniques or made their current  data analytics practices difficult to implement.", "Quantifying benefits of data analytics. Officials we interviewed in  two states said it was challenging to quantify the benefits of data  analytics, therefore resulting in a lack of sound evidence for  supporting the utility of this type of work. For example, officials in  Washington reported that it was difficult to conduct a cost-benefit  analysis of data analytics because of the challenge of quantifying how  often fraud is prevented before it occurs. Officials in Wisconsin  reported that it attempted to measure future savings from fraud  prevention but that there is no guidance for how to determine these  savings.", "Obtaining organizational support. Officials in two states reported  that it was challenging to obtain sufficient organizational support for  conducting data analytics. For example, officials in North Dakota  reported that they could not say how much support exists in the state  government to pursue additional resources for data analytics. Those  in the District of Columbia noted that it is sometimes difficult to  convince certain employees of the need for data analytics to detect  fraud.", "Appearing to criminalize legitimate use. Officials in three states  said that a challenge to using more advanced data analytics was that  it could appear to profile recipients or make it appear to the general  public and to policy-makers that certain legitimate uses of SNAP  benefits, such as using benefits out-of-state, were not allowed. For  example, Washington tracked the number of replacement EBT cards  as a possible indicator of fraud, but officials said that there were many  cases in which the client had legitimate reasons for needing a high  number of replacement cards, such as mental health issues or  homelessness. Washington officials further noted the challenge of  using demographic data in a predictive model, reporting that it puts  them at risk of profiling even though it can be helpful. For example,  when they examined recipients with high balances on their EBT cards,  demographic information provided an explanation. In particular,  elderly individuals were being frugal with their benefits.", "Dealing with changing patterns of fraud. Officials we interviewed in  three states said that a challenge to using data analytics was dealing  with changing patterns of fraud. They said that the characteristics of  transactions that may indicate potential fraud are constantly changing  as fraudulent actors change their tactics in response to state  enforcement. For example, officials in Mississippi said that recipients  committing fraud might change from high-dollar to low-dollar  transactions, in which case the state would need to adjust its  monitoring accordingly.", "Obtaining necessary data. Officials we interviewed also reported  challenges with obtaining data needed to conduct data analytics.  Officials in three states said that simplified reporting presents a  challenge to using data analytics to detect potential recipient fraud.  Specifically, simplified reporting made it challenging to use certain  information as potentially indicative of fraud because recipients are  not required to report certain changes\u2014for example, a move out of  state\u2014until it is time for them to recertify for benefits. In addition,  officials in three states reported a challenge in verifying necessary  data in order for them to be considered reliable for use. For example,  Massachusetts reported that one of the biggest challenges of  developing investigative leads through data analytics is that not all  data are considered equally reliable. For SNAP, FNS guidance  defines some data matches as \u201cverified upon receipt\u201d if the match is  with a primary or original source of the data (such as information on a  government benefit provided by the administering agency, such as  SSA). Eligibility workers can use this information without taking  additional steps to verify that the data are accurate, according to FNS  guidance. In contrast, data from a secondary source, defined in the  guidance as not being verified upon receipt, require additional  verification before the state agency can take action on an eligibility  determination.", "High costs and resource demands. Officials in six selected states  cited the high costs and resource demands of using advanced data  analytics techniques. For example, officials we interviewed in North  Dakota, which conducted only data matching, said that they lacked  the funding and staff resources to use more advanced techniques.  Officials we interviewed in New Mexico noted that they lacked the  staff resources to use data analytics. Officials from North Dakota said  that they had the option to procure a data analytics tool, but said that  the costs were prohibitively high. Officials in Wisconsin, which was  employing more data analytics, said that they were not able to  purchase access to a third-party data source using SNAP funding  alone, and that they had to seek funding from another federal program  in order to afford these efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FNS Supported Certain States in Adopting Leading Practices for Data Analytics, but Assistance and Information Sharing Has Been Limited", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FNS Helped Some States Adopt Certain Leading Practices for Data Analytics", "paragraphs": ["FNS provided individualized assistance and training to several states  across the country to build their capacity for data analytics on SNAP,  consistent with several of GAO\u2019s leading practices.

For example, officials from Utah, who  participated in the pilot, said that FNS provided training to them on mining  social media data. The officials added that the timing of the training was excellent because the state was beginning to build its capability for data  analytics on its own.

According to FNS,  each grantee state planned to use the funds to link its system with FNS\u2019s  database through the web rather than using a \u201cbatch\u201d processing system,  which will allow them to match data on applicants at the time of  application or recertification rather than at specific intervals after eligibility  is determined. Florida officials mentioned in the related grant proposal  that using the state\u2019s current batch processing system meant that other  states did not have real-time access to information about the state\u2019s  disqualified recipients, thereby potentially increasing the chance of an  ineligible individual receiving benefits.", "In addition, FNS  administered a grant on behalf of OMB, which funded a  pilot program for five southeastern states to develop the National  Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC), a data sharing system that allows  participating states to identify applicants who are receiving benefits in the  partnering states in near-real time. According to one state official, a  primary benefit of the NAC is that it enables each participating state to  match data on individual beneficiaries across five states without having to  connect to five different states\u2019 computer systems. One member of the  NAC consortium from Florida said that the ability to match in near-real  time is helpful because the data available in the PARIS system is older  and would only identify individuals potentially receiving benefits in multiple  states months after they have occurred, rather than at the time of  application.

One of the  techniques involved mining recipient transaction data for households that  had shopped at disqualified retailers to develop a prioritized list of  retailers and recipients to investigate. According to state officials we  interviewed in Wisconsin, the technique automated a time and labor  intensive process that state analysts had previously performed manually.  The pilot project also used other data mining techniques to develop  profiles of recipients who commit fraud. For instance, in Utah, the data  analysis showed that they are more likely to have multiple replacement  EBT cards and make more purchases from small stores than other  recipients. At the end of the pilot, FNS sponsored a training course that  included detailed instruction on data mining.", "Although past efforts by FNS have been limited to some states and  encouraged some leading practices, more recently, in May 2018, FNS  released a SNAP Fraud Framework that provides more comprehensive  guidance to help states adopt all of GAO\u2019s 10 leading practices for data  analytics. Specifically, FNS\u2019s SNAP Fraud Framework provides a  collection of examples, promising practices, and procedures to help state  agencies with the prevention and detection of SNAP fraud that  encompass all 10 data analytics leading practices from GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework. (For a comparison of the practices in the two frameworks,  see appendix III.) According to FNS officials, the SNAP Fraud Framework  is meant to take a holistic, integrated approach to fraud, including data  analytics, but they recognize that states differ in their readiness to adopt  analytics. The framework\u2019s data analytics section provides a range of  approaches, examples, case studies, and methods that allow all states to  begin embedding analytics into their processes. FNS officials reported  that they began conducting outreach to state officials about the  framework in the summer of 2018. FNS officials said that they are also  considering using grant funds to assist states with the implementation of  components of the framework. Furthermore, FNS officials said that some  of the potential technical assistance may include showing states how to  develop their own analytic tools.", "FNS has also developed a maturity assessment to evaluate each state\u2019s  capacity to implement the various components of the fraud framework. It  includes a state\u2019s use of data analytics for fraud detection and  investigations, and its learning and development opportunities for  stakeholders who use the results of data analytics, such as investigators,  hearing officials, and court officials.

Specifically, much of FNS\u2019s direct assistance to  states came in the form of pilot projects, competitive grants, or  conferences. According to officials, FNS is in the early stages of  promoting states\u2019 use of data analytics for SNAP fraud prevention and  detection, and its efforts have focused on assessing the current capacity  of states to use data analytics and determining analytic practices that are  effective. Furthermore, FNS\u2019s efforts generally had specific end dates and  did not provide ongoing assistance to reach a broader group of states and  provide them with the knowledge and tools to develop and maintain their  data analytics efforts. (See table 5 for more information on the reach of  FNS\u2019s direct assistance efforts.)", "Although FNS provided some training on using data analytics, it was not  conducted on a recurring basis, and state officials we interviewed  expressed concerns about their access to information on successful data  analytics approaches. Officials we interviewed in five of our seven  selected states said that they attended FNS conferences that provided  training in data analytics and participated in regional discussions on the  topic; however, these events were provided occasionally and limited to  states within the region. State officials said that participating in  conferences in which they could learn from other states\u2019 experiences was  particularly helpful, and they wanted more opportunities to do so. State  officials also told us that it would be beneficial if FNS took a more active  role in disseminating states\u2019 successful practices, particularly with regard  to data analytics. Further communications about data analytics would be  consistent with federal internal control standards that call for agencies to  communicate necessary quality information to external parties in order to  achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. Federal agencies can support external  parties, such as state agencies, in achieving the federal agency\u2019s  objectives by sharing information on effective practices used by the  program or other external parties.", "Furthermore, officials we interviewed in selected states most frequently  cited high costs and resource demands as a challenge to using advanced  data analytics techniques. Although FNS has provided some financial  support to state efforts, officials in two states that we reviewed told us that  they were not always able to sustain efforts beyond the life of the FNS  pilot or grant. For example, officials we interviewed from Wisconsin said  that FNS\u2019s contractor for the 10-state pilot, in an effort separate from the  contract, developed a tool that identified SNAP purchases made from  disqualified SNAP retailers. Although the state officials found the tool to  be highly efficient because it could sift through large amounts of data, the  tool was only available to the state for a fee, which they said it could not  afford. Similarly, officials from Washington told us that as part of a  recipient trafficking prevention grant, the state was able to hire two  investigators to detect potential SNAP fraud that may be occurring via  social media. However, according to state officials, the state was unable  to maintain the effort after the grant ended.", "In our prior work on establishing data analytic programs to address fraud,  we noted that one way to handle resource challenges is to identify  opportunities that leverage a program\u2019s existing capabilities. In  September 2016, GAO convened a forum of data-analysis experts to  discuss considerations for entities establishing and refining data analytics  programs, during which the costs of such programs were raised.  Panelists, which included officials from FNS, noted that in developing a  data analytics program, an entity should consider ways of leveraging  resources throughout the entity. For example, panelists suggested that an  entity could improve its data analytics group by combining a data  warehouse from one department with existing statistical software from  another and incorporating it with its current fraud-prevention system. The  forum also suggested that a data analytics group should look across the  agency to find staff that may have an interest or experience in working  with data. Panelists noted that such efforts may be improved by seeking  staff from a diverse set of positions and perspectives, including auditors,  evaluators, investigators, and attorneys.", "Similarly, some state officials we interviewed shared creative ways to  leverage existing resources. For example, officials from Florida and  Wisconsin stated that they were able to leverage recovered funds from  other programs to purchase access to a commercial database that  matches eligibility data for individuals across related programs. In  Mississippi, officials said that they used SNAP transaction data to identify  individuals living out of state and then determine whether those  individuals were ineligible for both SNAP and other assistance programs.  By combining data and analyses across two programs, the state officials  said that they were able to close more cases and significantly increase  cost savings.", "However, other state officials noted that leveraging resources, especially  data, poses challenges that states will need to learn how to resolve.  Specifically, some states reported facing problems sharing data across  different systems and with restrictions on sharing sensitive personal  information. For example, officials representing four states from the  American Association of SNAP Directors (AASD) told us that, for states to  leverage data, SNAP states\u2019 data systems need to be integrated across  states. However, in their view, the cost of integration may exceed the  benefits from integrating the data. In addition, state officials said that in  order to leverage personal data, some states as well as programs in the  same state will need to reach agreements that define how data will be  extracted and used while protecting privacy. For example, a Wisconsin  official told us that its data analytics group has difficulty acquiring data  across programs within the state because of confidentiality and privacy  rules as well as the difficulty of reaching data-sharing agreements with  other programs.", "Moving forward, FNS\u2019s SNAP Fraud Framework, combined with its  maturity assessment, will form the core of FNS\u2019s efforts to assist states  with data analytics in a broad-based, systematic manner.

The use of  data analytics, such as mapping and predictive analysis, may help SNAP  agencies increase program integrity and improve administrative  efficiency. Data mining and data matching techniques can help identify  potential SNAP fraud, and predictive models can help identify  characteristics of SNAP traffickers. Our use of analytics on SNAP out-of- state transaction data from three selected states identified only slight  differences between those households who shopped out of state and  those who did not, suggesting that analyses of other data elements that  have been shown to be indicative of potential trafficking may allow states  to better identify potential trafficking and, thereby, better target resources.", "Although FNS has efforts underway to promote the use of data analytics  to improve SNAP fraud detection through its fraud framework and  maturity assessment, officials in our selected states cited challenges with  accessing and maintaining needed resources such as staff, technology,  and tools. While these challenges may limit states\u2019 ability to implement  data analytics, some of our selected states have successfully overcome  such challenges to implement or enhance data analytics programs. For  example, two states described leveraging recovered funds and  reinvesting them to combat fraud. Another state leveraged transaction  data across two programs, resulting in financial savings and enhanced  collections, which could be reinvested to combat fraud. As FNS conducts  outreach to help states implement its fraud framework and uses its  maturity assessment to assess states\u2019 anti-fraud capabilities, it has an  opportunity to regularly assist states with adopting advanced data analytic  techniques. Based on the experiences described by state officials, finding  ways that states can leverage existing resources to improve their data  analytic capabilities may be an important part of any solution. In its role as  the federal oversight agency, FNS is in a position to collect and widely  disseminate information about those states that have built support for  data analytics and leveraged existing resources to implement or expand  their data analytics programs to states seeking such examples.

To address these objectives, we  primarily focused on federal and state SNAP recipient anti-fraud work  since the beginning of fiscal year 2015\u2014the period which follows our  August 2014 report on SNAP recipient fraud. We reviewed relevant  federal laws, regulations, program guidance, and reports, and we  interviewed FNS officials in headquarters and all seven regional offices to  address all three objectives and obtained relevant documentation.", "To assess the extent that SNAP households in selected states made out- of-state purchases that may indicate potential recipient fraud, we  analyzed all out-of-state purchase data nationwide and we analyzed  transaction data for SNAP households in the District of Columbia and two  states\u2013North Dakota and Washington. We selected these states as they  were among the top states for out-of-state spending in a non-border state  in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the two most recent years\u2019 of SNAP data  available when we started this review. We obtained SNAP transaction  data from FNS for all participating households in the three selected  states, and analyzed fiscal year 2017 data for households that spent all  their benefits in a non-border state in that year. We also analyzed fiscal  year 2017 data for all households in these three states for purchases that  may indicate trafficking, based on common suspicious transaction types.  We tested the transaction data for ten different suspicious transaction  types that have been used by FNS and state SNAP officials to identify  potential trafficking. While the transactions we flagged for potential  trafficking in our three selected states are generally deemed potential  indicators of fraud by SNAP officials, there could also be legitimate  reasons for these purchases and they do not prove trafficking. For that  reason, our analysis focused on households with a greater frequency of  questionable purchases in fiscal year 2017 indicating potential  trafficking\u2014specifically purchases that resulted in 20 or more trafficking  flags. We assessed the reliability of SNAP transaction data used in  analyses through review of related documentation, interviews with  knowledgeable officials, and electronic testing of the data, and found  them to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine how selected state agencies are using data analytics to  identify potential SNAP recipient fraud, we interviewed officials from  seven state SNAP agencies about their efforts.

We interviewed state SNAP agency officials who oversee anti- fraud practices in each of our seven selected states. During each  interview, we collected information on each state\u2019s data analytics  activities and whether they have implemented leading practices for data  analytics from GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework. We also discussed the  advantages and challenges of using data analytics.

We also reviewed the terms of work for a  contract FNS awarded to a private consulting firm to conduct a pilot  project with 10 states during fiscal years 2014-2017, as well as reports  delivered by the contractor detailing the results of the work. In addition,  we reviewed a guide to data analytics that FNS developed for a 5-day  training session in August 2016, as well as the data analytics \u201cmaturity  assessment\u201d questionnaire that is intended for FNS regions to use to  assess the capacity of the states. We also obtained and reviewed FNS\u2019s  SNAP Fraud Framework and Supplementary Materials that was released  in May 2018.
