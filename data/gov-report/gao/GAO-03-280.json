Furthermore, the Air Force has not fully funded certain cost reduction plans called production improvement programs (PIPs), and as a result, these PIPs may not achieve their estimated $3.7 billion in offsets to cost growth. In addition to the cost growth estimated by DOD, GAO identified areas where, in the future, F/A-22 production cost growth is likely to occur. First, the Office of the Secretary of Defense's current production cost estimate does not include about $1.3 billion in costs that should be considered in future cost estimates. Second, schedule delays in developmental testing could delay the start of a multiyear contract designed to control costs. These delays could also result in additional costs owing to the expiration of an Air Force agreement with the contractor designed to help control production costs in fiscal year 2005. Last, other risk factors may increase future production costs, including the dependency of certain cost reduction plans on the availability of funding and a reduction in funding for support costs. DOD has not fully informed Congress (1) about what the total cost of the production program could be if cost reduction plans do not offset cost growth as planned or (2) about the aircraft quantity that can be procured within the production cost limit.

Thus, if entry into a multiyear  procurement contract does not occur as planned, offsets from the  implementation of multiyear procurement cannot be achieved.

Regarding our first  recommendation on making investments in PIPs a priority, DOD said  that while it believes that PIP investments in general are a good idea,  the Department intends to implement PIPs on a case-by-case basis, using  expected return-on-investment criteria. DOD also commented that our  report does not provide evidence that investments in PIPs reduce costs.", "Our recommendation that the Air Force make the funding of PIPs at  the planned level a priority is based on evidence from both the Air Force  and OSD that investment in PIPs at the planned level will generate a  significant return-on-investment. In addition, during the course of our  review, Air Force officials told us they planned to make up for not fully  investing in PIPs during the last 2 fiscal years by investing more in  subsequent years in order to achieve the planned savings. The Air Force\u2019s  plan appears to recognize that it has moved beyond a case-by-case  approach. Our recommendation would support such a plan. Finally, the  reluctance to embrace PIPs in DOD\u2019s comments appears to be contrary to  the position taken within the Department. The potential benefits of  investing in PIPs continue to be highlighted in high-level F/A-22 meetings  and correspondence to Congress. A September 2001 letter to Congress  from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics estimates that the quantity of F/A-22 aircraft will need to be  reduced, but more aircraft can be procured if cost reduction plans  (which include PIPs) prove more successful than OSD\u2019s estimates. We  believe our recommendation to make the funding of PIPs at the planned  level a priority puts DOD in a better position to enhance the affordability  of the F/A-22. Conversely, by not funding PIPs at the planned level, DOD  may lose opportunities to create greater production efficiencies and as a  result, have to acquire fewer aircraft.", "Regarding our second recommendation related to providing  documentation to Congress on cost reduction plans, the implications of  not investing in PIPs as planned, and the aircraft quantities that can be  acquired within the existing production cost limit, DOD stated that our  recommendation is inconsistent with its decision to use a \u201cbuy-to-budget\u201d  approach for the F/A-22 (buying the highest quantity of aircraft possible  each year on the basis of appropriated funding each year). DOD also  stated that providing this information to Congress would not provide a  reliable projection of the number of aircraft possible because (1) there are  other factors that affect cost and (2) the projected savings are uncertain  and may not materialize as the estimator expects.", "We continue to believe that the Secretary of Defense should provide  Congress with this documentation. As we have discussed in this and  several earlier reports, we agree that there are indeed many factors that  can cause F/A-22 production costs to rise. And, as we have also noted,  projected offsets generated by PIPs and other cost reduction plans are  uncertain and may not all materialize, even if investments are made as  planned. Shifts in these realities are frequent and create a constantly  changing picture of F/A-22 production costs, offsets, and aircraft  quantities. This is particularly the case when PIP investments are not made  as planned. Hence, it is important that updated and accurate information  be regularly and routinely made available to Congress as the picture  changes. DOD\u2019s argument that it is implementing a \u201cbuy-to-budget\u201d  approach makes our recommendation more compelling because aircraft  quantities planned each fiscal year can change in the few months between  when fiscal year funding is appropriated and when a production contract  is negotiated with the prime contractor and awarded. Providing visibility  to the projection of how many aircraft can be acquired within the cost  limitation would enhance program oversight.", "DOD has several extant reporting options that can be used to provide this  information. A new report is not required. For example, DOD could return  to its former practice of using annual selected acquisition reports to  inform Congress about the potential cost of production if cost reduction  plans do not offset cost growth as planned. This information was included  in these reports from 1996 to 1998. In addition, the President\u2019s Budget  submission could be used as a vehicle to provide Congress with updated  information about the quantity of aircraft DOD believes can be acquired  under the existing production cost limitation.
