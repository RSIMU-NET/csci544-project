Given the risks posed by the sale of sensitive defense-related items to the public, and the Internet's international reach and high volume of commerce, the Subcommittee asked GAO to conduct undercover testing to determine whether the general public can easily purchase these items on the Internet, including on the Web sites eBay and Craigslist. To perform this work, GAO investigators used undercover identities to pose as members of the general public, meaning that they conducted their work with names, credit cards, and contact information that could not be traced to GAO.

A review of policies and procedures for these Web sites determined that there are few safeguards to prevent the sale of sensitive and stolen defense-related items using the sites. During the period of investigation, GAO undercover investigators purchased a dozen sensitive items on eBay and Craigslist to demonstrate how easy it was to obtain them. Many of these items were stolen from the U.S. military. According to the Department of Defense (DOD), it considers the sensitive items GAO purchased to be on the U.S. Munitions List, meaning that there are restrictions on their overseas sales. However, if investigators had been members of the general public, there is a risk that they could have illegally resold these items to an international broker or transferred them overseas. GAO investigators also identified examples of U.S. government property that was stolen and sold for a profit rather than being utilized by DOD. For example, GAO found two civilian store owners who acted as conduits for defense-related property that was likely stolen from the military. The store owners told GAO they purchased gear from service members--including Kevlar vests, flak jackets, and gas masks--and sold it through eBay to the general public. GAO also purchased stolen military meals, ready-to-eat (MRE) and found a robust market for stolen military MREs on eBay and Craigslist. Advertisements for the sensitive defense-related items GAO purchased were not removed by Web site administrators, allowing investigators to buy the items. Both Web sites maintain lists of items that are prohibited from sale, including stolen items, but only eBay contains warnings related to overseas sales and the improper sale of sensitive defense-related items."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Unauthorized individuals, companies, organizations, and other countries  continue their attempts to obtain sensitive items related to the defense of  the United States. For example, a 2003 undercover investigation by  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) revealed that an individual  in Florida attempted to purchase and illegally export roughly $750,000  worth of U.S. F-14 fighter jet components to the Iranian military.  According to the indictment, the individual planned to ship these  components through other countries, including Italy, to conceal Iran as the  ultimate destination. As we have reported before, Iran\u2019s acquisition of F-14  components could threaten national security. In another example, ICE  agents arrested a Columbian national in 2005 for attempting to illegally  export 80 AK-47 assault rifles, an M-60 machine gun, and an M-16 machine  gun to the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, a U.S.-designated terrorist  organization.", "Although it is not illegal to buy and sell some defense-related items  domestically, many sensitive items are manufactured strictly for military  purposes and were never meant to be a part of everyday American life.  The Department of Defense (DOD) assigns demilitarization codes (demil  codes) to some items so that, when they are no longer needed by the  military, the items can be recognized and rendered useless for their  intended purpose prior to leaving government control. We are defining  sensitive defense-related items as those items that, if acquired by DOD,  would have to be demilitarized before disposal\u2014a process that could  involve everything from removing a sensitive component to destroying the  item entirely. Our prior reports found that control breakdowns at DOD  allowed members of the general public to acquire sensitive defense-related  items, including F-14 components, from the Government Liquidation Web  site; these items had not been demilitarized properly. Although DOD has  made improvements in the management of its excess property system,  saving millions of dollars and reducing the likelihood that sensitive items  are improperly sold, concerns remain that members of the general public  can acquire sensitive defense-related items through additional weaknesses  involving the government\u2019s acquisition, use, storage, and sale of these  items.", "The Internet is one place that defense-related items can be purchased,  raising the possibility that some sensitive items are available to those who  can afford them. In addition to the Government Liquidation Web site,  many military surplus stores across the United States have Web pages with  online ordering capability. Furthermore, Web sites such as eBay and  Craigslist are popular because they allow sellers to advertise individual  items and appear to provide some element of anonymity. For the most  part, these Web sites have an international reach\u2014meaning that it is  possible for sellers to identify buyers in foreign countries and quickly  export purchased items. Sellers use eBay to auction goods or services,  receive bids from prospective buyers, and finalize a sale. eBay also  features \u201cstore fronts\u201d in which property is listed and bought without  going through a bidding process. In contrast, Craigslist functions as an  automated version of the newspaper classifieds, listing jobs, housing,  goods, services, personals, activities, advice, and just about anything users  wish to sell, advertise, or promote. The service is community-based and  moderated, operating in 450 cities worldwide, and is largely free of charge.", "While potential buyers for some sensitive items certainly include  hobbyists, military enthusiasts, and emergency response or law  enforcement units, the ICE cases clearly show the real risk that illegal  weapons brokers, terrorists, and unauthorized agents of foreign  governments also number among potential buyers. In addition to the risk  that sensitive defense-related items could be used directly against U.S.  interests, some items could be disassembled and analyzed to determine  how they work. This technique, known as reverse engineering, could allow  the creation of (1) countermeasures to defeat or minimize the military  significance of the item or (2) the development of an equivalent item that  could be used against U.S. interests.", "Given the risks posed by the sale of sensitive defense-related items to the  public, and the Internet\u2019s international reach and high volume of  commerce, you asked us to conduct undercover testing to determine  whether the general public can easily purchase these items on the Internet,  including on the Web sites eBay and Craigslist.", "To perform this investigation, we searched for certain target items on eBay  and Craigslist. When these items were identified, investigators attempted  to purchase them\u2014either through bidding or a direct purchase (eBay) or  by contacting the seller and arranging an in-person meeting or sale via U.S.  mail (Craigslist). Investigators used undercover identities to pose as  members of the general public when purchasing these items, meaning that  they conducted their work with names, credit cards, and contact  information that could not be traced back to GAO. In the case of eBay  purchases, investigators worked with eBay\u2019s Fraud Investigations Team to  obtain information regarding the identity and account history of the  sellers. We also searched the DOD Employee Interactive Data System  (DEIDS) database to determine whether sellers were active members of  the U.S. military. Where applicable and feasible, investigators interviewed  the sellers and performed additional follow-up investigative work or, in  some instances, made immediate referrals of the cases to field agents of  the appropriate law enforcement entities.", "After purchasing a questionable item, our investigators matched the  National Stock Number (NSN) on the item to those listed in DOD\u2019s Federal  Logistics System (FedLog) to validate that it met our definition of a  sensitive defense-related item.

Rather, our report provides only a \u201csnapshot\u201d of some items that  investigators identified and purchased. Further, we did not attempt to  perform a comprehensive audit or analysis to determine whether systemic  property-management problems at DOD ultimately resulted in the sale of  these items on the Internet during this period. As a result, our investigation  of sellers was limited, in most cases, to their claims regarding how they  obtained the items.

Demil codes are contained in the  Defense Demilitarization Manual, which implements DOD policy to apply  appropriate controls and prevent improper use or release of these items  outside of DOD. Demil codes indicate whether property is available for  public use without restriction or whether specific restrictions apply, such  as removal of classified components, destruction, or trade security  controls. For example, if an item is designated as demil D, DOD requires  this item to be totally destroyed \u201cso as to preclude restoration or repair to  a usable condition\u201d rather than allowing a member of the general public to  purchase the item.", "According to DOD\u2019s Defense Logistics Information Service, it considers  sensitive defense-related items to be U.S. Munitions List items. This list,  which is maintained by the State Department, identifies defense-related  items that require government approval prior to export or temporary  import. There are 20 categories of items on the U.S. Munitions List,  including firearms and ammunition; aircraft and associated components;  protective personnel equipment (such as body armor); nuclear weapons  and related items; and directed energy weapons. Some of these items are  also defined as significant military equipment, which are items for which  special export controls are warranted because of their capacity for  substantial military utility or capability. Any person or company in the  United States that engages in either manufacturing or exporting U.S.  Munitions List items must register with the State Department. Prior to  exporting these items, a State Department-issued license is generally  required.", "The table below defines the DOD demil codes, their associated designation  as U.S. Munitions List items or Significant Military equipment, and DOD\u2019s  approach to disposing of the item under each code.", "Despite the use of demil codes and other safeguards, our prior reports  show that DOD faces significant challenges in properly disposing of  sensitive military property. For example, in our May 2005 report on excess  property, we found that some sensitive defense-related items in the DOD  excess property system were lost, stolen, or damaged before DOD could  decide what to do with them. Losses included nearly 150 chemical and  biological protective suits, over 70 units of body armor, and 5 guided  missile warheads. Because 43 percent of the reported losses involved  military and commercial technology requiring demilitarization, we  reported that these losses posed a security risk. In follow-up work  reported in July 2006, we found that the Government Liquidation Web site  sold over 2,500 sensitive-defense related items to nearly 80 individuals  between November 2005 and June 2006. We also reported that our  undercover investigators purchased items from the Government  Liquidation Web site that should not have been sold to the public,  including SAPIs (which were in demand by U.S. service members in Iraq  and Afghanistan); a time-selector unit used to ensure the accuracy of  computer-based equipment, such as global positioning systems and  system-level clocks; digital microcircuits used in F-14 fighter aircraft; and  numerous other items. In our most recent July 2007 report, we found that  DOD has made significant improvements in preventing the sale of sensitive  defense-related items through the Government Liquidation Web site.  Throughout our investigation, we detected items that were potentially  sensitive, but DOD or Web site employees regularly identified the same  property items and removed them from the site before they were sold.", "In addition to the improper sale of sensitive defense-related items, we have  also reported that the sale of demil code A and other nonsensitive military  items can result in waste and reduces the efficiency of DOD operations.  For example, in our May 2005 report, we found that DOD sold new and  unused items to the general public for pennies on the dollar through the  Government Liquidation Web site at the same time other DOD agencies  requested these items. Rather than allocate its resources effectively, DOD  simply paid the full acquisition cost again to purchase the same new and  unused items. We determined that, from fiscal years 2002 through 2004,  $3.5 billion in new, unused, and excellent condition items were being  transferred or donated outside of DOD, sold on the Internet for pennies on  the dollar, or destroyed rather than being reutilized. DOD has made  progress in this area, with improved utilization of property resulting in  millions of dollars in recent savings. Another area involving waste where  we have performed investigative work involves the sale of military MREs.  Although military MREs are nonsensitive items and are not on the U.S.  Munitions List, we have identified civilians and service members selling  military MREs on eBay for commercial gain. We concluded that military  MREs are procured by government entities using taxpayer dollars, and  consequently, if they are sold to the general public on eBay, they are  clearly not reaching their intended recipients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sensitive and Stolen Defense-Related Items Available on the Internet to the Highest Bidder", "paragraphs": ["We found numerous defense-related items for sale to the highest bidder on  eBay and Craigslist from January 2007 through March 2008.

On March 30, 2007, we purchased a  used body armor vest and two SAPIs from an eBay seller located in Minot,  North Dakota. The seller lives near Minot Air Force Base. Our  investigation determined that the seller was a Senior Airman with the Air  Force Reserve. Further, we determined that the individual had completed  eBay auctions for 18 body armor vests and SAPIs from June 2006 to April  2007 for a total of over $3,300. According to eBay records, an individual in  Japan was the highest bidder in one of the auction rounds. After we  referred this matter to Air Force OSI, we learned that the Minot Air Force  Base security police and the county sheriff\u2019s office had investigated the  matter and determined that the body armor was stolen from the base.

This eBay seller owns a gun store in Barstow,  California. He lists U.S. military items on his eBay store front, including  sensitive defense-related items such as Kevlar helmets and NBC gear.  When we asked the seller to identify the source of the items listed on his  eBay store front, he told us that military personnel frequently arrive at his  shop with the items for sale.

This eBay seller owns a military surplus  store in Abilene, Texas. Our investigators visited the physical store  location associated with the eBay store and observed a number of new  ACUs with IR tabs affixed to them. As discussed above, IR tabs are an IFF  element that can be detected at night by both ground troops and airborne  combat pilots equipped with night vision equipment and represent one  part of the military\u2019s night-fighting system. IR tabs on ACUs are demil code  D. When our investigators pointed this out to the store owner, he said he  was unaware of the restriction and removed the ACUs from the sales rack.  The store owner said he purchased the ACUs from service members. He  added that many of the items in his store were acquired from local military  personnel who arrive, unannounced, at his shop with items for sale. He  said that he maintains a record of transactions and provided a copy to our  investigators.

Consequently, if military MREs are sold to the general public on  the Internet, they are clearly not reaching their intended recipients and  represent a waste of taxpayer dollars. Since service members are not  authorized to take MREs and sell them for personal gain, the vast majority  of the military MREs for sale on the Internet represent stolen military  property.", "During our investigation, we purchased numerous cases of MREs from  eBay and Craigslist sellers. The sellers were mostly civilians. Three  examples of our investigative work related to military MREs follows:    One civilian seller in Louisiana indicated that she has been selling  military MREs on eBay for a number of years. She said that she  acquires the MREs from service members assigned to a nearby military  base, and that they arrive at her home unannounced. She added that  most of the service members have 2 or 3 MRE cases but that others  have had as many as 10 to 12 cases. She told us that she does not know  any of the service members or where they get the MREs, but suggested  they are \u201cleft over\u201d from field exercises. She said that she usually pays  service members about $20 per case in cash and that she can sell the  cases on eBay for about $55 per case. We reviewed eBay records and  learned that, from September 2006 through February 2008, she  completed eBay auctions totaling about $55,000 for MREs. These MREs  were likely stolen from the nearby military base. We referred this case  to Army CID for criminal investigation.", "A second seller living in Phenix City, Alabama, is employed as a civilian  aircraft mechanic at Fort Benning, Georgia. She told us that she obtains  military MREs from dumpsters at Fort Benning.

According to sales data provided by eBay, from July  30, 2006, to February 6, 2008, this individual had completed  approximately $54,000 in MRE auctions. Because of the volume of sales  activity we referred this case to Army CID for criminal investigation.", "A third seller was a Private First Class in the U.S. Army stationed in  Camp Casey, South Korea. Based on our referral, Army CID executed a  search warrant at the seller\u2019s residence and discovered a substantial  amount of stolen U.S. military property, as well as nearly $2,000 in  cash. According to Army officials, the seller was charged with drug  possession and use in the summer of 2006. He was demoted and placed  in a supply clerk position in charge of MRE inventories while awaiting  discharge from the military, which gave him the opportunity to steal  MREs and sell them over eBay.

Both Web sites maintain published lists of  items that are prohibited from sale, including stolen items, but only eBay  contains warnings related to sensitive defense-related or export-controlled  items even though both Web sites have an international reach. eBay  employs administrative staff and investigative teams intended to deter  fraud and prohibited sales from occurring on the site. Meanwhile,  Craigslist has a smaller staff and largely relies on its user community for  identifying inappropriate advertisements or postings. Officials with both  Web sites told us they cooperate with law enforcement agencies to stop  the sale of illegal, counterfeit, or stolen items, and identify and deter  individuals from using these Internet services for a fraudulent or improper  purpose. Generally, neither eBay nor Craigslist can incur criminal liability  for being the conduit through which stolen or export-controlled items are  sold, even if the items are sold overseas. Because the Web sites never take  possession of the goods, do not set the price of transactions, and do not  actually deliver the items, no relevant federal criminal statute applies to  their activities. Table 5 summarizes the policies, proactive enforcement  efforts, and penalties that each of these Internet companies maintain to  deter the sale of prohibited items.", "Advertisements for the sensitive defense-related items we purchased were  not removed by eBay administrators, allowing us to complete the  transactions. According to its prohibited items list, eBay prohibits stolen  property from being sold. eBay also provides extensive information about  international trading on its prohibited items list, including a link to a  government Web site on export controls. There are no explicit references  to the sale of military MREs and other stolen military property on the  prohibited items list. However, eBay does discuss a prohibition on  defense-related items that have not been disposed in accordance with  DOD demilitarization policies. According to an eBay official with whom  we spoke, his company has created two teams that inspect user sales\u2014the  Fraud Investigations Team and the Prohibited Items Team. The Fraud  Investigations Team deals directly with law enforcement organizations and  provides information on sales or seller activity. We received invaluable  assistance from the Fraud Investigations Team during our investigation.  The official stated that the Fraud Investigations Team also proactively  refers cases to relevant law enforcement agencies for further investigation  and prosecution. Meanwhile, the Prohibited Items Team has an automatic  filtering system to identify potentially prohibited sales and responds to  reports on prohibited activity. If the Prohibited Items Team discovers a  prohibited item, its mandate is to remove the advertisement for the item,  educate the seller, and suspend the seller\u2019s account if the activity  continues. When we asked the eBay official about the sale of military body  armor on eBay, he admitted that it was a difficult issue for eBay because  some body armor can be sold legally. He said that the Fraud Investigations  Team does not scan eBay sales to try to identify what body armor is illegal  to sell, e.g., body armor that has been stolen from the military. Regarding  the sale of military MREs, the official stated that \u201cnobody has indicated to  us that it\u2019s illegal to sell MREs.\u201d To penalize users who violate eBay  policies, eBay officials can cancel listings, limit account privileges,  eliminate users\u2019 \u201cPower Seller\u201d status, and suspend accounts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Craigslist", "paragraphs": ["Advertisements for the sensitive defense-related items we purchased were  not removed by Craigslist administrators, allowing us to complete the  transactions.

Further, there are no  explicit references to the sale of military MREs and other stolen military  property on the prohibited items list.

We observed this in several cases during our investigation,  when questionable advertisements for weapons and other obviously  prohibited sales we identified were also apparently noticed by Craigslist  users, leading to removal of the items from the Web site. The Craigslist  official with whom we spoke indicated that Craigslist works with law  enforcement agencies but does not proactively call issues to their  attention. The official said that Craigslist deletes advertisements for  questionable items, such as body armor and night vision goggles, when  contacted by law enforcement.
