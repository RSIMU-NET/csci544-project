Common activities include, among others, market research, consumer and retail promotion, and participation in international trade shows. GAO's analysis of expenditure data from 2007 through 2011 shows that participants in the Market Access Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMD)--the largest of the five market development programs--remained generally consistent during that period. The program participants with the largest shares of funding and the countries where the largest shares of funds were spent also remained relatively consistent. Expenditure data for 2011 show that MAP and FMD participants met or exceeded FAS contribution requirements that they match minimum percentages of the program funding they receive. Unlike funding for the other programs, a portion of MAP funds is used for promotion of branded products. In 2011, MAP participants spent about 85 percent of program funding on overseas promotion of generic commodities. More than 600 small companies and seven agricultural cooperatives spent the remaining 15 percent of MAP funding to promote branded products.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) uses several management and monitoring processes to reduce the risk of duplication among the five programs. FAS uses an integrated system to process funding applications for multiple programs and to monitor expenditures, which reduces the risk of duplication. According to FAS officials, FAS also monitors participants' expenses for all programs through its compliance review process. In addition, FAS guidance requires program participants to submit annual progress reports on the results of their market development activities. GAO found that performance measures in a sample of progress reports generally reflected selected FAS guidance and key attributes of successful performance measures that GAO had identified. However, the sampled reports did not always outline the methodologies used to assess activity results as required by FAS guidelines. In these cases, it would be difficult for FAS to determine the reliability of the reported results and the impact of market development activities.", "A 2007 cost-benefit analysis of MAP and FMD, commissioned by FAS, found that the programs increased U.S. agricultural exports and benefited the U.S. economy, but methodological limitations may affect the magnitude of the estimated benefits. Overall, the analysis asserted that the government's expenditures for the two programs resulted in greater increases in U.S. agricultural exports and greater benefit to the U.S. economy than would have occurred without the expenditures. However, an economic model used to estimate the programs' impact on U.S. market share omitted important variables, such as commodity prices. Also, the study did not include sensitivity analyses of certain key assumptions underlying its estimates of impacts on U.S. exports. For example, analyses of the possible effects of varying levels of program funding would provide a clearer picture of the potential impact of increased or decreased funding on U.S. exports and the economy. FAS officials reported that they plan to commission a new cost-benefit analysis in 2014 but have not yet identified the methodologies that the new analysis will use."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USDA (1) emphasize that market development program participants' annual progress reports should identify the methodologies used to assess results and (2) ensure that any economic models used in future cost-benefit analyses of the programs include industry-specific variables and sensitivity analyses of key assumptions.

In 2010, the administration  highlighted the importance of increasing exports, including agricultural  exports, when it launched the National Export Initiative with the goal of  doubling the dollar value of U.S. exports by 2015. However, members of  Congress have debated the level of funding for market development  assistance and the impact it has on agricultural exports. The two largest  of USDA\u2019s five market development programs\u2014the Market Access  Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMD)\u2014 received authorizations of, respectively, $200 million and $34.5 million of  USDA\u2019s annual market development program funding in fiscal year 2012.  The three remaining programs\u2019 authorizations ranged from $2 million to  $10 million in fiscal year 2012. USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS)  administers the five programs. We last reported on MAP in 1999, when  we found that USDA\u2019s estimate of the program\u2019s impact on the U.S.  economy may have been overstated and that evidence of the program\u2019s  impact from available market-level studies was inconclusive. More  recently, USDA commissioned a cost-benefit analysis of MAP\u2019s and  FMD\u2019s economic impact, which was completed in 2007 and updated in  2010.", "You asked us to review several aspects of FAS\u2019s five market  development programs.

Because MAP and FMD receive most of USDA\u2019s  market development funding\u2014about 90 percent in 2012\u2014we focused our  review primarily on participation in these two programs. Appendix III  provides participant expenditure data on the three smaller programs\u2014the  Emerging Markets Program (EMP), the Quality Samples Program (QSP),  and the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program (TASC).", "We analyzed USDA\u2019s market development program expenditure data for  participants in each of the five programs for 2002 through 2011. We also  reviewed key agency and program participant documents, including  program regulations and guidelines and selected participant applications  and strategies. We interviewed FAS officials in Washington, D.C., and at  Agricultural Trade Offices in Japan and Mexico. We also met with several  program participants in their domestic headquarters and with their  overseas representatives in Japan and Mexico, where we observed some  market promotion and maintenance activities. We assessed a random but  nongeneralizeable sample of participants\u2019 annual progress reports, using  FAS and GAO criteria for performance measures. In addition, we used  FAS expenditure data to develop the sample of progress reports from 20  participants and a specific country where they were active in 2008, 2009,  and 2010, for a total of 60 country progress reports. On the basis of  electronic and manual data testing and interviews with knowledgeable  USDA staff members, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Further, we analyzed FAS\u2019s cost-benefit  analyses of MAP and FMD evaluating the impact of these programs on  the U.S. economy, and we interviewed agency officials, consultants, and  academics involved in these analyses. Finally, we reviewed relevant  research about the economic impacts of FAS\u2019s market development  programs, reviewed Office of Management and Budget guidance for  conducting cost-benefit analyses, and reviewed GAO\u2019s cost estimation  guide.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FAS administers USDA\u2019s five market development programs on behalf of  the Commodity Credit Corporation, which is owned and operated by the  U.S. government. The programs provide matching funds to support U.S.  industry efforts to build, maintain, and expand commercial overseas  markets for U.S. agricultural products, with the overarching goal of  increasing agricultural exports. Congress authorizes a maximum level of  the corporation\u2019s funds to be used for USDA\u2019s market development  programs, with the exception of QSP, through 5-year farm bills. (Table 1  shows authorizations for the five programs for fiscal years 2002 through  2012.) Many other countries also provide government funding to promote  agricultural exports that compete with U.S exports in the world market.  The World Trade Organization does not consider such expenditures to be  trade distorting and therefore does not restrict these expenditures,  according to USDA officials.", "Participants in these programs include nonprofit agricultural trade  associations; agricultural cooperatives that promote their own brand  name; and state regional trade groups. The majority of market  development funds are used for promotion of generic U.S. commodities,  with no emphasis on a particular brand; however a portion of MAP funds  may be used for promotion of branded products. When considering  applications for funding, FAS gives priority to applicants with the broadest  producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the  commodity being promoted. Appendix II shows participants in the five  market development programs in fiscal year 2012 and their award  amounts. These organizations may participate in more than one of the  five market development programs.", "After approving an application for participation in a market development  program, FAS sets the participant\u2019s funding level and signs a program  agreement with the participant. FAS provides a program approval letter,  which outlines approved activities and their budget levels, and program  funds are expended through reimbursement of the participant\u2019s expense  claims for approved activities. The five programs have different  requirements related to participants\u2019 matching contributions, which FAS  refers to as \u201ccost-sharing\u201d; these requirements ensure that program funds  are supplemental. MAP requires participants that receive funding for  promotion of generic products to make contributions to the program that  are worth at least 10 percent of the funding they receive, although FAS  encourages participants to commit in their program applications to  contributing more than the minimum required. Eligible contributions  include cash; the cost of acquiring materials; and in-kind contributions,  such as professional staff time spent on design and execution of  activities. The MAP branded products program and FMD require  participants to make a minimum contribution of 50 percent. EMP, TASC,  and QSP do not require minimum or maximum contributions, but  applicants are expected to propose the amount they will contribute. For all  five programs, the contribution levels that participants commit to is an  important factor FAS considers in approving applications for funding,  according to FAS officials. In addition, MAP and FMD participants must  certify that program funds supplement, and do not supplant, any private  funds, while applications for the other three programs must state why the  applicants could not achieve their objectives without government funds.", "In addition to having different contribution requirements, the five market  development programs have different funding levels, objectives, and  criteria for approving applications for funding.", "Market Access Program. MAP is the largest of the five programs,  with a current annual authorization of $200 million\u2014about 80 percent  of USDA\u2019s total annual market development funding. In fiscal year  2012, 66 program participants received MAP awards, which ranged  from about $17,000 to almost $20 million (see app. II). MAP was  established in 1985 to aid in the development, expansion, and  maintenance of foreign markets for U.S. agricultural commodities and  products by sharing the costs of overseas marketing and promotional  activities. A portion of MAP funds is used for promotion of brand- name products by cooperatives or by small, for-profit businesses that  apply through state regional trade groups or other MAP participants.  In addition, unlike participants in the MAP generic products program,  small businesses promoting branded products are subject to a  \u201cgraduation requirement,\u201d which limits them to no more than 5 years  of promotions in a given country. The MAP regulations for market  development for generic and branded products identify eligible  expenditures and criteria that FAS is to consider in approving  applications and determining funding levels. Eligible expenditures  include, among others, advertising, point-of-sale materials, in-store  and food service promotions and product demonstrations, seminars  and educational training, participation in trade shows, market  research, and independent evaluations and audits. The process for  approving applications for MAP funding involves applying a variety of  qualitative criteria, including the adequacy of the applicant\u2019s plan for  addressing market constraints and opportunities, prior export  promotion experience, past program results, and the suitability of the  applicant\u2019s plan for performance measurement. The MAP regulations  also list quantitative criteria for determining award amounts for  qualified applicants, including the size of the budget request relative to  the projected value of exports of the commodity being promoted, the  size of the budget request relative to the actual value of exports of the  commodity in prior years, and the applicant\u2019s proposed contribution  level.", "Foreign Market Development Program. FMD, which was  established in 1954, provides $34.5 million per year to nonprofit  agricultural associations representing U.S. agricultural producers and  processors, to create, expand, and maintain long-term export markets  primarily for generic bulk commodities. In fiscal year 2012, 24 FMD  participants received award amounts ranging from about $16,000 to  more than $5 million (see app. II). FMD allows many of the same  expenditures as MAP, such as market research and product  demonstrations; however, unlike MAP, FMD funds may not be used  for activities targeted directly at consumers. The qualitative criteria for  approving applications for participation in FMD and the quantitative  factors for determining award amounts are also similar to those for  MAP. Examples of these quantitative factors include the applicant\u2019s  contribution level and the value of exports being promoted.", "Emerging Markets Program. EMP, which was established in 1990,  provides up to $10 million annually to U.S private-sector, university,  or government entities for technical assistance activities intended to  promote exports of U.S. agricultural commodities and products in  emerging markets by improving their food and business systems and  reducing potential trade barriers. In 2012, FAS awarded EMP funds  to 35 entities, some of which received funding for more than one EMP  project, with total awards per participant ranging from $14,000 to  about $500,000 (see app. II). Types of projects funded may include  feasibility studies, market research, sector assessments, orientation  visits, specialized training, business workshops, and similar  undertakings. EMP is not intended for projects targeted at end-user  consumers. Ineligible expenses include branded product promotions  (e.g., in-store promotions, restaurant advertising, labeling);  advertising, administrative, and operational expenses for trade shows;  website development; equipment purchases; and the preparation and  printing of brochures, flyers, and posters. The EMP regulations list the  criteria FAS is to consider in reviewing applications for funding.  Among these criteria are the applicant\u2019s willingness to contribute  resources; the degree to which the proposed project is likely to  contribute to the development, maintenance, or expansion of U.S.  agricultural exports to emerging markets; and a demonstration of how  the proposed project will benefit a particular industry as a whole.  Individual projects are unlikely to be approved at levels above  $500,000, and funding for continuing and substantially similar projects  is generally limited to 3 years.", "Quality Samples Program. QSP, which was established in 1999,  currently provides $2 million annually to assist U.S. organizations in  supplying commodity samples to potential foreign importers.  Projects focus on industry and manufacturing, rather than on end-use  consumers, and are intended to promote U.S. food and fiber products.  In fiscal year 2012, 12 program participants received QSP funding, in  most cases for multiple projects, with total awards per participant  ranging from $5,000 to $460,000 (see app. II). QSP funding for  individual projects is limited to $75,000, and the projects should be  completed within a year of approval by FAS. Eligible expenditures  include the sample purchase price and the cost of transporting the  samples domestically to the port of export and from there to the  foreign port or point-of-entry. Samples provided in a QSP project may  not be directly used as part of a retail promotion or supplied directly to  consumers. The annual QSP Notice of Funds Availability spells out  the criteria that FAS is to use for approving applications for QSP  funding. These criteria include, among others, the potential for  expanding commercial sales in the proposed market; the importer\u2019s  contribution in terms of handling and processing the sample; the  amount of funding requested and the applicant\u2019s willingness to  contribute resources; and how well the proposal\u2019s technical  assistance will demonstrate the intended end-use benefit.", "Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program. TASC, which  was established in 2002, is currently authorized under the 2008 farm  bill, as extended by the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012, to  provide a maximum of $9 million to U.S. entities, for projects that  address sanitary, phytosanitary, and technical barriers that prohibit or  limit U.S. specialty crop exports.  Any U.S. organization may receive  TASC funding, including, but not limited to, U.S. government and state  government agencies, nonprofit trade associations, universities,  agricultural cooperatives, and private businesses. In 2012, FAS  awarded funds to 24 participants, some of whom received funding for  multiple projects, and total funding awarded to each participant  ranged from about $1.3 million to $14,000 (see app. II). FAS will not  consider proposals for TASC funding that exceed $500,000 in a given  year. Examples of eligible expenditures include seminars and  workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest lists, and  pest and disease research. Certain types of expenses are not eligible  for reimbursement, such as the costs of market research, advertising,  and other promotional expenses.

The council  also conducts educational efforts aimed at explaining to Japanese  furniture and flooring manufacturers, designers, and architects that  discoloration and curving grains are wood characteristics rather than  imperfections, because, according to a council representative, straight  wood grain has traditionally been favored in Japan.", "California Table Grape Commission used about $271,000 in 2011 MAP  funds for generic product promotional activities in Mexico. Commission  representatives informed us that in-store promotional activities are the  most effective means of reaching the customer. Promotional activities  include in-store grape display competitions as well as promotions with  other U.S. fruit groups, such as apples and pears. The commission also  used MAP funding to conduct in-store grape sampling demonstrations at  major retail chains throughout Mexico to demonstrate the quality of  California grapes. In 2010 and 2011, FAS authorized the commission to  use TASC funds for activities to remove, resolve, or mitigate sanitary,  phytosanitary, and related barriers that prohibit or threaten the export of  U.S. specialty crops in multiple countries.

To reduce this risk, FAS uses  an integrated online system, known as the Unified Export Strategy (UES)  system, which participants typically use to apply for funding for any of the  five market development programs. For example, a participant seeking  funding for both FMD and MAP submits a single application through the  UES system, explaining how it intends to use both programs to support its  foreign market development objectives. FAS\u2019s review of these funding  applications allows it to prevent duplicative programming, according to  FAS officials.

One of the Agricultural Trade Officers whom we interviewed  reported having conducted a workshop that reviewed the UES process  and discussed key definitions and criteria for identifying constraints and  opportunities and for developing performance measures.", "The country progress reports that we reviewed generally complied with  criteria based on selected FAS guidelines for preparing progress reports  and key attributes of successful performance measurement that we had  previously identified. In general, the 56 reports by MAP and FMD  participants that we reviewed met five of six criteria we used for our  analysis. However, 149 of the 373 performance measures in the  sampled reports (40 percent) did not identify the methodologies used to  assess results, as FAS guidelines require. Following are details of our  analysis of the performance measures in the progress reports we  reviewed, using these six criteria.  1.  Constraint or opportunity has at least one outcome measure. For  each constraint or opportunity shown in a progress report, FAS  guidelines require that at least one performance measure be outcome  oriented rather than output oriented. FAS describes an outcome as  showing changed behavior, with an emphasis on what was achieved  and how participant activities have affected attitudes and consumer  habits in the targeted market. In contrast, FAS defines an output as  showing what was done at the activity level (e.g., two seminars  conducted, newsletter sent to 1,000 addressees). The progress  reports that we reviewed used both outcome and output measures to  determine the impact of activities and to address the identified  constraints and opportunities. At least one outcome measure was  associated with 105 of the 115 constraints and opportunities in the  sample (91 percent), and outcome measures constituted 260 of the  378 performance measures (69 percent).   2.  Performance measure is clear. We assessed the clarity of the  performance measures. Specifically, we assessed whether the  measure\u2019s name and definition were clearly stated and consistent with  the numerical goal used to calculate it\u2014a key attribute for successful  performance measures that we previously identified. We found that  356 of the 378 performance measures (94 percent) in the progress  reports that we reviewed met this criterion.   3.  Performance measure is aligned with related constraint or  opportunity. To ensure alignment of performance measures with the  constraints or opportunities they address, FAS guidelines state that  each measure must directly affect the related constraint or  opportunity, must reflect the scope of activity and progress in the  market, and must be within the ability of the participants to influence.  In the progress reports that we reviewed, 330 of the 378 performance  measures (87 percent) were aligned with the related constraint or  opportunity, and 110 of the 118 constraints and opportunities had at  least one aligned performance measure associated with it. However,  58 (13 percent) of the performance measures were not aligned with a  constraint or opportunity, indicating a risk that those participants might  measure incorrectly, or fail to measure, the impact of their activities.   4.  Performance measure is quantifiable. FAS guidelines require that  each performance measure be quantifiable. All 378 (100 percent) of  the measures in the sample of progress reports we reviewed were  quantifiable, with numerical values. When a goal is measurable, FAS  is better able to assess whether the participant\u2019s performance is  meeting expectations.  5.  Performance measure has associated baselines. FAS guidelines  state that each performance measure should have an associated  baseline. We found that 359 of the 375 measures in our sample (96  percent) had associated baselines, indicating that they were based on  an initial market review and that the performance measures were  consistent from year to year. However, we also found that the  baselines did not appear to inform the goals for subsequent years. For  example, one participant had a baseline of 105 buyer/seller  introductions but set a goal of 35 for the following year. The result for  that year\u2014164\u2014not only exceeded the baseline but also exceeded  the goal by more than 468 percent, calling into question whether the  baseline was appropriate for the performance measure.   6.  Performance measure has an identified methodology. FAS  guidelines for reviewing country progress reports state that the reports  must identify the methodologies used to assess results for each  performance measure. The reports that we reviewed identified a  methodology\u2014that is, an information source, an approach for  assessing results, or both\u2014for 224 of the 373 performance measures  (60 percent). For example, one progress report identified \u201cesults  gathered from consumer surveys during in-store promotions\u201d as the  information source and the approach used to assess results of  activities intended to increase consumer awareness. Another report  identified the information source and the approach as \u201c2009 results  based on 334 informal customer surveys conducted throughout the  year\u201d and explained how certain results were averaged to provide  aggregated numbers. For the 149 performance measures with no  identified methodology (40 percent), it would be difficult for FAS to  determine the reliability of the reported results.", "Table 6 summarizes the results of our analysis of the sample of country  progress reports that we reviewed.", "In addition, a comparison of participants\u2019 measurable goals and reported  results in the progress reports that we reviewed showed that those  participants met or exceeded a combined total of 222 of 357 (62 percent)  of their goals. However, the extent to which participants met the goals  varied widely; some participants exceeded a goal by more than 1,000  percent, while others attained less than 10 percent of the goal. FAS  guidance requires that participants monitor their progress relative to their  stated goals but has not established requirements for whether, when, or  how participants should meet their goals. According to FAS officials,  narratives in the progress reports should address whether and why actual  results did or did not meet goals and what changes are needed to  address any disparities. FAS officials noted that if an FAS marketing  specialist reviewing a funding application notices wide discrepancies  between the participant\u2019s goals and results for the previous year, the  specialist will collaborate with the participant to identify lessons that can  be learned and will look for corresponding changes in the participant\u2019s  strategy for the coming year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAS Requires MAP and FMD Participants to Conduct Comprehensive Evaluations When Appropriate", "paragraphs": ["FAS requires that program participants conduct evaluations of their  program activities when appropriate or required by FAS.

In general, the 2007 study assumes that FAS program  expenditures lead to an increase in private-sector expenditures. To  estimate the economic effects of the program assistance, the 2007 study  employed two economic models commonly used in cost-benefit analysis:  (1) A market share model to estimate the effect of expenditures under the  2002 farm bill and the hypothetical 2007 farm bill on the U.S. agricultural  market share of global markets and (2) a spillover effect model to  estimate increases in U.S. agricultural exports due to promotions of other  U.S. exported commodities.

However, the model excludes  some variables that could be important for determining the U.S. market  share\u2014in particular, industry-specific variables such as commodity  prices, production volumes, and number of export competitors. Although  the study states that a linear trend variable is included as a proxy for  missing variables in the model, this variable cannot be expected to  capture the full effects of such industry-specific variables.

The second scenario assumed that FAS would increase program  expenditures and that participants would increase their contributions  gradually, spending 50 percent more by 2012 than in 2007. On the  basis of these assumptions, the study predicted that U.S. exports  would increase from $65 billion in 2006 to about $86 billion in 2015.   3.  The third scenario assumed that FAS would immediately eliminate  program expenditures in 2008 and that, as a result, participants would  spend less of their own resources on market development, gradually  decreasing their spending by 50 percent by 2012 compared with  2007.

Because MAP and FMD receive most of USDA\u2019s market development  funding, we focused our review primarily on program participation in those  two programs.", "For our first and second objectives, we selected five program participants  as case studies: the American Hardwood Export Council, the California  Table Grape Commission, the Wine Institute, Cotton Council  International, and the Western United States Agricultural Trade  Association. To select the four commodity group participants, we  examined market development program expenditure data for 2002  through 2011. We chose participants that used more than one market  development program and had spent a significant amount of their market  development funds in the two countries\u2014Japan and Mexico\u2014that we  selected for our review. The four groups consisted of at least one bulk  commodity group, one nonfood commodity group, and one high-value  commodity group, and one horticultural group. All four were MAP  participants, and two were also FMD participants. In addition, we included  one of four state regional trade groups in our sample, because these  groups allocate the majority of MAP funds to small businesses for  branded product promotion. We reviewed additional documents, including  agreement letters, strategic plans, country progress reports, program  evaluations, and other information provided by FAS and the participants.  We also interviewed U.S.-based headquarters staff from each of the five  organizations. Additionally, we conducted fieldwork in Japan and Mexico,  interviewing FAS staff in the Agricultural Trade Offices in Tokyo, Osaka,  and Mexico City, as well as representatives of program participants in  each country. We also observed several trade promotion activities and  visited retailers where U.S. products were sold. We selected Japan and  Mexico because they are in different geographic regions and are among  the countries where program participants have spent the largest shares of  USDA market development funds. In addition, for all of three of our  objectives, we interviewed FAS staff in headquarters, contractors that  FAS uses for aspects of its market promotion programs, and subject  matter experts in the field of trade economics. We also reviewed relevant  laws, regulations, and FAS guidelines.", "To describe agricultural groups\u2019 participation in FAS\u2019s five market  development programs and the programs\u2019 expenditures from 2002  through 2011\u2014our first objective\u2014we reviewed program participants\u2019  applications, country progress reports, and program evaluations to  identify examples of the activities that participants undertook with market  development funding. We also analyzed expenditure data for the five  programs from 2002 through 2011 to understand the nature of program  participation and to identify program participants with the largest  expenditures as well as changes in participants\u2019 expenditures. We  reviewed MAP and FMD expenditure data by country to determine where  participants spent the largest amounts of program funding. Further, we  compared participants\u2019 matching contributions with their expenditure  levels to determine whether participants were meeting program cost- sharing requirements. In addition, we reviewed expenditure data for the  MAP branded products program for 2002 through 2011 to determine the  scope of the branded products program, including the number of small  businesses participating and the number affected by the 5-year  graduation requirement. To assess the reliability of market development  program expenditure and contribution data that FAS provided, we  conducted electronic and manual data testing and held interviews with  knowledgeable USDA staff members. On the basis of our assessment of  the data and our interviews with the staff members, the data appear to be  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To examine FAS\u2019s management and monitoring of the market  development programs\u2014part of our second objective\u2014we discussed  management practices and the use of the Unified Export Strategy (UES)  system, which participants use to apply for multiple programs to reduce  risks of overlap and duplication among the five programs with FAS  officials. We also met with FAS\u2019s Compliance Review Branch to review  FAS\u2019s process for verifying participants\u2019 expenditures and contributions  for all programs in which they participated. In addition, to verify that small  businesses participating in the MAP branded products program did not  receive MAP funds from more than one MAP participant for promotion in  the same country, we reviewed expenditure data for the MAP branded  products program for 2011.  We examined all businesses that had spent  MAP funds, the countries where they spent the funds, and the MAP  participants that allocated these funds to the businesses through the  branded products program. We identified, and reviewed with FAS, any  instances in which a business may have spent in a single country funds  received from two MAP participants.", "To determine whether MAP and FMD participants were assessing results  in accordance with FAS performance monitoring guidelines\u2014also part of  our second objective\u2014we developed an assessment tool to analyze a  sample of participants\u2019 annual country progress reports. We selected a  random but nongeneralizable sample of 20 participants in MAP and FMD,  and we identified countries where these participants spent more than  $5,000 in 3 consecutive fiscal years, 2008 through 2010. We requested  the country progress reports for all 20 participants for each of the 3  years\u2014a total of 60 progress reports. After requesting the 60 reports, we  removed four groups on being informed that those groups use other  forms of reporting; we also removed two state regional trade groups. After  we requested additional randomly selected progress reports, our final  sample totaled 56 reports. Where progress reports covered a region  rather than a specific country, we used regional data and country-specific  data as available. We selected criteria, based on FAS guidelines for  developing the progress reports and key attributes of successful  performance measurement that we previously identified, to assess  constraints and performance measures in the reports that we reviewed.  These criteria are as follows: (1) each constraint has at least one  outcome measure; (2) the performance measure is clear; (3) the  performance measure is aligned with the related constraint or opportunity;  (4) the performance measure is quantifiable; (5) the performance  measure has an associated baseline; and (6) the performance measure  has an identified methodology. We also compared the goals and results  reported for each performance measure to determine the extent to which  the goals were met and the results were reported. We recorded each  constraint and performance measure from the country progress reports  we reviewed, and two reviewers coded separate analyses for each  criterion. The two analyses were then reconciled to produce a final result.  In addition, we requested from FAS all third-party program evaluations  associated with our random sample of participants and countries in the 3- year timeframe. FAS informed us that the evaluations were too difficult to  identify using these parameters and provided a list of 71 evaluations that  43 participants, including 13 of those in our sample, submitted in 2010  and 2011. We did not assess the quality of the evaluations, because such  an assessment was beyond the scope of this engagement.", "To assess FAS\u2019s cost-benefit analysis of MAP\u2019s and FMD\u2019s impact on the  U.S. economy\u2014our third objective\u2014we analyzed studies of MAP and  FMD commissioned by FAS and published in 2007 and 2010,  respectively, by Global Insight, Inc. We conducted structured interviews  with the studies\u2019 authors, agency officials, and academics involved in the  studies. We also reviewed relevant research on market development  programs. In addition, we reviewed Office of Management and Budget  guidelines for conducting cost-benefit analyses and interviewed office  officials. We evaluated the studies on the basis of GAO\u2019s cost estimation  guide, prior related GAO work, and internal expertise.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 to July 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Because of uncertainty about annual U.S.  government allocations of market development funding, private-sector  participants tend to develop short-term (i.e., 1 year) plans that do not  take into account the long-term effects of market development. For  example, market development expenditures for high-value and bulk  commodities have a lagged impact of 7 and 3 years, respectively, so  that expenditures in a single year accrue benefits over several years.  As a result, private-sector participants tend to underfund market  development activities relative to the socially optimal level.", "Spillover effect. Market development for one commodity may also  increase demand for other commodities\u2014a result known as a  spillover effect. For example, almond promotions increase grape  exports (but not vice versa). Unless such commodities are \u201cco- branded\u201d and marketed together, exporters do not see the spillover  effect as a promotion incentive and thus tend to underpromote their  own products compared with socially optimal levels.", "Indirect effect. Related to the first two sources of market failure, less  than optimal amounts of promotion, and therefore of exports, will  lead\u2014in what is known as the indirect effect\u2014to less than socially  optimal operating levels in other segments of the farm economy and  the general economy.

A computable general equilibrium model  is a mathematical expression where all economic relationships are  modeled simultaneously. For example, the price of a good depends on  the price of all other input goods, profits, and wages, and vice versa,  assuming full employment in the economy.
