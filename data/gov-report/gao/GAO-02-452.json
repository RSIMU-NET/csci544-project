The number of spare parts the military services ordered declined between 1996 and 2000, but the dollar value increased by 18 percent. Further, spare parts purchased were drawn from 70 of 78 stock groups. Defense officials told GAO that military downsizing was the primary reason for the decline and that credit card usage and contractor maintenance support also contributed.

In response, the Congress provided at least $1.1 billion in additional funding earmarked to purchase spare parts. However, as of September 2001, the department continued to report a shortage of spare parts. According to the department, shortages are a result of aging systems and high operational tempo, which increase the total number of spare parts required.", "You asked us to provide information on the spare parts the military services buy from the Defense Logistics Agency, a defense organization that supplies some spare parts to the services. In response, we are issuing this report to present available trend information on the quantities, reported dollar value, and types of spare parts that each military service ordered and reported as shipped from the Defense Logistics Agency over the past 5 years. We are also issuing similar information specifically on aviation-related spare parts because the services have highlighted a shortage of these as a particular readiness concern. This report is one in a series that deals with concerns you have raised about shortages of spare parts.", "It is important to note that the results presented in this report are based on unaudited data supplied by the Defense Logistics Agency and that our financial statement audit work has repeatedly shown that the Department of Defense\u2019s financial data and underlying inventory records are generally not reliable. However, it is the only data readily available. Also, because millions of individual federal stock numbers are used to identify types of parts/stocks, we consolidated data for this report by year, service, agency supply center, federal stock group, or federal stock class. Lastly, in a separate recent report, we assessed the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s efforts to control spare part price increases."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Spare parts are defined as repair parts and components, including kits, assemblies, and subassemblies required for the maintenance of all equipment. Repair parts and components can include (1) reparable items, which are returned to the supply system to be repaired when they are no longer in working condition, and (2) nonreparable items, also called consumables, which are often used in repairing the reparable items because they cannot be economically repaired themselves. For example, a screw (a consumable) may be used in repairing a landing gear component (a reparable).", "The Defense Logistics Agency, headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, provides consumable supplies and spare parts to the military services, the Department of Defense, federal civilian agencies, and selected foreign governments. As part of its mission, the agency manages over 4.1 million consumable items. The vast majority of these items are considered consumable spare parts, and the remaining items include medicine, food, clothing, and fuel. Spare parts managed by the agency range from low-cost, commonly used items, such as fasteners and gaskets, to high-priced, sophisticated items, such as microswitches, miniature components, and precision valves vital to operating major weapon systems.", "The agency\u2019s supply management operations are funded through the Defense-Wide Working Capital Fund, which operates as a revolving fund. The agency buys and sells spare parts to customers, who use appropriated funds to pay the agency.  Sales receipts are then used to purchase additional items to meet new customer demand. In principle, the agency should recover the acquisition cost of the spare parts it sells, as well as its own operating costs, so that over the long term the fund breaks even financially.", "The Defense Supply Center in Richmond, Virginia, is designated as the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s lead center for air/aviation systems.

However, the dollar value of spare parts obtained during the same period increased from $3.9 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $4.6 billion in fiscal year 2000 (about 18 percent). Electrical and electronic equipment components accounted for the highest proportion of total dollar value. The services acquired spare parts from 70 of the 78 federal stock groups. In commenting on a draft of this report, the department attributed the increased dollar value of sales to the increased value of items managed by the Defense Logistics Agency. This is clearly a contributing factor. However, at the same time as we recently reported, the Defense Logistics Agency has a number of actions underway to control spare part prices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Number of Spare Parts Supplied to Military Services Declined", "paragraphs": ["Defense Logistics Agency data indicates that every year from 1996 to 2000, the agency supplied the services with smaller quantities of spare parts, from a total of about 353 million in fiscal year 1996 to about 270 million in fiscal year 2000, a decrease of about 24 percent (see fig. 1). The number of spare parts the services ordered also decreased about 19 percent during the period, from about 348 million to about 283 million.", "Defense Logistics Agency officials cited three main reasons for the decline: increased credit card usage, increased contractor maintenance support, and\u2014primarily\u2014military downsizing.  The downsizing, which began in the early 1990s, continued through 2000. According to defense figures, the total number of active duty Navy fighter and attack aircraft declined from 504 in fiscal year 1996 to 432 in fiscal year 2000.

During this time, the Air Force increased the percentage of depot maintenance repair workload performed by the private sector.  The other services also increased private sector depot maintenance performance, but to a lesser extent than the Air Force.", "Figure 3 shows that in fiscal year 1996, the Defense Logistics Agency sold the Army about 96 million spare parts, but by fiscal year 2000, that number had dropped to about 78 million, a decline of 18 million, or 19 percent.", "Figure 4 indicates that in fiscal year 1996, the Navy obtained about 110 million spare parts from the Defense Logistics Agency, but in fiscal year 2000 it bought only about 72 million spare parts, a decrease of about 38 million, or 35 percent.", "As shown in figure 5, the Marine Corps purchased about 6 million spare parts from the agency in fiscal year 2000, about 45 percent less than the approximately 11 million it had purchased in fiscal year 1996."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reported Dollar Value of Defense Logistics Agency Part Sales Increased", "paragraphs": ["The reported dollar value of the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s annual sale of spare parts to the services rose about 18 percent over the past 5 years, increasing from about $3.9 billion in fiscal year 1996 to about $4.6 billion in fiscal year 2000. The dollar value of ordered spare parts increased from about $3.9 billion to about $5.2 billion (about 25 percent). The reasons cited for the dollar value increase were (1) Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s shift to a mix of more expensive spare parts and (2) price increases due to inaccurate initial price estimates, long periods between procurements, and/or substantial changes in the quantity of spare parts purchased. When disaggregated by service, the agency\u2019s data indicates some variation in this trend. The dollar value of sales to the Air Force increased every year, while the annual sale value of spare parts to the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps fluctuated. Table 1 shows the overall increase as well as the annual fluctuations.", "During the 1996-2000 period, the Department of Defense transferred the management of more costly, complex, and sophisticated spare parts to the Defense Logistics Agency.  Department officials indicated that the dollar value of the items transferred was significantly higher than the items being managed by the Defense Logistics Agency until that time. The items transferred from the services represented a higher percentage of the total inventory held by the agency, therefore contributing to the higher dollar value of spare parts sold to the services. Table 2 shows the average prices of the spare parts transferred as compared to those for spare parts not transferred and the prices for all spare parts sold to the services.  The table also indicates the percentages of the total inventory that consisted of transferred spare parts during the 1996-2000 period.", "Although the price of some spare parts has increased significantly, for most spare parts it has not. In November 2000, we reported that prices of about 70 percent of spare parts requisitioned by the agency\u2019s customers increased less than 5 percent a year during the 1989-98 period. This trend applied to all requisitioned spare parts, including those in frequent demand and aircraft-related spare parts. However, the prices of a relatively small number of spare parts did increase significantly\u2014by 50 percent or more.", "The spare part prices increased for a number of reasons. The majority of the agency\u2019s weapon system spare parts experienced a relatively low annual price change\u2014less than 5 percent\u2014from fiscal years 1989 through 1998. Most of the extreme price increases were due to inaccurate price estimates, outdated prices, or changes in quantities purchased. In other cases, prices increased significantly when long time periods\u2014sometimes decades\u2014passed between procurements. Agency purchasing officials cited other factors that can lead to price increases, including retooling of production lines between purchases, emergency procurements, and increases in the costs of raw materials. An Air Force official said that new technology also increased the cost as older aircraft were retrofitted with a new mix of more expensive spare parts to add capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Spare Parts the Services Acquired from Defense Logistics Agency", "paragraphs": ["The services obtained spare parts from 70 of 78 federal stock groups over the past 5 years.

Officials stated that the increases were caused in part by the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s shift to a mix of more expensive spare parts and increases in the price of aviation spare parts. Because our review covered only classes of spare parts, not individual items, we did not determine the extent to which the agency had changed the prices of individual spare parts.
