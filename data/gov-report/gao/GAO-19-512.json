As shown in the figure, however, the Navy has requested funding for the FFG(X) lead ship even though it has yet to complete key cost estimation activites, such as an independent cost estimate, to validate the credibility of cost expectations. Department of Defense (DOD) cost estimators told GAO the timeline for completing the independent cost estimate is uncertain.

However, Navy officials discounted the potential use of a warranty\u2014another mechanism to address the correction of shipbuilder defects\u2014stating that their use could negatively affect shipbuilding cost and reduce competition for the contract award. The Navy provided no analysis to support these claims and has not demonstrated why the use of warranties is not a viable option. The Navy's planned use of guarantees helps ensure the FFG(X) shipbuilder is responsible for correcting defects up to a point, but guarantees generally do not provide the same level of coverage as warranties. GAO found in March 2016 that the use of a guaranty did not help improve cost or quality outcomes for the ships reviewed. GAO also found the use of a warranty in commercial shipbuilding and certain Coast Guard ships improves cost and quality outcomes by requiring the shipbuilders to pay to repair defects.

As we found in  multiple reports, the Navy\u2019s vision for LCS evolved significantly over time  in response to diminished capability expectations and significant cost and  schedule growth. In 2014, the Secretary of Defense directed the Navy to  evaluate alternatives to LCS, citing survivability and lethality concerns.

To  execute shipbuilding acquisition programs, the Navy uses the acquisition  processes included in the DOD Instruction 5000 series, as well as  acquisition instructions established by the Secretary of the Navy.

Specifically, industry officials noted that  communication and activities during conceptual design improved their  understanding of the impetus for specific Navy requirements, allowing  industry the opportunity to get clarification on the intent of some  requirements, propose less costly alternatives, and get government  feedback on the proposed alternatives. It also improved their  understanding of the linkages between FFG(X)\u2019s approved capability  requirements and system specifications. In particular, industry officials  told us that one-on-one opportunities with the Navy aided knowledge  sharing and provided them with a means to ask questions without  concern that disclosing such information could jeopardize their  competitive position. They emphasized that in other cases where the  request for proposals process is their primary means for communicating  with the Navy (as opposed to having a conceptual design phase),  submitting questions about requirements or system specifications can be  challenging because those inquiries are available to the public.

They added that the parent designs provided a higher- fidelity design baseline from which the conceptual design industry teams  incorporated Navy systems and other requirements. Use of parent  designs is consistent with our best practices work in shipbuilding, which  has found that commercial shipbuilders use previous ship designs to the  extent possible. Doing so can reduce technical, schedule, and cost risk  in building a ship as compared to a \u201cclean sheet\u201d new ship design.

The use of competition in contracting is a critical tool for achieving the  best possible return on investment for taxpayers. Competitively awarded  contracts can save the taxpayer money, improve contractor performance,  and promote accountability for results. The fixed-price incentive  contracting approach for FFG(X) is intended to incentivize the contractor  to control costs and meet performance requirements. This contracting  strategy represents a significant departure from previous surface  combatant programs in which the Navy negotiated cost-reimbursement  contracts for construction of the lead ship. Under cost-reimbursement  contracts, the Navy assumes the cost risk because the shipbuilder is  reimbursed for its allowable incurred costs to the extent prescribed in the  contract, regardless of whether the work is performed to the exact level  desired by the Navy.

Fixed-price incentive contracts  generally include a profit adjustment formula referred to as a shareline, as  well as a price ceiling, target cost, and target profit. The structure of the  shareline establishes how cost overruns or underruns in relation to a  target cost are shared between the government and shipbuilder. For  example, the 70/30 shareline that the Navy is planning for FFG(X) lead  ship overruns means that the government pays 70 percent of cost and the  shipbuilder pays 30 percent when the cost exceeds the target cost up to  the price ceiling. Generally, the shareline functions to decrease the  shipbuilder\u2019s profit as actual costs exceed the target cost. The price  ceiling is generally the maximum the government will pay under the  contract and is typically negotiated as a percentage of the target cost.  The target cost generally informs the shareline and price ceiling.", "Given the unknowns associated with design and construction, the Navy  plans to account for these unresolved risks by assuming responsibility for  cost growth above DOD recommended guidance. As we reported in  March 2017, when the Navy assumes a greater share of cost overruns  above the target cost, accepts a higher price ceiling, or both, the fixed- price incentive elements may not provide sufficient motivation for the  shipbuilders to control costs. Figure 8 depicts the how risk changes as  the Navy departs from a 50/50 shareline for cost overruns and a ceiling  price of 120 percent.", "As we previously noted, for the FFG(X) lead ship the Navy is planning to  have a shareline of 70/30 for target cost overruns.

Based on this plan, the first  two FFG(X) ships will depart from DOD\u2019s guidance recommending a  50/50 point of departure for negotiations between the government and  shipbuilder for cost overruns up to the price ceiling. This results in more  cost risk to the government for two ships in the detail design and  construction contract. The Navy\u2019s planned price ceiling for the 10 ships  included in the contract award may deviate from DOD\u2019s guidance  recommending a ceiling price set at 120 percent of target cost as a point  of departure for fixed price incentive contracts. Specifically, Navy  officials stated that the maximum ceiling price could be as high as 125  percent for all of the ships. However, Navy officials stated that the request  for proposal will provide incentive for industry to propose the minimum  price ceiling that sufficiently accounts for the proposal\u2019s level of risk,  meaning that industry may propose price ceilings below 125 percent.

During the guaranty period, the shipbuilder would be required to  correct all defects for which it is responsible, with proposals required to  include a minimum limitation of liability of $5 million per ship.

We also found that commercial ship buyers and Coast Guard  officials stated that warranties foster quality performance because the  shipbuilder\u2019s profit erodes as it spends money to correct deficiencies after  delivery, during the warranty period. We further reported that the Coast  Guard has improved cost and quality by requiring the shipbuilder to pay to  repair defects by following Federal Acquisition Regulation warranty  provisions. For example, the Coast Guard paid up front for the Fast  Response Cutter warranty. The cost of the warranty amounted to 41  percent of the total defect correction costs. Although this ship does not  have the size and advanced systems planned for FFG(X), it serves to  demonstrate the potential value to the government presented by the use  of warranties. The Coast Guard also used a fixed-price incentive contract  with a warranty on its Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2014a ship of comparable size  to FFG(X). The first Offshore Patrol Cutter has a 2-year warranty, and  follow-on ships will have 1-year warranties. The Coast Guard pays a set  amount for these warranties, and in return, the shipbuilder must fix all  applicable defects identified within the agreed-upon time period  regardless of cost.", "Rather than using guarantees for the FFG(X) contract to provide for the  correction of defects, the Navy could help control costs to the government  through the use of warranties. Under warranties, the government  generally receives a contractual right for the correction of all defects for  which the shipbuilder is responsible at the shipbuilder\u2019s expense. The  use of warranties is typically not mandatory, but federal and defense  acquisition regulations instruct contracting officers to consider various  factors when deciding whether a warranty is appropriate for an  acquisition. The regulations also instruct contracting officers to use a  warranty when it is practicable and cost-effective to do so. We  previously found that, unlike a warranty, the Navy almost exclusively paid  for defects that were the shipbuilder\u2019s responsibility under a guaranty  because of the contract type and terms in contracts that we reviewed.  Such conditions limit the incentive to discover every deficiency during the  guaranty period, and may negatively affect quality improvements over  time.", "The Navy\u2019s FFG(X) plans suggest that the Navy may be prematurely  discounting warrantees as a mechanism to improve ship quality and  decrease cost to the government. Navy officials told us that mandating  that industry propose a warranty could result in additional costs to the  government because the initial cost of the ship could be raised  substantially to include the cost of the warranty. Additionally, Navy  officials said a requirement for warranty pricing could serve to limit  industry participation in the FFG(X) competition if offerors are unwilling to  accept the risk associated with a warranty and unable to provide  reasonable pricing. The Navy provided no analysis to support these  claims and confirm a clear understanding of whether a warranty could  provide greater value than the $5 million guaranty the Navy is proposing  for FFG(X).", "As part of the competitive proposal process for FFG(X) detail design and  construction, the Navy could maintain its plans to require a guaranty but  also seek ship warranty pricing. The full and open competition for the  FFG(X) contract award may increase the potential for receiving warranty  pricing that provides a cost-effective alternative to the Navy\u2019s guaranty  plans.

As a result, we maintain our belief  that the FFG(X) program office should implement this recommendation by  seeking warranty pricing as part of the detail design and construction  request for proposals. The full and open competition for the FFG(X)  contract award may increase the potential for receiving warranty pricing  that provides a cost-effective alternative to the Navy\u2019s guaranty plans.", "DOD stated that modifying the solicitation to incorporate a warranty  pricing component would cause an unacceptable delay to the FFG(X)  program, but did not provide an analysis to support this assertion or  specify the extent of delay associated with adding a warranty pricing  request. The current FFG(X) schedule has roughly 10 months between  the request for proposals deadline and the contract award, and the  program originally had been planning for the solicitation period to end in  December 2019 before moving the deadline to September 2019 shortly  before its release. We recognize the substantial effort the proposal  development and review process requires, but we continue to believe that  the government would benefit from adding a request for warranty pricing  to the detail design and construction solicitation. While DOD stated that  the Navy will support the recommendation after award by requesting  pricing for an unlimited warranty before exercising the first ship option,  doing so would eliminate any potential warranty pricing advantages that  would occur as a result of the competitive conditions that currently exist  for the current detail design and construction contract.", "In addition to DOD\u2019s written response to the report, DOD officials and  industry representatives associated with the FFG(X) conceptual design  activities provided separate technical comments, which we incorporated  as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Navy.
