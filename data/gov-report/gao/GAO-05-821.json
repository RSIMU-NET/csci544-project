For example, 5 of the 10 states we reviewed considered caring for a disabled household or family member to count toward the federal work participation requirement, while 5 did not consider hours spent in this activity to be countable. We also found that some states made significant changes in their definitions of the categories of work. As a result, the work participation rates for these states cannot be compared from year to year. Some of the states in our review have implemented internal controls to help report work participation hours in accordance with HHS guidance, while other states lack such internal controls. Some states have not issued guidance on how to verify that reported hours were actually worked, nor do they monitor data reported by their staff to help ensure that hours are reported correctly. In contrast, a few states have systematic approaches for verifying that hours reported were worked. HHS has provided limited oversight and guidance to states on appropriately defining work activities and reporting hours of work participation. According to HHS officials, HHS has the authority to regulate states' definitions of work activities. However, to promote state flexibility, HHS chose not to issue regulations for this purpose. Further, HHS's guidance lacks specific criteria for determining the appropriate hours to report. Given that HHS has not exercised oversight of states' definitions and internal controls, states are making different decisions about what to measure. Therefore, there is no standard basis for interpreting states' rates, and the rates cannot effectively be used to assess and compare states' performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2004, states spent $26 billion from the federal Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant and related state funds  to assist low-income parents and their children. The federal welfare  reform law\u2014the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity  Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA)\u2014that created the TANF block grant  included the expectation that welfare recipients would participate in work  activities. The law outlined 12 categories of work activities, such as  \u201cunsubsidized employment\u201d and \u201ccommunity service programs,\u201d in which  recipients could participate to meet federal TANF requirements. Under the  law, states have significant flexibility in designing their TANF programs,  such as flexibility in defining specific activities to fall under the 12  categories of work activities outlined in the law. Along with providing this  flexibility, PRWORA required states to collect and report a specified set of  data to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including  data on hours recipients spent in work activities. PRWORA also created a  performance measure called the TANF work participation rate for  determining the extent to which a state\u2019s TANF families were engaged in  work activities during the year. The 2003 work participation rates  calculated for the 50 states based on the data they submitted to HHS  ranged from 9 to 88 percent. HHS is responsible for reporting these rates  to Congress and for using them to identify states that are not meeting the  required level of work participation for their TANF recipients and, thus,  may be subject to penalties. Given the importance of the work  participation rates, they need to provide a consistent measure of work  participation across states.  Without a consistent measure, there will be no  standard basis for interpreting each state\u2019s rate or for comparing the  performance of states.", "A key issue in the debate over TANF reauthorization has been whether to  change work requirements, such as by requiring additional hours of work  and allowing more types of work activities to be counted. For example, a  Senate bill proposed adding substance abuse treatment and caring for a  disabled family member to the list of activities that can be counted as  work participation. Another issue in reauthorization has been how to  revise the caseload reduction credit, which uses levels of TANF caseload  declines to reduce the work participation rates states must have in order  to avoid penalty. Because of significant declines in TANF caseloads  following TANF implementation, the caseload reduction credit enabled  many states to have very low work participation rates and still meet their  required levels of work participation. Revisions in the caseload reduction  credit could raise the required level of work participation for many states  and may result in more states being penalized for not having high enough  work participation rates. In considering welfare reauthorization, Congress  has focused much attention on states\u2019 current work participation rates. To  help you understand these rates, we looked at (1) how selected states are  defining the work activities that count toward meeting federal work  participation requirements, (2) whether selected states have implemented  internal controls to help ensure that the work participation data they  report are in accordance with HHS guidance, and (3) what guidance and  oversight HHS has provided states regarding appropriately defining work  activities and reporting hours of work participation.", "Our review focused on HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families  (ACF), which administers the TANF block grant, and 10 selected states-\u2013  California, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin. In 2003, the 10 states made up  46 percent of the national TANF caseload. We selected these states to  represent a mix of TANF 2003 work participation rates, according to data  reported by states to ACF. (These rates are shown in app. IV.)  Specifically, we selected the 3 states with the lowest rates (9 percent to 11  percent), 3 states with some of the highest rates (62 percent to 88  percent), and 4 states with rates in the middle range (22 percent to 46  percent). We also selected states to represent a variety of other  characteristics, such as geographic location, benefit policies, and use of  waivers that exempt the state from certain TANF requirements.  We used a  semistructured interview protocol in conducting telephone interviews  with the 10 selected states\u2019 TANF officials.", "To learn how selected states are defining the work activities that count  toward meeting federal work participation requirements, we interviewed  the 10 selected states\u2019 TANF officials about activities they count in work  participation data. We also reviewed state documents, such as annual  TANF reports and TANF manuals that show how states define the 12  federal categories of work activities and how they classify recipients.

For example, states have flexibility in setting benefit levels, eligibility  requirements, work requirements, and policies for sanctioning  noncompliant recipients (that is, reducing or discontinuing their benefits).  Due to this flexibility, TANF programs differ substantially from state to  state. These different state policies can affect the extent to which a state\u2019s  TANF recipients participate in work activities and the type of work  activities they engage in. States also have flexibility in using TANF block  grant funds and in using state funds\u2014referred to as maintenance-of-effort  (MOE) funds\u2014that states were required to use toward TANF purposes in  order to qualify for the block grant. For example, if states want to  exclusively use MOE funds for a particular group of welfare recipients,  such as those in two-parent families, they can use these funds through  separate state programs (SSPs) for those recipients and remove them from  the TANF requirements.", "Due to the importance of state flexibility under TANF, PRWORA limited  HHS\u2019s authority to regulate state TANF programs.  PRWORA also  substantially reduced HHS staff available to implement TANF.  However,  PRWORA established penalties for states, such as for not meeting required  levels of work participation, and HHS has authority to regulate in  situations where penalties are involved. TANF has two work participation  rates\u2014one that applies to all adult-headed families and another that  applies to two-parent families. A certain percentage of each state\u2019s adult- headed TANF cases receiving cash assistance must participate in work- related activities for a minimum number of hours each week or the state  may face financial penalty. The categories of work activities that can be  counted for the purpose of the performance measure are outlined in TANF  law and regulations. If TANF recipients engage in other activities provided  or permitted under the state\u2019s TANF program, then those activities do not  count toward meeting the federal work participation requirements.  Further, if TANF recipients engage in work activities for less than the  minimum required number of hours, then those recipients do not count as  being engaged in work for purposes of the performance measure.", "When a state does not meet its required level of work participation, HHS  will send the state a penalty notice. The state then has the opportunity to  avoid a penalty by providing reasonable cause why it did not meet the  work participation rate or by submitting a corrective compliance plan that  will correct the violation and ensure continued compliance with work  participation requirements.  Since implementation of TANF, numerous  states have received penalty notices from HHS for not meeting the  required level of work participation. However, most of these states have  avoided penalties by submitting corrective compliance plans. As of  February 2005, 11 states and the District of Columbia had paid penalties  for not meeting the two-parent work participation rate. Most of these  penalties were for the first 4 years (fiscal years 1997-2000) of TANF  implementation, and 5 states and the District of Columbia have paid  penalties for more than 1 year.", "Each quarter, states are required to report to ACF monthly data on their  TANF cases, including the number of hours each adult recipient spent in  activities that count toward meeting federal work requirements.

This state had a  waiver exempting it from the 6-week limit for counting hours recipients  spent in Job Search/Job Readiness activities. For states with waivers, the  effective work participation rate is calculated based on the conditions of  the waiver. However, ACF also calculates a without-waiver rate for states  with waivers. After the state lost its waiver, it redefined some of its  categories of work by placing activities previously in the Job Search/Job  Readiness category (the category that had been covered by the waiver)  into other categories that do not have time restrictions, such as  Community Service.

ACF notifies states of any problems identified  by the edit checks so that states can correct and resubmit the data. The  edit checks can help improve the data; however, they do not address the  issue of verifying whether hours reported are actual hours of participation.", "State single audits. According to ACF officials, HHS\u2019s primary vehicle  for identifying problems with the states\u2019 data is states\u2019 single audit reports.  Findings from the state single audits go through a review process at HHS  to determine whether penalties are warranted. HHS has used findings from  the single audit to take action against a state for reporting poor quality  work participation data. However, ACF officials acknowledged that the  work participation data reported by states may have problems that the  single audits may not reveal. Our interviews with auditors in the 10 states  we reviewed indicate that the level of attention given to work participation  data varies greatly among the states.", "State auditors from 5 states (California, Georgia, Maryland, Nevada, and  Ohio) told us that their most recent single audits covering the TANF  program did not review the data states report to HHS on hours of  participation in work activities.", "Out of the 5 states in which state auditors reported that the most recent  single audits did test hours of work participation:   Three states (Kansas, Washington, and Wisconsin) reported that the  audits did not look for support of actual hours but instead compared  hours shown in the state\u2019s welfare database with the hours reported to  HHS for a sample of cases. State auditors for the 3 states did not report  any findings on work participation data from these reviews.", "Two states (New York and Pennsylvania) looked for supporting  documentation to verify that hours reported to ACF were hours of  actual participation for a sample of cases. In New York, the audit had  no finding regarding work participation hours.  The audit for  Pennsylvania found that some reported hours had no supporting  documentation to verify that they were actually worked. According to  state officials, Pennsylvania has implemented corrective actions in  response to the single audit findings.", "Our review of the 10 states\u2019 internal controls identified weaknesses both in  states where state auditors told us that the most recent single audit did not  test the data reported to HHS on hours of participation in work activities  and in states that did. ACF officials acknowledged that because of the  broad nature of the single audits, the quality and focus of the audits vary  from state to state. The single audit, covering hundreds of federal  programs, is designed as a tool that raises relevant questions about states\u2019  internal controls and compliance with laws and regulations governing  federal awards but is not intended to answer all questions. State auditors  responsible for conducting the single audits are provided with federal  guidance issued by OMB\u2014known as the Compliance Supplement.  Currently the Compliance Supplement contains reference to work  participation data only as a key line item for auditors to look at in the  TANF data report. According to ACF officials, the fiscal year 2005  Compliance Supplement for the single audit will contain more guidance to  help auditors identify whether work participation data are reported in  accordance with HHS guidance. The addition to the Compliance  Supplement will suggest that state auditors test a sample of cases to  determine the completeness and accuracy of the data, including the proper  documentation, used in calculating the work participation rate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["By listing 12 categories of permissible work activities, Congress placed  limits on the type of activities that states could count toward meeting  federal work participation requirements. HHS regulations only restate the  12 categories of work activities and do not further specify the types of  activities that can and cannot count toward meeting the federal work  requirements, nor do they provide for HHS\u2019s oversight of states\u2019 definitions  of the 12 categories. HHS has taken the position that with the current  limited regulations, it will not place restrictions on the activities states can  count toward meeting TANF work requirements.  As a result, states have  been able to include any activity in their definitions of the 12 categories of  work. Several states have broadly defined 1 or more of the categories to  include activities, such as substance abuse treatment, that other states  provide but do not consider countable toward meeting the federal work  participation requirement. Another discrepancy among states occurs with  the internal controls over the data they report to HHS. For example, some  states only report hours that have been verified as having been actually  worked, while others report hours without verification. Because of the  differences among states in the activities that they count in calculating the  work participation rate and in the internal controls over the data used in  the calculation, states are being measured by different standards, and the  work participation rates cannot be used to compare the performance of  states. Further, a high work participation rate does not necessarily  indicate more engagement of TANF recipients in work activities than a  lower rate.", "The current caseload reduction credit has greatly reduced the required  level of work participation for most states. However, if TANF  reauthorization results in lowering the caseload reduction credit and  raising the work participation requirements, more states could be  penalized, and states with strict definitions and effective internal controls  may be the most susceptible to penalties. If the TANF work participation  rate is to be an effective and equitable measure for assessing states\u2019  performance and penalizing states, HHS needs to give more oversight to  states\u2019 definitions of federal work activities and internal controls over the  data to help make the measure more consistent across states. We  acknowledge that efforts to obtain more valid, accurate, and consistent  information for this performance measure may have unintended  consequences. For example, it may motivate states to use separate state  programs or make other choices about the design of their TANF programs.   However, a measure that is used to assess penalties needs to be clear and  consistent for all those potentially subject to penalty; otherwise, the  measure can result in misleading information and inequitable penalty  assessments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["HHS should issue regulations to    specify the types of activities that can and cannot be included under  the 12 categories of work activities,    have HHS oversee states\u2019 definitions of activities under the 12    set forth criteria for counting actual hours of activity and whether there  are circumstances under which scheduled hours may be counted.", "We also recommend that HHS develop and implement a plan for working  with states to improve internal controls over work participation data.  This  plan could make use of existing resources and include steps such as   working through its regional offices to identify cost-effective internal  controls being used by states,    using regional offices and existing sponsored conferences to share  information with states on these internal controls and to emphasize  the importance of internal controls, and    obtaining information from states about their experiences using the  National Directory of New Hires to determine if it has potential for  helping states collect more complete work participation data and if  there are any useful practices to be shared with other states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HHS provided written comments on a draft of this report; these comments  appear in appendix V.

HHS  also provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "Concerning our recommendation that HHS issue regulations to provide  oversight of states\u2019 definition and more guidance on counting hours of  work activities, HHS said that it will consider this recommendation when  it develops the proposed rule after Congress enacts legislation to  reauthorize the TANF program. We agree that addressing this  recommendation during rule making after TANF reauthorization is  appropriate, if TANF is reauthorized in the near future. However, TANF  reauthorization has been delayed for 3 years and if it is delayed for much  longer, HHS should take action to revise TANF regulations without waiting  for reauthorization. Concerning our recommendation that HHS develop  and implement a plan for working with states to improve internal controls  over the work participation data, HHS said it recognized that more can be  done to ensure increased consistency in the accuracy of the work  participation data. HHS also stated that ACF is exploring options to  increase oversight and provide technical assistance to states using its  currently limited resources. Further, HHS noted that federal staff for  TANF had been reduced by 75 percent several years ago. We added a  statement about this staff reduction to the background section of the  report.", "HHS expressed concern that the draft report did not sufficiently recognize  the flexibility that Congress intended for the TANF program, and it stated  that Congress did not intend that there be a consistent measure of work  participation across states or that HHS make state-by-state comparisons  for penalty purposes. We believe that the report does recognize the  flexibility Congress provided to states. Also, we believe that the fact that  Congress gave states the flexibility to design their TANF programs does  not indicate that Congress did not want a meaningful measure to  determine if states are meeting TANF requirements. While states have  flexibility in determining what policies they will use to achieve TANF goals  and requirements, the measure used to assess their performance should be  defined the same way from state to state; otherwise, the rates produced by  the measure cannot provide meaningful and understandable information  for national policy makers and for assessing financial penalties. Further,  although the use of waivers and separate state programs contributes to  differences in which families are included in the work participation rate,  HHS has made efforts, through its annual reporting, to ensure  transparency about the rules governing these mechanisms and which  states are using them. The lack of oversight of states\u2019 definitions of  categories of work activities results in inconsistencies in performance  measurement, as discussed in this report, that are not transparent.", "HHS noted some imprecision in the draft report\u2019s description of the work  participation rate calculation. In response, we made revisions to the  report. HHS also took issue with our discussion of how a state\u2019s work  participation rate changed after its waiver expired. We continue to believe  that this example of how a state\u2019s rate changed over 50 percentage points  1 month after the waiver expired is a useful illustration of how changes in  definitions can affect work participation rates.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.
