Faster emergency response and improved medical techniques have resulted in more persons surviving their injuries, but many survive with a substantial long-term neurological disability. There are no comprehensive data describing the incidence of TBI-related disability, making it difficult to estimate the costs of providing adequate services to adults with TBI. Reliable estimates of the total number of individuals living with residual effects of TBI or those currently requiring services are not now available. However, it has been estimated that 1.5 to 2 million individuals sustain a TBI each year.", "Both the private and public sectors finance acute care services to adults with TBI. Federal and state governments, however, pay for a large part of post-acute services received by adults with TBI, since private insurance generally limits post-acute services and does not pay for long-term care and individuals may quickly exhaust personal resources. In addition, individuals\u2019 longevity may be unaffected by the injury and adults with TBI may require post-acute services for an extended period of time\u2014some for the remainder of their lives. As a result, the costs of caring for a person with TBI can be substantial.", "Because of your concern about the substantial governmental costs for services to persons with TBI, you asked us to review federal-state efforts to provide services to these individuals. Specifically, we examined (1) the primary federal and state programs that provide adults with TBI services to help them function more independently, (2) the strategies that states have developed to enhance access to TBI-related services, and (3) the circumstances believed to be most frequently associated with difficulty in obtaining services. As agreed with your office, we focused our study on post-acute services for civilians injured as adults with an emphasis on services that help reintegrate these individuals into the community.", "To conduct our study, we visited two states, Arizona and Pennsylvania, and interviewed representatives from seven other states\u2014Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, and New Jersey\u2014generally considered leaders in providing services to adults with TBI. We interviewed national experts in TBI; representatives from state TBI advocacy groups, Medicaid, and state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies; Medicaid providers; and case managers. We also reviewed documents from these states. We did not evaluate the effectiveness of any of the Medicaid or state programs. We conducted our work from November 1996 to January 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. (See app. II for more information on our scope and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["TBI is the injury most likely to result in death or permanent disability. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data indicate that each year approximately 50,000 people die, 210,000 are hospitalized and survive, and 70,000 to 90,000 individuals are disabled due to a TBI. CDC cautions that these numbers underestimate the numbers of individuals sustaining a TBI because they exclude individuals seen in emergency departments or other outpatient settings but not admitted to the hospital. Other researchers estimate that for each person who dies of TBI, 5 people are hospitalized and 27 are examined in emergency rooms without overnight hospitalization.", "Almost one-half of all TBIs result from transportation-related incidents. Most of the remainder result from falls, assaults, sports and recreation, and firearm-related injuries. Younger adults generally are more likely to be injured than older adults. Adult males sustain a TBI more than twice as frequently as women, and blacks are more likely than whites or Hispanics to sustain a TBI and to die from their injury. People at the lowest income levels are at the greatest risk of sustaining a TBI.", "Adults with TBI frequently have difficulty with executive skills, such as managing time, money, and transportation. They also have difficulty with short-term memory, concentration, judgment, and organization, which are necessary to function independently in the community. Adults with TBI often have normal intelligence but are unable to transfer learning from one environment to another.", "Both the private and public sectors finance acute care services to adults with TBI. When the individual progresses past the acute phase, private health insurance typically limits coverage of rehabilitation therapies and does not cover long-term care or community-based support services. As families exhaust their financial resources, the public sector pays for a greater share of the services received."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid, Vocational Rehabilitation, and ILS Programs Provide Services to Adults With TBI", "paragraphs": ["Federal funding is available for medical and social support services under Medicaid, vocational rehabilitation services provided through state VR agencies, and for independent living services. (See app. III for a summary of the broad categories of services provided through these programs by at least one of the states we contacted.)", "Medicaid provides health care for about 37 million disabled, blind, or elderly people and low-income families. At the state level, Medicaid operates as a health insurance program under a state plan covering both required and state-selected optional health care services. Generally, state plan benefits must be provided in the same amount, duration, and scope to all Medicaid beneficiaries. With the exception of nursing facility care, most services provided under the standard Medicaid program are medically oriented. Standard Medicaid programs generally do not provide many of the long-term community-based support services needed by many adults with TBI.", "To provide long-term home and community-based services for broad groups of Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014such as the elderly disabled or physically disabled, including adults with TBI\u2014states generally have used 1915(c) waivers. There are currently over 200 home and community-based waiver programs serving more than 250,000 individuals nationwide. Under these waivers, states, with HCFA approval, can waive one or more of the requirements for statewideness, income and resource standards, comparability of services, and equal provision of services, as long as the average per capita cost of providing these services will not exceed the cost of institutional care. States select the services, the service definition, the target population, and the number of individuals included under each HCFA-approved home and community-based waiver. Examples of services that can be provided under these waivers are personal care, homemaker, and nonmedical transportation services.", "Adults with TBI might benefit from some home and community-based services covered under broad-based waivers. However, these individuals often are unable to qualify for such services because the preadmission screening process may be oriented to physical rather than cognitive disabilities. For example, Colorado Medicaid reports that most adults with TBI are unlikely to qualify for the broad-based waiver for elderly and physically disabled individuals because the assessment weighs physical factors more heavily than cognitive factors. Pennsylvania has a home and community-based waiver for personal attendant services, but beneficiaries with cognitive impairment are excluded. In addition, home and community-based waivers targeted to individuals who are aged or physically disabled generally do not cover services needed by cognitively impaired individuals, such as cognitive rehabilitation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Target Medicaid Services to Small Groups of Adults With TBI", "paragraphs": ["States generally use Medicaid home and community-based waivers to target Medicaid services to small groups of adults with TBI. Missouri, however, narrowly targets services from its standard Medicaid program to persons with TBI.", "Home and community-based waivers can be used by states to target select services to smaller, more specific groups of individuals, such as adults with TBI. HCFA reports that, as of June 1997, a total of 15 states have applied for and received TBI waivers. These programs are small, covering an estimated 2,478 individuals and $118 million in expenditures in 1996.", "Four of the states we contacted\u2014Colorado, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New Jersey\u2014have TBI home and community-based waivers to compensate for the difficulty some adults with TBI experience in accessing services. In addition to services covered, the four waivers vary in terms of the target population, the number of individuals served, expenditures per individual, and the services covered. (See table 1.)", "The TBI waivers for three of the four states\u2014Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New Jersey\u2014target people in nursing facilities and similar institutions or at risk of institutional placement. Many of these individuals will likely require home and community-based services like those covered by the waiver for the remainder of their lives. In contrast, Colorado\u2019s waiver targets adults with TBI in the hospital who receive post-hospital waiver services so that they can be discharged more quickly. Colorado estimates that individuals will receive services under the TBI waiver for 2 years; after that time, they will receive, if necessary, services under the home and community-based waiver for the elderly, blind, and disabled, which covers a less intense level of services. Minnesota\u2019s TBI waiver covers two levels of home and community-based care: (1) for individuals at risk of nursing home placement and (2) for individuals at risk of placement in neurobehavioral units in hospitals.", "Some waiver services are covered by all four states: case management, personal care, respite care, environmental modifications, transportation, behavior modification programs, and day treatment or day care programs.Some type of alternative residential setting, cognitive rehabilitation, assistive technology, independent living training, specialized medical equipment and supplies, and mental health services are covered by three of the four states. Many of the services covered under the TBI waivers are similar to services required by other people with physical disabilities or chronic illnesses, such as personal care services or extended physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Some, however, are particularly useful to adults with TBI, such as cognitive rehabilitation or behavioral programming. (See app. IV for a comprehensive list of services covered under Colorado\u2019s, Minnesota\u2019s, New Hampshire\u2019s, and New Jersey\u2019s TBI waivers.)", "Fewer than 500 individuals are covered by these waivers in the four states, with large variation among the states in the number covered, ranging from 36 served in Colorado to 231 served in Minnesota. The actual cost per person also varies widely, ranging from less than $10,000 per person in Colorado to almost $80,000 in New Hampshire. The differences in actual cost per person reflect differences in the target population. For example, according to Colorado Medicaid, the lower cost per person reflects the fact that the waiver targets individuals who, although they receive costly treatment following discharge from the hospital, receive these services for only a short period of time. In contrast, New Hampshire reports that their higher cost per person reflects their target population, who are more disabled than TBI waiver recipients in other states and whom other states generally do not place in the community.", "In its standard Medicaid program, Missouri includes a package of services targeted specifically to adults with TBI, including neuropsychological, psychological, vocational, and recreational services, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Adults with TBI receive this service package for 6 to 12 months. In state fiscal year 1996, Missouri Medicaid provided its TBI service package to an average of 19 persons each month at a cost totaling almost $614,000. Missouri Medicaid officials chose to narrowly target these services to adults with TBI under the standard Medicaid program because this was administratively simpler than a home and community-based waiver."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VR and ILS Provide Services to Reintegrate Adults With TBI Into the Community", "paragraphs": ["VR and ILS\u2014Department of Education programs administered by the states\u2014provide services to disabled adults, including adults with TBI, to support their reentry into the community. VR programs provide vocational rehabilitation services to help disabled individuals prepare for and obtain employment. ILS provides training, peer support, advocacy, and referral through a decentralized system of federally funded ILS programs to help people with disabilities live independently. Both programs are financed by a combination of federal and state funds\u2014totaling roughly $2.5 billion in 1996\u2014and receive referrals from a variety of sources.", "VR provides vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities, including adults with TBI, to prepare them for and support them during their transition to employment. To be eligible, individuals must have a documentable disability that impedes employment but does not preclude the ability to work and must demonstrate a need for vocational rehabilitation services. Eligible individuals and VR counselors develop an individualized plan that includes an employment objective and services needed to reach that objective. These services can include rehabilitative therapies and supported employment services, which provide individuals who are integrated into a work setting post-employment support\u2014such as job coaching or on-the-job training\u2014to help facilitate their transition to employment. VR generally can provide supported employment services, for a maximum of 18 months; after this time, states must either find additional funds to pay for continuing services or discontinue the services. Adults with TBI, however, may still need these services to continue working.", "All federally funded ILS centers are required to provide four core services\u2014independent living skills training, peer support, advocacy, and referral\u2014to individuals with disabilities, including adults with TBI, on a continuing basis. Whether a center purchases additional services for consumers is determined locally. As a result, there is likely to be variation in whether ILS offers other services, such as personal assistant services or home modification, from state to state and within a state. ILS emphasizes peer support and consumer-directed action. The adult with TBI is provided information and peer support to determine his or her specific needs as well as referrals and advocacy from an ILS specialist. Trainers\u2014generally individuals with similar disabilities\u2014help the consumer identify barriers and ways to get around them. In some of the states we contacted, TBI experts expressed concern about the ILS model of consumer-directed needs assessment.

VR agencies are able to identify the costs of services to adults with TBI. However, the costs of adults with TBI served by ILS or the entire Medicaid program cannot be determined. Medicaid waiver expenditures for 1996 vary widely, from $300,000 in Colorado to $6.6 million in New Jersey; VR and ILS expenditures vary less.

Four programs receive referrals from individuals, families, providers, advocates, and other state agencies. Florida\u2019s program, however, receives notification from a central registry\u2014to which admitting hospitals are mandated to report\u2014of all individuals with a TBI who are hospitalized overnight. Individuals reported to the central registry are assigned to case managers, who provide the individual and his or her family with information on all available resources.

In contrast, Pennsylvania places time\u2014and cost\u2014limits on services provided. In Pennsylvania, adults with TBI are limited to 36 months for case management services and 2 years for rehabilitation services. To date, however, Pennsylvania has only enforced its cost limit, which is $125,000 per year per person for rehabilitation.", "Four of the five states\u2014Pennsylvania is the exception\u2014have legislatively mandated that their state-funded programs have an advisory council to provide guidance and oversight.

This difficulty will most likely last throughout their lifetime.", "These individuals frequently do not qualify for Medicaid waiver services under programs for the physically disabled because they have little to no difficulty in bathing, dressing, eating, or other activities of daily living used to assess disability.
