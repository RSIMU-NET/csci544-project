US-VISIT uses these identifiers (digital fingerscans and photographs) to screen persons against watch lists and to verify that a visitor is the person who was issued a visa or other travel document. Visitors are also to confirm their departure by having their visas or passports scanned and undergoing fingerscanning at selected air and sea ports of entry (POE). GAO has made many recommendations to improve the program, all of which DHS has agreed to implement. GAO was asked to report on DHS's progress in responding to 18 of these recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The current status of DHS's implementation of the 18 recommendations is mixed, but progress in critical areas has been slow. DHS has implemented 2 of the recommendations: it defined program staff positions, roles, and responsibilities, and it hired an independent verification and validation contractor. It has also taken steps to implement the other recommendations, partially completing 11 and beginning to implement another 5. In September 2003, GAO reported that the program had not assessed the costs and benefits of Increment 1 (which provides entry capabilities to air and sea POEs) and recommended that the program determine whether proposed increments will produce mission value commensurate with cost. In the latest cost-benefit analysis, dated June 23, 2005, the program identified potential costs and benefits for three alternatives for an air and sea exit solution. However, the analysis does not meet key Office of Management and Budget criteria; for example, it does not include a complete uncertainty analysis, which helps to provide decision makers with perspective on the potential variability of the cost and benefit estimates should circumstances change. GAO reported in May 2004 and February 2005 that system testing was not based on well-defined test plans and recommended that before testing begins, the program develop and approve test plans meeting certain criteria. However, although the latest test plan did cover many required areas (such as the tests to be performed), it did not adequately trace between test cases and the requirements to be verified by testing. Without complete and traceable test plans, the risk is increased that the deployed system will not perform as intended. In May 2004, GAO reported that the program had not assessed its workforce and facility needs for Increment 2B (which extends entry capabilities to the 50 busiest land POEs) and recommended that it do so. Since then, the program evaluated the processing times to issue and process entry/exit forms at 3 of the 50 busiest POEs and concluded that the results showed that no additional staff and only minor facilities modifications were required. However, the scope of the evaluation was limited. Since then, DHS has deployed and implemented Increment 2B capabilities to these 50 POEs, making the collection of predeployment baseline data for these sites impractical. Nonetheless, other alternatives, such as surveying site officials about the increment's impacts, have yet to be explored. Until they are, the program may not be able to accurately project resource needs or make any needed modifications to achieve its goals of minimizing US-VISIT's impact on POE operations, which was the impetus for GAO's recommendation. DHS attributed the pace of progress to competing demands on time and resources. The longer that US-VISIT takes to implement the recommendations, the greater the risk that the program will not meet its stated goals on time and within budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) is a  multibillion-dollar program of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  that is intended to record the entry into and exit from the United States of  selected individuals, verify their identity, and confirm their compliance  with the terms of their admission into and stay in the United States.

The program  director stated that he agrees that additional evaluation is needed to assess  the impact of implementing potential enforcement mechanisms and plans  to do so.", "Until the program office adequately evaluates the exit alternatives and  knows whether the alternative to be selected will be effective, the program  office will not be in a position to select the exit solution that is in the best  interest of the program.

As  with any program, introducing and institutionalizing the program  management and accountability discipline at which our recommendations  are aimed require investing time and resources while continuing to meet  other program demands. In making such investment choices, it is important  to remember that institutionalizing such program discipline in the near  term will produce long-term payback in a program\u2019s ability to meet these  other demands. Accordingly, the longer that US-VISIT takes to implement  our recommendations, the greater the risk that the program will not meet  its stated goals and commitments.", "Our open recommendations are all aimed at strengthening US-VISIT  program management and improving DHS\u2019s ability to make informed   US-VISIT investment decisions. With the exception of one, these  recommendations are still relevant and applicable.

Further, the  department stated that while it disagreed with certain areas of the report, it  nevertheless concurred with the need to implement our open  recommendations with all due speed and diligence.", "DHS commented specifically on 11 of the 18 recommendations discussed in  the report. The recommendations, the department\u2019s comments, and our  responses follow: 1. Recommendation: Develop and begin implementing a system security  plan, and perform a privacy impact assessment and use the results of  the analysis in near-term and subsequent system acquisition decision  making.", "DHS stated that this recommendation has been fully implemented. In  support, it said that it has completed a US-VISIT security plan that is  consistent with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  guidance, and that it provided the plan to us in September 2004. It also  stated that the security risk assessment aspect of this recommendation was  established in February 2005, 20 months after we made the  recommendation, and thus the age of the recommendation should be  shown as 10 months rather that the 30 months cited in the report.", "The department also commented that there is no US-VISIT system, but  rather a US-VISIT program with capabilities delivered by existing  interconnected systems. According to the department, these component  systems have been certified and accredited, consistent with NIST guidance,  and as part of their certification and accreditation, security plans and risk  assessments, as well as risk mitigation strategies, have been developed for  each system. The department stated that it provided us with these  system-level risk assessments, as well as system-specific action plans and  milestones for implementing the mitigation strategies. In addition, the  department noted that it completed a programwide risk assessment in  December 2005 that specifically addresses information security issues that  might not be captured in the system-specific documentation used to certify  and accredit each system. In light of its system-specific certification and  accreditation efforts, existing system-level risk assessments, and the  program-level risk management process (see response 4 for discussion of  the risk management process), DHS commented that it is inaccurate to  state that US-VISIT officials are not in a position to know program risks,  and the recommendation should be closed.", "While we agree that we received a copy of the US-VISIT security plan,  dated September 2004, we do not agree that the plan satisfied all relevant  federal guidance and that DHS has fully implemented our recommendation.  In particular, it has not provided us with evidence that a programwide risk  assessment has been done and that a security plan reflective of such an  assessment exists. According to relevant guidance, a security plan should  describe, among other things, the methodology that is to be used to identify  system threats and vulnerabilities and to assess risks, and it should include  the date the risk assessment was completed because the assessment is a  necessary driver of the security controls described in the plan. As we  reported in February 2005 and state in this report, the US-VISIT security  plan did not include this information; further, although DHS stated in its  comments that it completed this risk assessment in December 2005, this  statement is contradicted by a statement elsewhere in its comments that it  is still in the process of doing the assessment. In addition to this  contradiction, DHS\u2019s comments did not include any evidence to  demonstrate that it has developed a complete risk assessment, such as a  copy of the assessment.", "With regard to the age of the recommendation, we do not agree with DHS\u2019s  position that we established a new finding regarding the lack of a  programwide risk assessment in our February 2005 report. Rather, as part  of our analysis of actions to implement our prior recommendation to  develop a security plan, which is to include information about the related  security risk assessment, we observed that the plan did not indicate a date  for completing a risk assessment in accordance with federal guidelines.  Therefore, our position that about 30 months had passed from the time of  our initial recommendation (June 2003) is accurate.", "With regard to the individual system-level risk assessments, we agree that  we have received them. However, we do not agree that we have received  the action plans and milestones cited in the comments. Regardless, we do  not believe that system-level assessments are a sufficient substitute for a  programwide assessment. Accordingly, our recommendation focused on  the need for an integrated US-VISIT system risk assessment as part of  security planning. While the system-level plans and risk assessments are  relevant and useful, they neither individually nor collectively address the  threats and vulnerabilities imposed as a result of these systems\u2019  integration. By stating in its comments its commitment to having a  programwide risk assessment that identifies and proposes mitigations for  security risks that arise as a result of the interface and integration of the  legacy systems, DHS is agreeing with our position. Moreover, without  evidence that the program has completely assessed its risks, we continue  to find no basis for how program officials would know the full range and  degree of US-VISIT security risks. Our position in this regard has been  reinforced by a recent DHS Inspector General report that identified a  number of US-VISIT security risks.", "To further support its position that this recommendation has been fully  implemented, DHS also commented that it has completed numerous  privacy impact assessments and continues to update them to reflect system  changes. In particular, it said that it updated the privacy impact assessment  in December 2005 to reflect all increments and that it considers the  assessment to be part of US-VISIT system documentation. It further  commented that we appear to be unaware of privacy staff activities to  review system documents and perform privacy risk assessments  throughout the system life cycle. Nevertheless, the department  acknowledged that its privacy work was not always noted within US-VISIT  system documentation. Accordingly, DHS stated that it plans to  appropriately reference all privacy requirements and privacy risk  assessments in the program\u2019s system documentation in the future.", "We agree that US-VISIT has developed and updated its privacy impact  assessment and would note that our report states this fact. We do not agree,  however, with the comment that we are not aware that the privacy staff  review system documents and perform privacy risk assessments. In fact, it  is because we were aware of these facts that we were careful to ensure that  they were reflected in our report. The point that we are making is that  privacy is not addressed in all relevant systems documentation, which DHS  acknowledged in its comments. With regard to this point of agreement, we  support the department\u2019s stated plans to reference all privacy requirements  and any privacy risk assessments in all relevant system documentation in  the future.  2. Recommendation: Develop and implement a plan for satisfying key  acquisition management controls, including acquisition planning,  solicitation, requirements management, program management,  contract tracking and oversight, evaluation, and transition to support,  and implement the controls in accordance with SEI guidance.", "DHS commented that the report should reflect that US-VISIT had initially  adopted Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute (SEI)  Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model\u00ae to guide its  software-related process improvement efforts and that, in December 2004,  it transitioned to SEI\u2019s Capability Maturity Model\u2013Integration (CMMI\u00ae). As  a result, it said that the program\u2019s process improvement strategy and plans,  process development, and process appraisals are now aligned to the most  applicable CMMI process areas.", "We agree that US-VISIT has transitioned to CMMI. We state in our report  that US-VISIT has done so and that the key process areas it is addressing in  its process improvement strategy and plan are consistent with those cited  in our recommendation. We do not believe that this transition materially  affects our recommendation, however, because even though the names of  the key processes in these two models may in some cases differ, the  processes and respective practices are fundamentally consistent. 3. Recommendation: Clarify the operational context in which US-VISIT is  to operate.", "Consistent with our report, DHS commented that the operational context  in which US-VISIT operates is in progress, meaning that it has yet to be  fully established. For example, it said that the mission of DHS, and  therefore the scope of US-VISIT activities to meet the mission, is  continually expanding. Further, it acknowledged that more certainty in the  operational context is desirable. In mitigation of the risks associated with  not having a more stable operational context, DHS made several  statements. For example, it said that the principal role of US-VISIT is to  integrate information and immigration and border management systems  across DHS and the State Department, and to facilitate agencies working  toward a common environment that will eliminate redundancies. It also  said that elements of its draft immigration and border management  strategic plan are being used in current US-VISIT operations. In addition,  the department said that mechanisms to mitigate the risks that we cited  have been developed and are being implemented.", "We support DHS\u2019s acknowledgment of the importance of having a  well-defined operational context within which to define and implement  US-VISIT and related border security programs. However, we do not  believe that DHS\u2019s comments provided any evidence showing that  sufficient steps and activities to mitigate the associated risks have been  taken or are planned.  4. Recommendation: Determine whether proposed US-VISIT increments  will produce mission value commensurate with cost and risks and  disclose to the Congress planned actions.", "DHS commented that its cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for Increment 1B  conforms to relevant federal guidance, and noted that our expectations as  to the scope and level of detail of analysis that should be included in the  CBA document are inconsistent with its understanding of OMB Circular  A-94 and DHS\u2019s CBA workbook, which were used to guide the development of  the CBA analysis. As an example, the department took exception with our  statement that year-by-year benefit estimates were not reported by noting  that the net present value was based on an estimate of annual benefits and  costs, and that net present value could not be estimated without a  year-by-year benefit analysis.", "The department further commented that a comprehensive uncertainty  analysis was conducted because it completed a risk analysis, which is more  comprehensive, rigorous, and appropriate than conducting a sensitivity  analysis. In this regard, it added that the results of the risk analysis  provided an indication of Increment 1B\u2019s worthiness in light of existing  uncertainty, rather than information on a specific CBA variable or another.  The department further noted that it had provided some of these  supporting analyses to us.", "DHS also stated that any investment that has a 5-year life cycle and is  considered interim in nature will face considerable challenge in providing  economic benefits commensurate with cost.", "We do not agree that the CBA fully conforms to relevant federal guidance.  As our report states, for example, the analysis does not explicitly state the  numerical value of the discount rate used for calculating each alternative\u2019s  net present value, and hence does not conform to OMB guidance. In  addition, the cost estimates used in the analysis were not complete and  reliably derived. In deriving the estimate, for example, the department did  not clearly define the project\u2019s life cycle to ensure that key factors were not  overlooked and that the full cost of the program was included. (See  response 10 below for more information on this point.) Last, while we  agree that a year-by-year benefit analysis is a necessary component of a net  present value determination, OMB nevertheless requires that the  year-by-year benefit estimates be reported in the analysis to promote  independent review of the estimates.", "Also, we do not agree that DHS performed a complete uncertainty analysis.  According to OMB and DHS guidance, a complete uncertainty analysis  should include both a risk analysis and a sensitivity analysis. However, the  latter was not done. Thus, our point is not, as DHS comments suggest, that  US-VISIT should have performed a sensitivity analysis instead of a risk  analysis, but rather, that both types of analyses are necessary to completely  examine investment uncertainty.  5. Recommendation: Develop and implement a risk management plan and  ensure that all high risks and their status are reported regularly to the  executive body.", "DHS commented that US-VISIT began the development and  implementation of its risk management plan in 2004 immediately after we  made our recommendation. It further commented that, as part of a CMMI  maturity internal appraisal that it completed in July 2005, it found that the  risk management process had not been consistently applied across the  program. To address this, the department cited actions that it has taken to  fully implement risk management, such as approving the risk management  plan in September 2005; defining a risk governance structure; establishing  and maintaining a risk database; and developing risk management training  and providing this training to program personnel and contractors beginning  in November 2005.", "We support the recent actions that the program cited as having been taken  to strengthen risk management. However, the actions cited do not  demonstrate that the risk management process is being consistently  applied. Until US-VISIT fully implements its risk management plan and  process, it cannot be assured that all program risks are being identified and  managed in order to effectively mitigate any negative impact on the  program\u2019s ability to deliver promised capabilities on time and within  budget.  6. Recommendation: Develop and approve test plans before testing  begins that (1) specify the test environment; (2) describe each test to be  performed, including test controls, inputs, and expected outputs;  (3) define the test procedures to be followed in conducting the tests;  and (4) provide traceability between test cases and the requirements to  be verified by the testing.", "DHS stated that our report does not accurately reflect the status of the  Increment 2C Phase 1 testing. In particular, it said that the issues  associated with the traceability of requirements to test cases were minor  and that the extent of the discrepancies is far less than what our report  presents. It further stated that the discrepancies in our report are based on  old traceability documentation and do not reflect revised documentation  provided to us on November 9, 2005.", "We agree that DHS provided us with revised traceability matrixes after we  had shared with them our analysis of the test plans and traceability  matrixes, dated June 28, 2005, and June 27, 2005, respectively. However, the  revised documentation referenced in DHS\u2019s comments was provided in  November 2005, about 4 months after testing began. This means that the  test plans and traceability matrixes available at the time of testing\u2014which  are what we reviewed because they governed the scope and nature of  actual testing performed\u2014did not adequately trace between test cases and  the requirements to be verified. Specifically, 300 of the 438 Increment 2C  requirements, or about 70 percent, did not have specific references to test  cases.   7. Recommendation: Implement effective configuration management  practices, including establishing a US-VISIT change control board to  manage and oversee system changes.", "DHS commented that a US-VISIT representative attends all configuration  control board meetings for all applicable legacy component systems, and  that any proposed change request from a legacy component control board  that could affect US-VISIT functionality is brought to the attention of the  US-VISIT Executive Configuration Control Board for consideration.", "We do not question these statements. However, we do not believe that they  demonstrate that US-VISIT has adequate control over system changes that  could affect the program. That is, they do not ensure that changes to the  component systems that are initiated and approved by another DHS  organization and that could affect US-VISIT performance are subject to  US-VISIT configuration management and approval processes. US-VISIT  could establish explicit and enforceable control over changes to the legacy  systems through such mechanisms as defined and enforced memorandums  of understanding among the affected DHS organizations. It was the lack of  such control that prompted our recommendation. 8. Recommendation: Assess the full impact of Increment 2B on land POE  workforce levels and facilities, including performing appropriate  modeling exercises.", "The department stated that, given the imperative to meet the legislatively  mandated time frames, the scope of Increment 2B was limited to only one  part of POE operations\u2014incorporating the collection of a biometric into  the previously manual Form I-94 issuance process. It also stated that wait  times are affected by various factors, including traffic volume, staffing  levels, and availability of officers. Therefore, DHS focused the Increment  2B evaluation on just the change to this process.", "The department further commented that given the events since the  evaluation\u2014namely, Increment 2B full operations\u2014it is not practical to  collect and model baseline data for the 47 sites that were not part of the  initial evaluation.", "Regarding the 3 pilot sites included in the assessment, the department  stated that the sites were selected based on criteria developed from input  from US-VISIT, as well as CBP operational constraints. The department  further commented that the 3 sites provided a reasonable mix of travelers  and they did not have other constraints that directly impacted the  collection of performance data specific to Form I-94 issuance. DHS also  stated that the I-94 processing times vary by POE, and therefore they are  not easily generalized from one port to another. Further, the department  commented that the number of workstations and officers available to  operate those workstations to process applicants for a Form I-94 do not  impact the time it takes to issue a Form I-94.", "We agree that the scope of the Increment 2B evaluation was limited to the  I-94 issuance process, and that it did not address the increment\u2019s impact on  the POEs\u2019 ability to meet other performance parameters. Our point is that  the limited nature of the evaluation does not satisfy either the intent of our  recommendation or DHS\u2019s own stated purpose for the evaluation, which  was to determine the effectiveness of Increment 2B performance at the 50  busiest land POEs. We also agree that the I-94 processing times vary by  POE and cannot be easily generalized. It is for this reason, among others,  that we questioned whether the 3 sites selected for the assessment were  sufficiently representative to satisfy both our recommendation and the  evaluation\u2019s stated purpose.", "In addition, while we also agree that collecting pre-Increment 2B baseline  data is not practical at this time, the fact remains that the operational  impact of Increment 2B on workforce levels and facilities has not been  adequately assessed, as evidenced by officials at 1 large POE telling us that  processing times have increased and DHS\u2019s recognition that each POE is  somewhat different. In light of these new facts and circumstances, we are  closing our existing recommendation and making a new recommendation  to recognize the need for DHS to explore alternative means to assess the  impact of US-VISIT entry capabilities at land POEs. This new  recommendation will be shown as an open recommendation, and the  original recommendation will be closed. 9. Recommendation: Develop a plan, including explicit tasks and  milestones, for implementing all of our open recommendations and  periodically report to the DHS Secretary and Under Secretary on  progress in implementing this plan; and report this progress, including  reasons for delays, in all future expenditure plans.", "DHS stated that it is untrue that 19 months had elapsed from the time we  made this recommendation to the time that it assigned responsibilities to  program officials for addressing each of our recommendations. In support,  it commented that it issued its first plan to address our recommendations  on August 18, 2003, and subsequent reports have been issued periodically  that update progress in doing so.", "We agree that DHS has assigned responsibilities to specific individuals for  addressing each recommendation. However, we have yet to be provided  any evidence to support its statement that it issued the first report  addressing our recommendations on August 18, 2003. Similarly, we have  not received evidence showing that it has prepared a plan, including  specific actions and milestones, for implementing all of our open  recommendations, which is a focus of this recommendation. We would also  observe that we made this recommendation in May 2004, and at that time  the department stated that it agreed with the recommendation but did not  indicate that it had taken any steps to address it, such as commenting that a  report was issued on August 18, 2003.  10. Recommendation: Follow effective practices for estimating the costs  of future increments.", "DHS either tacitly or explicitly agreed with our findings relative to its  satisfaction of 8 of the 13 cost-estimating criteria presented in table 4 (now  table 3) of our draft report. For example, it agreed that it did not clearly  define the life cycle to which the cost estimate applies. It also agreed that it  did not include a work breakdown structure, noting that it used the  available project implementation schedule as a proxy for the activities  related to the deployment of the exit alternatives.", "Regarding our five findings concerning its satisfaction of cost-estimating  with which DHS disagreed, the department\u2019s primary area of disagreement  was with the intended purpose of the Increment 1B CBA that used the cost  estimate, which it said in its comments was to inform decision makers  about the relative worthiness of each of the three exit alternatives  considered for deployment. Hence, DHS stated that the purpose of the CBA  was to analyze only the costs associated with deploying an operational  solution, not to analyze the costs and benefits of both developing and  deploying alternative solutions. DHS further stated that the CBA thus  includes only those costs to be incurred in deploying a selected alternative,  and it does not include costs already incurred in developing system  alternatives (i.e., sunk costs). It further commented that DHS guidance  states that sunk costs are not relevant to the current investment analysis  because \u201conly current decisions can affect the future consequences of  investment alternatives.\u201d", "DHS also disagreed that the cost estimate in the CBA should have included  nonrecurring development costs, and commented that it did appropriately  size the task described in the cost estimates for each alternative exit  solution, noting that sizing metrics related to software development were  not relevant to deployment of the alternatives because development  activities had already occurred and therefore are sunk costs. The  department added that those sizing metrics that are relevant to the cost  estimate are discussed in the CBA, as are the cost estimating parameters  (i.e., those associated with deployment and not those associated with  development and testing).", "In addition, DHS disagreed that DHS\u2019s cost estimate excluded important  cost categories, such as system testing, and stated that the estimate  addresses labor, facilities, operations and maintenance, information  technology, travel, and training costs. Once again, DHS emphasized that  since the focus of the CBA was on operational deployment and not system  design and development, system testing costs were not included because  they were not considered relevant. DHS also reiterated its early point that  the uncertainty analysis that it conducted was comprehensive.", "We agree that actual sunk costs should not be included in a CBA cost  estimate. However, we disagree that the cost categories that DHS cited as  not relevant are only costs that are associated with predeployment  activities. Testing, for example, is an activity that is normally performed  before, during, and following deployment, and thus the associated costs  would be relevant to the stated purpose of the Increment 1B CBA.", "However, a testing cost category was missing from the CBA cost estimate,  as was a cost category for software maintenance.", "Regarding DHS\u2019s statement that it conducted a complete uncertainty  analysis, we reiterate our previous point that a complete uncertainty  analysis should include both a risk analysis and a sensitivity analysis, and  the CBA did not include the latter.  11. Recommendation: Reassess plans for deploying an exit capability to  ensure that the scope of the exit pilot provides for adequate evaluation  of alternative solutions and better ensures that the exit solution  selected is in the best interest of the program.", "Concerning the questions we raised about the adequacy of the exit pilots in  light of the 24 percent compliance rate, DHS commented that we failed to  consider the compliance rate of the previous exit pilot program, the  National Security Entry Exit Registration System (NSEERS), which,  according to DHS, had a 75 percent compliance rate. DHS added that  NSEERS achieved this compliance rate with a very limited number of exit  locations, and therefore, any of the three US-VISIT exit alternatives would  have at least a 75 percent compliance rate once national deployment was  completed.", "Further, the department commented that Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) had recently conducted enforcement operations at the  Denver International Airport, and that the compliance rate during these  operations increased from 30 percent to over 90 percent. It then concluded  that the combined results of the exit pilot evaluation, the NSEERS pilot,  and the ICE enforcement activities at the Denver International Airport lead  it to believe that the US-VISIT exit alternatives have been adequately  evaluated.", "We do not agree with this conclusion because it is based on unsupported  assumptions. Specifically, DHS did not provide any evidence to support its  claim that that US-VISIT would achieve a comparable compliance rate to  the NSEERS program. Moreover, even if DHS could achieve a 75 percent  compliance rate for US-VISIT exit,that still means that 25 percent of eligible  persons would not be complying with the US-VISIT exit process.", "Further, DHS did not provide any information about the recent  enforcement actions conducted by ICE, nor did it provide any evidence  that this is a practical and viable option for the US-VISIT exit solution.", "While we agree that enforcement actions may indeed increase the exit  compliance rate, DHS has not yet assessed the impact of such a solution on  the US-VISIT exit process. Further, the US-VISIT program director  acknowledged the need to evaluate the impact of implementing potential  enforcement actions on US-VISIT exit and planned to do so.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, as well as  to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of other Senate and House  committees that have authorization and oversight responsibilities for  homeland security. We are also sending copies to the Secretary of  Homeland Security, Secretary of State, and the Director of OMB. Copies of  this report will also be available at no charge on our Web site at  www.gao.gov.", "Should you or your offices have any questions on matters discussed in this  report, please contact me at (202) 512-3439 or at hiter@gao.gov.

To accomplish this objective, we reviewed and  analyzed US-VISIT\u2019s most recent status reports on the implementation of  our open recommendations and related key documents, augmented as  appropriate by interviews with program officials. More specifically, we  analyzed relevant systems acquisition documentation, including the  program\u2019s process improvement plan, risk management plan, and  configuration management plan. We also analyzed the US-VISIT security  plan, privacy impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis, cost estimates, test  plans, human capital plans, and related evaluations and assessments. In  performing our analyses, we compared available documentation and  program officials\u2019 statements with relevant federal guidance and associated  best practices. A more detailed description of our scope and methodology  relative to the cost-benefit analysis, cost estimates, and test plans follows:  Our analysis of the cost-benefit analysis focused on Increment 1B  because this was the latest cost-benefit analysis and cost estimate  prepared. In doing this analysis, we compared the US-VISIT cost-benefit  analysis to eight criteria in Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  guidance.", "Our analysis of the cost estimate also focused on Increment 1B for the  same reason previously cited. In doing this analysis, we compared the  estimate to 13 criteria from the Software Engineering Institute that we  have previously reported to be the minimum set of actions needed to  develop a reliable cost estimate. We then determined whether the  criteria were satisfied, partially satisfied, or not satisfied using the  definitions given below.", "Our analysis of the test plans focused on Increment 2C because it is the  most recently tested increment. This analysis included determining the  extent to which the test plans for this increment met 4 key criteria that  we have previously reported as essential to effective test plans.
