However, GAO found that DFAS did not fully implement the steps required by the FIAR Guidance. GAO found numerous deficiencies in the implementation of DFAS's contract pay FIP, including the following:", "DFAS did not adequately perform certain planning activities for its contract pay FIP as required by the FIAR Guidance. For example, DFAS did not assess the dollar activity and risk factors of its processes, systems, and controls, which resulted in the exclusion of three key processes from the FIP, including the reconciliation of its contract pay data to the components' general ledgers. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that control activities such as reconciliations are an integral part of an entity's planning, implementing, reviewing, and accountability for stewardship of government resources and achieving effective results. As result, DFAS did not obtain sufficient assurance that the contract disbursements are accurately recorded and maintained in the components' general ledgers, and that the status of DOD's contract obligations is accurate and up-to-date.", "DFAS did not adequately perform required testing of its contract pay controls, processes, and balances. For example, DFAS did not adequately validate the populations used to perform substantive and internal control testing as required by the FIAR Guidance. DFAS officials stated that they validated that the population that was tested; however, GAO found that the process followed by DFAS for validating the population did not include a reconciliation of the population to the components' general ledgers. As a result, additional deficiencies may exist in DFAS's contract pay controls and additional errors may exist in the recorded transactions activity and balances, which affects the components' ability to rely on DFAS's controls over contract pay.", "DFAS did not provide adequate documentation to support that it had remediated all of the identified control deficiencies that DFAS stated had been corrected. GAO's review of a nongeneralizable sample of 25 of these deficiencies found that in 3 instances, corrective actions had not been taken as required, and in 15 other instances, the documentation provided by DFAS did not sufficiently support that the identified deficiencies were remediated. DFAS had adequately developed and implemented the necessary corrective action plans for 7 of the deficiencies GAO reviewed.", "Although DFAS has asserted audit readiness, until it corrects the deficiencies and fully implements its FIP in accordance with the FIAR Guidance, its ability to process, record, and maintain accurate and reliable contract pay transaction data is questionable.

For example, the  discretionary budget authority of $606 billion DOD requested for fiscal  year 2014 constitutes about 53 percent of budget requests for  discretionary programs throughout the federal government. Yet it is one of  the few major federal entities that cannot accurately account for its  spending or assets, and remains the only major federal agency that has  been unable to receive an audit opinion of any kind on its department- wide financial statements. To address this, the National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2010 mandated that DOD  develop and maintain a Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness  (FIAR) Plan that describes the specific actions to be taken and the costs  associated with correcting DOD\u2019s financial management deficiencies and  validating that the department\u2019s consolidated financial statements are  ready for audit by September 30, 2017. DOD\u2019s FIAR Plan is a strategic  plan and management tool for guiding, monitoring, and reporting on the  department\u2019s ongoing financial management improvement efforts and for  communicating the department\u2019s approach to addressing its financial  management weaknesses and achieving financial statement audit  readiness. DOD is required to report semiannually, not later than May 15  and November 15 each year, on the status of the implementation of the  FIAR Plan. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010 also required that DOD  develop standardized guidance for DOD components, which DOD has  done by issuing its FIAR Guidance to require components to develop  Financial Improvement Plans (FIP) for each element of their FIAR-related  efforts, and define oversight roles and assign accountability for carrying  out the FIAR Plan to appropriate officials and organizations.", "Because DOD management relies heavily on budget information for day- to-day management decisions, the DOD Comptroller designated the  Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) as an audit priority and the  Secretary of Defense underscored the department\u2019s SBR priority with a  directive that set an interim date of September 30, 2014, for validating  that its SBR is audit ready. Subsequently, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013  amended the legal requirement to support this goal, explicitly requiring  that the FIAR Plan describe the specific actions to be taken and the costs  associated with validating audit readiness of the department\u2019s SBR by no  later than September 30, 2014.", "DOD identified properly accounting for payments made to its contractors,  referred to as contract pay, as a key element of its SBR audit readiness  efforts. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is the  service provider responsible for processing the department\u2019s contract  pay. DFAS reported that it processed $183 billion in contract pay  disbursements for fiscal year 2013, which was just over one-fourth of  DOD\u2019s reported $671 billion in net outlays\u2014spending, net of offsetting  collections and receipts. DFAS asserted in October 2013 that its contract  pay FIP was audit ready and has engaged an independent public  accounting firm to conduct an audit.", "The results of our prior work have raised concerns about the ability of  DOD components to effectively implement the FIAR Guidance. For  example, our review of the Navy\u2019s civilian pay and the Air Force\u2019s military  equipment audit readiness efforts identified significant deficiencies, such  as insufficient testing and conclusions reached that were not supported  by testing results. In addition, we found that neither the Marine Corps  nor the Navy had implemented effective processes for reconciling fund  balance with Treasury, which is required by the FIAR Guidance to  develop a reliable SBR. Further, we have reported on challenges in  achieving audit readiness for the U.S. Army\u2019s military pay, such as a lack  of an efficient or effective process or system for providing supporting  documentation for its military payroll expenses.", "This report was performed under our mandate to audit the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements, including activities of  executive branch agencies such as DOD. Our objective was to  determine the extent to which DFAS implemented its contract pay FIP in  accordance with the FIAR Guidance. To address our objective, we  compared DFAS\u2019s contract pay FIP with the FIAR Guidance to determine  whether the FIP contained all the steps and related supporting  documentation that the FIAR Guidance requires the components to  complete. Using the FIAR Guidance, we analyzed DFAS\u2019s FIP supporting  documentation, such as process narratives and flowcharts, test plans,  and test results. We also analyzed DFAS\u2019s efforts to address control  deficiencies identified during testing. Specifically, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 25 control deficiencies that were reported  by DFAS as remediated on the FIAR Directorate\u2019s Tracking Sheet and  reviewed the documentation. We interviewed officials from DFAS\u2019s  Office of Audit Readiness, DFAS\u2019s Internal Review, and the FIAR  Directorate to obtain explanations and clarifications on the results of our  evaluation of the FIP.

To  implement the FIAR Plan, the DOD Comptroller issued the FIAR  Guidance, which defines DOD\u2019s strategy, goals, roles, and responsibilities  and the procedures that the components need to perform to improve  financial management and achieve audit readiness. DOD components  are expected to prepare a FIP in accordance with the FIAR Guidance for  each of their assessable units. The FIPs are intended to both guide and  document financial improvement efforts. While the name FIP indicates  that it is a plan, as a component implements that plan, it must document  the steps performed and the results of those steps, and retain that  documentation within the FIP. When a component determines that it has  completed sufficient financial improvement efforts for an assessable unit  to undergo an audit, it asserts audit readiness for the related assessable  unit and submits the FIP documentation to the FIAR Directorate to  support the conclusion of audit readiness.

Specifically, the FIAR Guidance requires service providers to work with  the components to execute audit readiness activities on their systems,  data, processes, internal controls, and supporting documentation that  have a direct effect on the components\u2019 audit readiness state. To support  the component audit readiness efforts, a service provider is required to  take either of the following steps:", "Develop and implement a FIP to improve its processes, systems, and  controls so that it can successfully undergo a Statement on Standards  for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 examination.  Specifically, the FIAR Guidance requires the service provider to  implement a FIP if three or more components will rely on its  processes and systems for their audit readiness assertions, and if the  service provider will be able to assert audit readiness prior to the  components\u2019 targeted dates for asserting audit readiness.", "Directly participate in and support the component\u2019s financial statement  audit where the service provider\u2019s processes, systems, internal  controls, and supporting documentation are audited as part of the  components\u2019 financial statement audits.", "The FIAR Guidance service provider methodology requires the FIP to  include the following five phases: Discovery, Corrective Action,  Assertion/Evaluation, Validation, and SSAE No. 16 Examination.

The deliverables from the  service provider are then reviewed by the FIAR Directorate during the  Assertion/Evaluation Phase. Based on its review of the deliverables, the  FIAR Directorate determines whether the service provider is audit ready  and, if so, authorizes the service provider to engage an auditor to perform  an SSAE No. 16 examination. If the FIAR Directorate determines that the  service provider is not audit ready, the FIAR Directorate provides  feedback, which the service provider has to address before resubmitting  the required deliverables for review. After the auditor completes the SSAE  No. 16 examination and issues the report, the service provider submits a  copy of the SSAE No. 16 examination report to the FIAR Directorate and  evidence that it has implemented corrective actions to remediate the  deficiencies identified by the auditor, if any. As part of the Validation  Phase, the FIAR Directorate reviews the SSAE No. 16 report and  supporting documentation of the implemented additional corrective  actions to determine if the service provider is ready for a second SSAE  No. 16 examination and, if so, authorizes the service provider to engage  an auditor to perform a second SSAE No. 16 examination. If the service  provider receives an unqualified opinion on the first SSAE No. 16  examination, the FIAR Directorate will not require the service provider to  undergo a second audit as part of the SSAE No. 16 Examination Phase.

Figure 2 illustrates the  relevant systems and end-to-end process, which includes contract input,  invoice entitlements, pre-validation, disbursing, Treasury reporting,  accounting and reconciliation, and contract closeout and reconciliation  processes.  1.  Contract input: The components electronically transmit contract  award data and related document images through their contract  writing systems into the Mechanization of Contract Administration  Services (MOCAS) system. DFAS reported that some contract  awards are issued with manually produced documents, which the  components mail or fax to DFAS for input into MOCAS. DFAS\u2019s  Contract Input Branch personnel validate the contract data before  inputting them into MOCAS.  2.  Invoice entitlements: Contractors electronically transmit invoices to  DFAS for payment processing in MOCAS; however, if these invoices  do not pass a series of automatic validation edits in MOCAS, they are  rejected by the system. DFAS\u2019s Entitlement branch personnel process  these transactions utilizing its Entitlement Automation System  (EAS). MOCAS perform edits to validate the invoices in MOCAS or  EAS and compare the contract obligations, invoices, and receiving  reports. DFAS\u2019s entitlement branch personnel also utilize the  Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) tool during the entitlement  process to monitor and validate the contractors\u2019 invoices. The BAM  tool is a monitoring capability that DFAS uses to identify potential  erroneous or improper payments.  3.  Pre-validation: The Elimination of Unmatched Disbursements (EUD)  system transmits invoice data to the components\u2019 accounting  systems. The components review the invoice data transmitted by  EUD and approve the invoices for payment.  4.  Disbursing: Once the components approve the invoices for payment,  the components notify DFAS disbursing operations personnel who  input the approval status into MOCAS. MOCAS processes the  approved invoices to be paid either by check or electronic funds  transfer (EFT). MOCAS generates a disbursement file that identifies  all invoices to be paid. A certifying official reviews the disbursement  file for accuracy prior to payment being made. After approval by the  certifying official, DFAS\u2019s Disbursing Operations personnel either mail  the checks to contractors or transmit the EFT file to the Federal  Reserve Bank to make the payment.  5.  Treasury reporting: Once the disbursements are processed,  MOCAS interfaces with the Defense Cash Accountability System  (DCAS), which is the system used by DFAS to generate and submit  monthly reports on contract pay disbursements to the Department of  the Treasury (Treasury).  6.  Accounting and reconciliation: DFAS\u2019s Contract Branch personnel  generate a disbursement file from MOCAS that is provided to the  components to record the contract disbursements into their general  ledgers. DFAS is also responsible for the reconciliation of the  disbursements transactions in MOCAS to the components\u2019 general  ledgers; however, DFAS has yet to implement this process.  7.  Contract closeout and reconciliation: DFAS\u2019s Contract Branch  personnel assist the components during the contract closeout and  reconciliation processes, for example, with paying final vouchers and,  when needed, resolving unreconciled balances on a contract. DFAS  officials explained that they utilize the Standard Contract  Reconciliation Tool (SCRT) to investigate differences in contract  payment data between MOCAS and the components\u2019 general ledgers  upon request from the components and to process the necessary  adjustments.

However, DFAS  has not established a time frame for when the CONOPS will be  completed. In addition, our review of the draft CONOPS and existing  mission work agreements showed that they do not address all the  requirements reflected in the FIAR Guidance. For example, these  documents do not:  identify the roles and responsibilities for authorizing, initiating,  processing, recording, and reporting of transactions;  identify the roles and responsibilities for the creation, completion, and  retention of supporting documentation; and  identify the supporting documentation that should be retained for each  business process and transaction type.", "DFAS officials stated that they did not assess materiality and risk level for  determining what processes, systems, and controls needed to be  included in DFAS\u2019s contract pay FIP because their approach consisted of  including in the FIP the processes and systems that were common to at  least three or more components. By applying this approach, they  determined that the three processes that were excluded were used by  two or fewer components. For example, each client has a different  general ledger system; therefore, DFAS did not consider the general  ledger reconciliation process to be a common service. However, this  approach did not comply with the requirements in the FIAR Guidance,  which requires service providers to determine the processes to be  covered in the FIP based on whether the process is critical to the audit  readiness efforts as defined by both materiality and risk. As a result, and  as shown in figure 4, DFAS excluded from the FIP three of its key  contract pay processes: (1) reporting of disbursements to Treasury,   (2) accounting and reconciliation of contract pay disbursements to the  components\u2019 general ledgers, and (3) contract closeout.", "These processes excluded by DFAS from its FIP are intended to help  ensure that the contract disbursements processed by DFAS are  accurately recorded and maintained in the components\u2019 general ledgers  and that the status of DOD\u2019s contract obligations is accurate and up-to- date. At the time of the implementation of its contract pay FIP, DFAS had  not established a general ledger reconciliation process. DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation (FMR) requires DFAS to reconcile  disbursements transactions to the components\u2019 general ledger, and the  FIAR Guidance notes that the DOD components will not be able to  successfully pass an audit without transaction-level reconciliation to the  general ledger. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that control activities such as reconciliations are an integral part of  an entity\u2019s planning, implementing, reviewing, and accountability for  stewardship of government resources and achieving effective results.  DFAS officials explained that DFAS is evaluating the three processes  excluded from its contract pay FIP for each of the components to support  their audit readiness efforts and that they will provide the results of these  efforts to the affected components before the components assert audit  readiness for contract pay. Specifically, these officials indicated that they  have established a general ledger reconciliation process and plan to  evaluate it and the other two processes (i.e., the reporting of  disbursements to Treasury and contract closeout processes) in support of  the Departments of the Navy, Air Force, and Army with a completion date  of June 2014.

The FIAR Guidance requires service providers to validate  the population of transactions to be tested prior to performing internal  control and substantive testing by reconciling the population to the  general ledger and assessing it for invalid transactions, abnormal  balances, and missing data fields. As noted earlier, at the time of the  implementation of its contract pay FIP, DFAS had not established a  general ledger reconciliation process.", "In response to our inquiries, DFAS officials stated that they had validated  the populations and provided to us a copy of a data reliability  assessment. According to the FIAR Guidance, a data reliability  assessment is intended to document a comparison of the transaction data  to the components\u2019 general ledgers and data mining performed to identify  any outliers. However, the data reliability assessment provided by DFAS  did not contain such a comparison or address data mining activities.  Instead, the data reliability assessment provided background information  on the Shared Data Warehouse (SDW), which is the database used by  DFAS to generate the samples of transactions tested. SDW was  developed by DFAS as a tool to generate reports for the disbursements  recorded in MOCAS because MOCAS has limited query capabilities. As a  result, SDW is used by DFAS to store contract administration and  payment data collected from MOCAS, conduct queries, and produce  reports. Because SDW is a database that stores data from MOCAS, this  comparison is not an adequate reconciliation and, in essence, represents  a comparison of the transactions recorded in MOCAS to MOCAS itself.  An effective reconciliation process would involve comparing transactions  to supporting documentation, systems of record, or both to ensure the  completeness, validity, and accuracy of financial information. Even if  DFAS had performed an adequate reconciliation process, according to  the data reliability assessment that DFAS provided, the population of  transactions validated by DFAS only covered the disbursements for 1  day, not the population of data for the entire fiscal year that was used by  DFAS to select the samples that were tested.", "DFAS did not identify any deficiencies related to its substantive testing of  the contract disbursements recorded in MOCAS and identified 20  deficiencies related to its internal control testing.

DFAS officials told us that they decided to focus the entity-level  testing on the 122 controls identified by the FIAR Guidance as having the  highest relevance for a financial statement audit because of resource  constraints. Based on the entity-level controls that were tested, DFAS  identified 20 general control deficiencies at the entity level that were  related to either the design or operation of controls, such as inappropriate  segregation of duties and inadequate monitoring of system access  privileges. However, because of the limited testing performed, additional  deficiencies may exist that were not identified.", "DFAS officials acknowledged that they needed to assess the other 139  entity-level controls and planned to perform such an assessment during  fiscal year 2014. However, as stated previously, DFAS asserted in  October 2013 that its contract pay process was audit ready and did so  without having assessed these 139 entity-level controls. Without effective  entity-level general controls, application-level controls may be rendered  ineffective by circumvention or modification. As a result, these  deficiencies can materially affect the effectiveness of DFAS application- level controls. For example, edits designed to preclude users from  entering unreasonably large dollar amounts in a payment processing  system can be an effective application control. However, this control  cannot be relied on if the general controls permit unauthorized program  modifications that might allow some payments to be exempt from the edit.", "Application-level controls: DFAS performed application-level testing for  the six system applications it determined to be key to its contract pay  systems. However, DFAS did not develop audit plans or strategies to  guide its application-level control testing for all six systems and did not  perform sufficient testing for three of its systems\u2014BAM, SCRT, and EUD- Accounting Pre-validation Module (APVM). The FIAR Guidance requires  service providers to follow the Federal Information System Controls Audit  Manual (FISCAM) to test the IT controls of the systems and applications  that are necessary to achieve audit readiness. FISCAM requires a  written audit program or strategy that describes the objective, scope, and  methodology for the testing of IT controls. Entities are required to use the  information documented in the audit plan or strategy to determine the  nature, timing, and extent of the IT test procedures. DFAS officials  explained that they did not document a plan or strategy for application- level controls because they were performing self-assessments and not  audits. They also stated that some of their staff members did not know  how to perform a FISCAM audit and that this was a learning experience.  However, the FIAR Guidance requires DOD components to follow a  process similar to an audit to obtain sufficient evidence that the  organization is audit ready. DFAS officials stated that they recognized  that the assessments could be improved, but noted that the FIAR  Directorate had validated the results of its application-level testing.", "In addition, DFAS did not perform sufficient application-level testing for  BAM, SCRT, and EUD-APVM. Out of the 163 controls required by the  FIAR Guidance to be considered for each system, DFAS tested 40  controls for EUD-APVM, 32 for BAM, and 9 for SCRT. DFAS provided us  a document to support how it selected the key controls that were tested  for these systems and its reasoning for excluding from the testing most of  the controls that are required by the FIAR Guidance. However, this  document did not adequately support DFAS\u2019s scope and methodology for  testing these systems. For example, the document stated that either  limited or no testing was performed of certain control areas, such as the  application-level general controls for Security Management and  Contingency Planning, because those controls were tested at the entity or  system level; however, DFAS\u2019s review of entity-level controls did not  cover any application-related controls. Further, as stated earlier, DFAS  did not perform sufficient testing of its entity-level controls.

DISA\u2019s SSAE No. 16 report also recognized the need for  its user entities to implement complementary controls in different areas,  including backup and recovery management. As a result, the application- level testing performed by DFAS for BAM, SCRT, and EUD-APVM was  not sufficient and did not comply with the FIAR Guidance.", "Based on its limited testing of application-level controls, DFAS identified a  total of 359 deficiencies. For example, DFAS found deficiencies in its  access controls, such as a lack of processes to ensure that users\u2019 system  access is authorized and limited to job responsibilities. DFAS also found a  lack of adequate policies and procedures to ensure proper segregation of  duties and related monitoring processes. Because DFAS did not use a  documented plan or strategy, and did not have adequate evidence on  whether its application-level control testing was adequately designed, it  did not obtain the necessary assurance that its contract pay data are  valid, complete, and accurate.

For example, half of these  corrective action plans only described the control requirements from  FISCAM but did not describe the underlying root cause of the  deficiencies identified by DFAS. As a result, these corrective action  plans do not provide sufficient information to perform an independent  review to determine whether an implemented corrective action  remediated the identified deficiency.", "For the remaining 7 deficiencies, DFAS did not provide adequate  documentation to support that the corrective action plans were  adequately implemented. For example, DFAS provided us a copy of a  documented procedure as support for the implementation of one of its  corrective action plans; however, the documented procedure provided  by DFAS was not relevant to the identified deficiency. In addition,  DFAS did not provide support that a corrective action had been tested  and had successfully remediated the deficiency, and for another  deficiency the test results showed that it had not been successfully  remediated by the implemented corrective action.
