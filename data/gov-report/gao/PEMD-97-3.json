In 1994, DOD set up groups to identify, coordinate, or implement process improvements to reduce \u201ccost drivers\u201d believed to cause increases in the price DOD pays for goods and services.

The greatest 1-year percentage decline in the procurement budget\u2019s growth was the 80-percent decline in 1945, following World War II. The greatest increase was the 372-percent increase in 1951, preceding the Korean War. These periods represent the most extreme past cases of growth increase and decrease. In post-World War II history, the period 1985-95 represents the longest consistent decline in the procurement budget.

In the past 20 years, DOD has spent more in procuring aircraft, guided missiles, and electronics and communications equipment than in procuring other major hard goods for national defense. (See figure 3.) In particular, expenditures for aircraft exceeded all others during the period.", "DOD\u2019s 1975-94 prime contract awards for aircraft, missiles, and electronics and communications equipment show a trend in which spending exceeded that on other weapon systems. Figure 3 shows that aggregate procurement spending on aerospace products has been 65 percent greater since 1975 than the cumulative spending on ships, tanks, weapons, and ammunition.Contract awards for missiles, electronics and communications equipment, and especially aircraft peaked in the 1980s. While their levels have since fallen, DOD\u2019s constant dollar spending for aircraft, missiles, and electronics and communications equipment, and for most other major hard goods, is the same or nearly the same as just prior to the peacetime defense buildup of the early 1980s.", "The change in post-Cold War procurement contract spending has not been constant or equal across procurement programs. While the average post-Cold War reductions in spending for aircraft in 1990-94 were the smallest, at 3.6 percent, reductions in spending for ammunition were the largest, at 18.7 percent.

The participants can be small or small disadvantaged businesses or large businesses. For example, companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have received subcontractor awards under this program. DOD\u2019s published sources did not permit us to determine awards by weapon system or industrial segment but we were able to observe that the trends in the dollar amounts awarded to subcontractors are similar to those for prime contractors. Subcontractor awards peaked in the 1980s and began a gradual decline in 1989. The average change in post-Cold War funding available through DOD\u2019s subcontractor program is \u20136.7 percent.", "A recent RAND report sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) indicates that in the aerospace industry, small suppliers to \u201clarge military aircraft programs\u201d receive about 10 percent of defense dollars that go to contractors. Therefore, in some cases, reductions in defense spending should be expected to affect small suppliers differently relative to large defense firms.

Post-Cold War cutbacks in defense spending have been associated with declining employment in military force levels, federal defense-related civilian employment, and defense-related employment in private industry. On the one hand, DOD estimates show a 39-percent decrease in defense-related employment between 1989 and 1997\u2014approximately 5 percent per year. DOL reports that private employment generated by defense spending fell by 600,000 jobs between 1987 and 1992 and projects at least an additional 1.2 million job losses by 1997. Between 1989 and 1994, McDonnell-Douglas Corporation reduced its total corporate staff by approximately 70,000 people.", "On the other hand, the Defense Conversion Commission reported to DOD that the concept of job loss can overstate the effect of the post-Cold War drawdown on employment because it does not account for the ability of the economy to absorb dislocated workers. The commission estimated that the drawdown will account for less than 2 percent of all unemployment between 1992 and 1999. In a report to the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, CBO found that cuts in defense spending, or in any type of federal spending, will temporarily reduce employment. However, it notes that defense cuts that are matched by increases in public-sector investment, or nondefense spending, can offset the short-term effects of spending reductions. CBO reports that overall growth in the U.S. economy is a greater factor in reemployment for displaced defense workers than what happens in the defense sector. CBO reports, as well as other reports we reviewed, also indicate that the effect of reduced defense spending on employment varies by regions of the country, whereas those that are less dependent on defense spending are generally affected to a lesser extent.", "We analyzed available indicators of defense sector employment and an indicator of DOD procurement outlays linked to those sectors over the period of our study to determine the strength of the relationship between the two (see appendix II for methods discussion). We found a statistical relationship between the available indicators of employment levels and procurement outlays for the period 1975-91 that was not large in size and is less than values considered moderate in size (r =.27 to .36, depending upon the indicator used). (See appendix III.)

When AIA data on unit production are plotted with trends in DOD\u2019s aircraft procurement budget, there is a trend between 1969 and 1986 in which more aircraft procurement money is associated with the production of fewer aircraft. From about 1986 to 1993, the trend shows a relatively constant number of aircraft being produced while aircraft procurement budgets have declined.", "In other segments of the aerospace industry, in its 1995 assessment of the helicopter industry DOD projects that the unit cost for military helicopters will increase while the number of units produced will remain relatively flat through 2004. DOD expects to procure fewer, \u201cmore capable,\u201d higher-cost helicopters rather than larger quantities of lower-cost helicopters. Other DOD data on trends in ship and tank procurement indicate that DOD is purchasing fewer units at higher costs. One explanation for this trend is that the complexity and sophistication of weapons, and related weapons manufacturing processes, have increased over time.

The dollar value of the contracts and the solicitation procedures used are recorded in DOD\u2019s DD350 database. It provided us with trend data on where the defense dollar was being spent and in what solicitation category it was being spent, such as \u201cfull and open competition\u201d and \u201cother than full and open competition.\u201d Hence, using the DD350 data, we measured one aspect of competition: the total dollars awarded in each solicitation category.", "The shortcoming of this database is that it does not fully capture the number of offers received in response to solicitations in each solicitation category, which could be another indicator of competition.", "The DD350 serves as a basis for internal reports and reports to other agencies and the Congress and contains the only available data on the dollar amounts of contract actions for full and open and other than full and open competition. The \u201cother than full and open competition\u201d category captures instances where DOD uses various authorities to limit competition such as soliciting only one source when awarding follow-on contracts or when a \u201cunique source\u201d exists (see table III.1 for a complete list of authorities).", "Among all the legal authorities for using other than full and open competition, dollars awarded under the broad category \u201conly one source\u201d accounted for 80 percent of the total contract dollars between 1986 and 1994. Included in this broad category are \u201cfollow-on contracts\u201d (17 percent of the total), awards to a \u201cunique source\u201d (37 percent of the total), and awards categorized as \u201conly one source-other\u201d (25 percent of the total).", "DOD\u2019s data on competition in contracting reveal that in the categories of major hard goods we looked at, over the past 18 years, the money associated with major systems procurement has been greater for contracts awarded using other than competitive methods than for those awarded using competitive ones. We found this trend as an 18-year average (see figure 5 and figure 6) and in each individual year for most programs in the period. (See also appendix III.3, figure III.16.)", "DOD\u2019s definition of its competitive and other than competitive contracting procedures on the DD350, used as guides in our work, are shown in appendix III, table III.1.

Figure 6 shows \u201cpost-CICA\u201d data, for 1986-94. We note that pre- and post-CICA data are based on different categories of required information that DOD collected concerning the use of competitive or other than competitive procedures used to award procurement contracts. Differences between pre- and post-CICA data stem from the 1984 enactment of CICA. In our work for this request, we did not audit the pre- and post-CICA data derived from the DD350. Therefore, the full extent of differences between pre- and post-CICA data and the accuracy of DOD\u2019s reported data for both time periods would require more evaluation.", "In general figures 5 and 6 show similar findings, although the data presented are different measures of competition used in pre- and post-CICA periods. The portion of average contract dollars awarded using noncompetitive methods ranged from 66 percent for ships to 80 percent for aircraft (figure 5). For the post-CICA period, the range for other than full and open competition was 58 percent for ships and 81 percent for ammunition (figure 6).", "Post-Cold War Restructuring and Reform. The major defense contractors we spoke with indicated that in the post-Cold War drawdown, defense companies have been acting to improve production efficiency, reduce costs and overhead, streamline operations, and reorient themselves toward a more cost-conscious customer. One outcome of changes in the way defense firms have been doing business since the Cold War, with relevance for competition, is a reduction in the number of independent defense firms by company mergers and acquisitions or by companies leaving the defense business. Notable examples include the March 1995 merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, Lockheed Martin\u2019s acquisition of Loral\u2019s defense electronics and systems integration business, the intended Boeing-McDonnell-Douglas merger, Raytheon\u2019s purchase of Texas Instruments defense unit, and Northrop-Grumman\u2019s acquisition of Westinghouse defense electronics. In other areas of defense industry, the January 1994 agreement between FMC Corporation\u2019s Defense Systems Group and Harsco\u2019s BMY-Combat Systems Division to form United Defense Limited Partnership (UDLP) changed three major competitors in the light and medium armored vehicle market to two: UDLP and General Dynamics Land Systems.", "A goal of business restructuring in the post-Cold War environment is to enhance or at least maintain a competitive position in the marketplace. We did not evaluate the effect of the recent trend in mergers and acquisitions on competition. However, in its 1996 annual report, while supportive of consolidations, DOD has concluded that \u201cConsolidation carries the risk that DOD will no longer benefit from the competition that encourages defense suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality, and stimulate innovation.\u201d Moreover, in its assessment of the conventional ammunition segment, DOD concluded that a reduction in the number of suppliers has reduced competition.", "The number of contractors will continue to decrease, according to DOD\u2019s published findings, officials we interviewed at Booz-Allen and Hamilton and TASC, and projections from officials at McDonnell-Douglas. They expect more mergers in some segments of the defense industry, such as helicopters and missiles, and expect some companies to keep the possibility of acquisition within their long-term strategies. Moreover, at least one noted defense industry expert has reported that barriers to entering the defense business\u2014created by the need for large amounts of capital for preparing contract proposals and by the need to gain access to scientific and engineering talent and to specialized, expensive, production equipment\u2014will continue to lessen the likelihood that new defense companies will enter the market in the near future.", "This post-Cold War process of defense industry consolidation and restructuring may reduce some segments of the defense industry to one major provider. For example, one possible avenue DOD sees to achieve its stated goal of reducing costs for medium and heavy space launches is to consolidate the medium and heavy launcher booster families and \u201cevolve\u201d a new family of launch vehicles. DOD\u2019s procurement plan for this Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) is to have a single provider by 1998.", "While not taking a position on consolidation and mergers, the Defense Science Board\u2019s 1994 report to DOD on the antitrust aspects of defense industry consolidation states that reducing the number of firms capable of developing a suitable design for a new weapon system may lead to higher prices, poorer products, smaller advances in technology, and a reduction in the number, variety, or quality of the proposals that companies submit to DOD. The report further states that congressional findings, industry opinion, and a large body of literature lead to the conclusion that DOD\u2019s regulatory and auditing procedures cannot substitute for competition as a way of ensuring the best mix of price and quality.", "Within its current Defense Acquisition Reform vision, DOD has recently implemented several new acquisition reform programs intended to increase efficiency and value in weapons procurement and to reduce unnecessary costs. DOD\u2019s cost as an independent variable (CAIV) reform represents a move toward making cost the significant driver in system design, compared to the Cold War era in which the emphasis was on systems that could outperform or overwhelm Soviet threats. The fiscal year 1996 Defense Authorization Act simplifies the processes for commercial item acquisition by exempting procurements for commercial items from cost or pricing data requirements. DOD created the Defense Standards Improvement Council to carry out policies mandated in June 1994 by the Secretary of Defense to develop performance-based solicitation requirements and expand the use of nongovernment standards or specifications.", "An assessment of the effect of recent acquisition reforms on DOD\u2019s weapons procurement process and the broader defense industrial base would supplement the information presented here. To date, however, an independent assessment of the effect of DOD acquisition reform initiatives or programs on the issues discussed in this report has not been conducted.

Assessments of a random sample of small California aerospace businesses that supply goods or services to large military aircraft programs show that between 1992 and 1995, 94 percent were still in business while 3 percent had either merged or been acquired.", "Officials at the major defense contractors we visited, the defense industry experts we interviewed, and the annual reports from major defense contractors we reviewed indicate that, in order to survive and remain viable in the funding drawdown, the top companies have, among other things, been (1) attempting to gain market share and to be more competitive for future defense business through mergers and acquisitions; (2) reorganizing and restructuring internally, in ways that involve job losses and layoffs, and reconfiguring job duties; (3) reducing their supplier-subcontractor base; (4) engaging in team concepts or entering joint ventures in which several firms subcontract with one another; (5) expanding defense markets to broaden the international customer base and increase sales; or (6) selling the defense business segments that are not core business units or that do not represent niche markets, as well as exiting segments of the defense industry.", "For various reasons, defense manufacturers have not given emphasis to converting their products or capabilities to commercial ones. Officials at Lockheed Martin have noted that if defense businesses understand commercial markets, they may be able to produce competitive commercial products, but officials at Booz-Allen and Hamilton have emphasized that producing competitively for the commercial sector is different from producing for the defense sector. The production process and infrastructure that have been set up to serve DOD\u2019s customers are markedly different from those of commercial companies manufacturing competitive products for the average consumer. Further, some industry experts suggest that there are no commercial markets for converted military products. However, an official at a large defense firm noted that Rockwell International corporation achieved success in establishing a commercial market for Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. In responding to this issue, however, some top defense firms have survived by investing in mergers and acquisitions and by reorganizing and downsizing their companies.", "The defense industry experts and major defense contractors we spoke with agreed that companies that choose to stay in a post-Cold War defense industry must remain viable and competitive. They indicated that while industry consolidation can help them do this, the heart of consolidation is the reduction of overcapacity. Overcapacity increases costs through excess, underutilized overhead. When fewer dollars are available, companies must reduce costs in order to remain competitive. DOD also views the elimination of excess capacity as a means of achieving some cost-savings.", "Booz-Allen and Hamilton has pointed out that while mergers and acquisitions have the potential to produce cost savings, particularly administrative savings, cost-savings benefits associated with consolidation are limited if excess production capacity is not reduced. They note that reduction of excess product design capability, as well as general production capacity, should be addressed in consolidation decisions. Booz-Allen and Hamilton also notes that cost-savings are minimized to the degree that merging companies or segments have dissimilar business. Similarly, internal company reorganization, teaming, and joint ventures may not result in any real savings if excess production capacity is not eliminated. Increasing foreign military sales might help spread out overhead costs normally charged to DOD but only as long as production lines remain open for weapons to be purchased by international customers.", "Although DOD\u2019s industrial assessments have all claimed that consolidating the defense industry will produce cost-savings, our past work, our review of research from DOD and the private sector, and our discussions with industry consultants and defense contractors all suggest that this assumption should continue to be studied, tested, and validated.", "There are efforts to study costs and savings associated with specific defense business combinations. Section 818 of Public Law 103-337 requires DOD to provide the Congress with the projected amounts of costs and savings for defense contractor mergers or acquisitions when DOD is asked to reimburse the contractor for the costs associated with company restructuring. At the time we completed our work, under this provision, DOD had so far certified restructuring payment for three business combinations: United Defense Limited Partnership between FMC Corporation, Defense Systems Group, and Harsco Corporation, BMY Combat Systems Division; Martin Marietta Corporation purchase of multiple business entities of GE Aerospace; and Northrop Corporation purchase of Grumman Corporation. Further, under section 818, GAO has a requirement to report to the Congress on restructuring costs. At the time we completed our work, we had issued two reports under this provision.Aside from reimbursements for restructuring costs, section 818 does not provide for analysis and validation of the type of broad cost-savings claims that appear in some of DOD\u2019s published industrial assessment reports. Moreover, in both reports, we found that defense contractor\u2019s estimates of savings associated with business consolidation activity, submitted for official DOD review and certification, were greater than the estimates DOD could later verify. Finally, we have also reported that although contractors have been reducing overhead rates by consolidating facilities and by other means, they have been projecting future increases in overhead rates.", "Vertical integration in defense industry was pointed out, by one external reviewer and DOD officials who reviewed a draft of this report, as an emerging issue of interest or concern for the defense industry linked to recent defense industry consolidation activity. Vertical integration can occur in multiple ways. Vertical integration that occurs when major prime contractors acquire control of key components that make up the systems they sell has recently received attention. Industrial concentration that occurs through the acquisition of lower-tier firms by prime contractors can create the opportunity for contractors to freeze out of the market competitors that do not have access to these particular components. An external reviewer noted that vertical integration can allow prime contractors to shut out as sellers traditional second- and third-tier component suppliers who normally sell to the prime contractors.", "A DSB task force on vertical integration convened in September 1996, at the request of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. The task force is expected to issue a report in 1997. We note that the effect on lower-tier smaller suppliers is considered by one industry leader as a relevant issue in assessing vertical integration. In our work, we were limited in our ability to obtain comprehensive data about smaller subcontractors in the post-Cold War defense industry. However, we believe that the effect of defense industry consolidation is fully understood by reviewing the state of the smaller defense subcontractors in addition to the larger prime contractors. Given that small suppliers may typically concentrate on making one or a handful of products, compared to a broader mix among the primes, industry activity that limits the market for small suppliers may exert a disproportionate impact on them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of a draft of this report to the Department of Defense.

The aggregate incremental costs for Vietnam were $110.6 billion from 1965 to 1976 and include the transition period. The aggregate incremental costs for Desert Shield and Desert Storm were $1.9 billion from 1990, projected to 1998. That they appear to have been considerably less than those for Vietnam may be partly because the Persian Gulf war was much shorter but also because DOD received for it offset payments from foreign nations that totaled at least $48.4 billion. 2.

What are the trends in indicators of employment, productivity, and competition over time?", "In developing methods to address these issues, we interviewed and consulted with knowledgeable experts in the defense industry from the private and federal sectors as well as defense contractors on trends in employment, productivity, and competition. Given the scope of our work, the most comprehensive employment data were available from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers series published by the Bureau of the Census. The macro-level quantitative data we used were indicators of productivity and data that are relevant to the evaluation of competition. For productivity, they included the value of production output in defense-concentrated industries from DOL\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). From DOD offices and AIA records, we obtained limited information on units produced for some defense sectors. For competition, it included dollars spent on procurement contracts awarded using competitive and other than competitive procedures identified on the DD350 form and retrieved from DOD\u2019s DD350 database. We describe these measures in detail.", "The employment and productivity data were defined according to separate defense-concentrated industry groups\u2014a cluster of one or more manufacturing industries identified by a four-digit Standard Industrial Classification code. DOD, Commerce, and DOL, as well as private research firms that study trends in defense industry, refer to them as \u201cdefense-dependent\u201d or \u201cdominant\u201d industries because a large proportion of their output is purchased for defense purposes. For example, in 1985, shipbuilding, ammunition (except small arms ammunition), ordnance (not elsewhere classified), and aircraft and missile engines industries produced 75 percent or more of their output for defense. Nondefense related output produced by these industries may be purchased by commercial companies, other U.S. government offices, or international companies. When we conducted our work for this report, aircraft, guided missiles, ammunition and ordnance, tanks, electronics and communications equipment, and shipbuilding and repairing were the principal defense-concentrated industry groups identified by defense industry researchers in federal agencies and private research organizations.", "The value of production output in defense-concentrated industries is measured by productivity indexes that we obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Office of Productivity and Technology. The index BLS provided\u2014the constant-dollar value of production output per hour\u2014is derived by dividing an index of the value of production (shipments, revenue, or sales) in each of the manufacturing industries by an index of aggregate employee hours. This is a standard measure of productivity used in BLS\u2019 program of productivity measurement and technology studies. The limited data on procurement or production rates we used came from reports prepared by AIA and DOD\u2019s Office of Economic Security and PA&E.", "Extant data from DOD\u2019s DD350 database gave us information about the competitive nature of procurement contracts awarded for major weapon systems or components. We retrieved and analyzed data from the blocks of information on the DD350 that specifically indicated the extent of competitive procedures used to award contracts in pre- and post-CICA time periods (see table III.1). These data provide an indication of the processes DOD uses (that is, competitive or noncompetitive) in awarding weapon procurement contracts to defense contractors. We did not determine the degree to which these processes are reliable indicators of competition or noncompetition within the defense industry. 4. How are employment productivity and competition related to indicators of defense spending?", "The available quantitative data permitted us to provide a limited response to this question. We developed methods that made use of existing information and we supplemented the quantitative data with information we collected from the experts we spoke to and our review of existing literature.", "Our quantitative method for examining the relationship between indicators of defense spending and productivity over time involved generating correlation coefficients between available measures of defense budgets and the BLS productivity indexes. For example, we correlated the productivity indexes for the tank industry with DOD\u2019s budgets for tank procurement for the years available. We used the same approach in examining the relationship between indicators of defense spending and defense-related employment: correlating the available measures of total employment in the defense-concentrated industrial sectors from Census with the total dollar amount of contracts awarded for procuring major hard goods (see table I.1 for the categories of major hard goods) over the period of our study (data were available only for the period 1975-91). We also conducted the analysis using DOD budgets (FYDP, TOA) as an indicator of DOD spending linked to defense-concentrated industrial sectors.", "An important issue in selecting appropriate measures of employment in defense-concentrated industrial sectors and an indicator of spending (that is, outlays) linked to those sectors was selecting measures that were independent from one another. For example, in the course of our work we discovered that data on defense-related industry employment reported in DOD\u2019s series of reports on national defense budget estimates (also known as the \u201cgreen book\u201d) is not independent from data on procurement outlays also reported in these series. The lack of independence between the two data sets calls into question the validity, or accuracy, of any correlational analysis done using this data and, of course, any resultant correlation coefficient observed.", "Given available data, we were unable to develop a comparable quantitative method for addressing the relationship between competition and levels of defense spending over time. Our interviews on these relationships with defense contractors and defense industry experts supplemented the quantitative information on defense industry competition that we were able to obtain. 5. What are the trends in the financial indicators of major defense contractors over time?", "Considerable variability characterizes the methods used to determine appropriate financial indicators or financial viability. For example, defense industry analysts at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments indicate that there are at least 12 ways to conduct financial assessments of the defense industrial base. We interviewed Wall Street business analysts, reviewed the procedures DOD recommends for conducting financial assessments, and spoke with defense contractors and industry experts. They agreed that financial viability is best assessed with multiple indicators. We used sales and cash flow because they are conventional indicators and because information on them could easily be retrieved from Standard and Poor\u2019s COMPUSTAT database. Other measures or variables from company income statements that can be used to analyze financial viability include gross income, operating income, and net income.", "Our sample of defense companies included those among the top 100 that received the largest dollar amount of DOD prime contract awards in 1994. So that most of the defense industries would be represented, we included companies that have business units in one or more of the defense industry segments. 6. What is the relationship between indicators of defense spending and indicators of the financial status of major defense contractors over time?", "Our focus was predominantly on trends in the financial status of companies in the last several years of the recent defense spending reduction. We supplemented the information on corporate sales and cash flow from Standard and Poor\u2019s database with reviews of DOD\u2019s assessments of the financial state of major defense companies since the end of the Cold War.

The possible range of a correlation is \u20131 to +1. A correlation of zero means that two numbers (variables) are not correlated. A negative correlation means that large values of one number are associated with small values of another number. A number correlated with itself returns a correlation of 1. A correlation coefficient provides an indication of the strength and direction of a linear relationship. In this case, the observed correlation coefficient allows us to determine the strength of the relationship between indicators of defense industry employment and defense spending over a specific time period. The procedures used to generate a correlation coefficient, by themselves, make it impossible to determine whether changes in one variable cause changes in another variable. More analysis is required to reach such conclusions.", "Declining defense-related employment since the post-Cold War spending reduction began has been described. We statistically compared total employment in the defense-concentrated industrial sectors where data were available (aircraft, ammunition and ordnance, shipbuilding, electronics and communications equipment, and tank manufacturing) to an indicator of defense spending linked to those sectors (total amount of contract awards for major hard goods procurement) for the years data were available (1975-91). The observed correlation, r = .27, indicates that the strength of the relationship is not large and is less than values considered moderate in size.", "In addition to the limits of correlational analysis stated above, other factors limit the ability to generate definite determinations or generalizations about the relationship between defense spending and defense industry employment.
