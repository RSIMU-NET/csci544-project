This statement is based on these two reports and discusses prior GAO findings on (1) REAC inspections and inspector oversight and (2) lead paint hazards. For the March 2019 report, GAO reviewed HUD documents and data related to REAC's physical inspection process. For the June 2018 report, GAO reviewed HUD documents and information related to its compliance efforts, performance measures, and reporting.", "In March 2019, GAO made 14 recommendations to HUD to improve the physical inspections process and oversight of inspectors. In June 2018, GAO made six recommendations to HUD to improve compliance monitoring processes, inspection standards, and performance assessment and reporting on lead reduction efforts in federally assisted properties. HUD generally agreed with these recommendations. As of November 2019, HUD officials had identified planned steps to implement most of these recommendations but had not fully addressed them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) plays an important role in providing decent and safe housing for households receiving federal rental assistance. However, HUD needs to improve its physical inspection program and its efforts to identify and address lead paint hazards in federally assisted housing. To that end, GAO made 20 recommendations on these issues in its March 2019 and June 2018 reports.", "Physical inspections of properties. HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) is responsible for conducting physical inspections of HUD-assisted properties. Despite longstanding processes to inspect properties and take action against owners who do not address physical deficiencies, HUD continues to find some properties in poor physical condition and with life-threatening health and safety issues. In a March 2019 report, GAO identified a number of areas in which HUD needed to improve its physical inspection process and oversight of inspectors, which could help ensure the health and safety of those who live in HUD-assisted properties. For example, REAC had not conducted a comprehensive review of its inspection process since 2001, although new risks to the process have emerged since then. A comprehensive review could help REAC identify risks and ensure it meets the goal of producing reliable inspections.", "In addition, REAC uses contractors to inspect properties; these contract inspectors are trained and overseen by HUD staff known as quality assurance inspectors. However, GAO found REAC lacked formal mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of its training program for contractor inspectors and for HUD employees responsible for monitoring and overseeing contract inspectors. And, unlike professional inspection organizations, REAC does not have continuing education requirements. Formal mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of its training program and requirements for continuing education could help REAC ensure its program supports development needs of inspectors and that inspectors are current on any changes in policy or industry standards.", "Lead paint hazards. GAO also identified a number of areas in which HUD could improve its efforts to identify and address lead paint hazards to protect children from lifelong health problems. Lead paint hazards (such as dust containing lead and chips from deteriorated lead-based paint) are the most common source of lead exposure for U.S. children. In a June 2018 report, GAO identified shortcomings in HUD's compliance monitoring and enforcement, inspection standards, and performance assessment and reporting for lead-reduction efforts. For example, HUD's monitoring efforts relied in part on public housing agencies to self-certify compliance with lead paint regulations. Additionally, the lead inspection standard for the voucher program is less strict than that for the public housing program. As a result, children living in voucher units may receive less protection from lead paint hazards than children living in public housing. Furthermore, GAO found that HUD did not track the number of lead-safe housing units in the voucher or public housing programs. Therefore, HUD may not be fully aware of the extent to which children have been living in unsafe units."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to submit this statement on the Department of Housing and  Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) efforts to ensure that households receiving  federal rental assistance live in decent and safe housing.

The Secretary of  Housing and Urban Development has stated that the department has no  higher calling than to make certain that taxpayer-supported housing is  healthy for vulnerable families to live in. To ensure decent and safe  housing, HUD performs regular physical inspections and enforces lead  paint regulations for HUD-assisted housing. In recent reports, we have  found weaknesses in HUD\u2019s execution of its responsibilities in both of  these areas.", "HUD\u2019s Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) is responsible for  conducting physical inspections of multifamily and public housing  properties. However, despite longstanding processes to inspect  properties and take action against owners who do not address physical  deficiencies, HUD continues to find some properties that are in poor  physical condition and with life-threatening health and safety issues.  Members of Congress, the HUD Inspector General, and media reports  have raised concerns about properties that may receive inspection scores  that are not a true representation of their physical condition. For example,  in 2015, Eureka Gardens, a multifamily housing complex in Jacksonville,  Florida, received a passing score on its REAC inspection but was later  found to have physical deficiencies consistent with a much lower score.", "In addition, concerns have been raised by members of Congress and the  HUD Inspector General that HUD-assisted properties may not comply  with lead paint regulations. Although lead-based paint was banned for  residential use in 1978, hazards still exist in millions of homes. Lead paint  hazards (such as dust containing lead and chips from deteriorated lead- based paint) are the most common source of lead exposure for U.S.  children. Lead exposure can cause serious, irreversible cognitive damage  that can impair a child for life. Young children are at greater risk of being  exposed to lead because they often crawl on the floor, have frequent  hand-to-mouth activity, and may ingest nonfood items.", "Questions exist about HUD\u2019s ability to identify and address lead paint  hazards. False certifications by some public housing authorities (PHA)  that their properties comply with HUD\u2019s lead paint regulations continue to  be a problem. For example, a New York City Department of Investigation  report found that the New York City Housing Authority failed to conduct  required lead inspections, knowingly filed false certifications of  compliance with HUD, and failed to put adequate systems in place to  confirm the accuracy of lead certifications before they were made. After  a federal investigation, in January 2019 New York City and the New York  City Housing Authority settled with HUD, agreeing to increased oversight  and funding to remediate the issues.", "This statement is based primarily on two previously issued GAO reports:  a March 2019 report on HUD\u2019s inspection standards and a June 2018  report on lead paint hazards in HUD-assisted housing.

For example, REAC staff have raised concerns that  some property owners have taken advantage of the scoring system and  others have misrepresented the conditions of their properties.  Specifically, because more points are deducted for deficiencies on the  property site than for deficiencies in a dwelling unit, some property  owners prioritize site repairs over unit repairs. Additionally, some property  owners attempt to cover up, rather than address, deficiencies\u2014such as  by using mulch on a building exterior to hide erosion. REAC staff also  have raised concerns about property owners employing current or former  REAC contract inspectors to help prepare for an inspection, sometimes  by guiding owners to repair just enough to pass inspection rather than  comprehensively addressing deficiencies. REAC also continues to find  that some contract inspectors conduct inspections that do not meet  REAC\u2019s quality standards.", "Furthermore, REAC fundamentally changed the entities that conduct  inspections. In 1998, REAC employed a few large inspection companies  to conduct the inspections. However, in 2005, REAC introduced the  reverse auction program and opened up the inspection process to a  larger number of small businesses, which resulted in a change in the  composition of inspectors. We found that without a comprehensive  review, REAC cannot determine if it has been meeting the goal of  producing inspections that are reliable, replicable, and reasonable.", "We recommended that REAC conduct a comprehensive review of the  physical inspection process, and HUD agreed with this recommendation.", "In November 2019, HUD officials told us that they recently completed a  comprehensive review of the physical inspection process. In supporting  documentation, HUD stated that the current model was insufficient for  evaluating HUD-assisted housing when compared to modern  expectations of housing quality, and that there is now a need to focus  more on health and safety of residents and less on asset preservation  and condition and appearance items. We have been assessing HUD\u2019s  recent review to determine whether it is has fully addressed our  recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Sampling Errors", "paragraphs": ["We also found that REAC may not be identifying all properties in need of  more frequent inspections or enforcement actions because it does not  consider sampling errors of the inspection scores. For large properties,  REAC inspects a statistical sample of the property\u2019s units and buildings  rather than all of them. The results for the sample are then used to  estimate a score that represents the condition of the entire property. HUD  takes enforcement action for multifamily properties with a score below 60.  However, sampling introduces a degree of uncertainty, called sampling  error, which statisticians commonly express as a range associated with  numerical results. For example, for a property that scored 62 on its  physical inspection, due to sampling error, the range associated with this  score could be between 56 on the lower bound and 68 on the upper  bound. REAC would consider this a passing score that requires an annual  inspection and no enforcement action, although the lower bound fell  below 60.", "REAC previously calculated sampling errors but ceased doing so in 2013,  according to REAC officials, in part because of a lack of resources and  also because they believed there was no need to calculate them. Based  on our analysis of REAC inspection data, HUD could have taken  enforcement actions against more properties if REAC had taken sampling  errors in inspection scores into account. For example, from fiscal years  2002 through 2013, about 4.3 percent of inspections of multifamily and  public housing properties had an inspection score of 60 or slightly above  60 but had a lower bound score under 60. Without considering sampling  errors when determining whether enforcement action is needed, REAC  will not identify some properties that may require more frequent  inspections or enforcement actions.", "We recommended in our March 2019 report that REAC resume  calculating the sampling error associated with the physical inspection  score for each property, identify what changes may be needed for HUD to  use sampling error results, and consider those results when determining  whether more frequent inspections or enforcement actions would be  needed. HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation.  However, since our report was issued, HUD said that by September 30,  2020, REAC planned to include the standard error calculations in the next  version of its scoring software for physical inspections. REAC officials  also stated that a task team concluded that the use of sampling error  likely would have no impact on any individual enforcement action.  However, REAC\u2019s statement appears to contradict its own policies  because inspection scores alone are used to determine whether some  properties are referred for potential enforcement actions.

For  example, in November 2019, HUD officials said that they were moving  toward a model of contracting with larger firms to conduct physical  inspections of properties. In this model, HUD plans to put the first level of  responsibility on the contractor to do its own due diligence on inspector  candidates, and the contractor would be required to review 25 verifiable  prior inspections completed by each inspector candidate. A REAC official  then would be expected to select a sample of the candidate\u2019s inspections  to review.", "In response to our recommendation about revising training for quality  assurance inspectors, REAC said that it recently began requiring a  minimum of 8 hours of continuing education annually for all quality  assurance staff. As of November 2019, REAC had not yet provided us  with information about the subject matter of that training. Since our report  was issued, REAC also developed continuing education requirements for  contract and quality assurance inspectors, which it said will be required  beginning in January 2020.

On average, REAC conducted inspections for these properties about 6  months past the targeted date. REAC staff told us that there may be  legitimate reasons for not conducting an inspection according to the  targeted date. For example, the Office of Multifamily Housing, which  oversees the performance of properties that receive project-based  assistance, can delay an inspection for reasons such as natural disasters  or major rehabilitation to the property. However, REAC maintains limited  data on the reasons why inspections have been rescheduled or  cancelled. In addition, these data are not readily available to understand  retrospectively why an inspection did not occur on schedule. REAC also  does not track its progress toward meeting its requirement for inspecting  multifamily properties within prescribed time frames.", "REAC\u2019s inability to adhere to the inspection schedule could hinder the  Office of Multifamily Housing\u2019s ability to monitor the physical condition of  properties on a timely basis and take enforcement actions when  warranted. Furthermore, the lack of a mechanism to track REAC\u2019s  progress toward meeting its requirement for inspecting multifamily  properties hinders its ability to determine what factors have contributed to  delays in conducting the inspections. In our March 2019 report, we  recommended that REAC track on a routine basis whether it conducts  inspections of multifamily housing properties in accordance with federal  guidelines for scheduling, as well as coordinate with the Office of  Multifamily Housing to minimize the number of properties that can cancel  or reschedule their physical inspections.

However, we also identified several limitations with HUD\u2019s monitoring  efforts. For example, HUD relies in part on PHAs self-certifying their  compliance with lead paint regulations, but investigations found that some  PHA officials may have falsely certified that they were in compliance.  Also, on-site compliance reviews performed by HUD staff can be used to  determine if PHAs are in compliance with these regulations, but HUD  performs a limited number of these reviews annually.
