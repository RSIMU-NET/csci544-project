GAO's work to accomplish this included reviewing budget, planning, and other documents from NASA; reviewing NASA officials' testimonies; and interviewing NASA and foreign space program officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NASA faces significant challenges in its plans to complete assembly of the International Space Station (ISS) prior to the scheduled retirement of the space shuttle in 2010. Since GAO testified on this issue in July 2007, the shuttle flight schedule has remained aggressive--slating the same number of launches in a shorter period. While NASA thinks the proposed schedule is still achievable, the schedule (1) is only slightly less demanding than it was prior to the Columbia disaster when the agency launched a shuttle every other month with a larger shuttle fleet and (2) leaves little room for the kinds of weather-related, technical, and logistical problems that have delayed flights in the past. Unanticipated delays could result in changes to the station's configuration, that is, some components may not be delivered. We have previously testified that such changes could limit the extent of scientific research that can be conducted on board the ISS. After assembly is completed and the shuttle retires, NASA's ability to rotate crew and supply the ISS will be impaired because of the absence of a vehicle capable of carrying the 114,199 pounds of additional supplies and spares needed to sustain the station until its planned retirement in 2016. For crew rotation and logistics, NASA plans to rely on Russian, European and Japanese vehicles--these vehicles were designed to augment the capabilities of the shuttle, not replace them, and have far less capacity to haul cargo. Furthermore, aside from a single Russian vehicle that can bring back 132 pounds of cargo, no vehicle can return cargo from the ISS after the shuttle is retired; and Commercially developed vehicles--NASA has pledged approximately $500 million for the development of commercial vehicles. NASA expects these vehicles will be ready for cargo use in 2010 and crew use in 2012, even though none of the vehicles currently under development has been launched into orbit yet and their aggressive development schedule leaves little room for the unexpected. If one of these vehicles cannot be delivered according to NASA's current expectations, NASA will have to rely on Russian vehicles to maintain U.S. crew presence on the ISS until the new generation of U.S. spacecraft becomes available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss challenges that the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA) faces in completing and sustaining the  International Space Station (ISS). After delays and redesigns, efforts are  under way for a long-envisioned expansion of the station so it can support  a larger crew and more scientific research. NASA officials estimate the  entire cost to complete the station will total $31 billion, and another $11  billion will be needed to sustain it through its planned decommissioning in  fiscal year 2016.", "The space shuttle has been and is critical to completion of the space  station and re-supplying the station. The shuttle remains the only vehicle  capable of transporting large segments of the station into orbit for  assembly. NASA plans to complete ISS assembly duties and retire the  shuttle fleet in 2010 in order to pursue a new generation of space flight  vehicles for exploration. To that end, NASA has begun the process of  making key decisions on suppliers that will no longer be needed. NASA  officials told us that in many cases, restarting suppliers after these  decisions are made would be cost prohibitive and time consuming.  However, a new NASA vehicle will not be available until 2015 at the  earliest, when the Crew Launch Vehicle (Ares I) and Crew Exploration  Vehicle (Orion) are expected to fly. To fill the gap following retirement of  the shuttle and provide crew rotation and logistical support, NASA plans  to rely on a variety of spacecraft developed by the commercial sector and  other countries.", "In July 2007, we testified on a number of challenges NASA was facing with  regard to completing the ISS within the time constraints created by the  shuttle\u2019s retirement. Those challenges are still relevant. In light of these  issues, we examined the risks and challenges NASA faces in (1)  completing assembly of the ISS by 2010, and (2) providing logistics and  maintenance support to the ISS after 2010.", "In short, our work continued to find that NASA\u2019s plans to complete  assembly of the International Space Station prior to the scheduled  retirement of the  space shuttle at end of fiscal year 2010 require much to  happen and very little to go wrong. While NASA believes the schedule is  still achievable, the flight rate that NASA is projecting is only slightly less  aggressive than it was prior to the Columbia disaster when, from 1992 to  2003, the agency launched a shuttle every other month. At that time, NASA  used four vehicles to maintain its flight schedule. To complete the station  by 2010, NASA will need to maintain a similar flight rate with fewer  shuttles and with a shuttle fleet that is aging and continuing to face fuel  sensor challenges. NASA remains confident that the current manifest can  be accomplished within the given time, and in fact, it has several months  of reserve time in its manifest.  However, agency officials readily admit  that the schedule is aggressive. If delays continue, NASA may need to  reduce the number of flights to the station, which could prevent delivery  of items currently scheduled for assembly and the pre-positioning of  critical spares. Further, while NASA still expects to be able to increase  crew capacity from three to six persons, changes it may need to make to  the space station\u2019s configuration could limit the extent of scientific  research that can be conducted onboard the ISS or quality of life for the  crew.", "After assembly is completed and the shuttle is retired, NASA\u2019s ability to  rotate crew and supply the ISS will be impaired because of the absence of  a vehicle capable of carrying the 114,199 pounds (or 51.8 metric tons) of  additional supplies needed to sustain the station until its planned  retirement in fiscal year 2016. NASA plans to rely on Russian, European  and Japanese vehicles to service the station. Even with these vehicles, this  shortfall remains. While the Russian vehicles are already in service, the  European vehicle just completed its first operational test flight, and  development efforts are still under way on the Japanese vehicle. In  addition, these vehicles were designed to augment the capabilities of the  shuttle, not replace them. Both the European and Japanese vehicles were  designed to deliver supplies to the station but their capacities are not  equal to the shuttle\u2019s 37,864 pounds of capacity. Furthermore, aside from a  single Russian vehicle that can bring back 132 pounds of cargo and rotate  crew, no vehicle can return cargo from the International Space Station  after the shuttle is retired. NASA plans to rely on commercially developed  vehicles to address some of these shortfalls and has pledged  approximately $500 million for their development. NASA expects one of  these vehicles will be ready for cargo use in 2010 and crew use in 2012.  However, no vehicle has successfully been launched into orbit and their  development schedules may leave little room for the unexpected. If these  vehicles cannot be delivered according to NASA\u2019s current expectations,  NASA will have to rely on Russian vehicles to maintain U.S. crew on the  International Space Station until the new generation of U.S. spacecraft  becomes available.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed documents and testimonies by NASA  officials relating to the challenges associated with ISS completion, the  delivery schedule for ISS assembly and replacement units, and the space  shuttle manifest. We reviewed key ISS budget and strategic maintenance  plans, the ISS Independent Safety Task Force Report, and previous GAO  reports relating to the ISS. We visited and interviewed officials responsible  for ISS operations at NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C., and the  Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. At NASA Headquarters, we met  with officials from the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and the  Space Operations Mission Directorate, including representatives from the  International Space Station and space shuttle programs. We met with ISS  and space shuttle officials at the Johnson Space Center. We also talked to  a commercial developer of space vehicles and met with representatives of  foreign space efforts. Complete details of our scope and methodology can  be found in appendix I. We conducted this performance audit from July  2007 to April 2008, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The International Space Station program began in 1993 with several  partner countries: Canada, the 11 member nations of the European Space  Agency (ESA), Japan, and Russia. The ISS has served and is intended to  expand its service as a laboratory for exploring basic questions in a variety  of fields, including commercial, scientific, and engineering research. The  first assembly flight of the station, in which the space shuttle Endeavor  attached the U.S. laboratory module to the Russian laboratory module,  occurred in early December of 1998. However, since the program\u2019s  inception, NASA has struggled with cost growth, schedule delays and re- designs of the station. As we reported in the past, these challenges were  largely due to poorly defined requirements, changes in program content  and inadequate program oversight. Due to these challenges, the  configuration of the station has devolved over time. In the spring of 2001,  NASA announced that it would make major changes in the final  configuration of the ISS to address cost overruns. In 2003, the National  Academies reported that this reconfiguration greatly affected the overall  ability of the ISS to support science. NASA estimates that assembly and  operating costs of the ISS will be between $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion  annually for FY2009-FY2012. The ISS as of February 19, 2008, is  approximately 65 percent complete.", "The shuttle program and the ISS program are inherently intertwined. The  shuttle has unique capabilities in that it can lift and return more cargo to  and from orbit than any other current or planned space vehicle. Figure 1  shows the capabilities of the shuttle in various configurations. Most  segments of ISS cannot be delivered by any other vehicle. For example,  the Columbia disaster in 2003 put ISS assembly on hiatus as NASA ceased  shuttle launches for 2\u00bd years while it investigated the safety of the fleet.  During this period, the Russian Soyuz became the means of transportation  for crewmembers traveling to and returning from the ISS.", "In a major space policy address on January 14, 2004, President Bush  announced his \u201cVision for U.S. Space Exploration\u201d (Vision) and directed  NASA to focus its future human space exploration activities on a return to  the Moon as prelude to future human missions to Mars and beyond. As  part of the Vision, NASA is developing new crew and cargo vehicles, with  the first crew vehicle currently scheduled to be available in 2015. The  President also directed NASA to retire the space shuttle after completion  of the ISS, which is planned for the end of the decade. Based on that  directive, NASA officials told us that they developed a manifest consisting  of 17 shuttle launches to support ISS assembly and supply between 2005  and 2010. Nine of these have taken place. In response to the President\u2019s  Vision, NASA formally set September 30, 2010, as the date that the shuttle  program will cease because agency officials believe that continuing the  program beyond that date will slow development of the agency\u2019s new  vehicles\u2014specifically, the agency budget cannot support both programs at  costs of $2.5 billion to $4 billion above current budget. As shown in Table  1, the shuttle program costs NASA several billion dollars annually and  projected funding is phased out in fiscal year 2011. NASA officials stated  that the majority of shuttle program cost is fixed at roughly $3 billion a  year whether it flies or not. NASA officials stated that the average cost per  flight is $150 million to $200 million.", "The 2005 NASA Authorization Act designated the U.S segment of the ISS  as a national laboratory and directed NASA to develop a plan to increase  the utilization of the ISS by other federal entities and the private sector. In  response, NASA has been pursuing relationships with these entities. NASA  expects that as the nation\u2019s newest national laboratory, the ISS will  strengthen NASA\u2019s relationships with other federal entities and private  sector leaders in the pursuit of national priorities for the advancement of  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Any of these factors  can cause delays that may require NASA to re-evaluate and reconstitute  the assembly sequence. NASA remains confident that the current manifest  can be accomplished within the given time and there are tradeoffs NASA  can make in terms of what it can take up to support and sustain the station  should unanticipated delays occur.

The plan for launches remains aggressive,  partly because NASA plans on completing the ISS with the last assembly  mission in April 2010, with two contingency flights in February and July  2010 to deliver key replacement units. The 5 months between the last  assembly launch and shuttle retirement in September 2010 act as a  schedule reserve, which can be used to address delays. There are 8 shuttle  flights left to complete the station and two contingency flights left to  deliver key components necessary to sustain the ISS after the retirement  of the shuttle. There is an average of 2 \u00bd months between each shuttle  launch. Table 2 shows the current shuttle manifest.", "NASA has launched shuttles at this rate in the past. In fact, the agency  launched a shuttle, on average, every two months from 1992 through the  Columbia disaster in 2003. However, at that time the agency was launching  a fleet of four shuttles. The shuttles require maintenance and refurbishing  that can last four to five months before they can be re-launched.  Launching at such a rate means that the rotation schedule can handle few  significant delays, such as those previously experienced due to weather  and fuel sensor difficulties. Lastly, NASA officials said that Shuttle  Atlantis, which was to go out of service after the Hubble mission, will  return to servicing the ISS for two more flights, which NASA believes will  add more schedule flexibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Launch Delays Remain", "paragraphs": ["NASA officials stated repeatedly that NASA is committed to safely flying  the shuttle until its retirement and will not succumb to schedule pressure.  However, the compressed nature of the manifest will continue to test that  commitment. Fuel sensor challenges continue to surface in the shuttle  fleet. For example, the recent shuttle Atlantis launch was delayed two  months while NASA addressed a fuel sensor problem associated with the  shuttle\u2019s liquid hydrogen tank. This is the same system that caused a 2- week delay in the launch of the shuttle Discovery in 2005.", "There are also challenges associated with the shuttle launch window.  NASA officials told us that the duration of that window is dependent on a  number of factors, which include changes in the position of the earth and  spacecraft traffic restrictions. NASA must consider its traffic model  constraints for vehicles docking at the space station. According to the  traffic model for ISS, no other vehicle can dock while the shuttle is  docked, and each vehicle has constraints on how long it can stay docked.  For example, the shuttle can dock for a maximum of 10 days, while the  Soyuz can dock a maximum of 200 days. The docking of these two  vehicles must be coordinated and meet other technical restrictions.", "In addition, the shuttle has experienced delays due to severe weather,  such as when Atlantis\u2019s external tank was damaged by a hailstorm in 2007.

In  addition, there are two components that have been planned to hold this  and other equipment needed for the six-person crew, which are scheduled  to go up in April 2010.  If unanticipated delays occur, NASA may need to  hold back these two components\u2014known as the Node 3 and the Cupola\u2014 which could constrain the ability to conduct research and the quality of  life on the station for the crew.", "NASA officials emphasized that NASA\u2019s intent was to have most science  conducted on ISS only after the assembly of the ISS was completed. The  ISS currently supports three crewmembers. NASA stated that the majority  of the crew\u2019s time is spent maintaining the station, rather than conducting  scientific study. According to NASA, the crew spends no more than 3  hours per week on science. Completion of the ISS would allow NASA to  expand to a six-person crew who could conduct more research.", "Since the ISS is designated as a national laboratory, the expectation is that  it will support scientific experimentation. NASA is in the process of  negotiating agreements with scientific organizations to support scientific  research on the ISS. NASA officials told us that they are negotiating a  Memorandum of Understanding with the National Institutes of Health to  explore the possibility of scientific experimentation onboard the ISS.

The two contingency flights  of the shuttle have been designated to deliver these key replacement units,  which only the shuttle is capable of carrying. According to NASA, the  original approach to deal with these key components (also known as  orbital replacement units\u2014ORU) was to take the ones that failed or  reached the end of their lifetime back to Earth on the shuttle, refurbish  them and launch them back to ISS for use. As a result of the shuttle  retirement, NASA will no longer be bringing down ORUs to fix. Instead,  NASA officials stated they have adopted a \u201cbuild and burn\u201d philosophy,  which means that after the shuttle retires, instead of being brought down  to be refurbished, ORUs will be discarded and disintegrate upon re-entry  into the atmosphere. To determine how many replacement units need to  be positioned at the station, NASA officials told us they are using data  modeling that has been very effective in determining how long ORUs will  last.

The Soyuz provides crew delivery and rescue capability for  three crew members. Progress vehicles are expendable and offer no  recoverable return capability, but provide important trash removal  capabilities. Soyuz vehicles have a limited recoverable cargo capacity.

It leaves little flexibility in the shuttle schedule. Any  delays could require NASA to choose between completing the station as  planned and the pre-positioning of needed critical spares. The decision  also leaves NASA dependent on Russia for crew rotation services until  other vehicles are developed and demonstrated. And even with the  development of these vehicles, NASA still faces a significant capacity  shortfall in its ability to provide logistical support to the station. The  shortfall may well impact support for a six person crew and the quality of  research that can be conducted on the ISS.  At the same time, it also  provides opportunities to commercial suppliers to demonstrate  capabilities that could have long-term benefits for future U.S. space  exploration and development.  We are not making recommendations as a  result of our review as NASA is well aware of the predicament it faces with  the station and has weighed options and trade-offs for the remainder of  the schedule manifest.  However, it is important that flexibility continue to  be maintained as events impacting schedule occur and that decisions be  made with the goal of maximizing safety and results.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
