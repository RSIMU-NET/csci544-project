The draft discusses (1) selected agencies' plans for, and status in, transitioning to EIS; and (2) the extent to which selected agencies were implementing established transition planning practices. In preparing the report on which this testimony is based, GAO administered a survey to 19 selected agencies that spent at least $10 million on telecommunications in fiscal year 2018 regarding their plans for and status in transitioning to EIS.

All of these agencies reported that they plan to fully transition to EIS program contracts before the current contracts expire in May 2023. However, 11 agencies did not plan to fully transition by the General Services Administration's (GSA) September 30, 2022, milestone. The majority of the selected agencies also did not meet GSA's milestones for completing critical contracting actions in 2019 (see table). While transitioning to EIS is a complex undertaking, delays in making this transition will cause agencies to miss out on potential cost savings that would result from the generally lower rates for services on the EIS program contracts.", "Dates", "GAO's preliminary results indicate that five of the 19 agencies that were selected for further review had partially implemented established planning practices that can help agencies successfully transition their telecommunications services to new contracts. These practices are to: (1) develop an accurate inventory of telecommunications services, (2) perform a strategic analysis of telecommunications requirements, (3) develop a structured transition management approach, (4) identify the resources needed for the transition, and (5) develop a transition plan. The agencies provided several reasons for partially implementing the practices. For example, transition officials at three agencies said that they were not responsible for tracking all of the telecommunications services in use at their agencies; as such, they were unable to provide complete telecommunications inventories. The agencies also planned to implement certain practices after they issue their EIS task orders. However, the limited time remaining to complete the transition makes it critical that agencies conduct early planning with the information available and fully implement these transition planning practices to reduce the risk that the agencies experience the types of delays and missed savings that occurred in previous transitions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO's draft report contains 25 recommendations to the five agencies to fully implement the transition planning practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the General Service  Administration\u2019s (GSA) Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) program.

The three remaining  agencies did not demonstrate that they were applying established  configuration management processes to their transitions, and two of  the three also did not demonstrate that they had implemented change  management processes for their transitions.", "Officials from the selected agencies generally attributed their lack of full  implementation of this practice to the fact that, at the time of our review,  the agencies were early in their transition planning processes.

Thus, it is critical for  agencies to apply a rigorous management approach from the start of the  current transition using the information that is currently available, even  though changes may be necessary as conditions evolve. Agencies that  do not fully adopt the comprehensive approach captured in these  planning practices may not make the most of the opportunity for change,  and the potential to save costs, that such a major telecommunications  transition provides.", "Accordingly, our draft report contains 25 planned recommendations to the  five selected agencies. By implementing our recommendations, the  agencies should be better positioned to reduce their risk of experiencing  the types of delays that occurred during previous transition efforts.
