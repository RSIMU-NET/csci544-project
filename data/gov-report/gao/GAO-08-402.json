Nanotechnology is the ability to control matter at the scale of a nanometer--one billionth of a meter. A key research area funded by some federal agencies relates to potential environmental, health, and safety (EHS) risks that may result from exposure to nanoscale materials. Because of concerns about federal efforts to fund and prioritize EHS research, GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which selected agencies conducted such research in fiscal year 2006; (2) the reasonableness of the agencies' and the NNI's processes to identify and prioritize such federal research; and (3) the effectiveness of the agencies' and the NNI's process to coordinate this research. GAO reviewed quantitative and qualitative data from five federal agencies that provided 96 percent of fiscal year 2006 funding for EHS research."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The NNI reported that in fiscal year 2006,federal agencies devoted $37.7million--or 3 percent of the $1.3 billion total nanotechnology research funding--to research that was primarily focused on the EHS risks of nanotechnology. However, about 20 percent of this total cannot actually be attributed to this purpose; GAO found that 22 of the 119 projects identified as EHS-related by five federal agencies in fiscal year 2006 were not focused on determining the extent to which nanotechnology poses an EHS risk. Instead, the focus of many of these projects was to explore how nanotechnology could be used to remediate environmental damage or to detect a variety of hazards. GAO determined that this mischaracterization is rooted in the current reporting structure which does not allow these types of projects to be easily categorized and the lack of guidance for agencies on how to apportion funding across multiple topics. In addition to the EHS funding totals reported by the NNI, federal agencies conduct other research that is not captured in the totals. This research was not captured by the NNI because either the research was funded by an agency not generally considered to be a research agency or because the primary purpose of the research was not to study EHS risks. Federal agencies and the NNI are currently in the process of identifying and prioritizing EHS risk research needs; the process they are using appears reasonable overall. For example, identification and prioritization of EHS research needs is being done by the agencies and the NNI. The NNI also is engaged in an iterative prioritization effort through its Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications (NEHI) working group. NEHI has identified five specific research priorities for five general research categories, but it has not yet completed the final steps of this process, which will identify EHS research gaps, determine specific research needed to fill those gaps, and outline a long-term, overarching EHS research strategy. GAO found that the focus of most EHS research projects underway in fiscal year 2006 was generally consistent with agency priorities and NEHI research categories and that the projects focused on the priority needs within each category to varying degrees. The anticipated EHS research strategy is expected to provide a framework to help ensure that the highest priority needs are met. Agency and NNI processes to coordinate activities related to potential EHS risks of nanotechnology have been generally effective. The NEHI working group has convened frequent meetings that have helped agencies identify opportunities to collaborate on EHS risk issues, such as joint sponsorship of research and workshops to advance knowledge and facilitate information-sharing among the agencies. In addition, NEHI has incorporated several practices that are key to enhancing and sustaining interagency collaboration, such as leveraging resources. Finally, agency officials GAO spoke with expressed satisfaction with the coordination and collaboration on EHS risk research that has occurred through NEHI. They cited several factors they believe contribute to the group's effectiveness, including the stability of the working group membership and the expertise and dedication of its members."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nanotechnology encompasses a wide range of innovations based on the  Nanotechnology encompasses a wide range of innovations based on the  understanding and control of matter at the scale of nanometers\u2014the  understanding and control of matter at the scale of nanometers\u2014the  equivalent of one-billionth of a meter.

The NNI is a mechanism to coordinate the  nanotechnology-related activities of the 25 currently participating federal  agencies that fund nanoscale research or have a stake in the outcome of  this research, such as those agencies that may regulate products  containing nanomaterials. While the NNI is designed to facilitate  intergovernmental cooperation and identify overarching goals and  priorities for nanotechnology research, it is not a research program. It also  has no funding or authority to dictate the nanotechnology research agenda  for participating agencies or to ensure that adequate resources are  available to achieve specific goals. Instead, participating agencies develop  and fund their own nanotechnology research agendas. In fiscal year 2006,  13 of the 25 participating agencies in the NNI allocated a total of about  $1.3 billion from their appropriated budgets to nanotechnology research  and development activities.", "Management of the NNI falls under the purview of the National Science  and Technology Council (NSTC), a Cabinet-level body within the Office of  the President that coordinates science and technology policy across the  federal government. The NSTC\u2019s Committee on Technology has  established a Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET)  subcommittee to help coordinate, plan, and implement the NNI\u2019s activities  across participating agencies. In 2003, the NSET subcommittee further  established a Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications  (NEHI) working group. The purpose of the NEHI working group,  composed of representatives from 16 research and regulatory agencies, is  to, among other things, coordinate agency efforts related to EHS risks of  nanotechnology. As is the case with the NNI, the NEHI working group has  no authority to mandate research priorities or to ensure that agencies  adequately fund particular research.", "In December 2003, Congress enacted the 21st Century Nanotechnology  Research and Development Act. The act establishes a National  Nanotechnology Program to coordinate federal nanotechnology research  and development. Among other things, the act directs the NSTC to  establish goals and priorities for the program and to set up program  component areas that reflect those goals and priorities. To implement  these requirements, the NSTC has established a process to categorize  research projects and activities undertaken by the various federal agencies  into seven areas. Of these seven, six are focused on the discovery,  development, and deployment of nanotechnology, while the seventh  relates to the societal dimensions of nanotechnology that include issues  such as the EHS risks of nanotechnology. Agencies also report their  research funding for each area to the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) as part of the annual federal budget process. NNI\u2019s annual  Supplement to the President\u2019s Budget, prepared by the NSTC, includes  EHS research figures from the agencies and a general description of the  research conducted by the agencies in each of the seven areas.

However, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars has  questioned the accuracy of reporting research related to EHS risks.  Furthermore, some groups, including industry, environmental advocacy,  and nonprofit research institutes, have raised concerns about the pace of  NEHI\u2019s prioritization activities as well as the process it is using to identify  research priorities and coordinate federal research.", "In this context you asked us to report on (1) the extent to which selected  research and regulatory agencies conducted research in fiscal year 2006  that primarily was focused on the potential EHS risks of nanotechnology;  (2) the reasonableness of the processes that agencies and the NNI use to  identify and prioritize federal research on the potential EHS risks of  nanotechnology; and (3) the effectiveness of the processes that agencies  and the NNI use to coordinate their research.", "To determine the extent to which selected research and regulatory  agencies conducted research that is primarily focused on studying the  EHS risks of nanotechnology, we gathered data on the funding that NNI\u2019s  participating agencies have used for EHS risk research. We focused our  review on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National  Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute for Occupational Safety  and Health (NIOSH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), and the National Science Foundation (NSF), because these five  agencies accounted for 96 percent of the EHS research funding reported in  fiscal year 2006. Of these agencies, NIH, NIOSH, NIST, and NSF are  research agencies that have specific budgets to support research,  including nanotechnology-related research. EPA on the other hand is a  regulatory agency that also conducts research and therefore has a  research budget. In addition to the agencies mentioned above, we also  included in our review three regulatory agencies that do not have research  budgets\u2014the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration (OSHA) to determine whether these three agencies  conducted any research on their own relative to EHS risks of  nanotechnology. We assessed the reliability of the agencies\u2019 data and  determined it was sufficient for the purposes of this analysis. To assess  whether or not the primary purpose of the research conducted by these  agencies addressed the EHS risks of nanotechnology, we reviewed  qualitative data on all projects funded by EPA, NIH, NIOSH, NIST, and  NSF in fiscal year 2006. To minimize bias and to ensure the consistency of  our evaluation, the team independently conducted project reviews by  using publicly available and agency documentation, such as project  abstracts or grant applications, to make our determinations. For  categorization of projects that appeared questionable to us, we discussed  the categorization with agency officials and modified our determination as  appropriate given the additional support provided by the agency.", "To determine the reasonableness of the process that the agencies and the  NNI used to prioritize and coordinate federal research on studying EHS  risks, we collected and reviewed documentation on research priorities,  and the process used to establish these priorities, at each of the eight  agencies included in our review and compared these priorities with funded  research within the agency. To review the process being used by the NNI  to identify and establish government-wide priorities, we reviewed NNI  documents and interviewed agency officials and external stakeholder  groups, including officials from groups that represent environmental and  industry concerns. We compared the NNI\u2019s identified priorities with those  identified by the agencies to determine whether they were consistent. We  also compared the NNI\u2019s identified priorities with agency project-level  data on EHS research underway in fiscal year 2006 to determine whether  the projects were reflective of NNI\u2019s identified priorities. We did not  determine whether the NNI\u2019s identified priorities represented a scientific  consensus on the most appropriate ones. We interviewed agency officials  at each of the eight agencies about the extent to which their agency\u2019s  research priorities were met, either through the agency\u2019s own research or  research conducted by other agencies. With regard to coordination, we  discussed with agency and NNI officials how agencies coordinate research  and NNI\u2019s role to facilitate that coordination, and we obtained  documentation on these collaborative efforts. Furthermore, we compared  the NNI\u2019s efforts to facilitate interagency collaboration with established  practices that have been found to enhance and sustain collaboration  among federal agencies. In addition, we interviewed stakeholders,  including environmental and industry groups, to obtain views on agency  coordination efforts. We conducted this performance audit from June 2007  to February 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

In other cases, NSF-funded research  was targeted toward developing nanotechnology-based applications to  remediate soil or water contamination. In addition, many of the projects  NSF reported as having a primary purpose to study EHS risks were part of  its efforts to build a national research infrastructure capable of supporting  a wide range of nanotechnology-related research. Specifically, NSF  sponsors 16 Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, many of which  devote a portion of their research efforts to EHS risk-related projects. In  these cases, NSF apportioned a segment of the Center funding to the EHS  category to account for this research. At NIOSH, both projects that we  identified as not being primarily focused on studying EHS risks were  focused on using nanotechnology to mitigate workplace risks, such as  developing advanced sensors that incorporate nanotechnology to detect  the presence of toxic gases in the workplace.", "We found that the miscategorization of these 22 projects resulted largely  from a reporting structure for nanotechnology research that does not  easily allow agencies to recognize projects that use nanotechnology to  improve the environment or enhance the detection of environmental  contaminants, and from the limited guidance available to the agencies on  how to consistently report EHS research. From fiscal years 2001 to 2004,  the NSET subcommittee categorized federal research and development  activities into nine categories, known as \u201cgrand challenges,\u201d that included  one focused on \u201cnanoscale processes for environmental improvement.\u201d  Agencies funded and researchers initiated work on many of these 22  projects under the grand challenges categorization scheme. Starting in  fiscal year 2005, NSET adopted a new categorization scheme for agencies  to report their nanotechnology research. The new scheme, which was  based on PCAs, eliminated the environmental improvement applications  research category. Instead, agencies were asked to fund and report  research designed to address or understand the risks associated with  nanotechnology, as part of the societal dimensions PCA. In essence, the  new scheme shifted the focus from applications-oriented research to  research focused on the EHS implications of nanotechnology. However,  under the new scheme, agencies no longer had a way to categorize  environmentally focused research that had been initiated. As a result, NSF  and NIOSH characterized these projects as EHS focused for lack of a more  closely related category to place them in, according to program managers.  Furthermore, neither NSET nor OMB provided agencies guidance on to  how to apportion the dollars for a single project to more than one program  component area, when appropriate. This is especially significant for broad,  multiphase research projects, such as NSF\u2019s support to develop networks  of research facilities with the capability to address a range of  nanotechnology-related topics. Of the five agencies we reviewed, only NSF  apportioned funds for a single project to more than one PCA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Conduct Additional Research that Also Helps Advance Scientific Knowledge of Potential EHS Risks", "paragraphs": ["In addition to research reported to the NNI as being primarily focused on  the EHS risks of nanotechnology, some agencies conduct research that is  not reflected in the EHS totals provided by the NNI either because they are  not considered federal research agencies or because the primary purpose  of the research was not to study EHS risks. For example, FDA, which does  not have a specific research budget and does not generally track  nanotechnology research spending, used a portion of its operating funds in  fiscal years 2004 through 2007 to undertake 15 research projects to  evaluate the potential health risks of nanomaterials in the products that it  regulates. One such project focused on sunscreens that contain nanosized  particles of titanium dioxide to better understand their potential to be  absorbed into the body through the skin. Another project is designed to  study the toxicological and immunological responses to nanoparticles that  may be used in therapeutic drugs. A fundamental understanding of  potential risks will help FDA develop guidance and make future regulatory  decisions regarding the manufacture and use of FDA-regulated products  using these materials, according to program managers.", "In addition, as noted in the NNI\u2019s annual Supplement to the President\u2019s  Budget, some agencies conduct research that results in information highly  relevant to EHS risks but that was not primarily directed at understanding  or addressing those risks and therefore is not captured in the EHS total.  For example, NIH has research underway to develop drug delivery  mechanisms that use nanotechnology. While the primary purpose of such  research is to develop medical applications using nanotechnology, the  research also provides information on how toxic the nanomaterials are,  whether they accumulate in body tissues, and how they interact with the  body at the cellular and molecular level. Agencies report funding data for  such research in other PCAs, such as nanoscale devices and systems,  rather than the EHS area. In addition, NIST conducts an array of  nanotechnology research to accurately quantify the properties of  nanomaterials and determine their size, shape, and chemical composition.  This type of information is needed to understand and measure  nanomaterials to ensure safe handling and protection against potential  health or environmental hazards. However, NIST reports the funding data  for such research under other PCAs such as instrumentation research,  metrology, and standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Processes to Identify and Prioritize Needed EHS Research Appear Reasonable and Are Ongoing but a Comprehensive Research Strategy Has Not Yet Been Developed", "paragraphs": ["Ongoing agency and NEHI working group efforts to identify and prioritize  needed research related to the potential EHS risks of nanotechnology  appear reasonable but have not as yet resulted in a comprehensive  research strategy to guide EHS research across agencies.

Most agencies have developed task forces or designated  individuals to specifically consider nanotechnology issues and identify  priorities, although the scope and exact purpose of these activities differ  by agency. EPA, for example, formed a Nanomaterial Research Strategy  Team to craft a long-term, focused plan to guide all of the agency\u2019s  nanotechnology research. The strategy, which identifies EPA\u2019s research  priorities around four key themes and seven scientific questions, is based  in part on the agency\u2019s 2007 \u201cNanotechnology White Paper\u201d that described  scientific issues the agency should consider to help ensure safe  development of nanotechnology and to understand the potential risks. At  other agencies, particularly those that have little or no funding for  nanotechnology research, specific individuals throughout the agency have  been tasked to identify and prioritize EHS research needs. For example,  CPSC has assigned individual staff responsible for different aspects  related to consumer product safety, such as health scientists, to monitor  trends in the use of nanomaterials in such products, which helps inform  the agency\u2019s nanotechnology research priorities. Once identified, agencies  communicate their EHS research priorities to the public and to the  research community in a variety of ways, including publication in agency  documents that specifically address nanotechnology issues, agency  strategic plans or budget documents, agency Web sites, and presentations  at public conferences or workshops."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNI\u2019s Efforts to Prioritize Research Needs Are Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the efforts of individual agencies, the NSET subcommittee  has engaged in an iterative prioritization process through its NEHI  working group, although this process is not yet complete. First, in 2006,  NEHI identified but did not prioritize five broad research categories and 75  more specific subcategories of needs where additional information was  considered necessary to further evaluate the potential EHS risks of  nanotechnology. The report identified these five general research  categories as (1) Instrumentation, Metrology, and Analytical Methods; (2)  Nanomaterials and Human Health; (3) Nanomaterials and the  Environment; (4) Health and Environmental Exposure Assessment; and  (5) Risk Management Methods. Second, following efforts to obtain public  input on its 2006 report, NEHI released another report in August 2007, in  which it distilled the previous list of 75 unprioritized specific research  needs into a set of five prioritized needs for each of the five general  research categories.", "The NEHI working group has used these initial steps to identify the gaps  between the needs and priorities it has identified and the research that  agencies have underway. According to agency and NNI officials, once this  gap analysis is complete, NEHI will formulate a long-term, overarching  EHS research strategy. According to the August 2007 report, the proposed  strategy will list NEHI\u2019s final research priorities, describe current federal  EHS research, document the unmet needs, identify opportunities for  interagency collaboration, and establish a process for periodic review. As  envisioned, the EHS research strategy will serve as guidance for individual  agencies as they develop their own research agendas and make funding  decisions. NEHI plans to complete this overarching research strategy and  issue a report in early 2008, according to NNI officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 and the NNI\u2019s Prioritization Processes Appear Reasonable", "paragraphs": ["Despite the fact that a comprehensive research strategy for EHS research  has yet to be finalized, the prioritization processes taking place within  individual agencies and the NNI appear so far to be reasonable. Numerous  agency officials said their agency\u2019s EHS research priorities were generally  reflected both in the NEHI working group\u2019s 2006 research needs and 2007  research prioritization reports. Our comparison of agency nanotechnology  priorities to the NNI\u2019s priorities corroborated their statements.  Specifically, we found that all but one of the research priorities identified  by individual agencies could be linked to one or more of the five general  research categories. For example, OSHA\u2019s need for toxicity data and  information related to exposure is reflected in the two general research  categories of Health and Environmental Exposure Assessment and  Nanomaterials and Human Health. According to agency officials, the  alignment of agency priorities with the general research categories is  particularly beneficial to the regulatory agencies, such as CPSC and OSHA,  which do not conduct their own research, but rely instead on research  agencies for data to inform their regulatory decisions.", "In addition, we found that the primary purposes of agency projects  underway in fiscal year 2006 were generally consistent with both agency  priorities and the NEHI working group\u2019s research categories. Of these 97  projects, 43 were focused on Nanomaterials and Human Health, including  all 18 of the projects funded by NIH. In addition, EPA, NIOSH, and NSF  each undertook research for this general research category. EPA and NSF  funded all 25 projects related to Nanomaterials and the Environment.  These two general research categories accounted for 70 percent of all  projects focused on EHS risks. Reflective of its relatively large EHS  research budget and broad mission, NSF sponsored projects in each of the  five general research categories. In contrast, all the research projects NIST  sponsored were related to Instrumentation, Metrology, and Analytical  Methods.", "Agency research addressed each of the five general research categories  and focused on the priority needs within each category to varying degrees.  With the exception of the Human Health category, for which all specific  needs were considered a top priority, 43 percent of projects addressed the  two highest-priority needs in each category and 37 percent addressed the  two lowest-priority needs. For example, 8 of the 11 projects in the  Instrumentation, Metrology, and Analytic Methods category focused on the  highest-priority need to \u201cdevelop methods to detect nanomaterials in  biological matrices, the environment, and the workplace.\u201d In contrast, of  the 25 projects related to Nanomaterials and the Environment, 3 addressed  the highest-priority need in the category\u2014\u201dunderstand the effects of  engineered nanomaterials in individuals of a species and the applicability  of testing schemes to measure effects\u201d\u2014and 11 addressed the fourth- ranked priority\u2014\u201ddetermine factors affecting the environmental transport  of nanomaterials.\u201d Moreover, although the NEHI working group  considered the five specific research priorities related to human health  equally important, 19 of the 43 projects focused on a single priority\u2014 \u201dresearch to determine the mechanisms of interaction between  nanomaterials and the body at the molecular, cellular, and tissular levels.\u201d  See table 3 for a summary of projects by agency and specific NEHI  research priority.", "Despite the fact that the NEHI working group\u2019s priorities reflect individual  agency priorities, some environmental and industry groups have called for  a more top-down and directed approach to the NNI\u2019s prioritization efforts.  In various congressional testimonies and in written comments on the  NEHI working group\u2019s draft reports, some groups have suggested that the  NNI adopt a stronger, more autonomous role in setting the federal EHS  research agenda. Some of these groups suggest that the NNI should have  the authority to direct participating agencies to undertake research in  specific EHS areas, its own budget authority, and the ability to shift EHS  research dollars among the agencies. Proponents believe that this more  centralized approach would help ensure that a cohesive EHS research  strategy is implemented in a timely manner and that sufficient resources  are dedicated to the highest-priority research.", "However, such a strategy may not be consistent with historical approaches  used to set federal research priorities and would be difficult to implement  given how federal research currently is funded. Federal expenditures for  research and development are regular budget items and are contained,  along with other types of expenditures, within the budgets of more than 20  federal agencies. For some of these agencies, research is a major activity,  and for others, it is a smaller part of a much larger set of programs.  Centralizing nanotechnology research expenditures in a single existing  agency or new agency would be difficult to achieve. In addition, agency  officials we spoke with were generally satisfied with the current bottom- up, consensus-based approach. Moreover, they said the process has  benefited from the in-depth expertise each agency has developed. For  example, NIH played a large role in shaping the priorities for  Nanomaterials and Human Health; NIST was heavily involved with  Instrumentation, Metrology, and Analytical Methods; and NIOSH was a  major contributor to the development of priorities for Health and  Environmental Exposure Assessment. Some officials acknowledged that  while the current approach has limitations, it benefits from the input of a  broader range of stakeholders. According to one official, information  bubbles up through the NNI structure and is utilized to inform and create a  top-down vision, which then serves to guide agency funding decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coordination Processes Have Fostered Interagency Collaboration and Information-Sharing", "paragraphs": ["Agency and NNI processes to coordinate research and other activities  related to the potential EHS risks of nanotechnology have been generally  effective, and have resulted in numerous interagency collaborations.

These EHS-related activities are consistent  with the expressed goals of the larger NNI\u2014to promote the integration of  federal efforts through communication, coordination, and collaboration.  The NEHI working group is at the center of this effort. Regular NEHI  working group meetings, augmented by informal discussions, have  provided a venue for agencies to exchange information on a variety of  topics associated with EHS risks, including their respective research needs  and opportunities for collaborations.", "Interagency collaboration has taken many forms, including joint  sponsorship of EHS-related research and workshops, the detailing of staff  to other NEHI working group agencies, and various other general  collaborations or memoranda of understanding. For example, FDA, NIST,  and NIH\u2019s Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory have initiated  formal agreements to collaborate on research to characterize the physical  and biological properties of nanomaterials used in cancer diagnosis and  treatment. An FDA official said that this arrangement was developed  primarily through discussions that occurred as a result of the agencies\u2019  participation in NEHI. Participation in NEHI has helped facilitate other  types of interagency collaborations including a 2007 memorandum of  understanding between EPA and NSF to create and fund research at a  virtual Center for the Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology,  detailing a CPSC toxicologist to a research laboratory office at EPA, and  sponsoring international conferences on nanotechnology and occupational  health by all NNI agencies, led by NIOSH, in 2005, 2006, and 2007. See  table 4 for more examples of interagency collaboration.", "Furthermore, the NEHI working group has adopted a number of practices  GAO has previously identified as essential to helping enhance and sustain  collaboration among federal agencies. For example, NEHI\u2019s 2005 \u201cTerms  of Reference\u201d clearly defined its purpose and objectives and delineated  roles and responsibilities for group members. Furthermore, collaboration  through multiagency grant announcements and jointly sponsored  workshops has served as a mechanism to leverage limited resources to  achieve increased knowledge about potential EHS risks. Despite the  general effectiveness of its collaboration efforts, the NEHI working group  has not yet completed an overarching strategy to help align the agencies\u2019  EHS research efforts. A completed strategy, combined with the results of  the research needs prioritization process, also will serve as a means to  monitor, evaluate, and report on the progress of meeting EHS research  needs.

Many officials  described NEHI as unique among interagency efforts in terms of its  effectiveness. Given limited resources, the development of ongoing  relationships between agencies with different missions, but compatible  nanotechnology research goals, is particularly important. NIH officials  commented that their agency\u2019s collaboration with NIST to develop  standard reference materials for nanoparticles may not have occurred as  readily had it not been for regular NEHI meetings and workshops. In  addition, NEHI has effectively brought together research and regulatory  agencies, which has enhanced planning and coordination. Many officials  noted that participation in NEHI has frequently given regulators the  opportunity to become aware of and involved with research projects at a  very early point in their development, which has resulted in research that  better suits the needs of regulatory agencies. Participation in NEHI is  particularly important for agencies like CPSC, FDA, and OSHA that do not  have dedicated budgets for nanotechnology research.", "Many officials also cited the dedication of individual NEHI working group  representatives, who participate in the working group in addition to their  regular agency duties, as critical to the group\u2019s overall effectiveness. A  number of the members has served on the body for several years,  providing stability and continuity that contributes to a collegial and  productive working atmosphere. In addition, because nanotechnology is  relatively new with many unknowns, these officials said the agencies are  excited about advancing knowledge about nanomaterials and contributing  to the informational needs of both regulatory and research agencies.
