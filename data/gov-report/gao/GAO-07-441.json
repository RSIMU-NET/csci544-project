Also, a recent Executive Order directs agencies to develop plans to improve FOIA operations, including decreasing backlog. For this study, GAO was asked to examine the status and trends of FOIA processing at 25 major agencies as reflected in annual reports, as well as the extent to which improvement plans contain the elements emphasized by the Executive Order.

Despite increasing the numbers of requests processed, many agencies did not keep pace with the volume of requests that they received. As a result, the number of pending requests carried over from year to year has been steadily increasing. Agency reports also show great variations in the median times to process requests (less than 10 days for some agency components to more than 100 days at others). However, the ability to determine trends in processing times is limited by the form in which these times are reported: that is, in medians only, without averages (that is, arithmetical means) or ranges. Although medians have the advantage of providing representative numbers that are not skewed by a few outliers, it is not statistically possible to combine several medians to develop broader generalizations (as can be done with arithmetical means). This limitation on aggregating data impedes the development of broader pictures of FOIA operations, which could be useful in monitoring efforts to improve processing and reduce the increasing backlog of requests, as intended by the Executive Order. The improvement plans submitted by the 25 agencies mostly included goals and timetables addressing the four areas of improvement emphasized by the Executive Order: eliminating or reducing any backlog of FOIA requests; increasing reliance on dissemination of records that can be made available to the public without the need for a FOIA request, such as through posting on Web sites; improving communications with requesters about the status of their requests; and increasing public awareness of FOIA processing. Most of the plans (20 of 25) provided goals and timetables in all four areas; some agencies omitted goals in areas where they considered they were already strong.

Agencies receive requests, usually in writing (although  they may accept requests by telephone or electronically), which can come  from any organization or member of the public. Once received, the request  goes through several phases, which include initial processing, searching for  and retrieving responsive records, preparing responsive records for  release, approving the release of the records, and releasing the records to  the requester. Figure 1 is an overview of the process, from the receipt of a  request to the release of records.", "During the initial processing phase, a request is logged into the agency\u2019s  FOIA system, and a case file is started. The request is then reviewed to  determine its scope, estimate fees, and provide an initial response to the  requester (in general, this simply acknowledges receipt of the request).  After this point, the FOIA staff begins its search to retrieve responsive  records. This step may include searching for records from multiple  locations and program offices. After potentially responsive records are  located, the documents are reviewed to ensure that they are within the  scope of the request.", "During the next two phases, the agency ensures that appropriate  information is to be released under the provisions of the act. First, the  agency reviews the responsive records to make any redactions based on  the statutory exemptions. Once the exemption review is complete, the final  set of responsive records is turned over to the FOIA office, which  calculates appropriate fees, if applicable. Before release, the redacted  responsive records are then given a final review, possibly by the agency\u2019s  general counsel, and then a response letter is generated, summarizing the  agency\u2019s actions regarding the request. Finally, the responsive records are  released to the requester.", "Some requests are relatively simple to process, such as requests for  specific pieces of information that the requester sends directly to the  appropriate office. Other requests may require more extensive processing,  depending on their complexity, the volume of information involved, the  need for the agency FOIA office to work with offices that have relevant  subject-matter expertise to find and obtain information, the need for a  FOIA officer to review and redact information in the responsive material,  the need to communicate with the requester about the scope of the request,  and the need to communicate with the requester about the fees that will be  charged for fulfilling the request (or whether fees will be waived).", "Specific details of agency processes for handling requests vary, depending  on the agency\u2019s organizational structure and the complexity of the requests  received. While some agencies centralize processing in one main office,  other agencies have separate FOIA offices for each agency component and  field office. Agencies also vary in how they allow requests to be made.  Depending on the agency, requesters can submit requests by telephone, fax,  letter, or e-mail or through the Web. In addition, agencies may process  requests in two ways, known as \u201cmultitrack\u201d and \u201csingle track.\u201d Multitrack  processing involves dividing requests into two groups: (1) simple requests  requiring relatively minimal review, which are placed in one processing  track, and (2) more voluminous and complex requests, which are placed in  another track. In contrast, single-track processing does not distinguish  between simple and complex requests. With single-track processing,  agencies process all requests on a first-in/first-out basis. Agencies can also  process FOIA requests on an expedited basis when a requester has shown a  compelling need or urgency for the information.", "As agencies process FOIA requests, they generally place them in one of  four possible disposition categories: grants, partial grants, denials, and \u201cnot  disclosed for other reasons.\u201d These categories are defined as follows:  Grants: Agency decisions to disclose all requested records in full.", "Partial grants: Agency decisions to withhold some records in whole or  in part, because such information was determined to fall within one or  more exemptions.", "Denials: Agency decisions not to release any part of the requested  records because all information in the records is determined to be  exempt under one or more statutory exemptions.", "Not disclosed for other reasons: Agency decisions not to release  requested information for any of a variety of reasons other than  statutory exemptions from disclosing records.

In many cases, the variance can be  accounted for by the types of requests that different agencies process. For  example, as discussed earlier, SSA grants a very high proportion of requests  because they are requests for personal information about individuals that  are routinely made available to or for the individuals concerned. Similarly,  VA routinely makes medical records available to individual veterans, and  HHS also handles large numbers of Privacy Act requests. Such requests are  generally granted in full. Other agencies, on the other hand, receive  numerous requests whose responses must routinely be redacted. For  example, NSF reported in its annual report that most of its requests (an  estimated 90 percent) are for copies of funded grant proposals. The  responsive documents are routinely redacted to remove personal  information on individual principal investigators (such as salaries, home  addresses, and so on), which results in high numbers of \u201cpartial grants\u201d  compared to \u201cfull grants.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Times Vary, but Broad Generalizations Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["For 2005, the reported time required to process requests (by track) varied  considerably among agencies.

To find an arithmetic mean,  one adds all the members of a list of numbers and divides the result by the  number of items in the list. To find the median, one arranges all the values  in the list from lowest to highest and finds the middle one (or the average  of the middle two if there is no one middle number). Thus, although using  medians provides representative numbers that are not skewed by a few  outliers, they cannot be summed. Deriving a median for two sets of  numbers, for example, requires knowing all numbers in both sets. Only the  source data for the medians can be used to derive a new median, not the  medians themselves.", "As a result, with only medians it is not statistically possible to combine  results from different agencies to develop broader generalizations, such as  a governmentwide statistic based on all agency reports, statistics from sets  of comparable agencies, or an agencywide statistic based on separate  reports from all components of the agency.", "In rewriting the FOIA reporting requirements in 1996, legislators declared  an interest in making them \u201cmore useful to the public and to the Congress,  and  the information in them more accessible.\u201d However, the  limitation on aggregating data imposed by the use of medians alone  impedes the development of broader pictures of FOIA operations. A more  complete picture would be given by the inclusion of other statistics based  on the same data that are used to derive medians, such as means and  ranges. Providing means along with the median would allow more  generalizations to be drawn, and providing ranges would complete the  picture by adding information on the outliers in agency statistics.

In addition, one  value of the annual reports lies in the possibility they provide of seeing  trends and drawing generalizations. However, our ability to generalize  about processing times, whether from agency to agency or year to year, is  limited because only median times are reported. Since processing times are  an important gauge of government responsiveness to citizen inquiries, this  limitation is significant. Medians are useful as representative numbers that  are not skewed by a few outliers, but the addition of averages (arithmetic  means) and ranges would enhance the ability to make useful comparisons  and provide a more complete picture.

It may be  that Treasury\u2019s FOIA council will provide this focus; however, this was not  clear from the agency\u2019s plan, which included no milestones or goals in  these areas to guide the council\u2019s future activities.", "We also disagree with Treasury\u2019s view that we do not give sufficient weight  to the activities that the plan included or that Treasury officials indicated  were already in progress. Although we took these into account, they did not  provide evidence that Treasury was already giving or planned to give the  level of attention to the three areas of emphasis that was envisioned by the  Executive Order. For example, although Treasury\u2019s compliance with the  1996 e-FOIA amendments is important, the Executive Order asks agencies  to look for opportunities to go beyond complying with legal requirements  to disseminate records. Similarly, although the technology improvements  that Treasury described have the potential to improve FOIA processing  (including improvements in the three areas of emphasis), the plan did not  tie these improvements and actions to goals or milestones in the three  areas. As a result, we did not change our assessment. However, we have  clarified the language of the report to emphasize that our assessment is  based on meeting the level of attention emphasized in the Executive Order.", "We note, however, that Treasury in its comments indicates that it does plan  to continue to reevaluate its improvement plan and modify it to  accommodate changing circumstances. If future modifications specifically  address external communications, particularly with requesters, the goal of  our recommendation may be achieved.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General, the Director  of the Office of Management and Budget, and the heads of departments and  agencies we reviewed.

All agency workload data were self-reported in annual  reports submitted to the Attorney General.", "To assess the reliability of the information contained in agency annual  reports, we interviewed officials from selected agencies and assessed  quality control processes agencies had in place. We selected 10 agencies to  assess data reliability: the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Defense,  Education, the Interior, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Small  Business Administration, and Social Security Administration. We chose the  Social Security Administration and Veterans Affairs because they  processed a majority of the requests. To ensure that we selected agencies  of varying size, we chose the remaining 8 agencies by ordering them  according to the number of requests they received, from smallest to largest,  and choosing every third agency. These 10 agencies account for 97 percent  of the received requests that were reported in the 25 agencies\u2019 annual  reports.", "Of the 10 agencies that were assessed for data reliability, we determined  that the data for USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency were not reliable; these data  account for over 80 percent of the reported USDA data. We therefore  eliminated USDA\u2019s data from our analysis. Because of this elimination, our  analysis was of 24 major agencies (herein we refer to this scope as  governmentwide). Table 9 shows the 25 agencies and their reliability  assessment status.", "To determine to what extent the agency improvement plans contain the  elements emphasized by the order, we first analyzed the Executive Order to  determine how it described the contents of the improvement plans. We  determined that the order emphasized the following areas to be addressed  by the plans: (1) reducing the backlog of FOIA requests, (2) increasing  reliance on public dissemination of records (affirmative and proactive)  including through Web sites, (3) improving communications with FOIA  requesters about the status of their requests, and (4) increasing public  awareness of FOIA processing including updating an agency\u2019s FOIA  Reference Guide. We also analyzed the improvement plans to determine if  they contained specific outcome-oriented goals and timetables for each of  the criteria. We then analyzed the 25 agencies\u2019 (including USDA) plans to  determine whether they contained goals and timetables for each of these  four elements. We evaluated the versions of agency plans available as of  December 15, 2006.", "We also reviewed the Executive Order itself, implementing guidance issued  by OMB and the Department of Justice, other FOIA guidance issued by  Justice, and our past work in this area.", "We conducted our review in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

The Department agrees with GAO that such summaries provide the public and the Congress a governmentwide picture ofFOIA processing. Accordingly, OIP will resume compiling the aforementioned summaries beginning with a summary of the fiscal year 2006 annual reports.
