Their charter includes three objectives: (1) developing and refining Centers' policies and processes; (2) assuring consistent application of the Centers' standards; and (3) monitoring execution to meet the overarching objectives and priorities of the Army Facilities Standardization Program (AFSP) and standardization process. We found that the Centers' various activitiessuch as conducting value engineering and life-cycle cost studies to identify possible cost savings and analyze long-term costs of new facilitiesare consistent with key principles and concepts in Office of Management and Budget guidance for a disciplined capital planning process. Additionally, the post-occupancy evaluations led by the Centers are designed to evaluate whether the Army functional requirements have been met, Army standard design has been implemented, and there are any areas where the design could be improved. These evaluations support all three of the Centers' objectives by evaluating whether a design needs improvement, a facility was constructed in accordance with the approved project design, and customer needs were met.", "The Army has limited performance measures to track the Centers' progress in achieving program objectives. Semi-annual meetings of the Army's Centers of Standardization Management Board (Board) enable the Army to track the Centers' progress toward their goal of developing and updating Center policies and processes (first objective of the Centers). However, GAO found that the Army lacks performance measures to assess the Centers' progress in ensuring the consistent application of Army standard designs (second objective of the Centers) and in monitoring how well the Centers meet the objectives and priorities of the AFSP and standardization process (third objective of the Centers). Specifically, the Board does not maintain, consolidate, or analyze information about how frequently the Centers participate in construction projects, or how this activity affects the program and supports AFSP objectives, such as reducing project costs, times, and change orders.

Under this program, USACE  established nine Centers to develop design standards for types of  facilities that the Department of the Army (Army) constructs on a regular  basis, such as barracks, battalion headquarters, dining facilities, and  fitness centers. The objectives for Army facilities\u2019 standardization and use  of the Centers\u2019 standard designs include improving the design quality of  Army facilities, reducing the design and construction costs and time, and  reducing the contract changes during construction. We have previously  reported that federal construction projects typically involve some degree  of change as the projects progress. Contract changes (change orders)  are made through modifications to a contract and can occur for a variety  of reasons, including design errors and changes in user requirements.  For instance, a contractor could file a claim against the government if the  contractor felt there was a flaw in the Army\u2019s standard design or that  using the standard design resulted in unanticipated costs during the  design or construction phase.", "In March 2018 we reported that Department of Defense (DOD)  construction projects consistently faced cost overruns and schedule  delays. Additionally, we reported that guidance for construction projects  did not fully incorporate the necessary steps for developing reliable cost  estimates. We recommended that DOD fully incorporate all 12 steps  needed for developing high-quality reliable cost estimates. As of August  2019, DOD officials told us that the department was planning to update its  cost-estimating guidance to include all 12 steps.", "In addition, in July 2019 we reported that USACE does not regularly  monitor how long it takes to finalize construction contract changes, thus  limiting management\u2019s ability to identify and respond to problems. We  recommended that the Secretary of the Army direct the Chief of  Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers to develop a strategy to expand on existing data and systems  to routinely collect information on and monitor the time frames for  finalizing construction contract changes at the headquarters level. DOD  agreed with this recommendation, and officials told us that DOD has  developed a corrective action plan to address the recommendation. They  estimate that this effort will be completed in August 2020.", "Senate Report 115-262, accompanying a bill for the John S. McCain  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, included a  provision for us to evaluate the effectiveness of the Centers, including  whether they are achieving their objectives. This report assesses the  extent to which (1) the Centers have identified activities that support their  key objectives; (2) the Army tracks the Centers\u2019 progress in meeting their  key objectives; and (3) increased liability may be introduced to the  Centers during construction when standard designs are used.", "For objective one, we assessed the Centers\u2019 roles and responsibilities\u2014 as stipulated in Army and USACE regulations\u2014to identify activities that  the Centers undertake on construction projects. We identified eight Army  projects that were authorized in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 for our  analysis. We selected projects from those years because military  construction projects typically take multiple years to complete. Therefore,  selecting projects from this time frame increased the likelihood that the  contractor had completed construction of the projects and that the  Centers had conducted post- occupancy evaluations, which are used to  assess users\u2019 satisfaction with completed projects. We then compared  these activities to the objectives expressed in the Centers\u2019 2006 charter to  determine whether the activities supported the objectives. We reviewed  supporting documentation for eight Army projects that the service  identified as being built using standard designs to determine whether  evidence existed to demonstrate that the Centers had engaged in these  activities. While our observations on these projects are not generalizable  to all Army projects, they illustrate the kinds of activities the Centers  engage in on Army projects that use standard designs. We further  evaluated whether the Centers\u2019 activities are consistent with key  principles and concepts in Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  guidance to agencies for a disciplined capital programming process (for  example, federal buildings). We also interviewed cognizant officials  concerning the Centers\u2019 objectives and activities they engage in to  support those objectives.", "For objective two, we reviewed information on processes related to the  Centers\u2019 project documentation and performance metrics. We also  reviewed DOD annual performance reports to identify any goals and  performance measures that are related to the objectives of the Centers.  We assessed whether the project documentation, the Centers\u2019  performance measures, and any performance measures in DOD\u2019s annual  performance reports would assist the Centers in assessing progress  toward their three program objectives to (1) develop and refine Centers of  Standardization policies and processes; (2) assure consistent application  of standards of the Centers program; and (3) monitor the Centers\u2019  execution to meet the overarching objectives and priorities of the Army  Facilities Standardization Program (AFSP) and standardization process.  Finally, we interviewed Centers headquarters and Army officials, including  members of the Centers of Standardization Management Board,  concerning any performance measures currently being utilized.", "For objective three, we reviewed DOD and Army guidance and  regulations that address legal responsibilities related to military  construction to identify the extent to which the Centers\u2019 role in developing  standard designs used in construction potentially exposes the Centers to  liability related to problems that arise during construction. We reviewed  documents that relate to the Centers\u2019 standard contracting practices and  interviewed USACE legal counsel concerning any previous or potential  liability related to standard design.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The overall objective of the Army Facilities Standardization Program is to  achieve savings and benefits in the programing, design, and construction  of Army facilities of excellence. To meet AFSP\u2019s objectives in a timely,  efficient, and cost-effective manner, the Army established the nine  Centers in 2006 to support the AFSP, as shown in figure 1.", "The AFSP operates under the direction of the Army Facilities  Standardization Committee (Committee). As shown in figure 2 below, the  Committee is chaired by the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation  Management (ACSIM) and composed of members from USACE and the  U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM). Each of these  offices has representatives who are either full-fledged or advisory  members of the Centers of Standardization Management Board (the  Board). The Board members directly oversee the activities of the Centers  and are responsible for developing performance measures and reporting  them to the Committee.", "The Centers have primary responsibility for developing and managing  Army standard design packages for designated facility types. The  Centers, among other things, ensure that these standard designs and  construction of projects comply with two other sets of facility guidelines:  DOD\u2019s Unified Facilities Criteria (Facilities Criteria) and general Army  standards.", "As we previously reported, the Facilities Criteria are overarching, DOD-wide technical manuals and standards used for planning, design, construction, restoration, and maintenance of DOD facility projects. These criteria must be used to the greatest extent possible by all DOD components. They are developed through the joint efforts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, and they are approved by the Engineer Senior Executive Panel of the  Unified Facilities Criteria Program.", "According to Army Regulation 420-1, Army standards are the immutable, unchanging, required facility elements and criteria that define the fundamental purpose and function of a facility\u2019s design and construction. These Army standards are authorized by the Committee. Army standard designs define the facility key components, features, and characteristics that must be included in the design and construction or major renovation of all facilities of the same type regardless of location, available funding, command preferences, or installation mission. Essentially, Army standard designs may consist of architectural and engineering drawings as well as written design specifications that a construction team can easily adapt or modify for site-specific requirements.", "Figure 3 below compares Army standard designs with Facilities Criteria  and general Army standards.", "In addition to developing and managing Army standard design packages,  the Centers\u2019 staff function principally as engineering and architectural  consultants within larger project teams as they monitor and oversee the  appropriate use of Army standard designs (as well as any incorporated  Army standards or Facilities Criteria). According to Centers officials, 12  full-time and 21 part-time staff are currently dedicated to the Centers.  Staff are located in USACE headquarters in Washington, D.C., as well as  in eight USACE districts and one Engineering and Support Center. Each  Center specializes in and is responsible for specific facility types and their  designs. While the Centers support the Army\u2019s overall efforts for  standardization, not every Army facility is built according to a standard  design. Appropriate Centers staff are required to review every proposed  Army construction project at its outset and, if an installation has requested  a waiver from an existing Army standard or standard design, all voting  members of the Committee may authorize waivers in accordance with  certain procedures. According to Centers officials, Army standard designs  have been developed for about 70 regularly constructed facility types out  of the Army\u2019s nearly 900 facility types. For example, the Army has  standard designs for fire stations, chapels, dining facilities, and weapons  storage. (See appendix II for a listing of the 70 facility types that currently  have standard designs or for which standard designs are under  development.)", "According to Centers officials, the Centers\u2019 70 facility types account for  approximately 60 percent of Army Military Construction (MILCON)  projects and represent an estimated 55 percent to 70 percent of the  overall Army MILCON budget for any given year. (See appendix III for  information on overall DOD standardization program, including the Navy  and Air Force standard design programs.) In fiscal year 2019, the Centers  reported a combined annual budget of about $6.2 million for their  operations and personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Centers Have Engaged in Activities That Support Key Objectives and Are Consistent with Key Principles and Concepts in OMB Guidance", "paragraphs": ["The Centers identified and engaged in a number of activities designed to  support the key objectives found in their charter and these activities are  consistent with key principles and concepts in OMB guidance for a  disciplined capital programming process. The Centers\u2019 charter includes  the following three objectives: (1) developing and refining Centers\u2019  policies and processes; (2) assuring consistent application of standards of  the Centers program; and (3) monitoring the Centers\u2019 execution to meet  the overarching objectives and priorities of the AFSP and standardization  process. To meet the three objectives, the Centers engage in different  activities throughout the military construction process. Figure 4 below  shows the various points at which the Centers are involved in the life- cycle of a military construction project and examples of the activities in  which the Centers engage. For example, Engineer Regulation 1110-3- 113 states that during the design phase of projects, the Centers maintain  a lead role and will be the technical lead for coordination, review, and  acceptance of design deliverables, including providing field technical  assistance, identifying and advising when a waiver is required and  coordinating with appropriate authorities in this matter, and reviewing and  editing requests for proposal documents\u2014activities that according to our  analysis support the Centers\u2019 second objective.", "Based on our review of supporting documentation from five projects that  used standard designs, we found that the Centers were undertaking the  activities mentioned above. In addition, activities in which the Centers  engaged during the design, construction, and post-construction phases of  these projects were consistent with key principles and concepts in OMB  guidance. Specifically, we found evidence that, for these five projects,  Centers\u2019 staff participated as integrated members of the project delivery  teams in planning meetings, design reviews, assessments of the need for  standard design waivers, value engineering studies, and life-cycle cost  analyses during the projects\u2019 design and construction phases. These  activities were consistent with key principles and concepts in OMB  guidance for a disciplined capital planning process, including that  agencies should use integrated project teams, as appropriate, to manage  the various capital programming phases or major acquisition programs  within the agency.", "In addition, we found that other Centers\u2019 activities\u2014performing post- occupancy evaluations (POE) and updating standard designs when  applicable\u2014were also consistent with key principles and concepts in  OMB guidance for a disciplined capital planning process. For instance,  we found that a POE was completed for one project, a post-occupancy  questionnaire was completed for another project, a POE was planned  during fiscal year 2020 for a third project, and a fourth project was still  under construction. According to OMB capital programming guidance,  POEs are tools to evaluate the overall effectiveness of an agency\u2019s  capital acquisition process. The primary objectives of a POE include (1)  identifying how accurately a project meets its objectives, expected  benefits, and strategic goals of the agency and (2) ensuring the continual  improvement of an agency\u2019s capital-programming process based on  lessons learned. The guidance identifies factors to be considered for  evaluation in conducting a POE, such as standards and compliance,  customer/user satisfaction, and cost savings. The guidance also notes  that a POE should generally be conducted 12 months after the project  has been occupied, to allow time for the tenant to evaluate the building\u2019s  performance and relevant aspects of project delivery. However, the  guidance allows agencies some flexibility in the timing of a POE to meet  their unique needs if 12 months is not the optimal timing to conduct the  evaluation.", "Our review of Centers guidance and project documents also found that  the Centers\u2019 activities supported the Centers\u2019 objectives as well as AFSP  objectives and priorities. In addition, Centers officials emphasized that the  Centers participate in all Army standard design construction projects to  ensure that the facility designs support the objectives of the AFSP,  specifically improving the programing, design, and construction processes  for Army facilities. As shown in table 1 and further outlined below, we  assessed whether the Centers\u2019 activities undertaken on standard design  construction projects were applicable to the Centers\u2019 objectives. Then, for  those that were applicable, we determined whether those activities  supported the Centers\u2019 objectives. (See appendix IV for a detailed  analysis of how the Centers activities support the program\u2019s objectives.)", "Centers use POEs to evaluate standard designs: We found, for example, that the POEs led by the Centers are designed to evaluate whether the project met fundamental Army functional and mission requirements, whether the project implemented Army standard design, and whether improvements to the design could be made. These reviews support Centers objectives 1, 2, and 3\u2014 developing and refining Centers\u2019 policies and processes, consistently applying Army standard designs, and supporting AFSP objectives and priorities\u2014by identifying areas of the design needing improvement, evaluating whether a facility was constructed in accordance with the approved project design, and eliciting customer feedback concerning whether the finished facility meets mission requirements.", "Centers review standard design waivers: The Centers review an installation\u2019s waiver request and advise whether a waiver to Army standards or standard designs is required for that specific project. This process supports Centers objectives 1, 2, and 3\u2014developing and refining Centers\u2019 policies and processes, consistently applying Army standard designs, and supporting AFSP objectives and priorities. Specifically, part of the waiver review and approval process is the Centers\u2019 assessing whether a waiver request represents a unique need of a specific end user or a possible permanent change to the Army standard design or Unified Facilities Criteria. In addition, if the Centers waive the use of or approve deviations from standard design prior to the beginning of the construction phase, it may reduce the number of change orders that occur during construction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Has Limited Performance Measures to Track the Centers\u2019 Progress toward Key Objectives", "paragraphs": ["The Army, through its Centers of Standardization Management Board, is  responsible for oversight of the Centers and has performance measures  to track their progress in achieving one of their three key objectives.

The Board\u2019s primary oversight process consists of monitoring  program execution of the nine Centers. According to Center officials, the  Board reviews these execution plans at the semi-annual board meetings  to determine whether the Centers are executing as planned, that is have  the Centers met their goals for updating and developing standard  designs. We found that this oversight process enables the Board to  assess the progress each of the Centers has made toward achieving its  goals for updating existing standard designs and developing new ones.  For example, in fiscal year 2017 the Fort Worth Center completed all four  of its planned standard design updates, and the Honolulu Center  completed three of its four planned updates.", "We also found that the Board does not evaluate progress toward ensuring  that the Centers consistently apply standard designs across the Centers  of Standardization program (second objective of the Centers).  Specifically, as shown in table 1 above, the Centers engage in a number  of activities that support the consistent application of Centers standards  on a project-by-project basis. However, the Board does not maintain,  consolidate, or analyze information about how frequently the Centers  engage in such activities, or how the Centers\u2019 activities affect the  program. That is because, according to Army and Centers officials,  neither the Board nor the Centers have developed and implemented  performance measures to assess the progress the Centers are making in  ensuring that standard designs are consistently used. Absent such  measures, the Army lacks assurance that standard designs are being  applied, when appropriate, and that standard designs are being applied  consistently across the service.", "In fact, to provide the project-specific documentation that we reviewed,  the Centers needed to request documents from the USACE district office  responsible for the projects. According to Centers officials, this was  necessary because the Centers currently do not have a document  management system in which project documentation is stored. Instead,  as the USACE organization responsible for specific projects, each district  maintains its own project records. The officials stated that USACE  recently moved to a cloud-based system for storing project documents  and is exploring whether this system could provide a more central  document storage system. We note that having access to such  information, along with creating appropriate performance measures, could  enable the Board to measure whether progress has been made in  ensuring that standard designs are applied consistently.", "In addition, we found that the Board does not evaluate whether the  Centers are making progress in supporting the objectives and priorities of  the AFSP (third objective of the Centers). One of the objectives of the  AFSP is to reduce design costs and time, construction costs and time,  and the number of change orders issued during construction. Although  Army and Centers officials told us that the use of standard designs  reduces project costs, time, and change orders, they could not provide  supporting data. That is because, according to Army and Centers  officials, neither the Board nor the Centers have developed and  implemented performance measures to assess the effects of the use of  standard designs.

It utilizes two  levels of guidance for standardized facility types: a broad standard, called  \u201cArmy Standards,\u201d and a specific standard, called \u201cStandard Design.\u201d The  Department of the Navy program began in 2014 and provides policy and  standards for the design development, and revision of Navy project  documents in Navy and Marine Corps Design and Facilities Criteria, while  the Air Force program was started in 2016 and provides criteria in an Air  Force Instruction for design and construction of Air Force facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Crosswalk of Key Centers of Standardization Activities and Objectives", "paragraphs": ["The Centers of Standardization (Centers) undertake a number of  activities designed to support the key objectives found in their charter,  which includes supporting the objectives of the Army Facilities  Standardization Program (AFSP).
