Our nation's current operational polar-orbiting environmental satellite program is a complex infrastructure that includes two satellite systems, supporting ground stations, and four central data processing centers. In the future, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is to combine the two current systems into a single, state-of-the-art environment-monitoring satellite system. NPOESS is considered critical to the United States' ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting and global climate monitoring though the year 2020. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have formed a tri-agency integrated program office to manage NPOESS.

In recent years, the program has experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays, with cost estimates increasing to about $10 billion and launch delays approaching 3 years. These factors triggered the need for difficult decisions about the program's direction and capabilities. In mid-November 2005, GAO reported that the NPOESS executive committee expected to make a decision by December 2005 on the direction of the program. GAO noted the importance of making a decision quickly so that the program could proceed. However, in late November 2005, NPOESS cost growth exceeded a legislatively mandated threshold that requires DOD to certify the program to Congress. This placed any decision about future direction on hold until certification takes place in June 2006. In the meantime, the program office has implemented an interim plan to continue work on key sensors and other program elements using fiscal year 2006 funding. Following certification, a decision on future direction should be clear. Proceeding will require a new program baseline and renegotiated contracts--efforts that could take up to a year. As NPOESS undergoes the Defense certification process and important decisions are made on how the program is to proceed, there are several important considerations. First, NOAA and NASA representation in the DOD certification process is imperative. It will be important for these agencies to remain active players in the deliberation of options and the final decision on how to move the program forward. Second, continued indecision increases the risk of a gap in satellite coverage if the final satellite in the predecessor satellite series (the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites or POES) were to fail. Thus, once program direction is decided, it will be important to move quickly to adjust agency budgets and contracts.

The satellites obtain  environmental data that are processed to provide graphical weather  images and specialized weather products and are the predominant  input to numerical weather prediction models. These models are a  primary tool for forecasting weather 3 or more days in advance,  including forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes. The  models are used to predict the potential impact of severe weather so  that communities and emergency managers can help prevent and  mitigate their effects. Polar satellites also provide data used to  monitor environmental phenomena, such as ozone depletion and  drought conditions, as well as data sets that are used by researchers  for a variety of studies, such as climate monitoring.", "Unlike geostationary satellites, which maintain a fixed position  above the earth, polar-orbiting satellites constantly circle the earth  in an almost north-south orbit, providing global coverage of  conditions that affect the weather and climate. Each satellite makes  about 14 orbits a day. As the earth rotates beneath it, each satellite  views the entire earth\u2019s surface twice a day. Currently, there are two  operational POES satellites and two operational DMSP satellites  that are positioned so that they can observe the earth in early  morning, mid-morning, and early afternoon polar orbits. Together,  they ensure that, for any region of the earth, the data provided to  users are generally no more than 6 hours old. Figure 1 illustrates the  current operational polar satellite configuration. Besides the four  operational satellites, six older satellites are in orbit that still collect  some data and are available to provide some limited backup to the  operational satellites should they degrade or fail. In the future, both  NOAA and DOD plan to continue to launch additional POES and  DMSP satellites every few years, with final launches scheduled for  2007 and 2011, respectively.", "Each of the polar satellites carries a suite of sensors designed to  detect environmental data that are either reflected or emitted from  the earth, the atmosphere, and space. The satellites store these data  and then transmit them to NOAA and Air Force ground stations  when the satellites pass overhead. The ground stations then relay  the data via communications satellites to the appropriate  meteorological centers for processing. The satellites also broadcast  a subset of these data in real time to tactical receivers all over the  world.", "Under a shared processing agreement among four satellite data  processing centers\u2014NOAA\u2019s National Environmental Satellite Data  and Information Service (NESDIS), the Air Force Weather Agency,  the Navy\u2019s Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center,  and the Naval Oceanographic Office\u2014different centers are  responsible for producing and distributing, via a shared network,  different environmental data sets, specialized weather and  oceanographic products, and weather prediction model outputs.   Each of the four processing centers is also responsible for  distributing the data to its respective users. For the DOD centers,  the users include regional meteorology and oceanography centers,  as well as meteorology and oceanography staff on military bases.  NESDIS forwards the data to NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service for  distribution and use by government and commercial forecasters.

Before the contract was awarded in 2002,  the life cycle cost for the program was estimated to be $6.5 billion  over the 24-year period from the inception of the program in 1995  through 2018. Shortly after the contract was awarded, the life cycle  cost estimate was estimated to be $7 billion.", "When the NPOESS development contract was awarded, program  officials identified an anticipated schedule and funding stream for  the program. The schedule for launching the satellites was driven by  a requirement that the satellites be available to back up the final  POES and DMSP satellites should anything go wrong during the  planned launches of these satellites. In general, program officials  anticipate that roughly 1 out of every 10 satellites will fail either  during launch or during early operations after launch.", "Early program milestones included (1) launching NPP by May 2006,  (2) having the first NPOESS satellite available to back up the final  POES satellite launch in March 2008, and (3) having the second  NPOESS satellite available to back up the final DMSP satellite  launch in October 2009. If the NPOESS satellites were not needed to  back up the final predecessor satellites, their anticipated launch  dates would have been April 2009 and June 2011, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NPOESS Has Experienced Continued Cost Increases and Schedule Delays", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, the NPOESS program has experienced a  series of cost increases and schedule delays. In 2003, we reported  that changes in the NPOESS funding stream caused a delay in the  program\u2019s schedule. Specifically, a DOD program official reported  that between 2001 and 2002 the agency experienced delays in  launching a DMSP satellite, causing delays in the expected launch  dates of another satellite. In late 2002, DOD shifted the expected  launch date for the final satellite from 2009 to 2010. As a result, the  department reduced funding for NPOESS by about $65 million  between fiscal years 2004 and 2007. According to program officials,  because NOAA is required to provide the same level of funding that  DOD provides, this change triggered a corresponding reduction in  funding by NOAA for those years. As a result of the reduced funding,  program officials were forced to make difficult decisions about what  to focus on first. The program office decided to keep NPP as close  to its original schedule as possible, because of its importance to the  eventual NPOESS development, and to shift some of the NPOESS  deliverables to later years. This shift affected the NPOESS  deployment schedule. To plan for this shift, the program office  developed a new program cost and schedule baseline.", "After this new baseline was completed in 2004, we reported that the  program office increased the NPOESS cost estimate from about $7  billion to $8.1 billion, and delayed key milestones, including the  planned launch of the first NPOESS satellite\u2014which was delayed by  7 months. The cost increases reflected changes to the NPOESS  contract as well as increased program management funds.  According to the program office, contract changes included  extension of the development schedule, increased sensor costs, and  additional funds needed for mitigating risks. Increased program  management funds were added for noncontract costs and  management reserves.", "At that time, we also noted that other factors could further affect the  revised cost and schedule estimates. Specifically, the contractor was  not meeting expected cost and schedule targets on the new baseline  because of technical issues in the development of key sensors,  including the critical VIIRS sensor. Based on its performance  through May 2004, we estimated that the contractor would most  likely overrun its contract at completion in September 2011 by $500  million. In addition, we reported that risks associated with the  development of the critical sensors, integrated data processing  system, and algorithms, among other things, could contribute to  further cost increases and schedule slips.", "Most recently, in our November 2005 testimony, we noted that  NPOESS schedules, costs, and trends had continued to worsen.  We  reported that over the past year, NPOESS cost increases and  schedule delays demonstrated worsening trends, and that there  were continuing problems in the development of a key sensor. We  further noted that contractor data showed that costs and schedules  were likely to continue to increase in the future. Our trend analysis  at the time showed that the contractor would most likely overrun  costs by $1.4 billion, resulting in a life cycle cost of about $9.7  billion, unless critical changes were made. We also noted that  program risks, particularly with the development of critical sensors,  could further increase NPOESS costs and delay schedules. At the  November hearing, program officials confirmed that the program\u2019s  life cycle cost estimate would likely grow to $10 billion unless  critical changes were made to the program. Table 2 provides a  summary of recent growth in program cost estimates.", "As for schedule changes, in November 2005, we noted that the  program office anticipated at least a 10-month delay in the launch of  the first satellite (totaling at least a 17-month delay from the time the  contract was awarded) and a 6-month delay in the launch of the  second satellite. A summary of those schedule changes is shown in  table 3. The effect of these delays is evident in the widening gap  between when the last POES satellite is expected to launch and  when the first NPOESS satellite could be available if needed as a  backup. This is significant because if the last POES satellite fails on  launch, it will be at least 3 years before the first NPOESS satellite  could be launched. During that time, critical weather and  environmental observations would be unavailable\u2014and military and  civilian weather products and forecasts could be significantly  degraded.", "Problems involving multiple levels of management\u2014including  subcontractor, contractor, program office, and executive  leadership\u2014played a role in bringing the NPOESS program to its  current state. For example, the VIIRS sensor development issues  were attributed, in part, to the subcontractor\u2019s inadequate project  management. Specifically, after a series of technical problems,  internal review teams sent by the prime contractor and the program  office found that the subcontractor had deviated from a number of  contract, management, and policy directives set out by the main  office and that both management and process engineering were  inadequate. Neither the contractor nor the program office had  recognized the underlying problems in time to fix them. After these  issues were identified, the subcontractor\u2019s management team was  replaced. Further, in January 2005, the NPOESS Executive  Committee (Excom) called for an independent review of the VIIRS   problems. This independent review, delivered in August 2005,  reported that the program management office did not have the  technical system engineering support it needed to effectively  manage the contractor, among other things. We also reported that  the involvement of NPOESS executive leadership had wavered from  frequent heavy involvement to occasional meetings with few  resulting decisions. Specifically, the Excom had met five times over  the preceding 2 years. Most of these meetings did not result in major  decisions, but rather triggered further analysis and review.", "Sound management is critical to program success. In our reviews of  major acquisitions throughout the government, we have reported  that key factors determining a project\u2019s ability to be delivered on  time, within budget, and with promised functionality include sound  program management, contractor oversight, risk identification and  escalation, and effective and timely executive level oversight.

We compared changes in NPOESS cost and schedule estimates to  prior cost and schedule estimates as reported in our July 2002, July  2003, and November 2005 testimonies and in our September 2004  report.", "To further analyze trends that could affect the program in fiscal year  2006, we assessed the prime contractor\u2019s cost and schedule  performance. To make these assessments, we applied earned value  analysis techniques to data from the contractor earned value and  variance analysis reports. We compared the cost of work completed  with the budgeted costs for scheduled work during January 2006 to  show trends in cost and schedule performance against the interim  plan for fiscal year 2006.", "NOAA and DOD officials generally agreed with the facts presented  in this statement and provided some technical corrections, which  we have incorporated. We performed our work at the Integrated  Program Office, DOD, NASA, and NOAA offices in the Washington,  D.C., metropolitan area, between February 2006 and March 2006, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "This  is  a  work  of  the  U.S.  government  and  is  not  subject  to  copyright  protection  in  the  United  States.
