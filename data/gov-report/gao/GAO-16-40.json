When oil and gas infrastructure is no longer in use, Interior requires lessees to decommission it so that it does not pose safety and environmental hazards.

According to officials, Interior's procedures include (1) identifying and tracking unused infrastructure, (2) reviewing lessee plans to decommission infrastructure, and (3) using different cost estimates for decommissioning in shallow and deep water. However, inconsistent with internal control standards, Interior officials must manually enter cost estimates into Interior's main data system to override inaccurate estimates automatically calculated by the system. Without a more accurate data system, Interior does not have reasonable assurance that it will consistently estimate the costs associated with decommissioning.", "Interior's procedures for obtaining financial assurances for decommissioning liabilities pose financial risks to the federal government, and Interior is planning to revise its procedures to address these risks but has not finalized its approach. As of October 2015, for an estimated $38.2 billion in decommissioning liabilities in the Gulf, Interior officials identified about $2.3 billion in liabilities that may not be covered by financial assurances. However, these officials were unable to determine the extent to which these data were valid due to limitations with Interior's data system, among other things. Of the remaining $35.9 billion in decommissioning liabilities, Interior held or required about $2.9 billion in bonds and other financial assurances, and had foregone requiring about $33.0 billion in bonds for the remaining liabilities. Interior has procedures that allow it to waive its requirement for a lessee to provide a bond if the lessee passes a financial strength test. Prior GAO work has shown that the use of financial strength tests in lieu of bonds poses risks to the federal government. Interior recognizes the risks associated with its procedures, and Interior officials stated that they issued draft guidance to clarify their procedures in September 2015. Interior has not issued any final revisions to its procedures; therefore, it is too soon to evaluate the details of these proposed changes. Until Interior improves its ability to obtain valid data from its data system and revises and implements its financial assurance procedures, the federal government remains at increased risk of incurring costs should lessees fail to decommission oil and gas infrastructure.", "Interior faces challenges managing potential decommissioning liability. For example, until December 2015, Interior did not have a requirement for lessees to report on costs associated with decommissioning activities in the Gulf. Instead, Interior contracted studies to obtain data on decommissioning costs, but some data were decades old. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to obtain information from external stakeholders that may significantly affect their ability to achieve agency goals. However, in December 2015, Interior issued final regulations (proposed in 2009) requiring lessees to report data on most, but not all, decommissioning costs to Interior. Unless and until Interior obtains accurate and complete data on decommissioning costs, Interior may not have reasonable assurance that its cost estimates of decommissioning liabilities in the Gulf are accurate, or that it is requiring sufficient amounts of financial assurance based on these estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Interior take several steps to improve its data system, complete plans to revise its financial assurance procedures, and revise its cost reporting regulations, among other things.

The vast majority of this production  occurred on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Historically, most  offshore oil and gas activities have occurred in shallow water, but in  recent decades these activities have moved into deep water. More than  two-thirds of the more than 5,000 active oil and gas leases in the Gulf are  now located in deep water.", "The Department of the Interior (Interior) manages oil and gas activities on  offshore federal leases, including activities associated with thousands of  wells, platforms, and miles of pipelines on the outer continental shelf.  When this infrastructure is no longer useful for operations or otherwise  becomes idle, or when a lease has been expired for more than 1 year,  Interior requires oil and gas lessees to decommission it so that it does not  pose potential safety hazards to marine vessels and environmental  hazards to sea life and humans. Decommissioning refers to the process  of plugging wells, removing platforms and other structures, removing or  cleaning out pipelines, and clearing sites of debris. According to Interior  estimates, in shallow water, decommissioning infrastructure can cost tens  of millions of dollars per lease, depending on the number of wells and  types of structures present. In deep water, decommissioning can cost  hundreds of millions of dollars per lease. In addition, infrastructure  damaged by hurricanes is significantly more expensive to decommission  than nondamaged infrastructure.", "According to Interior\u2019s regulations, all lessees are liable for  decommissioning costs that accrue during their ownership. Before  lessees drill wells or install platforms and other structures, Interior  requires them to provide financial assurance to ensure that they are  capable of meeting their decommissioning obligations. This financial  assurance may be in the form of a financial asset provided by the lessee,  such as a bond, or a determination that a lessee has the financial  strength and ability to fulfill decommissioning obligations. According to  Interior officials, the federal government has not incurred costs associated  with offshore decommissioning since 1989, when a lessee declared  bankruptcy. In response to this bankruptcy, Interior promulgated  regulations in 1993 requiring some lessees to provide bonds specifically  for offshore decommissioning.

A caisson is a cylindrical or tapered large diameter  steel pipe enclosing a well conductor and is the minimum structure for  offshore development. A well protector provides support to one or more  wells with no production equipment and facilities. A more complex  structure in shallow water is a fixed platform, which uses a jacket and  pilings to support the superstructure, or deck. The deck is the surface  where work is performed and provides space for crew quarters, a drilling  rig, and production facilities. Most of the large fixed platforms have living  quarters for the crew, a helicopter pad, and room for drilling and  production equipment. A typical platform is designed so that multiple  wells may be drilled from it. Wells from a single platform may have  bottom-hole locations many thousands of feet (laterally displaced) from  the surface location.", "Structures in deep water rely on other methods to anchor to the ocean  floor. For example, a \u201ccompliant tower\u201d structure supports the deck using  a narrow, flexible tower and a piled foundation.

First, as of October 2015, according to BOEM officials,  BOEM had identified approximately $2.3 billion in decommissioning  liabilities in the Gulf that may not be covered by financial assurances but  was unable to determine in a timely manner the extent to which these  liabilities were valid. Specifically, after identifying data on potentially  uncovered decommissioning liabilities in TIMS, BOEM officials analyzed  these data over several months to determine their validity. That is, BOEM  officials tried to determine the extent to which these liabilities were  accurate and the extent to which valid liabilities were covered by financial  assurances. BOEM officials told us that, based on their analyses, some of  the $2.3 billion in decommissioning liabilities may be valid and uncovered  by financial assurances.", "However, according to BOEM officials, they were unable to quantify how  much of the $2.3 billion in decommissioning liabilities were valid and  uncovered by financial assurances due to limitations with the TIMS data  system and inaccurate data, among other things. For example, BOEM  officials stated that existing reports generated by the TIMS data system  did not provide all the necessary information for determining the validity of  data on decommissioning liabilities and financial assurances. As a result,  officials said that they had to create new reports to access additional data  stored in TIMS, and that these efforts were time consuming. In addition,  BOEM officials said that they identified leases that did not have wells or  platforms but for which TIMS contained estimates of decommissioning  liabilities. BOEM officials said that data associated with these  decommissioning liabilities may not be valid but that they would need to  consult with BSEE officials to determine their validity, which would take  additional time.", "BOEM officials stated that, in order to determine the validity of the data in  TIMS, they plan to consult with BSEE officials and continue to analyze  relevant data. Once they have determined the validity of the data, they  said that they will take steps to obtain financial assurances for any  uncovered decommissioning liabilities. However, officials were unable to  provide details on how or when they planned to address existing  limitations with the TIMS data system or determine the accuracy of data  on decommissioning liabilities. Internal control standards in the federal  government call for agencies to ensure that pertinent information is  identified, captured, and distributed in a form and time frame that permits  people to perform their duties efficiently. Without timely access to valid  data on decommissioning liabilities in the Gulf and associated financial  assurances, BOEM does not have reasonable assurance that it has  sufficient financial assurances in place, putting the federal government at  risk.", "For the purposes of ensuring that there is at least one responsible party with the  financial ability to fulfill lease decommissioning obligations, BOEM attributes all lease  decommissioning liabilities to any waived lessee on a lease (even if other responsible  parties are present on the lease). The waived lessee is, with all other lessees, jointly and  severally liable for decommissioning and relies on its financial strength to secure the costs  of this decommissioning, on behalf of all the jointly and severally liable parties.", "Under Interior regulations, regional directors may determine that a supplemental bond is  necessary to ensure compliance with a lessee\u2019s obligations. According to Interior officials,  supplemental bonding becomes a requirement once the regional director determines that  it is necessary.", "Adjusted net worth includes a percentage of a lessee\u2019s proven oil and gas reserves  added to a lessee\u2019s audited net worth. BOEM varies the total liability ratio it will accept  based on adjusted net worth\u2014for example, a lessee with between $65 million and $100  million in adjusted net worth can possess total lessee liabilities of no more than 2 or 2.5  times its adjusted net worth, depending on the size of the company\u2019s potential  decommissioning liability.", "Alternatively, BOEM allows a lessee to use a substitute criterion\u2014the lessee must  demonstrate that it produces in excess of an average of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent  per day on its leases. However, according to BOEM officials, of the 51 waived lessees  only 1 or 2 chose to use this alternative criterion. demonstrate reliability, as shown by a record of compliance with laws,  regulations and lease terms, among other factors.", "If a lessee passes the financial strength test by demonstrating its financial  ability to pay for decommissioning on its leases, BOEM waives its  requirement for the lessee to provide supplemental bonds. Other  responsible parties on the lease will also be waived from the requirement  to provide supplemental bonds. According to BOEM officials, BOEM  waives these parties as well because the waived lessee could be held  responsible if another party on a lease does not fulfill its decommissioning  obligations. In addition, a waived lessee may provide financial assurance  in the form of a corporate guarantee of the lease obligations of a lessee  on another lease.", "After BOEM waives a lessee from the requirement to provide  supplemental bonding, it monitors the financial strength of the lessee to  ensure it continues to pass BOEM\u2019s financial strength test. BOEM  conducts quarterly financial reviews for the first 2 years after a lessee  receives a waiver and then an annual review thereafter. In addition, on a  weekly basis, BOEM compares the decommissioning obligations (as  determined by BSEE) of all waived lessees with the financial information  provided by lessee audited financial statements. If BOEM finds that a  lessee no longer passes its financial strength test, BOEM will conduct a  more in-depth review of a lessee\u2019s financial status by reviewing financial  statements, credit ratings, and other financial information. BOEM may  also conduct an unscheduled financial review if: (1) BSEE revises its  estimate of a lessee\u2019s decommissioning liability, (2) a lessee\u2019s financial  status changes as reported by credit rating agencies, or (3) a lessee does  not pay the required royalties to the federal government. According to  BOEM officials, these reviews could cause BOEM to revoke a lessee\u2019s  waiver from the requirement to provide supplemental bonding. For  example, in May 2015, BOEM revoked the waiver of one lessee and,  according to BOEM officials, the waived lessee and related parties could  be required to provide as much as $1 billion in supplemental bonds.", "Our prior reports have found that the use of financial strength tests and  corporate guarantees in lieu of bonds poses financial risks to the federal  government. Specifically, we found, in August 2005, that the financial  assurance mechanisms that impose the lowest costs on the companies  using them\u2014 such as financial strength tests and corporate guarantees\u2014 also typically pose the highest financial risks to the government entity  accepting them. In that report, we found that, if a company passes a  financial strength test but subsequently files for bankruptcy or becomes  insolvent, the company in essence is no longer providing financial  assurance because it may no longer have the financial capacity to meet  its obligations. Such financial deterioration can occur quickly. While  companies no longer meeting the financial test are to obtain other  financial assurance, they may not be able to obtain or afford to purchase  it. In addition, in May 2012, we found that, according to the Bureau of  Land Management and the Environmental Protection Agency, corporate  guarantees are potentially risky because they are not covered by a  specific financial asset such as a bond. BOEM\u2019s use of the financial  strength test and corporate guarantees in lieu of bonds raises the risk that  the federal government may have to pay for offshore decommissioning if  lessees do not.", "The third way BOEM\u2019s procedures pose financial risks to the federal  government is that BOEM\u2019s financial strength test relies on measures that  may not provide an accurate indication of a lessee\u2019s ability to pay for  decommissioning. As described above, BOEM uses net worth (from a  lessee\u2019s audited financial statements) as a key measure in its financial  strength test. However, according to representatives from credit rating  agencies we spoke to, net worth provides limited value to assess a  company\u2019s financial strength and ability to pay future liabilities.  Specifically, these representatives said that net worth is \u201cbackward  looking\u201d and can be skewed by the volatile nature of commodity prices,  among other factors. Credit rating agencies use financial measures that  emphasize the evaluation of cash flow, such as debt-to-earnings and  debt-to-funds from operations to evaluate whether a company will be able  to pay its liabilities. Without the use of similar measures in its financial  assessments, BOEM may not have reasonable assurance that the  lessees it waives from the requirement to provide supplemental bonds  have the financial abilities to fulfill decommissioning obligations, which  may increase the financial risk to the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BOEM Plans to Revise Its Procedures to Reduce Financial Risks", "paragraphs": ["According to BOEM officials, BOEM recognizes the financial risks  associated with its current financial assurance procedures and plans to  revise its procedures to reduce risk. Specifically, BOEM officials told us  that BOEM\u2019s planned revisions would eliminate the use of financial  strength tests to completely waive lessees from the requirement to  provide supplemental bonding. Instead, BOEM plans to conduct financial  reviews of lessees\u2019 financial status and, based on those reviews, assign  lessees an amount of credit that may be used to reduce required bonding  associated with decommissioning liabilities on leases. Lessees would be  able to apportion this credit to leases, in coordination with other  responsible parties on those leases, to ensure that lease  decommissioning liabilities are fully covered by apportioned credit or  supplemental bonds. As part of BOEM\u2019s financial review of lessees, these  officials told us that BOEM plans to use criteria that emphasize the use of  measures such as cash flow and company liquidity while deemphasizing  the use of net worth. In addition to these planned revisions, in August  2014, BOEM announced its intent to update its regulations and program  oversight for offshore financial assurance requirements. BOEM solicited  stakeholder comments in response to this proposal and has held industry  forums to discuss potential changes to its financial assurance regulations  and procedures.", "According to BOEM officials, if BOEM were to use these criteria as part of  its financial strength test, some of the lessees currently waived from the  requirement to provide supplemental bonds could lose their waivers.  BOEM officials also stated that, if the revised procedures are  implemented as planned, lessees could be required to provide several  billion dollars in additional supplemental bonds. BOEM officials told us  they plan to update the bureau\u2019s financial assurance procedures in late  2015 or early 2016. In commenting on a draft of this report, Interior  officials stated that on September 22, 2015, BOEM issued proposed  guidance to clarify its financial assurance procedures. However, it is too  soon to evaluate the specific details of BOEM\u2019s proposed changes to its  financial assurance procedures because BOEM has not issued any final  revisions to its procedures.

Specifically, BSEE needs accurate and complete  information on decommissioning costs to estimate decommissioning  liabilities in the Gulf, and BOEM relies on BSEE\u2019s estimates to ensure  that it is requiring sufficient amounts of financial assurance to cover  decommissioning liabilities.", "However, BSEE generally has not had access to current data on  decommissioning costs. Prior to December 2015, under BSEE\u2019s  regulations, lessees were not required to report costs associated with  decommissioning activities to BSEE. According to BSEE regional officials,  data on decommissioning costs were considered proprietary, and  companies generally did not share this information with BSEE. Instead,  BSEE regional officials relied on other sources of data\u2014some of which  are decades old and, as a result, likely inaccurate\u2014to estimate costs  associated with decommissioning liabilities. According to BSEE regional  officials, their estimates for decommissioning liabilities in shallow water  were based on data provided by the oil and gas industry in 1995. For  decommissioning liabilities in water depths of 400 to 1,400 feet, their  estimates were based on information in a 2009 report that Interior  contracted. For decommissioning liabilities for subsea wells, BSEE  officials said that they had developed their own models for estimating  costs based on an analysis of a variety of factors, such as the daily cost  of hiring a vessel in the Gulf to plug wells.", "During the course of our audit, BSEE regional officials told us that they  planned to improve this process and the resulting data by issuing a  regulation requiring such data to be submitted. Specifically, Interior issued  a proposed rule in May 2009 to establish new requirements for lessees to  submit expense information on costs associated with plugging and  abandonment, platform removal, and site clearance. In December 2015,  BSEE issued a final rule establishing these requirements. However,  according to BSEE regional officials, the rule does not require lessees to  submit expense information on costs associated with decommissioning  pipelines, and officials were unable to provide details as to when or  whether BSEE would issue a new rule to require the reporting of such  costs.

However, the transfer of rights to a lease may affect a  lessee\u2019s financial status. For example, lessees may transfer lease  ownership and the right to operate on a lease, which also obligates the  new owner to decommission infrastructure on the lease. Under Interior  regulations, these transfers must be approved by BOEM.", "Lessees can also transfer rights to lease production revenue. Transfers  of these revenue rights generally allow the receiving party to obtain a  portion of the revenue from oil and gas production over a period of time  and the lessee, in turn, is paid in advance of production. The more  revenue rights a lessee transfers to other parties, the less revenue the  lessee has to cover its other obligations, including decommissioning.  However, unlike transfers of lease ownership and operating rights,  transfers of revenue rights do not obligate the new owner to  decommission, and lessees are not required to obtain BOEM\u2019s approval  for these transfers. BOEM requires lessees to report these transfers, but  its regulations do not establish a clear deadline for the reporting. As a  result, BOEM is not always aware of such transfers in a timely manner.", "For example, in one recent case, a waived lessee that had previously  transferred most of its revenue rights to other parties subsequently  declared bankruptcy. BOEM was unaware of these transfers until  bankruptcy court proceedings. Had BOEM been aware of these transfers  during its weekly review of the waived lessee, it could have revoked the  lessee\u2019s waiver if it determined the lessee no longer passed the financial  strength test. Consequently, BOEM then could have required the lessee  or its co-lessees to provide supplemental bonds to cover its  decommissioning obligations. In this case, the transfer of revenue rights  left the lessee with insufficient assets to pay all of its liabilities during  bankruptcy, including decommissioning. Though other lessees were held  liable for decommissioning costs under joint and several liability, the  government was at increased risk of incurring costs if the other lessees  had been unwilling or unable to perform decommissioning.", "BOEM officials told us that they created an internal group to help improve  BOEM\u2019s knowledge of revenue rights transfers and the effect of transfers  on a lessee\u2019s financial status.

BSEE  officials in the Gulf region have developed procedures for reviewing idle  and terminated lease infrastructure to ensure that this infrastructure is  decommissioned. In addition, in December 2015, BSEE issued final  regulations (proposed in 2009) requiring lessees to report  decommissioning costs directly to BSEE. However, several problems  remain. First, BSEE\u2019s recent regulations do not require lessees to report  costs associated with decommissioning pipelines. Unless and until BSEE  obtains all relevant cost data, it may continue to use outdated data to  assess decommissioning liabilities. Second, limitations of Interior\u2019s  current data system restrict BSEE\u2019s ability to record estimates of  decommissioning costs, and it is unclear how BSEE\u2019s new data system  will address these limitations or when it will be available. Without access  to complete data on decommissioning costs, and without the ability to  accurately and completely record data in Interior\u2019s main data system,  BSEE does not have reasonable assurance that its estimates of  decommissioning liabilities in the Gulf are accurate, and BOEM may not  have reasonable assurance that it is requiring sufficient amounts of  financial assurance based on BSEE\u2019s estimates. Third, BSEE does not  have finalized, documented procedures for identifying and tracking idle  and terminated lease infrastructure and estimating decommissioning  liabilities. Without such documented procedures, BSEE does not have  reasonable assurance that it will consistently conduct such activities in  the future, which could limit the effectiveness of BSEE\u2019s oversight of the  decommissioning process.", "Moreover, while BOEM is taking important steps to ensure that the  financial assurance procedures used by the federal government are  reducing the government\u2019s exposure to decommissioning costs by  updating its procedures to assess the financial strength of lessees, we  continue to have three concerns. First, BOEM identified roughly $2.3  billion in decommissioning liabilities in the Gulf that may not be covered  by financial assurances but was unable to determine the extent to which  these liabilities were valid after several months of analysis due to  limitations with the TIMS data system and inaccurate data. As a result, it  is unclear whether BOEM has obtained sufficient financial assurances to  cover decommissioning liabilities in the Gulf. Without timely access to  valid data on decommissioning liabilities and associated financial  assurances, BOEM cannot ensure that it has sufficient financial  assurances in place, putting the federal government at financial risk.  Second, to date BOEM has not taken concrete steps to revise its current  procedures. As a result, it is unclear whether BOEM\u2019s planned revisions  will improve its procedures and the extent to which these revisions will  increase the amount of bonding that lessees provide. Until BOEM revises  its financial assurance procedures, the federal government remains at  increased risk of incurring costs should lessees fail to decommission oil  and gas infrastructure. Third, BOEM is not always aware when lessees  transfer rights to lease production revenue. While BOEM\u2019s current  regulations require lessees to report such transfers, these regulations do  not clearly establish a deadline for reporting.
