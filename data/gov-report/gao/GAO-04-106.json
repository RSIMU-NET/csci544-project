In 2001, GAO reported that the VA missed opportunities to test about 50 percent of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C. GAO was asked to (1) review VA's fiscal year 2002 performance measurement results in testing veterans at risk for hepatitis C, (2) identify factors that impede VA's efforts to test veterans for hepatitis C, and (3) identify actions taken by VA networks and medical facilities to improve the testing rate of veterans at risk for hepatitis C. GAO reviewed VA's fiscal year 2002 hepatitis C performance results and compared them against VA's national performance goals, interviewed headquarters and field officials in three networks, and conducted a case study in one network."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VA's performance measurement result shows that it tested, in fiscal year 2002 or earlier, 5,232 (62 percent) of the 8,501 veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C in VA's performance measurement sample, exceeding its fiscal year 2002 national goal of 55 percent. Thousands of veterans (about one-third) of those identified as at risk for hepatitis C infection in VA's performance measurement sample were not tested. VA's hepatitis C testing result is a cumulative measure of performance over time and does not only reflect current fiscal year performance. GAO found Network 5 (Baltimore) tested 38 percent of veterans in fiscal year 2002 as compared to Network 5's cumulative performance result of 60 percent. In its case study of Network 5, which was one of the networks to exceed VA's fiscal year 2002 performance goal, GAO identified several factors that impeded the hepatitis C testing process. These factors were tests not being ordered by the provider, ordered tests not being completed, and providers being unaware that needed tests had not been ordered or completed. For more than two-thirds of the veterans identified as at risk but not tested for hepatitis C, the testing process failed because hepatitis C tests were not ordered, mostly due to poor communication between clinicians. For the remaining veterans, the testing process was not completed because orders had expired by the time veterans visited the laboratory or test orders were overlooked because laboratory staff had to scroll back and forth through daily lists, a cumbersome process, to identify active orders. Moreover, during subsequent primary care visits by these untested veterans, providers often did not recognize that hepatitis C tests had not been ordered nor had their results been obtained. Consequently, undiagnosed veterans risk unknowingly transmitting the disease as well as potential complications resulting from delayed treatment. The three networks GAO looked at--5 (Baltimore), 2 (Albany), and 9 (Nashville)--have taken steps intended to improve the testing rate of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C. To do this, in two networks officials modified clinical reminders in the computerized medical record to alert providers that for ordered hepatitis C tests, results were unavailable. Officials at two facilities developed a \"look back\" method to search computerized medical records to identify all at-risk veterans who had not yet been tested and identified approximately 3,500 untested veterans. The look back serves as a safety net for veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C who have not been tested. The modified clinical reminder and look back method of searching medical records appear promising, but neither the networks nor VA has evaluated their effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1998, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched a major  initiative to screen all veterans treated at VA facilities by asking them a  series of questions about possible risk factors for hepatitis C and  performing blood tests for those veterans identified as being at risk for  contracting the disease. Hepatitis C is a chronic disease caused by a  blood-borne virus that can lead to potentially fatal liver-related conditions.  This initiative represents a major undertaking for VA, which provided  health care services to approximately 4.7 million veterans and identified  over 180,000 veterans with hepatitis C infections in fiscal year 2002.", "In June 2001, we testified before your subcommittee that VA was not  conducting hepatitis C risk factor screening for about 80 percent of  veterans making outpatient clinic visits to VA facilities and not testing, on  average, about half of the veterans it identified with at least one risk factor  at four VA facilities we visited. We concluded and VA agreed that for VA  to identify undiagnosed veterans, it would need to establish early  detection as a standard of care and hold managers accountable for the  testing of identified at-risk veterans who receive care in VA\u2019s outpatient  clinics. As a result, VA implemented a hepatitis C screening and testing  process and, in fiscal year 2002, included both screening and testing of  veterans for hepatitis C in its performance measurement system. VA\u2019s  hepatitis C screening and testing performance is measured by reviewing a  sample of veterans\u2019 medical records to determine the percentage of  veterans screened against a list of risk factors for the disease and the  percentage of at-risk veterans who are subsequently tested. To be included  in the hepatitis C testing performance measure, the veteran does not have  to have been tested in fiscal year 2002; testing may have occurred in a  prior fiscal year. VA established its fiscal year 2002 national hepatitis C  testing performance goal at 55 percent. For the veterans\u2019 medical records  to be included in the performance measurement sample, veterans must  have been enrolled to receive VA health care for 2 continuous years and  been seen at least once during the current fiscal year in one of VA\u2019s  primary care clinics.", "VA\u2019s hepatitis C screening performance result for fiscal year 2002 was 85  percent, a significant improvement from its baseline result of 51 percent in  fiscal year 2001. As a result, you asked us to focus our work on testing  performance and we (1) reviewed VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance  measurement results in testing veterans it identified as at risk for hepatitis  C, (2) identified factors that impede VA\u2019s efforts to test veterans for  hepatitis C in one VA health care network, and (3) identified actions taken  by VA networks and medical facilities intended to improve the testing rate  of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C.", "We reviewed VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance measurement process  results in testing veterans it identified as at risk for hepatitis C, the most  recently available data at the time we conducted our work. Specifically, to  assess VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance measurement results, we  compared VA\u2019s national and individual network performance results for  testing veterans in fiscal year 2002 or earlier against VA\u2019s national goal and  analyzed VA\u2019s method for calculating performance results. In addition, we  looked at one VA health care network\u2019s testing rate for at-risk veterans  visiting its clinics in fiscal year 2002. We identified factors that impede  VA\u2019s efforts to test veterans for hepatitis C through a case study of VA\u2019s  Network 5 (Baltimore), which included interviews with network and  facility officials and clinical staff. From the medical record review we were  able to determine if a hepatitis C test was ordered, if the ordered test was  completed, if the veteran visited the laboratory and provider after the test  was ordered, and if a test result was present in the medical record.  Network 5 was chosen for the case study because its rate of hepatitis C  testing was comparable to VA\u2019s national performance results. To identify  actions taken by networks and medical facilities intended to improve the  rate of hepatitis C testing, we expanded our interviews of VA officials and  clinical staff beyond Network 5 (Baltimore) to include staff in Network 2  (Albany) and Network 9 (Nashville). For a complete description of our  scope and methodology, see appendix I. Our review was conducted from  April 2002 through November 2003 and in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Hepatitis C was first recognized as a unique disease in 1989. It is the most  common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States and is a  leading cause of chronic liver disease. The virus causes a chronic  infection in 85 percent of cases. Hepatitis C, which is the leading  indication for liver transplantation, can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis  (scarring of the liver), or end-stage liver disease. Most people infected with  hepatitis C are relatively free of physical symptoms. While hepatitis C  antibodies generally appear in the blood within 3 months of infection, it  can take 15 years or longer for the infection to develop into cirrhosis.  Blood tests to detect the hepatitis C antibody, which became available in  1992, have helped to virtually eliminate the risk of infection through blood  transfusions and have helped curb the spread of the virus. Many  individuals were already infected, however, and because many of them  have no symptoms, they are unaware of their infection. Hepatitis C  continues to be spread through blood exposure, such as inadvertent  needle-stick injuries in health care workers and through the sharing of  needles by intravenous drug abusers.", "Early detection of hepatitis C is important because undiagnosed persons  miss opportunities to safeguard their health by unknowingly behaving in  ways that could speed the progression of the disease. For example,  alcohol use can hasten the onset of cirrhosis and liver failure in those  infected with the hepatitis C virus. In addition, persons carrying the virus  pose a public health threat because they can infect others.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly 4  million Americans are infected with the hepatitis C virus. Approximately  30,000 new infections occur annually. The prevalence of hepatitis C  infection among veterans is unknown, but limited survey data suggest that  hepatitis C has a higher prevalence among veterans who are currently  using VA\u2019s health care system than among the general population because  of veterans\u2019 higher frequency of risk factors. A 6 year study\u20141992\u20131998\u2014  of veterans who received health care at the VA Palo Alto Health Care  System in Northern California reported that hepatitis C infection was  much more common among veterans within a very narrow age  distribution\u201441 to 60 years of age\u2014and intravenous drug use was the  major risk factor. VA began a national study of the prevalence of hepatitis  C in the veteran population in October 2001. Data collection for the study  has been completed but results have not been approved for release. The  prevalence of hepatitis C among veterans could have a significant impact  on current and future VA health care resources, because hepatitis C  accounts for over half of the liver transplants needed by VA  patients\uf8e7costing as much as $140,000 per transplant\uf8e7and the drug  therapy to treat hepatitis C is costly\uf8e7about $13,000 for a 48-week  treatment regimen.", "In the last few years, considerable research has been done concerning  hepatitis C. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) held a consensus  development conference on hepatitis C in 1997 to assess the methods used  to diagnose, treat, and manage hepatitis C infections. In June 2002, NIH  convened a second hepatitis C consensus development conference to  review developments in management and treatment of the disease and  identify directions for future research. This second panel concluded that  substantial advances had been made in the effectiveness of drug therapy  for chronic hepatitis C infection.", "VA\u2019s Public Health Strategic Healthcare Group is responsible for VA\u2019s  hepatitis C program, which mandates universal screening of veterans to  identify at-risk veterans when they visit VA facilities for routine medical  care and testing of those with identified risk factors, or those who simply  want to be tested. VA has developed guidelines intended to assist health  care providers who screen, test, and counsel veterans for hepatitis C.  Providers are to educate veterans about their risk of acquiring hepatitis C,  notify veterans of hepatitis C test results, counsel those infected with the  virus, help facilitate behavior changes to reduce veterans\u2019 risk of  transmitting hepatitis C, and recommend a course of action. In January  2003, we reported that VA medical facilities varied considerably in the time  that veterans must wait before physician specialists evaluate their medical  conditions concerning hepatitis C treatment recommendations.", "To assess the effectiveness of VA\u2019s implementation of its universal  screening and testing policy, VA included performance measures in the  fiscal year 2002 network performance plan. Network performance  measures are used by VA to hold managers accountable for the quality of  health care provided to veterans. For fiscal year 2002, the national goal for  testing veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C was established at 55  percent based on preliminary performance results obtained by VA. To  measure compliance with the hepatitis C performance measures, VA uses  data collected monthly through its External Peer Review Program, a  performance measurement process under which medical record reviewers  collect data from a sample of veterans\u2019 computerized medical records.", "Development of VA\u2019s computerized medical record began in the mid-1990s  when VA integrated a set of clinical applications that work together to  provide clinicians with comprehensive medical information about the  veterans they treat. Clinical information is readily accessible to health care  providers at the point of care because the veteran\u2019s medical record is  always available in VA\u2019s computer system. All VA medical facilities have  computerized medical record systems.", "Clinical reminders are electronic alerts in veterans\u2019 computerized medical  records that remind providers to address specific health issues. For  example, a clinical reminder would alert the provider that a veteran needs  to be screened for certain types of cancer or other disease risk factors,  such as hepatitis C. In July 2000, VA required the installation of hepatitis C  clinical reminder software in the computerized medical record at all  facilities. This reminder alerted providers when they opened a veteran\u2019s  computerized medical record that the veteran needed to be screened for  hepatitis C. In fiscal year 2002, VA required medical facilities to install an  enhanced version of the July 2000 clinical reminder. The enhanced version  alerts the provider to at-risk veterans who need hepatitis C testing, is  linked directly to the entry of laboratory orders for the test, and is satisfied  once the hepatitis C test is ordered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Thousands of Veterans Identified as At Risk Remain Untested for Hepatitis C Despite VA Exceeding Its Testing Goal", "paragraphs": ["Even though VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance measurement results show  that it tested 62 percent of veterans identified to be at risk for hepatitis C,  exceeding its national goal of 55 percent, thousands of veterans in the  sample who were identified as at risk were not tested. Moreover, the  percentage of veterans identified as at risk who were tested varied widely  among VA\u2019s 21 health care networks. Specifically, we found that VA  identified in its performance measurement sample 8,501 veterans  nationwide who had hepatitis C risk factors out of a sample of 40,489  veterans visiting VA medical facilities during fiscal year 2002. VA  determined that tests were completed, in fiscal year 2002 or earlier, for 62  percent of the 8,501 veterans based on a review of each veteran\u2019s medical  record through its performance measurement process. For the remaining  38 percent (3,269 veterans), VA did not complete hepatitis C tests when  the veterans visited VA facilities. The percentage of identified at-risk  veterans tested for hepatitis C ranged, as table 1 shows, from 45 to 80  percent for individual networks. Fourteen of VA\u2019s 21 health care networks  exceeded VA\u2019s national testing performance goal of 55 percent, with 7  networks exceeding VA\u2019s national testing performance level of 62 percent.  The remaining 7 networks that did not meet VA\u2019s national performance  goal tested from 45 percent to 54 percent of at-risk veterans.", "VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 testing rate for veterans identified as at risk for  hepatitis C reflects tests performed in fiscal year 2002 and in prior fiscal  years. Thus, a veteran who was identified as at risk and tested for hepatitis  C in fiscal year 1998 and whose medical record was reviewed as part of the  fiscal year 2002 sample would be counted as tested in VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002  performance measurement result. As a result of using this cumulative  measurement, VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance result for testing at-risk  veterans who visited VA facilities in fiscal year 2002 and need hepatitis C  tests is unknown. To determine if the testing rate is improving for veterans  needing hepatitis C tests when they were seen at VA in fiscal year 2002, VA  would also need to look at a subset of the sample of veterans currently  included in its performance measure. For example, when we excluded  veterans from the sample who were tested for hepatitis C prior to fiscal  year 2002, and included in the performance measurement sample only  those veterans who were seen by VA in fiscal year 2002 and needed to be  tested for hepatitis C, we found Network 5 tested 38 percent of these  veterans as compared to Network 5\u2019s cumulative performance  measurement result of 60 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Impeded One Network\u2019s Efforts to Test Veterans Identified as At Risk", "paragraphs": ["We identified three factors that impeded the process used by our case  study network, VA\u2019s Network 5 (Baltimore), for testing veterans identified  as at risk for hepatitis C. The factors were tests not being ordered by the  provider, ordered tests not being completed, and providers being unaware  that needed tests had not been ordered or completed. More than two- thirds of the time, veterans identified as at risk were not tested because  providers did not order the test, a crucial step in the process. The  remainder of these untested veterans had tests ordered by providers, but  the actual laboratory testing process was not completed. Moreover,  veterans in need of hepatitis C testing had not been tested because  providers did not always recognize during subsequent clinic visits that the  hepatitis C testing process had not been completed.

First,  facilities lacked a method for clear communication between nurses who  identified veterans\u2019 risk factors and providers who ordered hepatitis C  tests. For example, in two facilities, nurses identified veterans\u2019 need for  testing but providers were not alerted through a reminder in the  computerized medical record to order a hepatitis C test. In one of these  facilities, because nursing staff were at times delayed in entering a note in  the computerized medical record after screening a veteran for hepatitis C  risk factors, the provider was unaware of the need to order a test for a  veteran identified as at risk. The three network facilities have changed  their practices for ordering tests, and as of late 2002, nursing staff in each  of the facilities are ordering hepatitis C tests for at-risk veterans. The  second reason for tests not being ordered, which was offered by a  clinician in another one of the three Network 5 facilities, was that nursing  staff did not properly complete the ordering procedure in the computer.  Although nurses identified at-risk veterans using the hepatitis C screening  clinical reminder in the medical record, they sometimes overlooked the  chance the reminder gave them to place a test order. To correct this,  nursing staff were retrained on the proper use of the reminder."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hepatitis C Test Orders Were Not Always Completed", "paragraphs": ["For the remaining 30 percent of untested veterans in Network 5, tests were  not completed for veterans who visited laboratories to have blood drawn  after hepatitis C tests were ordered. One reason that laboratory staff did  not obtain blood samples for tests was because more than two-thirds of  the veterans\u2019 test orders had expired by the time they visited the  laboratory. VA medical facilities consider an ordered test to be expired or  inactive if the veteran\u2019s visit to the laboratory falls outside the number of  days designated by the facility. For example, at two Network 5 facilities,  laboratory staff considered a test order to be expired or inactive if the date  of the order was more than 30 days before or after the veteran visited the  laboratory. If the veteran\u2019s hepatitis C test was ordered and the veteran  visited the laboratory to have the test completed 31 days later, the test  would not be completed because the order would have exceeded the 30- day period and would have expired. Providers can also select future dates  as effective dates. If the provider had designated a future date for the  order and the veteran visited the laboratory within 30 days of that future  date, the order would be considered active.", "Another reason for incomplete tests was that laboratory staff overlooked  some active test orders when veterans visited the laboratory. VA facility  officials told us that laboratory staff could miss test orders, given the many  test orders some veterans have in their computerized medical records. The  computer package used by laboratory staff to identify active test orders  differs from the computer package used by providers to order tests. The  laboratory package does not allow staff to easily identify all active test  orders for a specific veteran by creating a summary of active test orders.  According to a laboratory supervisor at one facility, the process for  identifying active test orders is cumbersome because staff must scroll  back and forth through a list of orders to find active laboratory test orders.  Further complicating the identification of active orders for laboratory  staff, veterans may have multiple laboratory test orders submitted on  different dates from several providers. As a result, when the veteran visits  the laboratory to have tests completed, instead of having a summary of  active test orders, staff must scroll through a daily list of ordered tests\uf8e7in  two facilities up to 60 days of orders\uf8e7to identify the laboratory tests that  need to be completed.

Further, almost all of the at- risk veterans who had hepatitis C tests ordered but not completed  returned for follow-up visits for medical care. Even when the first follow- up visits were made to the same providers who originally identified these  veterans as being at risk for hepatitis C, providers did not recognize that  hepatitis C tests had not been ordered or completed. Providers did not  follow up by checking for hepatitis C test results in the computerized  medical records of these veterans.

The sample of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis  C was selected from VA\u2019s performance measurement process\u2014also  referred to as the External Peer Review Process\u2014that is based on data  abstracted from medical records by a contractor. In addition, we looked at  one VA health care network\u2019s testing rate for at-risk veterans visiting its  clinics in fiscal year 2002. To test the reliability of VA\u2019s hepatitis C  performance measurement data, we reviewed 288 medical records in  Network 5 (Baltimore) and compared the results against the contractor\u2019s  results for the same medical records and found that VA\u2019s data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To augment our understanding of  VA\u2019s performance measurement process for hepatitis C testing, we  reviewed VA documents and interviewed officials in VA\u2019s Office of Quality  and Performance and Public Health Strategic Health Care Group.", "To identify the factors that impede VA\u2019s efforts to test veterans for  hepatitis C, we conducted a case study of the three medical facilities  located in VA\u2019s Network 5\uf8e7Martinsburg, West Virginia; Washington, D.C.;  and the VA Maryland Health Care System. We chose Network 5 for our  case study because its hepatitis C testing performance, at 60 percent, was  comparable to VA\u2019s national performance of 62 percent.", "As part of the case study of Network 5, we reviewed medical records for  all 288 veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C who were included in  that network\u2019s sample for VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance measurement  process. Of the 288 veterans identified as at risk who needed hepatitis C  testing, VA\u2019s performance results found that 115 veterans in VA\u2019s Network  5 were untested. We reviewed the medical records for these 115 veterans  and found hepatitis C testing results or indications that the veterans  refused testing in 21 cases. Eleven veterans had hepatitis C tests  performed subsequent to VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance measurement  data collection. Hepatitis C test results or test refusals for 10 veterans  were overlooked during VA\u2019s data collection. As such, we consider  hepatitis C testing opportunities to have been missed for 94 veterans.", "On the basis of our medical record review, we determined if the provider  ordered a hepatitis C test and, if the test was ordered, why the test was not  completed. For example, if a hepatitis C test had been ordered but a test  result was not available in the computerized medical record, we  determined whether the veteran visited the laboratory after the test was  ordered. If the veteran had visited the laboratory, we determined if the test  order was active at the time of the visit and was overlooked by laboratory  staff. Based on interviews with providers, we identified the reason why  hepatitis C tests were not ordered. We also analyzed medical records to  determine how many times veterans with identified risk factors and no  hepatitis C test orders returned for primary care visits.", "To determine actions taken by networks and medical facilities intended to  improve the testing rate of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis C, we  expanded our review beyond Network 5 to include Network 2 and  Network 9. We reviewed network and facility documents and conducted  interviews with network quality managers and medical facility staff\u2014 primary care providers, nurses, quality managers, laboratory chiefs and  supervisors, and information management staff. Our review was  conducted from April 2002 through November 2003 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Carl S.
