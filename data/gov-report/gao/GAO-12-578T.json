FHA cites declines in the fund's economic value due to higher-than-expected defaults, claims, and losses. At the same time, the other component of the ratio, insurance obligations, grew rapidly. The fund's condition also worsened from a budgetary perspective, with balances in the fund's capital reserve account reaching new lows. If the account were depleted, FHA would require more funds to help cover costs on insurance issued to date. FHA has indicated that it will narrowly avoid this scenario in fiscal year 2012. FHA enhanced methods for assessing the fund's financial condition but has not fully addressed GAO's 2010 recommendation for improving the reliability of its estimates. It relies on a single economic forecast, which does not fully account for variability in future house prices and interest rates. The approach GAO recommended would simulate numerous economic paths for house prices and interest rates would improve the reliability of its capital ratio estimates.", "FHA has taken or plans steps to better assess and manage risk. It created a risk office in 2010 and hired a consultant to recommend best practices. FHA plans to establish committees to evaluate risks at enterprise-wide and programmatic levels. It began a quality control initiative for single-family housing, in which program and field offices assess and report on risks, and enhanced lender and appraiser reviews. While FHA's consultant recommended integrating risk assessments, the quality control and risk office activities currently remain separate efforts. Also, since 2009, the Office of Single Family Housing has not updated assessments annually in accordance with HUD guidance. Without integrated and updated risk assessments that identify emerging risks, FHA lacks assurance it has identified all its risks. GAO recommended integrating quality control and risk office activities and updating assessments annually.", "GAO and others have identified limited staff, substantial reliance on contractors, and the need for modernized information systems as risks that the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) may face. Ginnie Mae has several planned initiatives to enhance its risk-management processes related to gaps in resources, contracts, and issuers, but these plans have not been fully implemented. It will be important for Ginnie Mae to complete these initiatives as soon as practicable to enhance its operations. Also, in developing inputs and procedures for the model used to forecast costs and revenues, the agency did not consider certain practices identified in guidance for preparing cost estimates of federal credit programs. Ginnie Mae has not developed estimates based on the best available data, performed sensitivity analyses to determine which assumptions have the greatest impact on the model, or documented why it used management assumptions rather than available data. By not fully implementing certain practices, which GAO believes represent sound internal controls for models, Ginnie Mae's model may not use critical data that could affect the agency's ability to provide well-informed budgetary cost estimates and financial statements.

Forecasts for the 2011  actuarial study predicted declines of 5.6 percent for FHA\u2019s single- family portfolio in 2011.

However, since 2008, the economic value has fallen as the  insurance-in-force has risen, dramatically lowering the capital ratio   (see fig. 2).", "At the same time, the Fund\u2019s condition has worsened from a budgetary  perspective. Historically, FHA has estimated that its loan insurance  program was a negative subsidy program (that is, estimated cash inflows  exceeded expected cash outflows). On the basis of these estimates, FHA  accumulated substantial balances in a budgetary account known as the  capital reserve account, which holds reserves in excess of those needed  for estimated credit subsidy costs and helps cover unanticipated  increases in those costs such as higher-than-expected claims. Reserves  needed to cover estimated subsidy costs are held in the Fund\u2019s financing  account.", "However, in recent years, the capital reserve account has covered large  upward reestimates of FHA\u2019s credit subsidy costs through transfers to the  financing account. As a result, balances in the capital reserve account fell  dramatically\u2014from $22 billion at the end of 2007 to an estimated $4.4  billion by the end of 2010 (see fig. 3). depleted, FHA would need to draw on permanent and indefinite budget  authority to cover additional increases in estimated credit subsidy costs.  FHA\u2019s latest annual report to Congress raises the possibility that, if house  prices were to decline in 2012, the expected future losses on the current,  outstanding portfolio could exceed current capital resources. These would  be offset by the expected net receipts from the new 2012 cohort of loans.  But, according to HUD, if house prices were to decline in 2012 by an  amount rivaling that of 2011, these new loans would not be expected to  generate sufficient net receipts to offset any potential decline in value of  the current outstanding portfolio, potentially necessitating assistance from  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). Under one stress scenario in  which house prices decline by 13.7 percent in 2011, rather than the 5.6  percent assumed in the baseline scenario, and house prices decline  another 1.3 percent in 2012, HUD estimates that it may require $13 billion  in assistance from Treasury to ensure the financing account has sufficient  loss reserves.", "By the end of 2011, the balance in the capital reserve account rose slightly to $4.7 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA\u2019s Current Methodology for Assessing the Fund\u2019s Condition Does Not Fully Account for Future Economic Volatility", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in September 2010, FHA and its actuarial review  contractor enhanced their methods for assessing the Fund\u2019s financial  condition but still were addressing other methodological issues that could  affect the reliability of estimates of the capital ratio. Annual actuarial  reviews of the Fund use statistical models to estimate the probability that  loans will prepay or result in insurance claims on the basis of certain loan  and borrower characteristics (such as loan-to-value ratios and borrower  credit scores) and key economic variables (such as house prices and  interest rates). FHA and its contractor have enhanced these models in  recent years, by incorporating additional variables related to loan  performance and developed an additional model to predict loss rates on  insurance claims. Also, consistent with recommendations we made in a  prior report, in 2003, the actuarial reviews began to analyze the impact of  more pessimistic economic scenarios\u2014for example, nationwide declines  in home prices\u2014than they did previously.", "However, the current methodology is significantly limited by its reliance on  a single economic forecast to produce the estimate of the capital ratio that  is used to determine if the Fund is meeting the 2 percent capital reserve  requirement. This approach does not fully account for the variability in  future house prices and interest rates that the Fund may face. As a result,  baseline estimates of the capital ratio may tend to underestimate  insurance claims and mortgage prepayments and therefore may  overestimate the Fund\u2019s economic value. In a November 2003 report, the  Congressional Budget Office concluded that FHA could project the Fund\u2019s  cash flows more accurately by using an approach (stochastic simulation)  that involves running simulations of hundreds of different economic paths  to produce a distribution of capital ratio estimates.", "Given the uncertainty that always surrounds estimates of future economic  activity, the report we issued in 2010 recommended that HUD require the  actuarial review contractor to use stochastic simulation of future economic  conditions, including house prices and interest rates, to estimate the  Fund\u2019s capital ratio and include the results of this analysis in FHA\u2019s  annual report to Congress on the financial status of the Fund. However,  the most recent annual report does not include an estimate of the Fund\u2019s  capital ratio using this technique. In response to our 2010 report, FHA  officials told us that they were planning to require the actuarial review  contractor to use a stochastic simulation model for future actuarial  reviews.

To address credit risk and help improve the financial  condition of the Fund (which is supported by borrower premiums), FHA  raised premiums and made or proposed policy or underwriting changes.  For example, in April 2011, FHA increased its annual insurance premiums  from 0.85 percent to 1.10 percent for borrowers with 30-year loans with  initial loan-to-value ratios of 95 percent or less and from 0.90 percent to  1.15 percent for borrowers with 30-year loans with initial loan-to-value  ratios greater than 95 percent. Additionally, FHA increased down- payment requirements for borrowers with lower credit scores. FHA also  has proposed reducing allowable seller contributions at closing, thereby  helping to ensure that buyers put more of their own funds into the home  purchase. Further, FHA has been revising its mortgage scorecard  algorithm to recognize the effect of various risk elements not currently  discerned by the scorecard and determine what cases warrant manual  underwriting. According to FHA, these revisions are in the early stages,  and no completion date has been set.", "To address operational risks and improve its risk-assessment strategy, in  2010, FHA established the Office of Risk Management and Regulatory  Affairs and created the position of Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk  Management and Regulatory Affairs, which reports directly to the  Assistant Secretary for Housing-FHA Commissioner. To provide  assistance to the Office of Risk Management (one of the offices within the  Office of Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs) in developing a risk- management strategy and organizational structure and establishing risk- management policies and processes, FHA hired a consultant to produce  a comprehensive report and recommend best practices for its operation.According to FHA officials, FHA plans to adopt the consultant\u2019s  recommendation to establish an enterprise risk committee to address  overall risk to the organization and a second tier of committees to address  program and operational risks. In addition, in 2009 the Office of Single  Family Housing implemented an internal quality control initiative at  headquarters and the four homeownership centers. For the areas  identified as high-risk, headquarters and the homeownership center  divisions developed plans to document control objectives and established  a monitoring strategy in which each homeownership center submits  quarterly reports to headquarters on the effectiveness of the controls,  including the status of any mitigation efforts.", "However, FHA\u2019s risk-assessment strategy raises several issues. First,  FHA\u2019s current risk-assessment strategy is not comprehensive because it  is not integrated throughout the organization. While the consultant  recommended that FHA integrate risk assessment and reporting  throughout the organization, currently the Office of Single Family  Housing\u2019s quality control activities and the Office of Risk Management\u2019s  activities remain separate efforts. FHA officials noted that until the Office  of Risk Management sets up a governance process, the integration  suggested by the consultant would not be possible. In the meantime, FHA  officials stated that every effort was being made to help ensure that the  Office of Risk Management\u2019s activities complemented program office  activities. Second, contrary to HUD guidance, the Office Single Family  Housing has not conducted an annual, systematic review of risks to its  program and administrative functions since 2009. According to an official  in this office, although management intended to conduct an annual  assessment, the dates slipped because of changes in senior leadership in  the Office Single Family Housing, and few staff were available to perform  assessments (because of attrition and increased workload). Finally, the  Office of Single Family Housing\u2019s current risk-assessment efforts do not  include procedures for anticipating potential risks presented by changing  conditions. The consultant\u2019s report proposes a reporting process and  templates for identifying emerging risks and provides specific examples.", "Office of Risk Management officials told us that, once they are  operational, the risk committees eventually would determine the exact  design and content of these reports and templates.", "Moreover, implementation and integration of the new risk-assessment  strategy and its planned tools has been slow because of delays in  defining the Office of Risk Management\u2019s authority, difficulty filling new  staff positions in the Office of Risk Management, and changes in FHA  leadership.", "All these factors limit FHA\u2019s effectiveness in identifying, planning for, and  addressing risk. More specifically, without an integrated risk-assessment  strategy, certain risks may not be fully addressed at the operational level  in a way that minimizes risk to the insurance programs; without annual  reassessments of its risks, the Office of Single Family Housing lacks  assurance that its quality control efforts address all its risks; and without  ongoing mechanisms in place to anticipate and address new or emerging  risks, FHA lacks a systematic approach to help the agency identify,  analyze, and formulate timely plans to respond most effectively to  changed conditions and risks. Therefore, we recommended that FHA (1)  integrate the internal quality control initiative of the Office of Single Family  Housing into the operational risk processes of the Office of Risk  Management, (2) conduct an annual risk assessment, and (3) establish  ongoing mechanisms\u2014such as use of the report templates from the 2010  consultant\u2019s report\u2014to anticipate and address risks that might be caused  by changing conditions. FHA agreed with the recommendations and, as  of January 2012, indicated that it either was working toward achieving the  recommendations or had plans to do so in the very near future. For  example, FHA said it would leverage or integrate existing risk  management efforts as soon as the Office of Risk Management\u2019s final  governance structure and risk management strategies were in place. The  agency also stated that the Office of Risk Management would conduct an  annual risk assessment as a component of its overall risk management  strategy.

As of May 20, 2013, FHA will require a net worth  of $1 million for all lenders, plus 1 percent of the total loan volume in  excess of $25 million, to a maximum required net worth of $2.5 million.  To help ensure that lenders and appraisers follow its policies and  procedures, FHA also has enhanced the criteria used to select loans for  reviews. Specifically, since May 3, 2010, the agency has considered high- risk loan or borrower characteristics, such as certain types of refinanced  loans and loans to borrowers with low credit scores. Additionally, FHA  increased the number of risk factors used to target lenders for review.  FHA also has revised its approach for overseeing appraisers.", "FHA has addressed staffing and training needs and succession planning  to some extent, but it lacks plans that strategically address future  workforce needs, including replacing retiring staff.

FHA previously had a multiyear workforce plan that identified  the critical competencies; analyzed skills and competencies, including  gaps; and proposed comprehensive strategies to address these gaps, but  it has not created another such plan. Instead, FHA has relied on occasional Resource Estimation and Allocation Process studies and  annual managerial assessments of staffing and training needs.", "FHA also currently does not have a succession plan, although a plan for  2006\u20132009 identified mission-critical positions, analyzed existing staff  competencies, assessed the number of retirement-eligible employees,  and determined the probability of near-term retirements.  Succession  planning is particularly important because, as of July 2011, almost 50  percent of the Office of Single Family Housing staff at headquarters were  eligible to retire in the next 3 years. The percentage of staff eligible to  retire at the homeownership centers was even higher\u201463 percent.", "While FHA has taken some steps to address succession planning, these  steps have been limited. FHA implemented two initiatives focused on  succession planning.

That is,  statutorily Ginnie Mae has flexibility to spend funds for contracting  expenses because these expenses can be funded from agency revenues  without annual appropriations. Ginnie Mae depends on contractors to  provide a variety of services, including those related to guaranteeing  MBS, such as collecting data from issuers and processing monthly  principal and interest payments to investors. In addition, Ginnie Mae  relies on several contractors to take over the servicing responsibilities on  pooled loans when issuers default. Ginnie Mae has used its own staff as  well as third-party assessments of contracts, to oversee its contractors  but plans to provide additional staff resources to supplement the third- party assessments. However, officials said that implementation of this  plan has been put on hold due to changes in the Ginnie Mae budget.  Additionally, Ginnie Mae has conducted risk assessments of its contracts  and potential operational risks, and it plans to review the proposed  recommendations and determine how to implement them.", "Ginnie Mae has been working on an ongoing initiative to improve its  information technology systems. According to officials, Ginnie Mae has  been working on the first phase of its business process improvement  initiative for the last few years based on a plan developed in conjunction  with the Office of Management and Budget. The main goal of the initiative  is to modernize the agency\u2019s technology by consolidating processes and  eliminating redundant systems. Some of the weaknesses included  outdated data systems, a reliance on paper-based processes, and a lack  of integrated data systems. According to Ginnie Mae, the first phase of  the initiative resulted in the creation of nine new information technology  system initiatives such as a system that allows Ginnie Mae to receive  enhanced reporting and provide status information to issuers. Ginnie Mae  has been drafting a strategy document for its ongoing initiative to look for  additional improvement opportunities in its information technology  systems.", "To manage its counterparty risk, Ginnie Mae has processes in place to  oversee MBS issuers that include approval, monitoring, and enforcement  and has revised its approval and monitoring procedures. For example, in  2010, Ginnie Mae increased the minimum net worth requirement for  issuers of Ginnie Mae-guaranteed MBS to $2.5 million. But, planned  initiatives to enhance its risk-management processes for issuers,  including its tracking and reporting systems, have not been fully  implemented. These initiatives include a plan to develop a database for  tracking the resolution and timing of findings from reviews of issuers. It  will be important for Ginnie Mae to complete its initiatives related to  operational and counterparty risk as soon as practicable. Our November  2011 report includes an appendix that contains a listing of Ginnie Mae\u2019s  planned and proposed initiatives and their expected completion dates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ginnie Mae Has Not Yet Implemented Certain Practices for Modeling Costs and Revenues", "paragraphs": ["In developing inputs and procedures for the model used to forecast costs  and revenues, Ginnie Mae did not consider certain practices identified in  Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) guidance for  preparing cost estimates of federal credit programs. Ginnie Mae has not  developed estimates based on the best available data, performed  sensitivity analyses to determine which assumptions have the greatest  impact on the model, or documented why it used management  assumptions rather than available data. By not fully implementing  practices in FASAB guidance that we believe represent sound internal  controls for models, Ginnie Mae\u2019s model may not be using critical data  that could affect the agency\u2019s ability to provide well-informed budgetary  cost estimates and financial statements. This may limit Ginnie Mae\u2019s  ability to accurately report to Congress the extent to which its programs  represent a financial exposure to the government.", "We recommended in our November 2011 report on Ginnie Mae that the  HUD Secretary direct Ginnie Mae to take steps to ensure its model more  closely follows certain practices identified in FASAB guidance for  estimating subsidy costs of credit programs. More specifically, Ginnie  Mae should (1) assess and document that it is using the best available  data in its model and most appropriate modeling approach; (2) conduct  and document sensitivity analyses to determine which cash flow  assumptions have the greatest impact on the model; (3) document how  management assumptions are determined, such as those for issuer  defaults and mortgage buyout rates; and (4) assess the extent to which  management assumptions, such as those for issuer defaults and  mortgage buyout rates, can be replaced with quantitative estimates.  Ginnie Mae has indicated that it plans to implement all of our  recommendations but has not provided a specific timeline. In addition,  Ginnie Mae agreed with our observation about the importance of  completing ongoing and planned initiatives for enhancing its risk- management processes, as soon as practicable, to improve operations.", "Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Olver, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
