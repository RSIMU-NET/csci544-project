Specifically, GAO was asked to determine (1) the magnitude of unpaid federal payroll tax debt, (2) the factors affecting IRS's ability to enforce compliance or pursue collections, and (3) whether some businesses with unpaid payroll taxes are engaged in abusive or potentially criminal activities with regard to the federal tax system. To address these objectives GAO analyzed IRS's tax database, performed case study analyses of payroll tax offenders, and interviewed collection officials from IRS and several states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS records show that, as of September 30, 2007, over 1.6 million businesses owed over $58 billion in unpaid federal payroll taxes, including interest and penalties. Some of these businesses took advantage of the existing tax enforcement and administration system to avoid fulfilling or paying federal tax obligations--thus abusing the federal tax system. Over a quarter of payroll taxes are owed by businesses with more than 3 years (12 tax quarters) of unpaid payroll taxes. Some of these business owners repeatedly accumulated tax debt from multiple businesses. For example, IRS found over 1,500 individuals to be responsible for nonpayment of payroll taxes at three or more businesses, and 18 were responsible for not remitting payroll taxes for a dozen different businesses. Although IRS has powerful tools at its disposal to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and to collect the taxes that are owed, IRS's current approach does not provide for their full, effective use. IRS's overall approach to collection focuses primarily on gaining voluntary compliance--even for egregious payroll tax offenders--a practice that can result in minimal or no actual collections for these offenders. Additionally, IRS has not always promptly filed liens against businesses to protect the government's interests and has not always taken timely action to hold responsible parties personally liable for unpaid payroll taxes. GAO selected 50 businesses with payroll tax debt as case studies and found extensive evidence of abuse and potential criminal activity in relation to the federal tax system.

In 2007, IRS processed over 230 million tax returns and  collected over $2.7 trillion in taxes. Although the majority of businesses  and individuals voluntarily comply with the nation\u2019s tax laws, many do not.  For those that do not, IRS\u2019s enforcement programs collected over $40  billion in taxes from businesses and individuals in 2007. In spite of these  efforts, IRS has a significant gap between what taxpayers should pay and  what IRS actually collects.

This is partly because IRS\u2019s approach to collection focuses first  on gaining voluntary compliance, even for more egregious payroll tax  offenders. IRS acknowledges that in some instances its collection methods  do not bring taxpayers into compliance.", "We have previously reported that IRS subordinates the use of some of its  collection tools in order to seek voluntary compliance, and that IRS\u2019s  repeated attempts to gain voluntary compliance often results in minimal or  no actual collections. Our audit of businesses with payroll tax debt and  our analysis of businesses with multiple quarters of unpaid payroll taxes  again found revenue officers continuing to work with a business to gain  voluntary compliance while the business continued to accumulate unpaid  payroll taxes. As discussed earlier, our analysis of IRS\u2019s inventory of  unpaid payroll taxes found that over 10,000 businesses owed payroll taxes  for 20 or more quarters\u20145 years or more.", "One of our case studies illustrates the extent to which unpaid payroll taxes  can accumulate using a voluntary compliance approach for unpaid payroll  taxes. In this case, the business was opened in 1994, after its owner closed  a similar business that owed payroll taxes. From its inception, the case  study business was not compliant with tax laws, making some tax  payments, but not filing any of the required tax returns. In July 1999, IRS  identified that the business was not filing its required payroll tax returns  and assigned the case to a revenue officer for investigation. After working  with the business for 5 months, the revenue officer secured 22 quarters of  delinquent payroll tax returns. Those returns indicated a total tax debt,  including interest and penalties, of almost $500,000. In March 2000, the  business requested to be put on an installment agreement to repay over  time the known outstanding taxes it owed. However, the business was not  eligible for an installment agreement because it was not compliant with its  filing requirements. The revenue officer worked with the business for  another 9 months attempting to obtain the financial information needed to  initiate an installment agreement. Meanwhile, the business continued to  accumulate unpaid payroll tax debt of about $20,000 each quarter. The  revenue officer continued to work with the business to gain voluntary  compliance, but the business did not provide the needed financial  information until the revenue officer filed levies against the business\u2019s  known bank accounts in early 2001. The levies resulted in collections of  less than $5,000 toward the unpaid tax debt. After 2-1/2 more years, in  August 2003, the revenue officer noted that, though IRS had been seeking  compliance for several years, the business was still not compliant with  filing requirements, had not provided current financial information, and  was generally unresponsive. Although the revenue officer continued to  obtain some delinquent tax returns and some payroll tax payments as a  result of the officer\u2019s efforts, the business continued to accumulate  additional tax debt. As of July 2007, the business had accumulated payroll  taxes from over 30 quarters totaling almost $1 million, and other taxes,  including business income taxes, of almost $400,000. Those unpaid taxes  stretch back to the inception of the business in 1994. Additionally, the  business has not filed required payroll tax returns since the fourth quarter  of 2004\u2014potentially accruing a quarter million dollars in additional unpaid  payroll tax debt.", "Failing to take more aggressive collection actions against businesses that  repeatedly fail to remit payroll taxes has a broader impact than on just a  single business. If left to accumulate unpaid payroll taxes, businesses gain  an unfair business advantage over their competitors at the expense of the  government. As we have found previously, in at least one of our case  study businesses, IRS determined that the non-compliant business  obtained contracts through its ability to undercut competitors due in part  to the business\u2019s reduced costs associated with its non-payment of payroll  taxes. Similarly, in another case the revenue officer noted that the  business was underbidding on contracts and was using unpaid payroll  taxes to offset the business\u2019s losses.", "Failure to take prompt actions to prevent the further accumulation of  unpaid payroll taxes can also have a detrimental impact on the business  and the associated owners/officers. As we have reported in the past, non- compliant businesses can accumulate substantial unpaid taxes as well as  associated interest and penalties. Over time, these unpaid balances may  compound beyond the business\u2019s ability to pay\u2014ultimately placing the  business and responsible officers in greater financial jeopardy.", "It should be noted that IRS is legally precluded from taking collection  actions during certain periods, such as when a tax debtor is involved in  bankruptcy proceedings. During those periods, even though IRS may not  be able to take collection actions, tax debtors may continue to accumulate  additional tax debt. However, IRS\u2019s focus on voluntary compliance has  negatively affected IRS\u2019s collection efforts for years. Our current findings  on IRS\u2019s focus on voluntary compliance are similar to those of the  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) in a study  from 8 years ago. In its 2000 study, TIGTA found that revenue officers  were focused on IRS\u2019s customer service goals and therefore were reluctant  to take enforcement actions. As a result, they continued to work with tax  debtors to gain voluntary payment rather than using more aggressive  enforcement tools such as levies or seizures. TIGTA found that in 116  cases they reviewed, revenue officers did not file a lien, issue a summons,  or levy or seize assets in almost a third of the cases. Revenue officers  considered seizing assets in just 3 of the 116 cases, but actually seized  assets in just 1 case. TIGTA also reported that as a result of IRS not  taking effective collection actions, the cases (while under review by  TIGTA) accrued more unpaid taxes while assigned to revenue officers  than the revenue officers were able to collect. Again in 2005, TIGTA  reported that IRS allowed tax debtors to continue to delay taking action  on their tax debt by failing to take aggressive collection actions. TIGTA  found that IRS did not take timely follow-up action for half of the cases for  which tax debtors missed specific deadlines.", "IRS has recently strengthened its IRM to include some specific steps for  dealing with businesses that repeatedly fail to remit payroll taxes and to  stress the importance of preventing the further accumulation of unpaid  payroll taxes. The revised IRM advises revenue officers to take all  appropriate remedies to bring the tax debtor into compliance and that they  should consider seizing assets and pursuing TFRP assessments against  responsible parties. It is important for IRS to support taxpayers in  remaining compliant and to facilitate businesses becoming compliant;  however, having a primary focus on voluntary compliance can lead to  delays in taking stronger actions against flagrant tax debtors who refuse to  comply with the tax laws and accumulate dozens of quarters of payroll tax  debt. Having a reticence to use enforcement tools may, over time, actually  diminish voluntary compliance and collections. IRS\u2019s guidance states that  businesses that fail to comply with the tax law jeopardize the public  perception of tax enforcement, which has a detrimental effect both on  compliance and collections.", "One official from a state taxing authority told us that the state benefited  from IRS\u2019s approach because it allowed the state to collect its unpaid  taxes from business tax debtors before IRS. In one of our case study  businesses, although IRS successfully levied some financial assets, a  mortgage holder and state and local officials seized the business\u2019s assets  to satisfy the business\u2019s debts. In another case, IRS did not seize assets,  but received some collections because local officials seized and sold the  business owner\u2019s house.

Our analysis indicated that IRS had  not filed a lien to protect the government\u2019s interest in a business property  in over 30 percent of all payroll tax cases assigned to the field for  collection effort.

In 2005, TIGTA reported that IRS\u2019s revenue officers  often failed to take timely collection actions on payroll tax cases and  concluded that not taking timely and aggressive collection actions on  cases allowed businesses to continue to accumulate unpaid payroll taxes.

Our analysis of IRS\u2019s inventory of unpaid payroll taxes as of September 30,  2007, found that IRS had not filed liens on over one-third of all businesses  with payroll tax debt cases assigned to the field for collection efforts \u2013  over 140,000 businesses. IRS guidance states that filing a lien is extremely  important to protect the interests of the federal government, creditors, and  taxpayers in general, and that the failure to file and properly record a  federal tax lien may jeopardize the federal government\u2019s priority right  against other creditors.", "The ability to file a tax lien in the public records is a powerful tool for IRS.  The lien appears on credit reports for both individuals and businesses and  can stay there for approximately 10 years. For an individual, the presence  of a tax lien can make it more difficult to obtain credit, in turn making it  more difficult to buy a home, rent an apartment, or buy a car. Tax debtors  that are able to get credit may have to pay higher credit rates. For  businesses, the presence of a tax lien can result in a creditor no longer  shipping inventory unless paid for by cash and banks withdrawing lines of  credit. This can ultimately cause businesses to fail. Lien filing may also  increase the likelihood of collection by IRS. The 2005 IRS study of TFRP  cases found that cases where a lien had been filed had more average  payments\u2014about a third more\u2014than where a lien had not been filed.", "Although the IRM does not explicitly state that liens should be filed, it  does emphasize the need to do so to protect the interest of the federal  government. Because businesses may be highly leveraged or have few  tangible assets, the filing of a lien may not always be advantageous to the  government; other situations may also make it counterproductive to file a  lien. The IRM does allow revenue officers to not file a lien in order to  allow a business to obtain a loan or to otherwise continue operating so  that the business may become compliant and pay the past due tax debt.  However, failure to file a lien can have a negative impact on tax  collections. For example, IRS assessed the business owner in one of our  case studies a TFRP to hold the owner personally liable for the withheld  payroll taxes owed by the business. However, IRS did not assign the  assessment to a revenue officer for collection, and thus did not file a  Notice of Federal Tax Lien on the owner\u2019s property. Because there was no  lien filed, the owner was able to sell a vacation home in Florida and IRS  did not collect any of the unpaid taxes from the proceeds of the sale.", "As in the case above, IRS\u2019s case assignment policy can delay the filing of  liens for payroll tax cases. Because payroll tax cases are one of IRS\u2019s top  collection priorities, once the notification process is complete, IRS  bypasses its ACS process and routes these cases to revenue officers for  collection. However, IRS generally must place cases in a queue until a  revenue officer is available to work the cases. Cases can be in the queue  for extended periods of time awaiting assignment. For the period that a  case is in the queue, revenue officers are not assigned to file liens and take  other collection actions. Our analysis found that for the $9 billion of  payroll tax cases in the queue awaiting assignment as of September 30,  2007, over 80 percent of the cases did not have a lien filed. As a result,  lower priority tax cases that go through the ACS process may have liens  filed faster than the higher priority payroll tax cases.", "IRS has been aware of this issue. Its own study in 2005 found less than half  of payroll tax cases in which IRS assessed the business owner or officer a  TFRP had a lien filed to protect the interest of the government, and only 27  percent of TFRP assessments that were under a year old had a lien filed.  As the previously discussed case study illustrates, the timeliness of lien  filing is critical in such cases to protect the government\u2019s interest in the  owner\u2019s personal property and to encourage the owners/officers to make  the business compliant.", "IRS is taking some steps to address these issues. For example, IRS is  investigating the feasibility of routing payroll tax cases that might  otherwise be sent to the queue through the ACS process to have a lien  filed. Additionally, in recent years IRS has begun to put in the IRM  timeliness guidelines for the use of certain collection tools, including lien  filings. The IRM now calls for revenue officers to make a determination to  file a lien within 10 days of initial contact. These are positive steps which  could help improve the timeliness of IRS\u2019s lien filings in the future.  However, while not all cases warrant having a lien filed, our analysis has  shown that, overall, 60 percent of all unpaid payroll tax cases currently in  IRS\u2019s inventory do not have a lien filed to protect the government\u2019s interest  in tax debtors\u2019 property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Does Not Always Assess Trust Fund Recovery Penalties Timely", "paragraphs": ["Although IRS has a powerful tool to hold responsible owners and officers  personally liable for unpaid payroll taxes through assessing a TFRP, we  found that IRS often takes a long time to determine whether to hold the  owners/officers of businesses personally liable and, once the decision is  made, to actually assess penalties against them for the taxes. In reviewing  the sample of TFRP assessments selected as part of our audit of IRS\u2019s  fiscal year 2007 financial statements, we found that from the time the tax  debt was assessed against the business, IRS took over 2 years, on average,  to assess a TFRP against the business owners/officers. We found that  revenue officers, once assigned to a payroll tax case, took an average of  over 40 weeks to decide whether to pursue a TFRP against business  owners/officers and an additional 40 weeks on average to formally assess  the TFRP. For 5 of the 76 sampled cases, IRS took over 4 years to assess  the TFRP. We did not attempt to identify how frequently IRS assesses a  TFRP against responsible owners/officers. However, in TIGTA\u2019s 2005  report on its review of IRS\u2019s collection field function, it noted that for  cases where a TFRP was applicable, revenue officers did not initiate or  conduct the interview to begin the TFRP process in over a quarter of the  cases TIGTA reviewed.", "The timely assessment of TFRPs is an important tool in IRS\u2019s ability to  prevent the continued accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes and to collect  these taxes. Once a TFRP is assessed, IRS can take action against both the  owners/officers and the business to collect the withheld taxes. For  egregious cases, such as some of those in our case studies, taking strong  collection actions against the owners\u2019 personal assets may be the best way  to either get the business to become tax compliant or to convince the  owners to close the business, thus preventing the further accumulation of  unpaid taxes. Failure to timely assess a TFRP can result in businesses  continuing to accumulate unpaid payroll taxes and lost opportunities to  collect these taxes from the owners/officers of the businesses. For  example, one business had tax debt from 2000, but IRS did not assess a  TFRP against the business\u2019s owner until the end of 2004. In the meantime,  the owner was drawing an annual salary of about $300,000 and had sold  property valued at over $800,000. Within 1 month of IRS assessing the  TFRP, the owner closed the business, which by then had accumulated  about $3 million in unpaid taxes.", "Lack of timeliness in assessing TFRPs has been a long-standing problem  for IRS. Our annual audit of IRS\u2019s financial statements in the late 1990\u2019s  identified this problem and we made recommendations for IRS to analyze  and determine the factors causing delays in both processing and recording  TFRP assessments. Although IRS has taken many steps to improve the  timeliness of TFRP assessments, such as centralizing TFRP assessment  processing and implementing a new Web-based application, these actions  have not been fully effective in resolving this issue. During our audit of  IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2007 financial statements, we continued to find long  delays in IRS\u2019s processing and posting of TFRP assessments.", "For most of the time our case study businesses were being worked on by  revenue officers, the IRM required them to make a determination of  whether to pursue a TFRP assessment within 180 days\u2014about 26 weeks.  However, the IRM was silent about how long it should take to actually  assess the TFRP once revenue officers determined that the failure by the  responsible individuals to remit payroll taxes was willful. Additionally,  although IRS had a 180-day requirement to make a determination, revenue  officers could make the determination to delay the assessment, thus  making a timely determination while still not moving forward to formally  assess the TFRP against the responsible individuals.", "In September 2007, IRS implemented new IRM requirements to address  the timeliness of TFRP assessments. Under the new policy, revenue  officers are now required to make the determination as to whether to  pursue a TFRP within 120 days of the case being assigned and to complete  the assessment within 120 days of the determination.

Further, it treats the TFRP assessments as a separate  collection effort unrelated to the business tax debt, even though the  business payroll tax liabilities and the TFRP assessments are essentially  the same tax debt. As a result, once the revenue officer assigned to the  business payroll tax case decides to pursue a TFRP against the responsible  owners/officers, the TFRP case does not automatically remain with this  revenue officer. Accordingly, IRS often does not assign the TFRP  assessment to a revenue officer for collection, and when it does, it may not  assign it to the same revenue officer that is responsible for collecting  unpaid taxes from the business. In reviewing the sample of TFRP  assessments selected as part of our audit of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2007 financial  statements, we found that half of the TFRP assessments had not been  assigned to a revenue officer by the time of our audit. Of those that had  been assigned, over half of the TFRP assessments had not been assigned  to the same revenue officer that was working the related business case.", "Assigning the collection efforts against the business and the TFRP  assessments to different revenue officers can result in the responsible  owners/officers being able to continue to use the business to fund a  personal lifestyle while not remitting payroll taxes.

For example, one  of our case study businesses was assessed a TFRP, but since the TFRP had  a lower priority, it was sent to the queue. Because the case had not been  assigned, IRS did not file a tax lien on the owner of the business and thus  the assessment of the TFRP had very little impact. Additionally, since IRS  has a statutory time limitation to collect against a tax debt, this owner was  almost half-way through the statutory period before the case was ever  worked on.", "Assigning a single revenue officer could help improve IRS\u2019s ability to  ensure assessments are made, transaction codes are input, and collections  are properly posted against trust fund amounts to all related parties, a  long-standing problem identified as a part of our financial statement  audits.", "IRS collection officials said the agency categorizes the unpaid payroll tax  debt of the business as a high priority to ensure that higher-level revenue  officers are assigned mainly to the more complex business cases. IRS  may also assign the business payroll tax debt and the TFRP assessment to  different collection officials because the business and the responsible  owners/officers are not located in the same zip code area. For example, if  an officer is in a different state than the business, the collection efforts  would be handled by separate officials to facilitate face-to-face collection  efforts and to allow the revenue officer to physically go to courthouses to  perform property searches. IRS collection officials also stated that  attempting to assign the same revenue officer both the TFRP assessments  and the business payroll tax case for collection would overload the  revenue officers with work and result in fewer high-priority payroll tax  cases being worked on. This view, however, stems from separating the  collection efforts of the business and the individual and not considering  the business\u2019s unpaid payroll taxes and the TFRP assessment as a single  case. In essence, the TFRP assessment is the same tax debt as the  business\u2019s payroll tax debt; the assessment is merely another means  through which IRS can attempt to collect the monies withheld from a  business\u2019s employees for income, Social Security, and hospital insurance  taxes that were not remitted to the government. This view that the  payroll tax debt and the TFRP assessment are essentially the same tax  debt is reinforced by IRS\u2019s own practice of crediting all related parties\u2019  accounts whenever a collection is made against either assessment.", "Prior studies have found that IRS\u2019s practice of assigning TFRP  assessments a lower priority than business cases has not been very  successful for collecting the unpaid taxes. In its own August 2005 study,  IRS reported that it had assessed over $11.9 billion in TFRP assessments  (including interest) between 1996 and 2004, yet had collected only 8  percent of those assessments. IRS reported that for those assessments  made in 1996, for which IRS had been attempting collection for at least 8  years, the collection rate was only 13 percent. For all responsible  owners/officers that were assessed a TFRP, 43 percent never made a  payment on their trust fund penalty.

We have reported in the  past that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the District Counsel prefer not to  seek such injunctions due to the time and expense required to prosecute  these cases. IRS is taking some action to attempt to address this issue by  piloting a Streamline Injunctive Relief Team to identify cases and develop  procedures to quickly move a case from administrative procedures to  judicial actions.

Although IRS has this authority, IRS officials stated that they often have  difficulty using levies to collect unpaid payroll taxes because, for example,  the levy may be made against funds in a bank account at a certain point in  time when little or no funds are available. Additionally, IRS officials told  us, and in our case studies we found, that IRS sometimes has difficulty  identifying which banks or financial institutions a tax debtor is using. This  is the case because tax debtors will often change financial institutions to  avoid IRS levies. Once a levy is served against an account, a tax debtor will  often close the account and open an account in a different financial  institution. IRS must then search for where the tax debtor is now doing  business and attempt to serve a new levy. One IRS official stated that IRS  may serve levies on multiple banks while searching for the new accounts.  Such a process of searching for accounts is very time consuming for both  the revenue officers and the financial institutions being served the levies  and is a burden to these financial institutions.", "Several states use legal authorities to assist in identifying levy sources.  States such as Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Indiana, and New  Jersey have enacted legislation for matching programs or entered into  agreements with financial institutions to participate in matching bank  account information against state tax debts. This matching allows states to  more easily identify potential levy sources and simplifies the financial  institution\u2019s obligations to respond to multiple levies. IRS is currently  working with at least one state to investigate the potential for this  matching, but in our discussions with IRS collection officials, they stated  that IRS has not sought legislation or agreements with financial  institutions to enhance its levying powers."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Businesses Engaged in Abusive and Potentially Criminal Activity Related to the Federal Tax System", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of unpaid payroll tax debt found substantial evidence of  abusive and potentially criminal activity related to the federal tax system  by businesses and their owners or officers.

We identified owners who were involved  in multiple businesses, all of which failed to remit payroll taxes as  required. For example, in one of our case studies in which a business  owed almost $2.5 million, the owner was involved in multiple other  businesses, all of which owed unpaid payroll taxes. IRS records indicated  that the owner was also underreporting personal income to avoid paying  personal income taxes. Additionally, the owner was the subject of at least  10 lawsuits either pending or settled and was involved in possible check  kiting and money laundering.

For the last decade, this business has  withheld taxes from its employees but remitted less than a quarter of the  taxes actually owed. IRS found the owner of the company willful and  responsible for not remitting the taxes, and IRS records indicate the owner  avoided paying taxes and trust fund amounts by transferring $1.5 million  in property after being assessed the TFRP and selling a personal residence  valued at over $600,000.", "Case 2 This healthcare business, which owes almost $2.5 million of  unpaid payroll taxes, repeatedly refused to remit withheld federal payroll  taxes and the officers used the business to pay personal expenses. In  addition, IRS records indicated the business\u2019s officers attempted to avoid  paying taxes by filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy on three separate occasions,  two of which were dismissed. Around the time of the bankruptcy filings,  the officers withdrew about $700,000 of cash from the business.

The owner had multiple businesses  that have not filed required tax returns. Additionally, the business owner  has not filed personal returns since the early 1990s and owes over $400,000  in personal taxes. The owner received several cash loans from the  business while not paying taxes, and business monies were diverted into  the owner\u2019s personal bank accounts.

Willful  failure to remit these funds is a breach of that fiduciary responsibility and  is a felony offense. A business\u2019s repeated failure to remit payroll taxes to  the government over long periods of time affects far more than the  collection of the unpaid taxes. First, allowing businesses to continue to  not remit payroll taxes affects the general public perception regarding the  fairness of the tax system, which may result in lower overall compliance.  Second, because of failure of businesses to remit payroll taxes, the burden  of funding the nation\u2019s commitments, including payments to the Social  Security and Hospital Insurance trust funds, falls more heavily on  taxpayers who willingly and fully pay their taxes. Third, the failure to  remit payroll taxes gives the non-compliant business an unfair competitive  advantage because that business can use those funds that should have  been remitted for taxes to either lower overall business costs or increase  profits. Businesses that fail to remit payroll taxes may also under bid tax- compliant businesses, causing them to lose business and encouraging  them to also become non-compliant. Fourth, allowing businesses to  continue accumulating unpaid payroll taxes has the effect of subsidizing  their business operations, thus enriching tax abusers or prolonging the  demise of a failing business. Fifth and last, in an era of growing federal  deficits and amidst reports of an increasingly gloomy fiscal outlook, the  federal government cannot afford to allow businesses to continue to  accumulate unpaid payroll tax debt with little consequence.", "For these reasons, it is vital that IRS use the full range of its collection tools  against businesses with significant payroll tax debt and have performance  measures in place to monitor the effectiveness of its actions to collect and  prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes. IRS has stated that  the collection of unpaid payroll taxes is one of its highest priorities. However,  IRS\u2019s collection philosophy focuses on gaining voluntary compliance, even for  recalcitrant businesses that repeatedly fail to remit payroll taxes and whose  actions indicate no intention to become compliant. Businesses that continue  to accumulate unpaid payroll tax debt despite efforts by IRS to work with  them are demonstrating that they are either unwilling or unable to comply  with the tax laws. In such cases, because the decision to not file or remit  payroll taxes is made by the owners or responsible officers of a business, IRS  should consider strong collection action against both the business and the  responsible owners and officers to prevent the further accumulation of  unpaid payroll taxes and to collect those taxes for which the business and  owners have a legal and fiduciary obligation to pay.", "IRS faces difficult challenges in balancing aggressive collection actions  against taxpayer rights and individuals\u2019 livelihoods. However, to the extent  IRS does not pursue aggressive collection actions against businesses with  multiple quarters of unpaid payroll taxes, IRS is not acting in the best  interests of the federal government, the employees of the businesses involved,  the perceived fairness of the tax system, or overall compliance with the tax  laws. Therefore, it is incumbent upon IRS to revise its approach and develop  performance measures to provide for the effective use of the full range of  available enforcement tools against egregious offenders to prevent those  businesses from continuing to accumulate payroll tax debt. It is also  incumbent upon IRS to proactively seek out and appropriately implement  other tools (particularly those with demonstrated success at the state level) to  enhance its ability to prevent the further accumulation of unpaid payroll taxes  and to collect those taxes that are owed.
