With this two-digit format, however, the Year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900, or 2001 from 1901, etc. As a result of this ambiguity, system or application programs that use dates to perform calculations, comparisons, or sorting may generate incorrect results when working with years after 1999.", "Should Air Force computer systems fail on the morning of the Year 2000, Air Force operations at all levels could be affected by the incorrect processing of data, as well as corrupted databases, or even massive system failures. In turn, this could result in such problems as delays in supply shipments, faulty inventory forecasts, unreliable budget estimates, and erroneous personnel-related information. Moreover, the problem could adversely affect critical warfighting functions such as combat, communications, command and control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and air traffic control.", "Like the other military services, the Air Force has adopted DOD\u2019s Year 2000 management strategy, which calls for centralized oversight with decentralized execution of Year 2000 correction.

This group has focused on such matters as sharing lessons learned, eliminating duplicative efforts, sharing resources, and tracking component progress. In the same month, the Air Force released an Air Force-wide impact assessment survey to all major commands, field operating agencies, and direct reporting units for the purpose of obtaining a rough order-of-magnitude of the Year 2000 problem throughout the Air Force.

With less than 26 months remaining before the Year 2000 deadline, this will add pressure on the Air Force to renovate, validate, and implement systems as quickly as possible. According to an industry expert, June 1997 is apt to be the latest point in time to start fixing systems and to have a reasonable probability of finishing before year 2000. The Air Force\u2019s Year 2000 guidance, as well as GAO and OMB\u2019s Year 2000 guidance, call for a similar completion date. In addition, according to the Gartner Group\u2014an independent contractor hired by Defense to provide Year 2000 technical support primarily in the areas of scheduling and cost estimating\u2014no more than 26 percent of an organization\u2019s total Year 2000 effort should be spent in the awareness and assessment phases. Our analysis shows that the Air Force has used nearly 46 percent of its available time to complete these two phases. While Air Force officials acknowledge that the assessment phase is taking longer than expected, they do not believe it will significantly affect their Year 2000 program because system and program managers have already begun to fix systems identified with Year 2000 problems.", "One reason for the delay in completing the assessment phase is that it has taken longer than anticipated to develop a complete systems inventory. Before its Year 2000 effort, the Air Force did not have a comprehensive servicewide system inventory. As such, it could not readily determine the magnitude (much less the cost to fix) of the Year 2000 problem servicewide when it began the assessment phase. While its inventory now contains 2,944 systems, the Air Force is still expanding it to include information on infrastructure-related devices, such as elevators, traffic control and security devices, telephone switching systems, and medical equipment. These devices rely on either microprocessors or microcontroller chips that may be vulnerable to Year 2000 problems. In addition, the Air Force is contending with slow and incomplete reporting by system and program managers. As a result, it has revised reporting requirements to facilitate better reporting on the part of its components.", "Furthermore, the Air Force must still resolve discrepancies between its inventory and recent findings by the Air Force Audit Agency. In June 1997, the Audit Agency identified over 6,000 information systems that were not included in the Air Force inventory (which contained 2,543 systems at the time this audit was conducted).

The Air Force, however, has not yet fully defined the scope of its Year 2000 problem or refined cost estimates, using actual assessment data, in order to gauge what resources are needed for correction. The need to take immediate action in this regard is critical, given that some organizations are already discovering that they do not have sufficient funding to correct their systems.", "Currently, the Air Force expects to spend about $405 million from fiscal year 1997 through 1999 to fix its Year 2000 problem. Table 2 breaks down the estimated cost by fiscal year.", "According to AFCIC officials, the cost estimate was calculated using the Gartner cost formula, which recommends multiplying $1.10 by the lines of code contained in the agency\u2019s automated information systems and $8.00 by the lines of code for weapon systems. The Gartner method is helpful in developing a rough estimate of what it will cost to resolve the problem early in the Year 2000 effort. However, according to a directive from Defense\u2019s Chief Information Officer as well as Year 2000 consultants, agencies should refine their cost estimates as they progress through the assessment phase and into the later Year 2000 phases to factor in the actual resources they believe are needed to renovate and implement their systems. According to DOD\u2019s Year 2000 Management Plan, these can include:", "The age of the systems being corrected. Age can have a significant impact on the cost of correction since older code tends to be less structured and thus harder to understand and correct than newer code.", "The Year 2000 strategy that the program is pursuing. Strategies that involve keeping the two-digit code, for example, are much less expensive than those that involve changing the two-digit code to a four-digit code.", "The degree of documentation that is available on the system and its understandability and the availability of source code.", "The skill and expertise of in-house programmers.", "Projected engineering costs.", "Labor hours required to fix systems.", "Testing requirements.", "The September estimate still used the Gartner formula and did not take into account other factors that can have a significant impact on the cost of correction including those identified in DOD\u2019s Year 2000 Management Plan. Air Force officials acknowledged that the $405 million estimate is a rough figure. They planned to re-estimate costs at some point after the assessment phase is completed. Costs should be continuously reestimated through the assessment and subsequent Year 2000 phases. By waiting to refine its cost estimates, the Air Force will be delaying the availability of information needed to make informed resource trade-off decisions.", "In fact, trade-off issues and other funding disputes, which call for the need to develop more accurate cost estimates, have already surfaced in some Air Force programs. For example, one aircraft weapon system program found that correcting the Year 2000 problem in ground software equipment that is used to program the aircraft\u2019s operational avionics software for navigation and weapons delivery would cost $42 million more than what was budgeted for routine maintenance of the aircraft. In August 1997, the program office reported that it fixed the problem for about $300,000 using a temporary workaround. However, according to a program office official, because the existing equipment consists of old IBM mainframes and outdated Jovial code it will have to be replaced eventually\u2014and likely at a higher cost\u2014in order to support future planned aircraft enhancements such as Joint Direct Attack Munition and Joint Standoff Weapon.", "In addition, the Air Force estimates that it will cost between $70 million and $90 million to fix telephone switches throughout the Service. This estimate is not included in the $405 million total Air Force Year 2000 cost estimate. The Air Force is currently in a dispute with the contractor that supplied the switches over who is responsible for Year 2000 correction. At the same time, Air Force components have not budgeted funds to fix their telephone switches. Since then, and according to AFCIC officials, the Air Force has begun to address this funding issue through its normal corporate funding process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System Interfaces Need More Attention", "paragraphs": ["It is critically important during the Year 2000 effort that agencies protect against the potential for introducing and propagating errors from one organization to another and ensure that interfacing systems have the ability to exchange data through the transition period. According to our Year 2000 Assessment Guide, to address the issue of interfaces, agencies should (1) identify their internal and external interfaces, (2) determine the need for data bridges and filters, (3) notify outside data exchange partners of their interface plans, (4) test their interface correction strategies, and (5) develop contingency plans that address the possibility of failing to receive data from an external source or receiving invalid data. DOD\u2019s Year 2000 Management Plan places responsibility on component heads or their designated Year 2000 points of contact to document and obtain system interface agreements in the form of memorandums of agreement or the equivalent.", "Since October 1996, the Air Force has participated in six high-level DOD Year 2000 interface workshops, including finance, intelligence, command and control, communications, logistics, and weapons systems. However, to date, the Air Force has not been tracking (1) how its components are going about identifying their interfaces, (2) how they plan to correct interfaces, and (3) whether they are instituting memorandums of agreement in order to communicate their interface plans to their data exchange partners. It is important for the Air Force to immediately begin tracking these issues since individual components are embarking on varying\u2014and possibly conflicting\u2014approaches to addressing interfaces. Moreover, others have not yet addressed the interface issue.", "For example, none of the five weapon system program offices we surveyed had fully determined the actual impact or program status of their system interfaces. One program office told us that it did not plan to do so until the Air Force prescribed a uniform approach to interfaces. In addition, we found other weapon system program approaches to identifying their interfaces to be considerably different. For example, the F-22 weapon systems program formally requested its development contractor, in writing, to assess the impact of the Year 2000 problem on the aircraft. This assessment would include identification of interfaces and an evaluation on whether they pose a Year 2000 problem. By contrast, the F-16 program office planned to informally contact its subcontractors to identify the status of interfaces and Year 2000 issues for on-board components of the aircraft that the program office does not directly manage. For components that the program office directly manages, it plans to informally request that its contractor assess Year 2000 problems and identify the status of interfaces. However, that assessment will not be documented as the F-22 program office\u2019s assessment will be. Clearly, the second approach will provide the Air Force with less assurance that all interfaces have been accounted for than the first approach.", "Without centralized oversight over the identification and correction of interfaces, there is a chance that some systems and interfaces, for which ownership is unclear, may not be identified and corrected. In addition, there is also a higher risk that conflicting interface solutions will be implemented without the data bridges that are necessary to ensure that information can still be transferred. For example, one system manager may choose to fix a system by expanding its date and year, while another may choose to keep the two-digit format and use procedural code or sliding windows as a strategy for becoming Year 2000 compliant. According to current Defense guidance, either fix is acceptable, but both parties need to know of the potential conflict so that they can install the data bridge.", "AFCIC plans to recommend that responsible system/program managers prepare interface memorandums of agreement, which describe the method of interface and assign responsibility for accommodating the exchange of data. If implemented, these agreements could ensure that information can be transferred even when components take conflicting approaches to their interfaces.

It was also not assessing the need for additional testing resources, even though it acknowledged that these resources would be in demand. Instead, AFCIC officials told us that they are relying heavily on system/program managers to organize, plan, and manage the necessary resources to test Year 2000 fixes. Our review showed that more attention is needed in this area. For example, none of the five program offices we surveyed had completed a master Year 2000 test plan.", "Due to the complexities and risks involved with testing, components that are not currently planning their testing strategies run a high risk of not completing the Year 2000 effort on time. This is because components must not only test the year 2000 compliance of individual applications, but also the complex interactions between scores of converted or replaced computer platforms, operating systems, utilities, applications, databases, and interfaces. Moreover, in some instances, components may not be able to shut down their production systems for testing and thus have to operate parallel systems implemented on a year 2000 test facility. Components may also find that they need computer-aided software testing tools and test scripts to help prepare and manage test data, automate comparisons of test results, and schedule tests. AFCIC officials themselves believe that there is a good chance that adequate test facilities may not be available to conduct joint interoperability testing involving systems that interface with one another. For these reasons, it is critical that Air Force headquarters ensure that components are taking time now to assess their testing needs and that the Air Force is well-positioned to provide components with additional testing facilities and tools.", "In August 1997, the Air Force working group began to address this testing issue in part by directing its components to identify and develop an inventory of existing testing facilities that could support Year 2000 testing of selective platforms such as Unisys and IBM.

However, the Air Force is unnecessarily putting its Year 2000 program at risk of failure because it has not yet refined cost estimates based on actual assessment data, fully examined resource trade-offs, and ensured strong and continuous oversight for interface, testing, and contingency planning issues. Because these steps are designed to ensure that organizations are well-positioned to deal with the more difficult stages of Year 2000 correction, neglecting any one of them can seriously endanger the Air Force\u2019s ability to meet its Year 2000 deadline. Given its role in national security, and its interdependence with other military organizations, the Air Force cannot afford this risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Air Force immediately require that the Air Force ensure its cost estimates factor in the actual resources it believes are needed to renovate and implement systems so that the Service can make informed resource trade-off decisions and ensure that this estimate is periodically refined throughout the Year 2000 program.", "We also recommend that the Secretary ensure that an approach is developed to continuously track how components are going about identifying interfaces, how they plan to correct interfaces, and whether they are instituting memorandums of agreement.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary ensure that components are developing test plans and identifying the need for additional testing resources and design an approach to obtain any needed testing resources that are identified by Air Force components.", "Finally, we recommend that the Secretary act to ensure that components have prepared contingency plans for their mission-critical systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Office of the Air Force Chief Information Officer agreed with all of our recommendations to improve the Air Force\u2019s Year 2000 program. In response to our recommendations, the Air Force agreed to update its cost estimates as it progresses through the remaining Year 2000 phases and include actual resources needed to renovate and implement systems so that it can make informed resource trade-off decisions. The Air Force also agreed to place greater management attention on identifying system interfaces and improve reporting practices to ensure that interface corrections are properly accounted for and can be readily tracked. In addition, the Air Force agreed to have major commands and product centers outline and prioritize their test requirements to ensure that testing resources will be available when needed.", "The Air Force pointed out that it is working with components to develop Year 2000 contingency plans as part of the renovation and validation phases. In addition, the Air Force plans to open servicewide crisis response centers around August or September 1999 to deal with critical systems that will not be Year 2000 compliant by January 1, 2000. The Air Force is taking steps to ensure that contingency plans will be prepared on each noncompliant system identified and be made readily available to the crisis response centers.
