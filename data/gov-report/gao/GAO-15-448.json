This report examines the extent to which CMS's enrollment-screening procedures are designed and implemented to prevent enrollment of ineligible or potentially fraudulent Medicare providers. GAO reviewed relevant documentation, interviewed CMS officials, and contacted the 12 CMS contractors that evaluate provider applications.

Two of CMS's procedures appear to be working to screen for providers and suppliers listed as deceased or excluded from participating in federal programs or health care\u2013related programs. However, GAO identified the following weaknesses in the other two procedures: CMS's verification of provider practice location and physician licensure status.", "First, Medicare providers are required to submit the address of the actual practice location from which they offer services. GAO's examination of 2013 data found that about 23,400 of 105,234 (22 percent) of practice location addresses are potentially ineligible. The computer software CMS uses as a method to validate applicants' addresses does not flag potentially ineligible addresses, such as those that are of a Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (such as a UPS store mailbox), vacant, or invalid addresses. In addition, CMS's March 2014 guidance has reduced the amount of independent verification conducted by contractors, thereby increasing the program's vulnerability to potential fraud. For example, the figure below shows a mailbox located within a UPS store that an applicant reported as a practice location, which CMS contractors inaccurately verified as an authentic practice location under CMS's new guidance, which allows contractors to use phone calls as the primary means for verifying provider addresses.", "Second, physicians applying to participate in the Medicare program must hold an active license in the state they plan to practice and self-report final adverse actions, such as a suspension or revocation by any state licensing authority. CMS requires its contractors to verify final adverse actions that the applicant self-reported on the application directly with state medical board websites. In March 2014, CMS began providing a report to its Medicare contractors to improve their oversight of physician license reviews. However, the report only includes the medical license numbers providers use to enroll into the Medicare program, but not adverse-action history or other medical licenses a provider may have in other states that were not used to enroll into Medicare. GAO found 147 out of about 1.3 million physicians listed as eligible to bill Medicare who, as of March 2013, had received a final adverse action from a state medical board for crimes against persons, financial crimes, and other types of felonies but were either not revoked from the Medicare program until months after the adverse action or never removed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS incorporate flags into its software to help identify potentially questionable addresses, revise its 2014 guidance for verifying practice locations, and collect additional license information.

First, CMS software to validate the applicant\u2019s practice location  address does not contain specific flags that can help identify questionable  practice locations. Without those flags, CMS misses an opportunity to  identify questionable practices that might warrant further review.

For  example, when the USPS address-management tool flagged a practice  location address as a CMRA, we took further steps, such as conducting  Google Maps searches or physical site visits, to determine whether the  address was ineligible. On the basis of these steps, we were able to  confirm that the addresses were legitimate in some cases, while in other  cases the practice locations in PECOS were ineligible addresses, such as  a UPS store or similar establishments.

We also interviewed CMS officials  about provider and supplier enrollment-screening procedures, including  procedures that were developed and implemented as a result of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s (PPACA) provisions. In  addition, we conducted interviews with five MACs, to learn about the  enrollment-screening procedures. We selected the five MACs to include  some with larger numbers of physicians serviced, some that met and  some that did not meet the accuracy threshold in CMS\u2019s provider  enrollment performance evaluation, some that participated in the  automated screening process and some that did not (to capture additional  possible checks that some MACs performed on providers\u2019 enrollment  information through this process), and some that served more than one  jurisdiction to maximize the number of states included in our review.

We contacted by e-mail the remaining seven MACs to obtain  additional information on the provider enrollment-screening procedures to  verify applicants\u2019 practice location addresses and validate applicants\u2019  licensure and accreditation information.", "To assess the extent to which CMS implemented enrollment-screening  procedures to prevent and detect the enrollment of ineligible or potentially  fraudulent Medicare providers, suppliers, and DMEPOS suppliers into  PECOS, we matched the list of providers and suppliers present in  PECOS on March 29, 2013, and DMEPOS suppliers on April 6, 2013\u2014 the most-current data available at the time of our review\u2014to four specific  databases listed below.  1.  The United States Postal Service (USPS) Address Matching  System Application Program Interface, which is a commercially  available USPS software package that standardizes addresses and  provides specific flags such as Commercial Mail Receiving Agency  (CMRA), vacant, or invalid addresses to determine the validity of the  providers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 practice location addresses. Specifically, we  submitted 980,974 PECOS practice location addresses to the USPS  address-management tool. The USPS address-management tool  contained valid addresses as of December 15, 2013. Of the 980,974  addresses, 105,234 (about 11 percent) appeared in the USPS  address-management tool as a CMRA, a vacant address, or an  invalid address. For those addresses that the tool flagged as a CMRA,  vacant, or invalid, we selected a generalizable stratified random  sample. Specifically, we sampled 496 addresses from the population  of 105,234. We stratified the population addresses by the type of  match (CMRA, vacant, or invalid) and by the type of provider  (individual practitioner, organization, or DMEPOS supplier). This  resulted in nine mutually exclusive strata. We computed sample sizes  to achieve a precision of plus or minus 10 percentage points or fewer,  at the 95 percent confidence level for each of the three types of  matches. Because we followed a probability procedure based on  random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of  samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval (e.g., plus or minus 10 percentage points). This is the interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. To confirm whether each of the 496  sampled practice location addresses was an eligible address, we  used Google Maps, Internet searches including searching the  provider\u2019s website, or physical site visits. On the basis of the results of  our work on the sample, we produced estimates of how many  addresses were likely to be ineligible, potentially valid, or inconclusive.  The estimates are based on our generalizable stratified random  sample of 496 addresses and have a margin of error at the 95 percent  confidence level of plus or minus 10 percentage points or fewer. To  calculate the amount of Medicare claims paid to providers and  suppliers we confirmed to have an ineligible practice location, we ran  the provider and supplier National Provider Identifier against the  claims paid from 2005 to 2013, the period for which CMS has claims  data. For addresses that were located at an ineligible CMRA, we  calculated the claims data from the date the provider or supplier  enrolled into PECOS using the address to December 2013. For  addresses flagged as vacant by the USPS address-management tool,  we calculated the claims data from September 2013 to December  2013.at least 90 days to be flagged as vacant in the USPS address- management tool. For the invalid addresses, we calculated the claims   According to USPS guidance, an address must be vacant for  data from the date the provider or supplier enrolled into PECOS using  the address to December 2013. The Medicare claims paid to  providers and suppliers with ineligible addresses may be understated  because some of the providers and suppliers enrolled in PECOS with  a potential ineligible address prior to 2005.  2.  The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) licensure data  from March 31, 2014, to determine whether enrolled providers or  suppliers had disciplinary actions that might make them ineligible for  Medicare enrollment. We matched the providers and suppliers in  PECOS with the FSMB licensure data by Social Security number and  provider name. We then validated the FSMB licensure information  against individual state medical licensing boards. We then calculated  Medicare claims for those physicians that received a suspension or  revocation of their medical license while enrolled in PECOS. This  included the time the physician was actively suspended or revoked  and in some cases the time when the provider could have been  barred from the Medicare program for not reporting an adverse action.  We calculated the Medicare claims data paid from 2005 to 2013,  which are the years CMS had the claims data available.  3.  The Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) full death file  containing updates through April 2013, to determine whether enrolled  providers or suppliers were deceased. We matched the providers  and suppliers with the SSA full death file by Social Security number  and provider\u2019s last name. We also matched the providers and  suppliers we identified as deceased with the Medicare claims by  National Provider Identifier. We calculated the Medicare claims data  paid from 2005 to 2013, which are the years CMS had the claims data  available, to the deceased providers by considering only claims paid  for services rendered after the date of death.  4.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of  Inspector General (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals and Entities  (LEIE) as of September 17, 2012, to determine whether providers or  suppliers were excluded from doing business with the federal  government or health care\u2013related programs.match by comparing the provider\u2019s Social Security number and  provider\u2019s last name. We also matched the providers and suppliers we  identified as being excluded with the Medicare claims data by using  the provider and supplier National Provider Identifier. We calculated  the Medicare claims data paid from 2005 to 2013, which are the years  CMS had the claims data available, to the excluded providers and  suppliers by considering only claims paid for services rendered after  the exclusion date through the date the MAC or CMS found the  provider to be excluded. The Medicare claims paid to excluded  providers and suppliers may be understated in cases where these  providers and suppliers were excluded prior to 2005.", "We also contacted the NSC and those MACs responsible for enrolling  any of the individuals and entities that appeared in our four sets of  matches. Since our PECOS data were as of March 29, 2013, for  providers and suppliers and April 6, 2013, for DMEPOS suppliers, we  requested updated information during the months of September 2014 to  October 2014. This information included whether the providers or  suppliers were revalidated or changed their PECOS profile information.  We also requested providers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 application files including  site-visit reports from the MACs when appropriate to corroborate MACs\u2019  responses. We also selected 30 locations for a physical site visit to  confirm whether the practice location address was an eligible address.  The 30 locations were selected based on the geographic proximity to the  five MACs and the NSC we visited, and to GAO offices. These locations  were selected independently of our generalizable sample of 496  addresses and this selection is not generalizable to any set of addresses.", "We assessed the reliability of the PECOS data, USPS address- management tool, FSMB licensure data, SSA full death file, HHS LEIE,  and Medicare claims data by reviewing relevant documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and performing electronic  testing to determine the validity of specific data elements in the data.  Specifically, for the USPS address-management tool, we selected a  generalizable stratified random sample of 496 addresses that the tool  flagged as a CMRA, vacant, or invalid and used Google Maps, Internet  searches, or physical site visits to confirm the address. For the FSMB  licensure data, we selected a random, nongeneralizable sample of 153  licenses and traced the license information, including disciplinary actions  when applicable, to the appropriate state licensing medical board for  confirmation. We determined that these databases were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of our work.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2014 to June 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
