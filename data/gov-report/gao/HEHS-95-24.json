Many of these single-parent families, particularly those headed by young mothers, are at risk of welfare dependency. Child support is critical to these families\u2019 self-sufficiency. In the last 5 years, more and more single-parent families have sought government assistance from the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which requires recipients to cooperate with the child support enforcement (CSE) program. In addition, an increasing number of single-parent families not receiving AFDC have voluntarily sought CSE\u2019s help in obtaining child support from noncustodial parents. But in 1992, according to data reported by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), only about 19 percent of the cases in the CSE program received any child support payments.", "In 1975, in response to the growth in the numbers of families receiving AFDC, the Congress created the national CSE program. The federal OCSE was created to monitor and help develop existing state and local child support enforcement programs. Child support collected for families receiving AFDC was to be returned to the government; child support collected for non-AFDC families would help these families avoid a need for cash assistance from the government. Over the years, the Congress steadily expanded CSE program enforcement tools, program requirements, and federal funding to states. In 1992, the federal government paid $1.7 billion to states in matching and other funds to serve a caseload of about 15 million families\u20148.7 million of whom received AFDC.", "Because of his concerns, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Services, Post Office and Civil Service of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs asked us to review the CSE program to determine how the federal government could improve services to the states and the families who depend on state CSE activities.

If the parents were not married when their child was born, the legal presumption of paternity conferred by marriage is lacking, and a permanent support order cannot be established or enforced on either parent until there is a legal determination of paternity. Paternity is established in either of two ways: (1) through voluntary acknowledgment by the father or (2) if contested, through determination based on evidence such as scientific (genetic testing) and personal testimony.

Since 1968, federal statutes pertaining to the AFDC program have specifically required states to have programs for establishing paternity and obtaining support for children who receive AFDC. By 1975, an alarming rise in welfare costs resulting from out-of-wedlock birth rates and parental desertion as well as a growing demand to relieve taxpayers of the financial burden of supporting these families prompted the Congress to create the national CSE program as title IV-D of the Social Security Act. The Congress believed government welfare expenditures could be reduced, and to some extent prevented, by recouping AFDC benefits from noncustodial parents\u2019 child support payments.

Various studies indicate that these cases usually require more services and are more difficult to successfully serve than those involving married or formerly married parents. For example, cases involving unwed parents require paternity establishment, which may be contested rather than acknowledged voluntarily. Also, unwed parents are usually less able and less willing than married or formerly married parents to pay child support. Such parents are generally younger and have less education and earning capacity. They are likely to be unemployed or unemployable and have little or no income with which to pay support\u2014some are still in high school. In addition, some unwed parents are not aware of or do not fully understand the parental responsibilities that CSE agencies try to enforce.", "The growing size and complexity of the CSE caseload reflect major changes in demographic characteristics of the American family. High rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth have resulted in more children living in single-parent households. For example, the number of births to unmarried mothers increased 82 percent between 1980 and 1991. During the same period, the proportion of out-of-wedlock births rose from 18.4 to 29.5 percent of all births.

In 1989, according to U.S. Census data, 62 percent of all custodial mothers did not receive child support payments, largely because they lacked support orders. In that same year, 32 percent of all custodial mothers were living below the poverty threshold, and three-quarters of them had not received child support. Receiving child support appears to be a particular problem for never-married custodial mothers and their children\u2014they made up 52 percent of the AFDC caseload in 1991, up from 21 percent in 1976.

The act also directs OCSE to establish standards for state program effectiveness and monitor the operation of state programs through periodic audits. To help ensure program effectiveness, OCSE has the authority to assess financial penalties if an audit reveals a state has failed to meet certain program standards.

To meet federal requirements and receive federal funds, state CSE programs must have HHS-approved plans indicating compliance with federal law and regulations and must operate programs in accordance with those plans. HHS can withhold federal funding from states that do not have approved plans. There are significant differences in the ways state CSE programs are organized, where they are placed in the states\u2019 organizational hierarchies, what relationships exist between the CSE program and other state agencies, and the policies and procedures that are followed. These characteristics usually vary by traditional state-local service delivery structures, levels of court involvement required by state family law, population distribution, and other state variables. For example, some state child support agencies operate their CSE programs with state funds through a network of regional offices, while others share the funding with and supervise county and other local jurisdictions\u2019 operations. Under both circumstances, certain program responsibilities may be contracted out to other entities.

Appendix I briefly describes these services and some of the activities and organizations involved with each of them.", "Families entering the CSE program require different combinations of these services at different times, and thus their cases flow through the program on different pathways. In some cases, the child\u2019s paternity has not been established and the location of the alleged father is unknown. In these cases, the custodial parent needs the CSE program to help with every step: locating the alleged father, establishing paternity and a child support order, enforcing the order, and distributing collections received. In other cases, the custodial parent may have a child support order and CSE agencies must periodically review and possibly modify the order to ensure continued conformity to state guidelines. Order amounts may be increased or decreased with changes in noncustodial parents\u2019 ability to pay, for example, because of wage increases or job losses.

At the local level, both enforcement and paternity establishment may involve the courts to varying degrees. One study of paternity establishment practices in a sample of nearly 250 counties found that the local agency responsible for child support was the department responsible for human services in 75 percent of the counties. Only 43 percent of the counties, however, had paternity establishment handled solely by the department of human services. In most other counties, paternity establishment was a joint responsibility of the human services agency and a prosecuting or private attorney.", "Paternity and support order establishment and enforcement may be handled through a judicial or administrative process, depending on the state in which the custodial parent lives. Under a judicial process, authority to make paternity judgments, establish support orders, and take enforcement actions rests with the courts; proceedings take place in a legal setting and typically may involve district attorneys, state\u2019s attorneys, county attorneys, judges, legal aid societies, or private attorneys. In contrast, under an administrative process, an agency of the executive branch of state government has authority to administer certain aspects of state child support law or regulation without court approval being necessary for legally binding actions. The degree to which administrative rather than judicial processes are used varies across all states and within states.

Some expect the program to achieve support for more of the families now in the program and to reach out and help additional families.

In-hospital voluntary paternity acknowledgment is extending CSE\u2019s reach early and has been shown to be increasing the number of paternities established and the efficiency of establishment. However, this initiative depends on the cooperation of both parents and results to date suggest that much remains to be done. Research reported in 1991 from the state of Washington, a pioneer of this approach, showed that nearly 40 percent of unmarried supposed fathers were signing voluntary acknowledgments. Other state programs\u2019 report similar results. These results mean that more than half of unwed fathers will have to be pursued through other means if child support is to be collected.", "Complicating the question of what realistic expectations are for CSE is the fact that not all custodial parents needing child support are served by the CSE program, and some choose not to use its services. According to 1987 Bureau of the Census data, 162,000 teenaged mothers were not awarded or were awarded but did not receive regular child support payments. Nearly 45 percent said they did not receive payments because they did not pursue the matter or did not want child support. Similarly, results from state demonstration projects of review and modification of orders also illustrate the reluctance of some families to have CSE involved in their cases. Reasons that non-AFDC custodial parents gave for refusing to have their awards reviewed included (1) fear of jeopardizing current payments, (2) desire to avoid court proceedings, (3) belief the noncustodial parent is paying all he or she can afford, and (4) doubt that the review would result in payments.", "Finally, program efforts may not guarantee that cooperative noncustodial parents will be able to pay support.

State programs used a variety of techniques, such as having a legislative liaison office, to convince state legislatures to enact laws needed to authorize new enforcement tools.

In Texas, for example, as of June 1993, more than 40 percent of Texas\u2019 total caseload needed paternity established, according to state figures (see figure 4.1). As described in chapter 1, paternity establishment is the first step in obtaining child support. It can be time-consuming and involve genetic testing and judicial hearings as well as CSE efforts to interview custodial parents and locate the alleged fathers.", "In addition, AFDC custodial parents\u2019 reluctance to cooperate with CSE staff has been cited by program staff across the country as contributing to the workload difficulty. Staff in the eight states we visited also cited contacts from increasing numbers of non-AFDC custodial parents as part of their growing workload.", "Program officials in all eight states also expressed frustration with the difficulty of pursuing noncustodial parents who are self-employed or change jobs frequently. CSE officials explained that the inability to reach such parents with existing resources and enforcement tools impeded collections and overall program performance.", "The expanding CSE program mission also increased CSE case complexity. In addition to the traditional establishment and enforcement services, program resources are being devoted to medical support enforcement and review and modification of support orders. The additional case complexity and the resources required are reflected in the longer time it takes to train new caseworkers and bring them up to a full-performance level. In Kentucky, officials said it takes 15 months to bring a new caseworker up to the full-performance level; whereas, it used to take 9 months.", "At the time of our visits, states were beginning to wrestle with review and modification requirements that became effective October 13, 1993. Based on the results of state demonstrations of the review and modification process, some state program officials anticipated further resource shortfalls. The demonstrations revealed that the process is very labor intensive, with two states estimating the need for 11 to 13 percent more staff to meet the requirements. One researcher noted that review and modification \u201ccan require considerable persistence to obtain accurate income information from parents, perform one or more guideline calculations, try to obtain an order agreeable to both parties, and prepare the case for court if necessary. In addition, part of the workload burden derives from the specifications of the Family Support Act, which imposes a complex scheme of notices and timeframes.\u201d", "Although staffing levels have increased over time for all the states we reviewed, program personnel told us that the programs were still understaffed relative to caseload size and the amount of work required for a typical child support case.

In commenting on workload difficulties, a New York local CSE official estimated that his office was 40 percent understaffed. In addition, a 1992 Arizona Auditor General report noted that staffing levels were inadequate to address rapidly growing caseloads. Telephone inquiries alone can consume staff time.

In extreme cases, such as Virginia and Kentucky in 1993, states still do not have single statewide computer systems. Instead, they rely on multiple stand-alone systems or manual processing to manage and track caseload actions. In Kentucky, for example, the largest portion of the state\u2019s caseload was being tracked by both a largely manual system in the state area office and a local computer system in a corresponding county attorney\u2019s office. Kentucky officials noted this arrangement caused duplication of casework between state and county offices.

Oregon, although it implemented a system between 1975 and 1978, is now in virtually the same situation as some other states developing systems for the first time. Over the years, Oregon made incremental enhancements to its system to handle increased caseload complexity and federal case processing requirements.

Caseload intake and noncustodial parent location functions are primarily handled manually by CSE personnel. In contrast, Iowa\u2019s automated CSE system has extensive case tracking and reporting capabilities, but its ability to seize bank assets is hindered by its current automation capacity.

OCSE is aware of the audits\u2019 limitations and has taken some actions to change the audits. Our work confirms and reinforces a need to reengineer OCSE audits. Such a reengineering could not only help federal-state program relations but also serve as a means for OCSE and state program staff to obtain accurate and consistent performance data\u2014key management data that could help OCSE and states as they seek to better serve the families that depend on CSE efforts.", "In this chapter, we make some specific recommendations. We believe implementing GPRA\u2019s management reforms may help OCSE improve its own program management as well as serve states better. But whether through GPRA implementation or through other means, some rethinking of federal management tools, processes, and relations with state CSE programs is needed if the issues we have identified are to be addressed. We recognize that the CSE program faces many difficult tasks and that even given optimum CSE program management, some noncustodial parents may never be located and others may never be able to pay support. But continued and strengthened efforts by OCSE and states would seem virtually certain to help some families. Such efforts are all the more important if OCSE is to be given new authorities and responsibilities under welfare reform."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GPRA Can Help OCSE Develop Needed Management Tools", "paragraphs": ["As a result of the GPRA mandate and OCSE\u2019s pilot project status, OCSE is beginning to build a planning and measurement discipline that focuses on outcomes. Such a process should enable OCSE to better (1) communicate program expectations, (2) identify the tasks needed to accomplish the outcomes, (3) identify the data needed to assess accomplishments, and (4) use the information from performance assessment for policy decisions and plan revisions. OCSE\u2019s actions to date show promise, but we believe some of the issues we have identified remain to be addressed.", "As of September 1994, OCSE had developed a draft strategic plan that exceeds what GPRA requires and had avoided repeating some past planning weaknesses. To develop the plan, OCSE has sought comments and involvement from key stakeholders such as the regional HHS CSE personnel and state program representatives. In addition, OCSE had defined a program mission, vision, and two general goals with objectives and many quantitative performance indicators for each goal. The draft mission statement affirms the broad scope and expanded mission the program has assumed over the years. The goals focus on paternity and order establishment in support of this broad mission, and the objectives and performance indicators specifically address outcomes not only for collections but for noncollection activities such as medical support enforcement as well.", "Articulating the broadness of the mission and establishing outcomes should help to clarify the program\u2019s mission among the stakeholders. In addition, through a welfare reform proposal, OCSE is attempting to align the existing funding structure and audit approach with the broad mission OCSE has defined. Such an alignment is important for stakeholders to clearly understand program priorities. In addition to the strategic plan, OCSE has also developed an annual performance plan as required by GPRA. According to GPRA, the annual plan is intended to provide a direct link between the program\u2019s longer-term goals and what state programs and OCSE\u2019s managers and staff will need to accomplish each year.", "Setting demanding but realistic long-term and annual measurable outcomes for the national program and for state programs will be challenging. The variation among states in adopting innovative practices, such as voluntary paternity acknowledgment and early employer reporting of newly hired employees, suggests a need for OCSE to work with each state program individually to set goals that require continuous improvement from year to year. One way to do this would be for OCSE and states to set goals that reflect and build on past state performance, similar to the approach used for the paternity establishment standards. We believe that an individualized, cooperative, goal-setting effort would encourage greater state responsibility and accountability for achieving the goals and the data used to measure performance. A cooperative process would seem more likely to promote such accountability than having OCSE or the Congress imposing annual goals on state programs.", "OCSE\u2019s planning efforts, however, will need to address some of the issues we have raised in this report, including data quality and OCSE\u2019s own outcome goals. Improving data quality is essential if OCSE and the states are to achieve effective annual performance reporting and OCSE has taken some preliminary steps toward this end. However, OCSE needs to define data definitions and set standards to promote consistent data reporting. Building on initial efforts to clarify definitions and obtain consistent state reporting, OCSE officials said OCSE audit staff are currently investigating (1) data definitions used by states, (2) state data collection systems, and (3) state data quality. However, these officials did not have a plan or timetable for the completion of this effort. Furthermore, once measurable outcome goals have been established for the program, OCSE and the state programs will need to identify the key data needed for annual performance reporting and develop the necessary definitions. Data quality, however, relies heavily on state program efforts. States will thus need to assume greater accountability for the quality of data they submit.", "Another important issue for OCSE to consider is its own performance as both a partner with and manager of state program efforts. While OCSE has expressed an intention to assess its processes for serving the states, it has yet to set goals for itself regarding the future timeliness of regulations, responsiveness to states about audits and policy questions, and regional HHS office commitment and feedback. Given the failure of OCSE\u2019s past planning efforts to focus on outcomes, measurement, and continuous improvement, we believe OCSE will need to address these issues in future planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Structure Should Be Redesigned", "paragraphs": ["Our work identified several problems with the current program funding structure that, taken together, suggest that the funding structure should be redesigned. The current incentive payment structure has not been aligned with the expanding CSE mission. Furthermore, it does not meaningfully encourage continuous improvement, nor does it provide for the cost sharing between state and federal governments originally envisioned for the program. Instead, the incentive payments make it possible for states to shift most, if not all, program costs to the federal government.", "If incentive payments are to promote better state performance, we believe they need to be aligned with performance expectations as defined in the mission priorities and goals established in the strategic plan. For example, if such a plan recognizes a broader CSE mission and includes measurable outcome goals for collection and noncollection results, such as paternity and order establishment and medical support enforcement, then the incentive payment structure should be used to reward state improvements and maintenance of the highest level of performance in these areas. We endorse the concept of performance-based funding embodied in the incentive payments and believe this concept should be retained in the redesigned structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal-State Partnership Needs to Be Reinvented", "paragraphs": ["OCSE should continue to work with states to find new ways to strengthen the federal-state partnership that is at the core of the CSE program. New ways to deliver technical assistance and training, as well as new ways to develop regulations, would be important steps to this end. In addition, long-standing communication problems between state officials, HHS regional staff, and OCSE staff, problems due in part to the current organizational structure, will need to be addressed.", "We encourage OCSE to explore more cooperative approaches to developing regulations and delivering technical assistance and training. In chapter 3, we described some initiatives states would like to see or are trying for developing regulations and delivering technical assistance. These may be potential models for OCSE to consider or develop further in working with the states.", "As part of reinvigorating the state-federal partnership, we believe HHS and OCSE officials should consider alternatives to the current federal organizational structure for the CSE program, since this structure has produced ineffective communication and accountability. To this end, OCSE\u2019s strategic planning can help clarify OCSE\u2019s role by establishing performance goals for the agency. As with the CSE program, these goals should be focused, as much as possible, on results such as more timely issuance of regulations and responsiveness to states. The needed organizational changes, therefore, should support not only CSE program mission priorities, but OCSE\u2019s agency performance goals as well. In developing a better functioning organization, we believe HHS should consider (1) what the role of regional HHS personnel is, (2) how regional resources should be spent on CSE, (3) what mechanisms are necessary to ensure accountability to OCSE by regional and ACF staff outside of OCSE who are working on CSE priorities, and (4) where federal resources should be devoted to foster state goal achievement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Audit Is a Candidate for Reengineering", "paragraphs": ["Whatever changes may be made to the CSE program, we believe it is essential that the federal government maintain a program monitoring function to ensure that children who need financial support are being effectively served. However, in view of the problems we and others have identified with the program\u2019s audits, we believe, and OCSE agrees, that the scope and approach of this monitoring function need to be reconsidered. While the audits have spurred state action in some cases, we believe it is time for the program audit role to be reexamined and reengineered to provide a monitoring capability that is not only more outcome-oriented, but supports accurate state performance reporting as well.", "Two existing conditions make this an opportune time to change the audit approach. First, GPRA implementation demands accurate, consistent data and assessment of progress toward stated goals\u2014elements the current program lacks. GPRA annual performance reporting, therefore, should provide insights about program outcomes that the current audit approach has been unable to provide. To ensure these insights are based on sound data, however, the data, not the administrative procedures, should be subject to audit. The OCSE audit role, when placed within the GPRA framework, can be shifted from ensuring compliance to ensuring data integrity and investigating performance problems identified in annual performance reporting, thus achieving a more outcome-oriented approach.", "A second condition that enables serious reconsideration of the existing audit approach is the growth of state-initiated self-monitoring. As we noted in chapter 3, a number of states are conducting their own program audits or evaluations using OCSE-promulgated program standards or their own evaluation criteria. These state program monitoring efforts can have a more timely effect on state operations than OCSE audits and reduce the need for OCSE to conduct the type of detailed audits of state administrative procedures it has in the past. OCSE is currently considering ways to use state monitoring efforts, including replacing the existing federal audit approach with required annual state monitoring and OCSE review of the results.", "OCSE agrees that the audit needs to be reengineered but believes its ability to make significant changes to the audit process is constrained under current law. Existing legislation requires OCSE to conduct periodic comprehensive audits of state programs to ensure substantial compliance with all federal requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Welfare Reform Presents Opportunities and Additional Challenges for CSE", "paragraphs": ["Welfare reform proposals could have various effects on the CSE program. Adding federal mandates, as reflected in the welfare reform proposals we reviewed, may result in a more standard national CSE program. In addition, welfare reform holds some promise for a redesigned funding structure and audit approach. However, under welfare reform, OCSE would likely need to assume more responsibilities despite its limited capacity and organizational accountability. Any reform is likely to require greater federal leadership than has been exhibited in the past to achieve reform goals.", "While increasing requirements would challenge OCSE\u2019s leadership capacity, some of the welfare reform proposals provide opportunities for better alignment among stated priorities and incentive funding. In addition, some target the audit process for change. By focusing financial rewards on performance in critical areas in addition to cost-effectiveness, the proposed funding structures emphasize the importance of activities such as paternity establishment that may not bring immediate collections.", "Furthermore, by focusing the audits more on program outcomes and the quality of the data used to measure the outcomes rather than on compliance with certain requirements, welfare reform provides the opportunity to improve information for future decision-making.", "Many of the current proposals for welfare reform would add to OCSE\u2019s responsibilities for providing technical assistance and training and for monitoring state programs. As demonstrated by our findings in this report and our earlier testimony, OCSE is already struggling with existing requirements in these critical support areas. Absent the reengineering of some OCSE processes, such as the audit, and an organizational structure with clear lines of authority and OCSE accountability, welfare reform seems likely to present OCSE with serious difficulties in achieving desired results.", "In addition, new requirements in the various welfare reform proposals would force legislative action in some states where the CSE programs have been unable to obtain the authority to pursue certain measures. However, the new requirements would also expand the authority and responsibilities of state CSE programs, requiring more stringent paternity establishment procedures, central registries, centralized collections, and work requirements for noncustodial parents, among others. Some of the new requirements could also add to the confusion about CSE\u2019s mission, goals, and priorities described in chapter 2.

In this process, we believe OCSE should consider setting outcome goals, in addition to output goals, in the areas of timely regulatory development, clear policy direction and responsiveness to state programs, cooperative planning, and technical assistance.", "Third, the Secretary should establish an organizational structure and reporting mechanisms for OCSE that support program priorities, set OCSE performance goals, and provide greater federal CSE program accountability among the regional staff and activities.", "We recognize that during the 103rd Congress the Secretary sought statutory changes to reform OCSE\u2019s audit approach and to change the program funding structure within the context of welfare reform.

For most of the recommendations, HHS provided additional information about actions it has already taken or is planning that we believe are responsive to our recommendations. However, we remain concerned that HHS\u2019 comments do not (1) indicate that OCSE is establishing performance goals for itself, (2) address the organizational accountability weaknesses we have identified, and (3) specify a plan for obtaining statutory changes for the funding structure and audit approach.", "With respect to our first recommendation regarding issues important to OCSE\u2019s planning efforts, HHS commented that OCSE has taken or is planning several actions that we consider responsive. It is planning to develop individual annual performance plans with state CSE agencies that will contain specific performance goals taking into consideration factors we mentioned and others. In terms of improving data quality, OCSE has recently started refining standard definitions for data elements and plans to meet with regional and state staff to achieve consensus on common terminology. In addition, OCSE is seeking to improve federal-state communication and working relationships through state visits by OCSE\u2019s deputy director and through developing various forums for more interaction with the states.", "In response to our second recommendation regarding the establishment of OCSE performance outcome goals that are linked to its mission, OCSE intends to develop an internal performance plan. While HHS provided additional information about the steps OCSE is taking to enhance training and establish staffing standards, it did not indicate that the performance plan will contain goals, either outcome or output, for OCSE. We believe that such outcome goals are essential for OCSE to (1) clarify its role and relationship to state programs, (2) focus on results, and (3) better hold regional resources accountable. We have clarified our recommendation to emphasize that OCSE should establish what outcomes it wants to accomplish with its actions.", "With respect to our third recommendation on organizational structure and reporting mechanisms, HHS described a recent reorganization, but its comments do not indicate how this reorganization will ensure regional office accountability for federal CSE activities. HHS states that ACF has reorganized so that the 10 regional administrators report directly to a new ACF Director of Regional Operations rather than the Assistant Secretary for ACF. In addition, an Assistant Director for Child Support Regional Operations has been established to assist in the direction and coordination of child support activities by the regions. HHS comments do not indicate, however, what reporting mechanisms it will use to obtain an up-front commitment of regional staff and travel resources to CSE and accountability for results of CSE activities. We continue to believe that such commitment is necessary to ensure that OCSE knows what regional resources are devoted to CSE and how regional actions will support OCSE\u2019s performance goals and foster state goal achievement.", "Finally, HHS\u2019 comments do not specify plans for changing the audit to make it more outcome-oriented or for reintroducing legislation to change the program funding structure.
