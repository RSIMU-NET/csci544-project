This spending target system--called the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system--adjusts physician fees based on the extent to which actual spending aligns with specified targets. In recent years, because spending has exceeded the targets, the system has called for fee cuts. Since 2003, the cuts have been averted through administrative or legislative action, thus postponing the budgetary consequences of excess spending. Under these circumstances, policymakers are seeking reforms that can help moderate spending growth while ensuring that beneficiaries have appropriate access to care. For today's hearing, the Subcommittee on Health, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which is exploring options for improving how Medicare pays physicians, asked GAO to share the preliminary results of its ongoing study related to this topic. GAO's statement addresses (1) approaches taken by other health care purchasers to address physicians' inefficient practice patterns, (2) GAO's efforts to estimate the prevalence of inefficient physicians in Medicare, and (3) the methodological tools available to identify inefficient practice patterns programwide. GAO ensured the reliability of the claims data used in this report by performing appropriate electronic data checks and by interviewing agency officials who were knowledgeable about the data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with the premise that physicians play a central role in the generation of health care expenditures, some health care purchasers examine the practice patterns of physicians in their network to promote efficiency. GAO selected 10 health care purchasers for review because they assess physicians' performance against an efficiency standard. To measure efficiency, the purchasers we spoke with generally compared actual spending for physicians' patients to the expected spending for those same patients, given their clinical and demographic characteristics. Most purchasers said they also evaluated physicians on quality. The purchasers linked their efficiency analysis results and other measures to a range of strategies--from steering patients toward the most efficient providers to excluding a physician from the purchaser's provider network because of poor performance. Some of the purchasers said these efforts produced savings. Having considered the efforts of other health care purchasers in evaluating physicians for efficiency, GAO conducted its own analysis of physician practices in Medicare. GAO used the term efficiency to mean providing and ordering a level of services that is sufficient to meet patients' health care needs but not excessive, given a patient's health status. GAO focused the analysis on generalists--physicians who described their specialty as general practice, internal medicine, or family practice--and selected metropolitan areas that were diverse geographically and in terms of Medicare spending per beneficiary. GAO found that individual physicians who were likely to practice medicine inefficiently were present in each of 12 metropolitan areas studied. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare, also has the tools to identify physicians who are likely to practice medicine inefficiently. Specifically, CMS has at its disposal comprehensive medical claims information, sufficient numbers of physicians in most areas to construct adequate sample sizes, and methods to adjust for differences in beneficiary health status. A primary virtue of examining physician practices for efficiency is that the information can be coupled with incentives that operate at the individual physician level, in contrast with the SGR system, which operates at the aggregate physician level. Efforts to improve physician efficiency would not, by themselves, be sufficient to correct Medicare's long-term fiscal imbalance, but such efforts could be an important part of a package of reforms aimed at future program sustainability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you discuss options for improving how  Medicare pays physicians. Your task is not simple, as you seek reforms  that can help moderate spending growth while ensuring that beneficiaries  have appropriate access to high-quality physician services and physicians  receive fair compensation for providing those services. Medicare\u2019s current  system of spending targets used to moderate spending growth and  annually update physician fees is problematic.", "This spending target system\u2014called the sustainable growth rate (SGR)  system\u2014adjusts Medicare\u2019s physician fees based on the extent to which  actual spending aligns with specified targets. If the growth in the number  of services provided per beneficiary\u2014referred to as volume\u2014and in the  average complexity and costliness of services\u2014referred to as intensity\u2014is  high enough, spending will exceed the SGR target. From 1999\u2014the first  year that the SGR system was used to update physician fees\u2014through  2001, physicians received fee increases annually. Since 2002, actual  Medicare spending on physician services has exceeded SGR targets, and  the SGR systems has called for fee cuts to offset the excess spending. In  2002 the SGR system reduced physician fees by nearly 5 percent. Fee  declines in subsequent years were averted only by administrative and  legislative actions that modified or temporarily overrode the SGR system.  In the absence of additional administrative or legislative action, the SGR  system will likely reduce fees by about 5 percent a year for the next  several years.", "The potential for a sustained period of declining fees has raised  policymakers\u2019 concerns about the appropriateness of the SGR system for  updating physician fees and about physicians\u2019 continued participation in  the Medicare program. A particular concern is that the SGR system acts as  a blunt instrument in that all physicians are subject to the consequences of  excess spending\u2014namely, downward fee adjustments\u2014that may stem  from the excessive use of resources by only some physicians. However, as  we have discussed in our prior work, the SGR system serves an important  role in alerting policymakers to the need for fiscal discipline. Specifically,  fee cuts under the SGR system signal to physicians collectively and to the  Congress that spending due to volume and intensity has increased more  than allowed.", "Some of the higher volume and intensity that drives spending growth may  not be medically necessary. In fact, the wide geographic variation in  Medicare spending per beneficiary\u2014unrelated to beneficiary health status  or outcomes\u2014provides evidence that health needs alone do not determine  spending. Medicare physician payment policy does little to change this  situation; payments under the Medicare program are not designed to foster  individual physician responsibility for the most effective medical  practices. In contrast, some public and private health care purchasers have  initiated programs to identify efficient physicians and encourage patients  to obtain care from these physicians.", "With these circumstances in mind, and in fulfillment of a 2003 mandate to  examine aspects of physician compensation in Medicare, we conducted a  study focusing on efficiency with respect to physician practices. In our  study, we use the term efficiency to mean providing and ordering a level of  services that is sufficient to meet a patient\u2019s health care needs but not  excessive, given a patient\u2019s health status. My remarks today will address  (1) physician-focused approaches taken by other health care purchasers to  address inefficient medical practices, (2) our efforts to estimate the  prevalence of inefficient physicians in Medicare, and (3) the  methodological tools available to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) to identify inefficient physician practice patterns  programwide. My remarks today are based on our study\u2019s preliminary  findings.", "In conducting our study, we interviewed representatives of 10 health care  purchasers, including 5 commercial health plans, 1 provider network, 1  trust fund jointly managed by employers and a union, and 3 government  agencies\u20142 in U.S. states and 1 in a Canadian province. We selected these  purchasers because their programs that examine physician practices  explicitly assess efficiency\u2014unlike many such programs that assess  quality only. We also estimated the prevalence in Medicare of physicians  likely to practice inefficiently. To do this work, we examined 2003  Medicare claims data from 12 metropolitan areas. We ensured the  reliability of the claims data used in this report by performing appropriate  electronic data checks and by interviewing officials at CMS who were  knowledgeable about the data. In addition, we discussed the facts  contained in this statement with CMS officials. The study on which these  remarks are based has been conducted beginning September 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, the health care purchasers we studied examined the practice  patterns of physicians in their networks and used the results to promote  efficiency. They adopted a range of incentives\u2014from steering patients  toward the most efficient providers to excluding a physician from the  network\u2014to encourage physicians to provide care efficiently; some  reported savings as a result of these efforts. Using our own methodology  to analyze the practice patterns of physicians in Medicare, we found that  physicians who were likely to be practicing medicine inefficiently were  present in all 12 of the metropolitan areas studied. CMS also has the tools  to identify physicians in Medicare who are likely to practice medicine  inefficiently, including comprehensive claims information, sufficient  numbers of physicians in most areas to construct adequate sample sizes,  and methods to adjust for differences in beneficiary health status."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Health Care Purchasers Use Physician Profiling Results to Encourage Efficient Medical Practice", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with the premise that physicians play a central role in the  generation of most health care expenditures, some health care purchasers  employ physician profiling to promote efficiency.

One approach focused on the costs associated with treating a  specific episode of illness\u2014such as a stroke or heart attack. The other  approach focused on costs, within a specific period, associated with the  patients in a physician\u2019s practice. Both approaches used information from  medical claims data to measure resource use and account for differences  in patients\u2019 health status.

The methods they  used generally computed efficiency measures as the ratio of actual to  expected spending for patients of similar health status. In addition, all of  the purchasers we interviewed profiled specialists and all but one also  profiled primary care physicians.

The incentives varied widely in design,  application, and severity of consequences. Purchasers used incentives that  included    educating physicians to encourage more efficient care,    designating in their physician directories those physicians who met  efficiency and quality standards,   dividing physicians into tiers based on efficiency and giving enrollees  financial incentives to see physicians in particular tiers,   providing bonuses or imposing penalties based on efficiency and quality    excluding inefficient physicians from the network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physician Profiling Has Potential for Savings", "paragraphs": ["Evidence from our interviews with the health care purchasers suggests  that physician profiling programs may have the potential to generate  savings for health care purchasers.

For example, 1 of those purchasers reported that growth in  spending fell from 12 percent to about 1 percent in the first year after it  restructured its network as part of its efficiency program, and an actuarial  firm hired by the purchaser estimated that about three quarters of the  reduction in expenditure growth was most likely a result of the efficiency  program.

We classified  these physicians as outliers\u2014that is, physicians whose proportions of  overly expensive patients would occur by chance less than 1 time in 100.  We concluded that these outlier physicians were likely to be practicing  medicine inefficiently.", "Based on 2003 Medicare claims data, our analysis found outlier generalist  physicians in all 12 metropolitan areas we studied. In two of the areas,  outlier generalists accounted for more than 10 percent of the area\u2019s  generalist physician population.

The feasibility of using efficiency measures to compare  physicians\u2019 performance depends, in part, on two factors: the availability  of enough data on each physician to compute an efficiency measure and  numbers of physicians large enough to provide meaningful comparisons.  In 2005, Medicare\u2019s 33.6 million fee-for-service enrollees were served by  about 618,800 physicians.
