However, the methodology used to calculate transit times significantly understated actual delivery times. In the absence of reliable data, GAO conducted discussion groups with a non-representative sample of 127 service members who served in-theater. More than half reported they were dissatisfied with mail delivery, underscoring the negative impact it can have on troop morale. Despite differences in operational theaters and efforts by DOD postal planners to incorporate Operations Desert Shield/Storm experiences into planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom, postal operations faced many of the same problems: difficulty with conducting joint-service mail operations; postal personnel who were inadequately trained and initially scarce owing to late deployments; and inadequate postal facilities, equipment, and transportation. The operations plan created for joint-service mail delivery contained certain assumptions key to its success but led to unforeseen consequences or did not occur. Also, plans for a Joint Postal Center were not fully put in place. One lesson learned from 1991 was carried out with success during Operation Iraqi Freedom: mail was transported overseas by dedicated contractor airlifts rather than by military. DOD has not officially tasked any entity to resolve the long-standing postal problems experienced during contingency operations.

According to Military Postal Service Agency data,  90 percent of all letters and parcels for Operation Iraqi Freedom were  processed through New York.

According to  Transit Time Information Standard System for Military Mail guidance,  transit times should be reported by postal units in theater on the basis of a  random sample of all incoming letters and all incoming packages arriving  at military post offices in the Iraqi theater. The samples are then divided  into three categories according to the date of the U.S. postmark: postmark  less than 10 days old, postmark 11 to 15 days old, and postmark over 16  days old. Each of these three categories is given a weight value of 10, 15,  and 16, respectively, which represent the break points of each category.  The sample size (number of letters or packages sampled) in each category  is then multiplied by the weight value and averaged to get the reported  transit time. Consequently, regardless of the sample size or the actual  number of days the items spent in transit, the resulting average will always  be from 10 to 16 days. For example, a piece of mail that spent 100 days in  transit would be counted in the same category and weighted the same as  one that only took 16 days. Similarly, a piece of mail that spent 4 days in  transit would be counted in the same category as one that took 10, and  again weighted the same. (See table 1 for an example of how this  methodology is used to calculate transit times.)", "This methodology is even less viable when one considers that during the  peak of wartime operations, all mail destined for Iraq was held at the joint  military mail terminal in Kuwait for 23 days (late March through mid-April)  because of the rapid pace of troop movements.

According to a 3rd  Personnel Command official, it had always been done this way. We  discussed the methodology with Military Postal Service Agency officials.

Mail delivery to the  Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division was stopped when word was received that  the division was about to redeploy. When this plan changed and the  division did not redeploy, mail started to flow again. The division was told  several times that it would be redeployed and then it did not; each time,  when deployment was thought to be imminent, mail delivery was stopped.  This created a backlog.

These troops were concentrated in camps located in  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia near the borders of Kuwait and Iraq. In contrast,  Operation Iraqi Freedom involved about half the number of troops (about  250,000), dispersed over a larger geographical area (all of Kuwait and  Iraq), and involved a ground war that lasted about 42 days. This greater  dispersion of troops for a longer period of time increased the logistical  requirements for delivering the mail. Additionally, although the ground  war for Operation Iraqi Freedom is officially over, there is an ongoing  requirement to provide timely and efficient postal support for a large  number of personnel still in theater, fighting the global war on terrorism."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Implementation of Joint Postal Operations Fell Short", "paragraphs": ["Several key planning assumptions used in the creation of U.S. Central  Command\u2019s postal plan for Operation Iraqi Freedom proved problematic.  The embargo on Any Service Member mail produced unintended negative  results; mail restrictions for the first 30 days in theater were never  enacted; and the volume of mail was grossly underestimated. Table 2  summarizes these key assumptions, the actions taken, and the  consequences of those actions.", "Because Any Service Member mail caused delays in the delivery of other  personal mail and stressed the logistical system during Operations Desert  Shield/Storm, postal plans for Operation Iraqi Freedom placed an embargo  on this type of mail. Defense officials also discontinued Any Service  Member mail for security reasons following the Anthrax scares of 2001.  During Operations Desert Shield/Storm, Any Service Member mail acted as  a morale booster because it provided mail to troops who might not have  received mail otherwise. From an operations standpoint, this mail could  be separated and set aside until individually addressed mail had been  processed. However, the volume of Any Service Member mail taxed  transportation and storage capabilities. In order to prevent similar  problems during Operation Iraqi Freedom, planners placed an embargo on  Any Service Member mail. Despite this, individuals and organizations  sending mail developed \u201cworkarounds\u201d that overwhelmed the postal  system and contributed to a slowdown in service. Instead of addressing  mail to \u201cAny Service Member,\u201d senders addressed their letters and parcels  to specific individuals, enclosing a request that they share the mail with  other troops. Because this mail was addressed to specific individuals,  postal personnel had to treat it as regular mail and could not separate it  and set it aside for later processing. These \u201cworkarounds\u201d added to the  workload at every stage in the mail delivery process. For example, when  we visited the Joint Military Postal Activity in San Francisco, California,  we observed one of these \u201cworkaround\u201d shipments. It consisted of  approximately 40 boxes, each weighing about 8 to10 pounds. They were all  addressed to the same recipient and came from a charitable service  organization. This one shipment required its own handcart and almost one- quarter of an airline-shipping container.", "A second key assumption that did not have the intended result involved  mail restrictions. Drawing from the lessons learned from Operations  Desert Shield/Storm, postal planners for Operation Iraqi Freedom assumed  that mail would be restricted to personal first-class letters or sound/video  recordings that weighed 13 ounces or less for the first 30 days of  operations. At the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Military Postal  Service Agency and Army postal officials in theater asked that these  restrictions be imposed. However, U.S. Central Command officials did not  approve the request because, according the U.S. Central Command postal  planner, they believed that a sufficient appropriate postal infrastructure  was in place to handle the mail. As a result, the mail continued to flow into  theater, overtaxing the limited mail handlers and facilities in place and  creating huge backlogs of mail.", "Underestimating the volume of mail was the third planning assumption  that created problems for the mail system. Postal planners in Operation  Iraqi Freedom assumed that the volume of mail per person would be less  than it actually was. They estimated that there would be from 0.5 and 1.5  pounds of first class mail per person per day based on data from previous  contingency operations. Instead, military officials estimate that the initial  surge of mail averaged closer to 5 pounds per day, overburdening the  developing mail system.  According to the Military Postal Service Agency  and Air Force Postal Policy and Operations officials we interviewed, of the  total volume of mail shipped, more than 80 percent consisted of parcels  and the rest consisted of flat mail. The mail volume per soldier was much  higher than that seen in Operations Desert Shield/Storm. For example,  mail volume reached a monthly peak of 10 million pounds in Operations  Desert Shield/Storm for about 500,000 troops compared with a monthly  peak of 11 million pounds in Operation Iraqi Freedom for half as many  troops.

The single-service manager is normally  appointed from one of the military components, generally the component  with the most postal resources in theater. During Operations Desert  Shield/Storm, the single-service manager was the same for both the  peacetime and the contingency areas of responsibility.

The operations plan states that a Joint Postal Center be  established and that the peacetime single-service manager for the area of  responsibility    provide postal personnel, resources, and equipment to support the Joint  Postal Center as required;    continue to oversee military postal operations in the area of responsibility  not in the contingency area; and  relinquish policy and oversight responsibilities of postal operations in the  contingency area of responsibility to the Joint Postal Center once it is  operational.", "U.S. Central Command postal officials told us that neither the Joint Postal  Center nor the single-service manager performed according to the  approved plan or as expected.

Usually, Army postal personnel are tasked to support the daily  operations of military post offices.", "However, even this type of training was lacking. Officials attributed this  lack of training to a number of different factors. One factor is that most of  the Army\u2019s postal units are made up of Army Reserve soldiers, who do not  have an opportunity to train in postal facilities during peacetime. This is  because there are no military post offices in the United States.  Subsequently, if a reserve unit wants to train in a military post office they  have to deploy overseas for their annual training. The second factor is that  active duty Army postal personnel do not have an opportunity to conduct  realistic postal operations during routine training exercises.

Key postal infrastructure  elements were needed to receive the increased volume of mail and  establish a joint mail terminal in Kuwait.", "At the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Fleet Mail Center in  Bahrain processed mail for all the services even though it did not have the  staff or equipment to handle the surge in volume. Because of the increased  workload, it took about 5 to 7 extra days for the mail to be delivered. As  the theater matured, a joint military mail terminal had to be established in  Kuwait to relieve the Fleet Mail Center of Army and Air Force mail and to  augment existing postal facilities at Camp Doha in Kuwait. Postal officials  told us that even with this additional facility, the biggest hindrance to  processing mail was a lack of sufficient workspace. In addition, as troops  began to occupy parts of Iraq in the spring of 2003, additional mail  facilities and transportation assets were set up to handle incoming and  outgoing mail in Baghdad and other cities and towns in Iraq.", "The lack of heavy material-handling equipment during the early stages of  both conflicts also hampered the processing of mail. Lessons learned from  Operations Desert Shield/Storm recommended that modern material- handling equipment be provided to postal units. Operation Iraqi Freedom  postal officials also underscored the need to have modern and varied types  of material-handling equipment, such as fork lifts and rough terrain cargo  handlers available to support postal facilities. (See fig. 8.) Postal workers  did not have such equipment in the early days of Operation Iraqi Freedom,  so they had to manually break down the containers and sort thousands of  pounds of mail per day by hand, adding to the time it took to process the  mail for delivery. According to military postal officials, units did not have  these types of heavy equipment because either their tables of organization  and equipment were not updated to reflect the need, or if updated, were  not properly resourced.", "In addition to a lack of heavy material-handling equipment, postal units did  not have the appropriate postal equipment and supplies to perform routine  operations. In lessons learned from Operations Desert Shield/Storm, postal  officials recommended that postal units regularly review their equipment  and supply needs and assemble prepackaged \u201ckits\u201d for contingency postal  operations. They also recommended that, at the earliest indication of a  contingency, an advance team of postal experts deploy into theater to  determine what postal equipment and supplies are required. Despite these  recommendations, postal units continued to arrive in theater inadequately  equipped to conduct postal operations during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Postal officials at all levels told us that the lists of authorized postal  equipment, such as meters and scales, were outdated and did not reflect  the correct types or quantities of equipment needed for modern postal  operations. In addition, many deployed units did not have access to the  full suite of communications equipment, such as secure radios, cellular  and satellite telephones, and \u201clandlines\u201d for their facilities. As a result,  postal units were unable to coordinate mail pick-up and truck mail  convoys, and communicate with other units.", "Moving mail once it got into theater was a challenge because postal units  were not equipped with vehicles to transport the mail. The operations plan  for Operation Iraqi Freedom made no special provisions for ground  transportation of mail. It assumed that mail would use existing  commercial trucks supplemented by military trucks as needed. Postal  units at all levels of command (e.g., company through corps) had to  compete with other units for vehicles or contract for trucks through local  sources. Military postal officials stated that, during Operation Iraqi  Freedom, trucks were scarce in theater and carrying mostly ammunition,  water, and food. In order to minimize delays in mail delivery, postal  officials in January 2003 arranged with a U.S. government contractor to  provide 72 trucks and drivers to deliver the mail from the Joint Military  Mail Terminal to military post offices in Kuwait and Iraq.  Although it took  the contractor several more months to obtain all the trucks, this action  was a great help, according to U.S. Central Command postal units serving  in theater at that time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Transportation Was Improved Based on Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["As a result of lessons learned from the first Gulf conflict, the Military  Postal Service Agency did implement one strategy during Operation Iraqi  Freedom that proved to be successful. At the beginning of Operations  Desert Shield/Storm, mail was initially transported overseas by  commercial airlines. Because commercial U.S. carriers reduced the  number of flights into Saudi Arabia, postal officials decided to switch  exclusively to dedicated military flights to transport mail from the United  States to the theater. Similarly, at the beginning of Operation Iraqi  Freedom, mail backlogs occurred with existing commercial air service.  However, in contrast to Operations Desert Shield/Storm, military postal  officials decided to continue using commercial airlines but arranged with  the U.S. Postal Service to contract for dedicated postal flights from the  United States to Bahrain and Kuwait. According to Military Postal Service  Agency officials, this resulted in much more reliable air delivery of mail to  the theater."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Various Military Postal Units Have Identified Solutions to Postal Problems, but No Mechanism Is in Place to Ensure Their Consolidation and Resolution", "paragraphs": ["Although military postal officials and others have begun to identify  solutions to some of the long-standing postal problems seen again during  Operation Iraqi Freedom, no single entity has been officially tasked to  resolve these issues.

At this time, no single entity has officially been  designated to collect and consolidate solutions to long-standing mail  delivery problems. After past contingencies, the Joint Staff\u2019s Joint Center  for Lessons Learned gathered and consolidated the lessons learned and  made them available to the field. We spoke to representatives of the  military Joint Center for Operational Analysis, formerly the Joint Center  for Lessons Learned, to determine if this process would apply to Operation  Iraqi Freedom and they informed us that military postal operations have  not been identified as an issue area for lessons learned and they do not  anticipate that postal operations will become one. Several individual  members of entities such as the U.S. Army Reserve Command, U.S. Central  Command, and the Coalition Forces Land Component Command have  prepared memoranda outlining issues and lessons learned for postal  operations during Operation Iraqi Freedom.", "We summarized the memoranda, after action reports and comments  regarding solutions to postal problems that we collected during our  meetings with dozens of key military postal officials. Key military postal  officials emphasized that these postal issues must be addressed to avoid a  repetition of the same postal problems in future contingencies. These  issues represent many long-standing problems that can be directly traced  back to Operations Desert Shield/Storm. The issues identified include the  following:  improve joint postal planning and ensure the execution of the postal  operations plan;    anticipate the levels of support and types of activities needed, and deploy  postal units early to reduce or eliminate backlogs during the build-up;    update tables of organization and equipment for postal units to reflect  what they actually need in terms of people and equipment to conduct  postal operations;    develop peacetime training programs to prepare postal units for the  missions they will be required to perform during contingency operations;  and  review the command and control of postal units to determine if the postal  function is in the right place and whether one organization should be  responsible to both develop and execute policy.", "In October 2003 the Military Postal Service Agency hosted a joint postal  conference to discuss postal problems with dozens of key postal  participants in Operation Iraqi Freedom. It is currently in the process of  developing a final report that will outline plans to resolve issues in the  areas of organization, supplies, planning, training, transportation, \u201cAny  Service Member\u201d mail, routing and labeling, and transit time data  collection. Although the agency has taken this initiative, it has limited  authority and cannot direct the services to jointly address the problems,  according to the Executive Director of the Military Postal Service Agency.  Military Postal Service Agency officials describe their role as primarily the  single point of contact between the military and the U.S. Postal Service.", "Service components and the Military Postal Service Agency have taken  some initial steps in employing alternative mail delivery and tracking  systems. For example, the Marine Corps is currently testing an electronic  mail system for getting mail delivered to forward deployed troops. In  addition, the Military Postal Service Agency has taken steps to solve a  long-standing problem regarding transit time data. The agency has  developed a mail bar-coding system that could be used to more accurately  track the transit time, but it has not yet been successfully deployed for use  by ground troops because of connectivity problems. The Military Origin  Destination Information System, modeled after the system that the U.S.  Postal Service employs, can be used to track transit times of bags of letters  and small packages as well as larger parcels. By bar coding these items  and scanning them prior to mailing, and then scanning them once they  reach their destination, transit times can be easily calculated. According to  officials from the Military Postal Service Agency, the Navy is currently  using this system with some success. However, the system requires a  certain level of connectivity with the Internet, which troops in the field  lacked during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Wireless networks may be  necessary in order to connect all military post offices to the Internet,  which has not been practical on the battlefield. In addition, this system  shares a shortcoming with the test letters in that transit times are not  tracked to the level of the individual service member."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The timely delivery of mail to troops overseas involved in contingency  operations is an important mechanism to boost morale among service  members and their families and friends. Without taking action to resolve  the identified issues in planning, building, and operating a joint postal  system, mail delivery will continue to suffer in future contingency  operations as witnessed by the repetition of delayed mail delivery from  one Gulf war to the next. Emphasis needs to be placed on establishing  joint postal responsibilities and the subsequent execution of those duties.  Past experience has shown that postal operations have not received  command attention or been designated a priority. Establishing the needs  for postal operations early in the process and dedicating the appropriate  resources is crucial for providing the timely and efficient delivery of mail.

Specifically, these actions should address the issues highlighted in this  report, such as the following:    strengthen the joint postal planning function and specify a body to ensure  the implementation of postal operations in theater;    deploy properly trained and equipped postal troops into theater prior to  the mail build-up; and    dedicate adequate postal facilities, heavy equipment, and transportation  assets for postal operations.", "An important part of addressing these long-standing problems is to share  the results of these lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom with all  of the combatant commands to ensure that future contingencies do not  repeat these problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD stated that it fully  concurred with our recommendations and has already initiated certain  actions.

Our review focused on postal  operations as they applied to U.S. troops deployed to the countries of  Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iraq during the buildup for Operation Iraqi Freedom,  the operation itself, and the ongoing military operations in Iraq (January  through December 2003).", "To address the issue of the timeliness of mail service to and from troops  serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, we collected, analyzed, and assessed  the reliability of transit time data from the Army\u2019s 3rd Personnel  Command and the Military Postal Service Agency. We discussed the data  with military postal officials to ensure that we were interpreting it  correctly, especially the methodology used to report transit times from the  Transit Time Information Standard System for Military Mail. Within our  analysis, we determined that the majority of transit time data we received  was for Army mail. Some data were from the Air Force and Marine Corps,  but they were not separated out. We did not collect transit time data from  the Navy, as their postal operations run separate from and independent of  the others. Some data required sorting in order to eliminate irrelevant  data elements and to be able to display them on a monthly basis. To  determine the effect that the timeliness of mail service had on troops  serving in the contingency area, we designed a data collection instrument  and then conducted discussion groups with and collected data from a non- representative sample of 127 officers and enlisted personnel\u201491 from the  Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Division (stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia) and 36  from the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (stationed at Camp Pendleton,  California).
