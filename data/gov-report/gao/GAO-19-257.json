As a result, it is difficult to determine whether changes are due to firms adopting advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robots (see photo), or other unrelated factors. In lieu of such data, GAO analyzed employment trends and characteristics of jobs that selected researchers identified as susceptible to automation, and found that:", "industries with a greater proportion of jobs susceptible to automation were more likely to have experienced growth in tech jobs (i.e., computing, engineering, and mathematics) from 2010 to 2016\u2014possibly an indicator of industries preparing to adopt advanced technologies;", "occupations susceptible to automation and industries with a greater share of these jobs did not experience meaningfully higher job loss rates in this period, though it could be too soon to observe these effects; and", "certain groups, such as workers with no college education and Hispanic workers, tended to hold jobs susceptible to automation in 2016, and thus could be disproportionately affected by changes if they occur.", "The Department of Labor (DOL) has a role in tracking changes in the U.S. workforce, but the data it collects related to the workforce effects of advanced technologies are limited. DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) identifies occupations projected to experience staffing pattern changes and the most significant causes, such as use of robotics, but its efforts are not designed to capture all instances of changes due to advanced technologies. DOL's Occupational Information Network program also collects data on tasks and technologies in occupations, such as robotics, but it was not designed to track changes over time. According to BLS, these efforts and other data they collect provide some, but not all, of the information required to identify and systematically track the impact of automation on the workforce. Without comprehensive data that link technological changes to shifts in the workforce, DOL lacks a valuable tool for ensuring that programs it funds to support workers are aligned with local labor market realities, and employers and job seekers need to rely on other sources of information to decide what training to offer or seek.", "The Department of Commerce's Census Bureau (Census) has started tracking technology adoption and resulting workforce effects in the new Annual Business Survey, which was administered for the first time in June 2018 with significant support from the National Science Foundation. This first survey asked firms about their use of advanced technologies and initial results will be available in late 2019. When the survey is next administered in summer 2019, Census plans to ask additional questions about firms' motivations for adopting technologies and effects the technologies might have on workers. This survey could provide information about the prevalence of technology adoption and workforce changes (e.g., declines in production workers or increases in supervisory workers), but it is not intended to provide information on the magnitude of workforce changes. Also, it remains unclear what limitations, if any, the survey data may have.", "According to officials from the 16 firms GAO interviewed, cost savings and other considerations led them to adopt advanced technologies, despite facing certain risks with the new technologies. Officials from these firms typically identified cost savings and improving job or product quality as primary motivations for adopting advanced technologies. For example, an automotive parts manufacturer said the firm adopted robots to reduce costs by using fewer workers. A door manufacturer said the firm installed two robots to lift heavy doors onto a paint line to reduce the number of worker injuries. A rubber stamp manufacturer said acquiring a robot (pictured above) allowed it to purchase and process raw materials instead of buying precut materials. Firm officials also identified risks related to adopting advanced technologies that could affect their return on investment, such as risks related to the reliability of technology and working with new tech developers.", "Among the firms GAO met with, officials described various ways technology adoption has affected their workforces. On one hand, officials at many firms said they needed fewer workers in certain positions after adopting technologies. The firms generally redeployed workers to other tasks, and in some cases, reduced the size of their workforces, typically through attrition. For example, a medical center GAO visited adopted autonomous mobile robots to transport linens and waste, among other things, which officials said eliminated 17 positions and shifted workers to other positions. On the other hand, officials at some firms said advanced technologies helped them increase competitiveness and add positions. An appliance manufacturer used advanced technologies to produce more of its own parts instead of relying on suppliers and, as a result, increased the number of production jobs, according to officials. Firm officials also noted that workers' tasks and skills have been changing due to advanced technologies (see figure). Workers who can adapt to new roles may experience positive effects, such as work that is safer, while those who cannot adapt may be negatively affected."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL develop ways to use existing or new data collection efforts to identify and systematically track the workforce effects of advanced technologies.

After  considering the limitations of available data to link employment trends to  technology adoption in a comprehensive way, we used a study by  researchers Frey and Osborne that identified occupations susceptible to  automation based on the tasks associated with them. We analyzed these  occupations to glean insight about the workforce effects of advanced  technology adoption. While different studies attempt to predict what jobs  might be automated in the future, we used this study because it is widely  cited and its results are structured in a way that allowed us to identify a  broadly inclusive group of occupations susceptible to automation. The  results of our analyses could be affected by using other studies to the  extent they identify different occupations as susceptible to automation.  We analyzed the occupations Frey and Osborne identified as susceptible  to automation using employment data from the Census Bureau (Census)  and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Specifically, we used data from  the American Community Survey (ACS), 2010-2016; the Current  Population Survey\u2019s (CPS) Displaced Worker Supplement, 2016; and the  Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, 2017. We analyzed  whether the concentration of these occupations in industries is correlated  with growth in tech jobs (i.e., jobs in the fields of computing, engineering,  and mathematics) or employment declines in those industries, whether  job displacements are more common in these occupations than in others,  the characteristics of workers who hold jobs in these occupations, and the  geographic concentration of jobs in these occupations. For more detail on  our data analysis methods, see appendix I.", "We also reviewed examples of recent and ongoing studies that attempt to  measure workforce effects directly attributable to technology adoption.

We interviewed officials and reviewed data and information collected by  these agencies. We also reviewed Commerce\u2019s new Annual Business  Survey questionnaire to consider the potential uses of data being  collected by the survey, and analyzed data from DOL\u2019s Employment  Projections program and Occupational Information Network (O*NET)  database to identify information related to the adoption and workforce  effects of advanced technologies.", "To understand the adoption of advanced technologies by firms and the  resulting workforce effects, we met with officials representing 16 firms that  are using advanced technologies and a systems integrator who spoke for  several of his customer firms. To identify firms to meet with, we consulted  a variety of sources, such as researchers, technology developer firms,  state economic development associations, and our own research. We  limited our focus to firms that had adopted advanced technologies and  had experienced workforce effects. Our findings from our discussions with  the selected firms are not generalizable, but do provide illustrative  examples of how various advanced technologies are being used and how  workers have been affected. We selected firms to provide a range of size,  industry sector, types of advanced technologies used, and geographic  location. For example, of the 16 firms we met with, 10 are manufacturers  and 6 are non-manufacturing firms of various types (e.g., a university- affiliated medical center and a warehouse for a regional grocery store  chain). When possible, we met with multiple managers and workers, and  observed advanced technologies in operation.

For example, researchers have noted that  automation has replaced tasks performed by workers and also increased  production, creating a greater demand for other types of workers.", "Although automation has historically been a labor disrupter in  manufacturing and physical work, various researchers have observed that  recent progress in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are  enabling machines to perform cognitive tasks currently performed by  humans. Artificial intelligence refers to machines and computers that  attempt to mimic various aspects of human intelligence, as we have  reported. The field of AI can be traced back to the 1950s. Early AI often  consisted of expert systems programmed by humans to perform  predefined tasks. This form of AI resulted in some degree of productivity  gains and remains an active area of development. However, numerous  factors, primarily the trends underlying big data (i.e., increased data  availability, storage, and processing power), have contributed to rapid  innovation and accomplishments in AI in recent years. Present-day AI  innovation centers more on machine learning, including deep neural  network architectures, in which systems are trained against observational  or simulated outcomes\u2014applications include language translation and  machine vision (i.e., systems that use cameras, radar, or lasers to  observe their surroundings or recognize content). Industrial robots and  robotic machinery are often more comparable to expert systems that are  programmed to perform predefined tasks, but they can also incorporate  machine learning, such as having machine vision capabilities (e.g., object  recognition). Below are some examples of expert system and machine  learning applications of artificial intelligence.", "Examples of expert system applications of AI:  software programs that prepare tax filings or schedule logistics; and  industrial robots that perform predefined or routine tasks, such as  lifting, placing, and welding pieces of metal together.", "Examples of machine learning applications of AI:  software that uses a training dataset to \u201clearn\u201d how to read information  from a form filled out by a person;  collaborative robots that can sense when they touch a physical  obstruction and shut down to safely work alongside humans;  industrial robots with machine vision incorporated to identify and pick  up specific parts from a collection of randomly strewn pieces; and automated guided vehicles that transport materials around a  production plant and use cameras and radar to navigate  independently and re-route around obstacles.", "Advanced technologies, including AI and other technological drivers of  workforce changes, are continually progressing and new developments  emerge regularly. For example, automated vehicles have varying levels of  autonomy. Similarly, while robots have existed for decades, today\u2019s  generation of robots may be equipped with machine vision and learning  capabilities that enable them to perform a more expansive array of tasks.  How, when, or whether technologies progress from development to  commercialization (i.e., readiness for adoption), and how, when, or  whether firms adopt the technologies is generally dependent on context- specific considerations, which are difficult to predict. To better understand  these developments and how they affect the economy, the National  Academies report recommended developing three indexes (technology  progress index; AI progress index; and organizational change and  technology diffusion index) to measure technology progress and the  extent of adoption. The study suggested that indexes could be valuable  for identifying what fields are advancing rapidly and what benchmarks  might indicate the imminence of significant economic impact, as well as  tracking and predicting the types of human tasks that can be automated  and the impacts of technology adoption by industry. Stanford University\u2019s  AI Index project is another initiative that aims to track, collate, and  visualize data related to artificial intelligence. The data collected by the AI  index measure, among other things, volume of AI activity (e.g., published  papers, course enrollment, AI-related startups, job openings) and  technical performance (e.g., object detection and speech recognition).

For  example, as shown in figure 2, the plastics product manufacturing  industry has a relatively high concentration of jobs susceptible to  automation. Many of these jobs are in production occupations. From 2010  through 2016, this industry experienced about 11 percent annual growth  in tech jobs (i.e., jobs in the fields of computing, engineering, and  mathematics). More than half of this growth was the result of increases in  industrial engineers, engineering technicians, and miscellaneous  engineers. As we observed at some firms we visited, some of these  engineers may have been hired to program or maintain newly installed  robots. However, the data do not provide this level of information about  job tasks. Similar dynamics could also be occurring in other industries.  Across all 69 industries that had statistically significant changes in the  concentration of tech jobs, we found a positive, though weak, correlation  with the concentration of jobs susceptible to automation (see fig. 2).  This suggests that growth in tech jobs may be an indicator of industries\u2019  preparation for, or adoption of advanced technologies. However, given  the complex causes of employment changes, there could be other  reasons for tech job growth in these industries that are unrelated to firms\u2019  adoption of advanced technologies.", "The growth in tech jobs in certain industries suggests firms in these  industries may be using more advanced technologies, which could also  signal that jobs susceptible to automation are being replaced. However,  our analysis of ACS data showed no correlation between an industry  having a higher concentration of jobs susceptible to automation and  employment changes in that industry (i.e., total employment increases or  decreases). We also found no meaningful differences in job losses,  according to our analysis of employment data from the Current Population  Survey\u2019s Displaced Worker Supplement. Specifically, the relative rate at  which workers in occupations susceptible to automation lost a job  because their position or shift was abolished or there was insufficient  work for them to do was not meaningfully different than workers in other  occupations. There could be a number of reasons we did not find a  relationship between susceptibility to automation and employment  changes in both of these analyses, including: a relationship does not exist;  such a relationship is too complex to measure in this way (e.g.,  automation may lead to decreases in employment in some industries,  while also leading to increases in employment in other industries due  to improved competitiveness, productivity, and profitability);  it is too soon to observe the employment effects of automation (e.g.,  growth in tech jobs in an industry may be a leading indicator of  employment disruption); or our analysis covered a period of overall economic growth, which could  obscure or overwhelm other employment trends.", "Existing data cannot predict with certainty when or if automation will  materialize in the workforce, as suggested by our analyses. However, the  tendency of particular worker groups to hold jobs susceptible to  automation suggests that some communities may be disproportionately  affected by changes if they occur. For example, according to our analysis  of 2016 ACS data, workers with lower levels of education are more likely  than those with higher levels to hold jobs in occupations that the Frey and  Osborne study identify as susceptible to automation. Specifically, 60.7  percent of workers with a high school degree or less hold these types of  jobs, as compared to 46.7 percent of workers with some college, 26.9  percent of workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and 11.3 percent of workers  with a graduate degree.

These occupations are comprised of a diverse set  of jobs that may experience automation in different ways and at different  times, if at all.

For  example, the median hourly wage for workers in occupations susceptible  to automation is $14.26, compared to $22.06 for other workers, according  to our analysis of 2016 ACS data. After controlling for factors that may  affect wages, such as age, education, and industry, we found that  workers in jobs susceptible to automation earn about 17.2 percent less,  on average, than similar workers in other occupations.

They observe that their estimated employment effects are  greatest in manufacturing and other industries most exposed to  robots, in routine manual work-related occupations, and for workers  with less than a college education. They do not find corresponding  employment gains in any other occupation or education groups. They  also estimate that one more robot used per thousand workers reduces  wages by about 0.5 percent. They conclude by noting that, so far,  relatively few robots have been used in the U.S. economy and thus  the effect on jobs has been limited; however, they state that if robot  usage continues to grow as researchers expect, these effects could  be more substantial.", "Graetz and Michaels estimate that increased robot use did not  significantly affect total hours worked across the 17 developed  countries in their analysis, but that work shifted from low-skilled  workers to middle-skilled and high-skilled workers. They also estimate  that increased robot use increases productivity and average wages.  While their analysis covers 17 developed countries, they note that  robot use in the United States was marginally lower than the average  across all countries. They also observe that while their results differ  from Acemoglu and Restrepo, it is possible that the effects of robot  usage are different in the United States than across the 17 countries  they analyze.", "Other researchers have used U.S. patent data as an alternative way to  approximate the spread of advanced technologies and to examine the  resulting workforce effects. Mann and P\u00fcttman (2017) use machine  learning algorithms to identify patents related to automation technology.  They find that automation patents grew substantially from 1976 through  2014. After linking the patents to industries where they may be used,  they estimate that automation causes manufacturing employment to fall,  though it increases employment in the service sector, as well as overall  employment. They observe that their results depict a more positive  picture of the employment effects of new technology use than the studies  that used industrial robot sales data (discussed above). Lee Branstetter,  a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, and his colleagues have a  similar ongoing project that uses a machine learning algorithm to identify  patents related to AI technologies.

Their  preliminary results estimate that automation replaces some routine tasks,  leading to estimated declines in the number of production floor jobs  requiring medium skill levels. According to the authors, this firm-level,  task-based approach may be applicable to other manufacturing industries  and could provide insight on how the adoption of different technologies  may produce different labor outcomes.

Because of the shape of the pieces and because they  were lying unorganized in boxes, the task requires human dexterity, making the process  difficult to automate, according to officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Adopting Advanced Technologies Has Had Varied Effects on the Workforces of Selected Firms, Including Declines in Some Types of Work and Gains in Others Officials Said Advanced Technologies Have Replaced Positions at Some Selected Firms, and Most Firms Relied on Redeployment of Workers and Attrition Rather than Direct Layoffs", "paragraphs": ["Officials at many of the firms we visited said they needed fewer workers  in certain positions after adopting advanced technologies to perform tasks  previously done by workers. Officials at these firms generally told us  they adjusted by redeploying workers to other responsibilities and, in  certain instances, reducing the firm\u2019s workforce size through attrition. We  also heard examples of direct layoffs due to the adoption of technologies.  There may also be other types of adjustments firms can make that we did  not observe or discuss with these officials. The complexity of these  workforce adjustments makes it difficult to determine or measure the  effects of technology adoption on workers. For example, although  workers may not have lost their jobs due to an adopted technology taking  over specified work tasks\u2014either because of redeployments or attrition\u2014 fewer job opportunities might be available in the future for workers with  similar skills. In addition, the iterative and sometimes lengthy process of  incorporating advanced technologies can delay workforce effects. Thus,  the absence of short-term effects of technology adoption does not  necessarily preclude long-term implications, such as reductions or slower  growth rates in workforce size over time (see text box below). As  discussed in the prior section, one reason firm officials are motivated to  use advanced technologies is to decrease labor costs.", "Slower Workforce Growth than Revenue Growth  An official from a small automotive parts manufacturer told us that advanced  technologies and automation resulted in revenue increasing by more than 400 percent  over the last 12 years while the workforce increased about 15 percent. Production  workers now make up a smaller percentage of the overall firm workforce than prior to  automation, and sales and support staff now make up a greater percentage. The firm  official described this change as an increase in higher-skilled jobs and a decrease in  lower-skilled jobs.  Similarly, according to firm officials at a different medium-sized automotive parts  manufacturer, revenue has grown six times in the past 15 years while the workforce has  grown four times, largely as a result of adopting robotics technology.", "Redeployments without job loss: When advanced technologies  replaced positions, firms we visited often shifted, or redeployed, workers  to different responsibilities. For example, officials at a medium-sized  automotive parts manufacturer we visited told us they had nine workers  who smoothed sharp edges and removed burrs on hydraulic cylinders  prior to installing two robots to perform these tasks. Now, with the robots  in these positions, three workers load the robots and then inspect and de- burr any parts of the cylinders the robots missed. The other six workers  were redeployed to other tasks, according to a firm official. At a large  appliance manufacturer we visited, officials told us that two workers used  to move large parts from one line to another line to be painted. Now, as  we observed, a collaborative robot performs this function alone; a worker  monitors the operation to ensure it is running smoothly, and the original  workers were moved to different tasks on the production line, according to  officials. Although the size of these firms\u2019 workforces did not decrease as  a result of the technology adoption, the numbers of certain positions were  adjusted\u2014for example, production positions decreased while monitoring  positions increased. Differences in skills required for these positions may  also affect the ability of current workers to transition and could have  implications for individual workers even though the number of jobs at the  firm does not change. These sorts of changes may or may not appear in  firms\u2019 reported employment data, depending on whether redeployed  workers change occupations or what other workforce changes may be  occurring simultaneously (e.g., if other production workers are hired for  reasons unrelated to the technology adoption).", "Redeployments with job loss through attrition: Officials at some of the  selected firms that redeployed workers said they also reduced their  overall workforce size through attrition, as a result of adopting advanced  technologies.", "Autonomous mobile robots independently transported biohazardous  waste, linens, meals, and prescription drugs throughout the university- affiliated medical center we visited. Officials told us they eliminated 17  positions after they deployed the robots. No workers were laid off;  instead, they relied on high staff turnover rates and moved workers to  vacant positions elsewhere.", "At a medium-sized fruit processing plant, firm officials told us they  replaced 150 to 200 jobs with various advanced technologies over the  past 3 to 4 years. However, they relied on attrition rather than layoffs.  For example, the plant adopted a robot to pack food into boxes. Prior  to using the robot, officials told us there were 26 workers per shift  performing this job; as of our visit, there were 13 workers per shift.", "A medium-sized door manufacturer reduced its workforce from 650  employees to less than 500 over approximately the last 20 years due  to, among other things, their adoption of robots, according to firm  officials. For example, we observed industrial robots that load steel  sheets into a cutting machine, reading a barcode on each sheet that  tells them what size sheet is being lifted and how it should be placed  in the cutting machine. This process only requires a single worker to  monitor the robots during each of two shifts, where previously three  workers per shift were on this production step (i.e., a change from six  to two workers total).", "How quickly workforce reductions materialize for firms using attrition can  vary greatly. We visited firms with low employee turnover rates and firms  with high turnover rates. High worker turnover rates allowed some firms to  more quickly adjust their workforces when deploying advanced  technologies and may be a reason we were told about job loss through  attrition rather than layoffs at these firms.", "Job loss through layoffs: An official from a systems integrator firm  (\u201cintegrator\u201d) provided examples of significant layoffs as a direct result of  advanced technologies. This integrator provides machine learning  technology and other similar products to automate office and  administrative processes, among other things. One of the integrator\u2019s  customers\u2014a U.S. automotive parts firm facing competition from online  retailers\u2014adopted machine learning technology to take over its accounts  payable and distribution system. As a result, according to the integrator\u2019s  official, this firm reduced the number of employees in one of its U.S.  offices from 500 to 200. Another of this same integrator\u2019s customers\u2014a  firm that sells telecommunication circuits\u2014adopted machine learning  technology to automate product returns processing. As a result, the firm  experienced a 30 percent reduction in customer care calls, and replaced  about 150 jobs in a U.S. call center with 110 jobs at a call center in a  different country (i.e., about 150 U.S. jobs lost; and an overall workforce  reduction), according to the integrator\u2019s official."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advanced Technologies Helped Increase Competitiveness and Enabled Employment Growth Despite Positions Being Replaced, According to Officials at Some Selected Firms", "paragraphs": ["According to officials at some selected firms, greater competitiveness and  productivity due to the adoption of advanced technologies (see sidebar)  has helped firms grow their workforces. For example, some hired  additional production workers due to increased production (despite some  production tasks being taken on by the adopted technologies), or new  types of workers, such as technicians to maintain the technologies. Some  officials also said that although they may not have grown their workforces,  adopting advanced technologies helped them stay in business by  allowing them to compete effectively, and thus to preserve jobs and retain  workers. For example, officials at a medium-sized door manufacturer,   where we observed numerous robots in the production facility, told us that  their firm \u201ccould not survive\u201d global competition without the use of  advanced technologies.", "Productivity and Efficiency Gains  Adopting advanced technologies has helped  some firms improve their product quality and  increase their production efficiency.  For example, according to officials at a  medium-sized fruit processing plant, after the  firm began using an automated fruit grading  technology, the process took significantly less  time and resulted in far fewer complaints from  farmers about the grading. Farmers thought  the automated grading technology was fairer  and more accurate than having workers  manually and subjectively grade the fruit.  A large appliance manufacturer that began  using a collaborative robot to apply sealant to  an appliance door observed improved  consistency, which led to fewer service calls  from retailers and customers about  excessive, insufficient, or incorrect seals.  One medium-sized door manufacturer said  that automation technologies enabled them to  produce and ship doors in 3 days, as  opposed to 4 to 6 weeks.   An official from a warehouse for a regional  chain of grocery stores said that using  automated guided vehicles allowed the firm to  save time moving pallets from one end of the  warehouse to the other, and also save worker  hours. The warehouse saves just over $2 per  pallet moved by an automated guided vehicle  rather than a worker, and up to $3,500 a day  based on volume, according to the official.", "Advanced technologies enabled some selected firms to increase  production or produce a larger range of goods, and thus to hire additional  production workers. This also led to workforce increases for suppliers and  other firms, according to officials.", "One large appliance manufacturer increased its use of robots and  other advanced technologies to produce more of its own component  parts internally instead of relying on suppliers. As a result, the firm  was also able to increase the number of production jobs, according to  firm officials.", "Due to advanced technologies, a small automotive parts manufacturer  was able to bid on a contract to produce a new and more intricate part  for a major automotive manufacturer. An official described how the  part was so intricate that it could not have been produced manually  with the required level of consistency and speed. Although the firm  adopted six robots to produce this part, winning the contract also  created nine new jobs. While the robots are completing much of the  production, the volume of parts demanded and the existence of some  tasks that only workers can complete has led to this job growth.", "A developer of autonomous mobile robots said that, as a result of  increased business, his firm has created jobs among its eight local  suppliers where he buys parts, such as motherboards for the robots.", "Growth of Developer and Integrator Firms  Selected developer firms we met with said they grew their technical and non-technical  staff as a result of increasing demand for their technologies.", "A firm that develops and produces robots had tripled its workforce size, to about 130  employees, in the last year alone, according to officials.  An official at another developer firm that makes inspection robots said they had  grown from three workers to about 20 and envisions expanding to 100 in the near  future. The official said that the firm\u2019s first years were spent on technology  development, but that once the technology was deployable to customers, the firm  grew its workforce size.", "Integrator firms that help companies adopt advanced technologies have also grown in  size, and new types have emerged, according to integrators we visited. For example,  with the development of smarter robots, one integrator firm we visited entered the  industry to recondition and sell old robots; the firm also adds newer technology to these  robots if requested. This integrator has grown from 35 to 45 employees in the last 10  years, according to officials, with the new positions being primarily robot technician jobs.", "As a result of technology adoption, some firms hired more workers with  technical skills, and in other instances lower-skilled workers, according to  firm officials.", "An official from a warehouse for a regional chain of grocery stores  said that adopting an advanced automation system created a need for  three additional workers to provide preventive maintenance on the  machines.

Workers who can adapt and be  flexible to task changes may experience positive effects, including work  that is less physically taxing, safer, more ergonomic, less monotonous, or  higher paying. On the other hand, workers who are unable to adjust to  changing tasks may be negatively affected. Officials at some of the firms  told us that their firms provided internal training or leveraged external  resources to develop workers\u2019 skills to help them move into new  positions. During our visits to selected firms, we saw a variety of ways in  which tasks for workers are changing.", "Interactive work: The use of autonomous mobile robots to deliver  prescription drugs for patients enabled nurses at the university-affiliated  medical center we visited to focus more of their time on patient  interaction, according to officials. The small stamp manufacturer we  visited would like to continue to automate its ordering process and focus  more on providing customer service. Officials there said for future hires,  they plan to recruit for data and people skills, rather than production skills.", "Cognitive work: A federal statistical agency adopted machine learning  technology to automatically interpret text narratives on forms and assign  codes to the data. As a result, staff who previously entered this  information manually are able to spend more time on analytical tasks  such as reviewing the accuracy of the auto-coding, correcting issues,  obtaining clarifications about information submitted on the forms, and  following up with non-respondents, according to officials.", "Higher-skilled work: At a large automotive manufacturer, due to  increased use of advanced technologies, workers who are hired today  need to have greater technical proficiencies than workers hired in the  past. For example, to adapt to their changing roles working with robotic  equipment, non-technical production staff need machine maintenance  and technical skills, rather than only manual dexterity skills. Officials at a  large appliance manufacturer that adopted an automated machine to  stamp metal said that the resulting process required a single worker to  monitor the machine and provide basic maintenance. This worker needed  technical skills and at least 6 months of training to effectively perform  these duties. In contrast, at another one of this firm\u2019s global plants, four  separate pressers are used and each requires workers to load and  unload metal.", "Monitoring work: Officials at the large appliance manufacturer  mentioned above showed us a step in their production process in which  two small pieces of plastic and metal need to be attached. Three workers  used to perform this task by hand, which caused ergonomic challenges,  and inconsistencies in both quality and production cycle times. Now, the  firm uses three robots to perform this work and a single worker loads the  pieces for all three robots and monitors their performance. At a small  automotive parts manufacturer, production operators who work in cells  with robots monitor multiple machines and sometimes also monitor  multiple work cells, so a greater aptitude level is needed. As a result,  these operators earn $3 per hour more than operators in work cells  without robots, according to a firm official.", "Less physically taxing work: Staff at some firms also told us how  advanced technologies have made worker tasks less physically  demanding. For example, we talked with one warehouse worker who  used to lift heavy boxes, but who now operates a forklift after his old task  was automated with a conveyer belt and sorting system. He described his  new position as having ergonomic benefits, including experiencing less  back pain. At a large automotive manufacturer, officials said the firm  installed six robots to paint vehicle interiors. This production step was a  major ergonomic hazard and workers who did this painting had a  relatively high injury rate, according to officials. Officials told us that  adopting the robots lowered the injury rate among these workers and  resulted in faster vehicle painting.", "Simplified work: At a small stamp manufacturer that adopted a  collaborative robot, officials told us that as the firm continues to redesign  and optimize operations, the robot will take on more complex tasks. As a  result, the remaining production work performed by the firm\u2019s production  worker will be simpler (see fig. 7). Officials said that in the future, after the  firm\u2019s current production worker retires, the firm may rely on contingent  workers to perform any needed production work not completed by the  robot because the tasks will be simpler and easier to train a new,  temporary worker to complete. Officials said the firm may also hire a  worker with a different and more varied skillset who can perform the few  remaining production tasks along with other types of tasks.", "Lower-skilled work: Officials at a medium-sized door manufacturer  installed a robot to facilitate the firm\u2019s redesigned door sealant system  and production process. The original process of manually applying door  sealant was physically-intensive, ergonomically challenging, and required  significant skill and experience to precisely apply the sealant. With the  new design, a robot applies the sealant autonomously. As a result,  workers perform lower-skilled tasks in this process, including placing a  piece on a platform, visually inspecting the robot\u2019s work, cleaning and  setting up the robot\u2019s work station, and confirming the correct program is  entered in the computer.", "Adaptability to changing daily work demands: Officials from selected  firms told us that due to advanced technology adoption, workers need to  change tasks depending on the day and circumstances. For example, at  a large appliance manufacturer some workers serve in different capacities  depending if the robots are functioning properly and depending on the  production needs of that day. On the day we visited the plant, several of  the robots were malfunctioning and workers were performing the robots\u2019  tasks.

Officials at the training center said that there  is a high demand in the area for maintenance  technicians. For example, they said that a  large automotive manufacturer in the area is  planning to hire 800 maintenance technicians  over the next 3 years, and that the firm is  worried about how it will fill these positions.  Officials at the training center also said that  some firms have such a high demand for  maintenance technicians that they hire high  school students who complete the training  program before they graduate high school.  The training center is piloting its adult training  program.

Officials at some firms told us that training current workers for more  technical positions was easier than finding workers with the appropriate  skills. For example, officials at one medium-sized door manufacturer said  they needed highly specialized engineers, but could not find any in the  region. As a result, this firm offered tuition reimbursement for workers  who were willing to go back to school to become engineers. They also  partnered with local community colleges to train students to become  future maintenance technicians. Officials at a large automotive  manufacturer said that due to increases in the firm\u2019s use of advanced  technologies, the plant has needed to hire more technicians.

For example,  Census\u2019 newly administered Annual Business Survey may provide  valuable information in the future about the adoption and use of advanced  technologies nationwide and the prevalence of resulting workforce  effects. However, comprehensive data on firms\u2019 adoption and use of  advanced technologies do not currently exist, which prevents federal  agencies and others from fully monitoring the spread of advanced  technologies throughout the economy and linking their use to changes in  employment levels or structural shifts in the tasks and skills associated  with jobs.", "Observations from our visits to selected firms illustrate the complex and  varied workforce effects that result from firms\u2019 adoption of advanced  technologies. In some circumstances, technology adoption will lead to  increases in different types of jobs and in other cases technology  adoption will lead to workforce reductions\u2014either over time or  immediately. Regardless of the firm-level workforce effects, worker roles  and responsibilities are likely to change as advanced technologies take  over tasks that workers previously performed. These changes could  positively affect some workers, but could also have negative  consequences for other workers, especially those who are unable to  adapt to changes. For example, workers whose previous work tasks are  automated and who are unable to perform new tasks required of them  may need to seek new employment. If these changes occur occupation- wide, across many firms, workers may need to re-train or seek new  employment in entirely different occupations or industries. To the extent  that these changes are concentrated among occupations susceptible to  automation, certain groups of workers (e.g., those with lower education  levels) may be disproportionately affected and may lack the opportunity to  develop skills needed to enter growing occupations. These workers will  be in greater need of programmatic or policy supports, and federal  workforce programs will need to be aligned with in-demand skills for the  changing economy.", "Without comprehensive data that can measure the magnitude and variety  of these firm-level changes, the workforce effects of the adoption of  advanced technologies will remain unclear, job seekers may not be fully  informed about their best future career prospects, and federally funded  programs to support workers may be misaligned with labor market  realities.

Because there was no  comprehensive data that link employment trends to technology adoption,  we used a study by Frey and Osborne to identify a group of occupations  susceptible to automation. We then analyzed whether the concentration  of these occupations in industries is correlated with growth in tech jobs or  employment declines in those industries, whether job displacements are  more common in these occupations than in others, the characteristics of  workers who hold jobs in these occupations, and the geographic  concentration of jobs in these occupations. We analyzed employment  data from the Census Bureau (Census) and the Bureau of Labor  Statistics (BLS); specifically, the American Community Survey (ACS), the  Current Population Survey\u2019s (CPS) Displaced Worker Supplement, and  the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey. For more  information, see detailed discussions of our data analyses in sections 1-3  below.", "Identifying occupations susceptible to automation: Using a model  that evaluates tasks within an occupation, Frey and Osborne estimate a  probability of automation for 702 occupations. They identify occupations  with a probability greater than 0.7 as being at high risk of automation. In  our analyses, we thus consider this collection of occupations as those  susceptible to automation. While there are different studies that attempt to  predict what occupations or jobs may be automated in the future, we use  the work by Frey and Osborne because it is widely cited and because its  results are structured to allow us to identify a broadly inclusive collection  of occupations susceptible to automation. The results of our analyses  could be affected by using other studies to the extent that they identify  different occupations as susceptible to automation. The accuracy of any  collection of occupations is limited by the unpredictability of when or if  jobs are automated, as well as the fact that occupations are comprised of  a variety of jobs, which may experience automation to varying degrees or  in different ways.", "We also reviewed examples of recent and ongoing studies that attempt to  measure workforce effects directly attributable to technology adoption.

BLS\u2019s projections are for the most part structured  around the Occupational Employment Statistics, which produces  employment and wage estimates for over 800 occupations. As part of  this program, BLS develops a table of occupations that are projected  to have direct employment changes due to some identified reason.  According to BLS officials, the specific reason listed for each  occupation is based on BLS\u2019s judgment of the most significant factor  or factors affecting the occupation (i.e., based on a qualitative  assessment). We examined the reasons listed in this table and  identified those related to the adoption of advanced technologies in an  occupation, such as through automation, the increased use of robots  or artificial intelligence, advances in machine or software  technologies, or other similar changes. We then counted the number  of unique occupations projected to experience declines in their shares  of employment in an industry or group of industries due to one of  these reasons. We also counted these occupations according to their  major occupation group. BLS projected that some of these  occupations would experience employment share declines in all  industries and some would experience employment share declines in  a single industry only. We counted unique occupations regardless of  what industries or how many were noted (e.g., all industries or only  one). We chose to do this to capture an inclusive list of occupations  projected to be affected by advanced technologies, and because we  are not using the list to quantify total projected employment changes.  Of the 247 unique occupations BLS includes in its table as projected  to have direct employment changes due to some identified reason,  BLS projects that 163 will experience employment share declines\u2014 100 of those occupations are projected to change broadly as a result  of the adoption of advanced technologies.

Specifically, we estimated wage  differences between workers in occupations susceptible to automation  and workers in other occupations\u2014i.e., whether a worker was in an  occupation susceptible to automation (as identified by Frey and Osborne)  was our primary independent variable (a binary, yes/no variable).  Because we used the natural log of the hourly wage as the dependent  variable, the standard interpretation of the regression coefficient of this  variable is that it represents the average log point difference in hourly  wages between occupations susceptible to automation and all other  occupations. This coefficient can be made to more closely approximate a  percentage difference in hourly wages or an earnings gap by taking the  exponent and subtracting 1. As noted previously, we limited our analysis  to workers who earned positive wage and salary income in the prior 12  months. We also removed observations with outlier values for wages  (e.g., wage rates above $140 per hour); this represented about 1 percent  of the sample in 2016.", "We ran five regression models with different sets of independent variable  controls.", "Regression (1) estimates the earnings gap without any controls (the  uncorrected earnings gap).", "Regression (2) estimates the earnings gap with a set of independent  variables that control for characteristics of the individual; these  variables included age, race and ethnicity, gender, marital status,  state of residence, and education level.", "Regression (3) estimates the earnings gap with independent dummy  variables for 2-digit industry codes added; this corrects for any  differences between industries at the 2-digit level.", "Regression (4) estimates the earnings gap with independent dummy  variables for 2-digit occupation codes added; this corrects for any  differences between occupations at the 2-digit level.", "Regression (5) includes both 2-digit industry and 2-digit occupation  code dummy variables.", "As table 4 shows, we found a significant difference in hourly wages  between workers in occupations susceptible to automation compared to  workers in other occupations, even after independent variables to control  for worker characteristics, industry, and occupation codes were included.  Including the additional independent variables caused the earnings gap to  fall from just over -34 percent to just over -10 percent. Regression model  3, which estimated an earnings gap of about -17.2 percent, is our  preferred model, as it controls for individual worker characteristics and for  any differences between industries at the 2- digit level, but does not  include occupation as an independent variable. Including occupation  variables controls for any differences between occupations at the 2- digit  level. However, because we identify workers in jobs susceptible to  automation based on their occupations, these occupation control  variables are likely highly predictive of Frey and Osborne\u2019s estimated  probability of automation, which is used to categorize workers in jobs  susceptible to automation.

We focused on these reasons for displacement as those that  most closely approximate how advanced technologies could replace  workers at a given firm. We also limited our analysis to those workers  who did not expect to be recalled to their jobs within the next 6 months.  We categorized these displaced workers according to the occupations  from which they were displaced (e.g., workers displaced from occupations  susceptible to automation and workers displaced from all other  occupations).", "We calculated relative job displacement rates as the number of  displacements over the period 2013-2015 reported by a given population  (e.g., workers in occupations susceptible to automation), over that  population\u2019s total current employment in January 2016.

To  categorize occupations, Frey and Osborne and BLS use Standard  Occupational Classification (SOC) codes, whereas the Displaced Worker  Supplement uses Census occupation codes. We used a crosswalk  provided by Census to match these occupation classifications. SOC  codes have a hierarchical structure\u2014e.g., a \u201cbroad\u201d occupation group  contains a subset of \u201cdetailed\u201d occupations. For example, SOC code 13- 1031 is the detailed occupation \u201cclaims adjusters, examiners, and  investigators\u201d within the broad group SOC 13-1030 (\u201cclaims adjusters,  appraisers, examiners, and investigators\u201d). When a direct crosswalk  between SOC and Census occupation codes was not available at the  detailed level, we used the associated broad SOC group to identify a  Census occupation code.

The alternative hypothesis is that the area  location quotient is greater than 1.1.

However, because ensuring  confidentiality is a primary concern, we assume that most of these cases  where data are suppressed would have relatively small numbers of jobs,  and thus have minimal effects on our results. To test this assumption and  to ensure the appropriateness of our methods, we compared the total  number of jobs we analyzed across all local geographic areas to the total  number of jobs reported at the national level (which do not have data  suppressed). The total number of jobs analyzed across our local  geographic areas was 5.5 percent lower than the total number of jobs  reported at the national level, which we concluded was within an  acceptable threshold to determine that the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes and our analysis.
