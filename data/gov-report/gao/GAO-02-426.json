Several cases of illicit trafficking in nuclear material in Germany and the Czech Republic in the early to mid-1990s underscored the proliferation threat. The United States responded to the threat by providing assistance to increase security at numerous nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union, particularly in Russia, in order to prevent weapons-usable nuclear material from being stolen. In addition, the United States has provided portal monitors (stationary equipment designed to detect radioactive materials carried by pedestrians or vehicles) and smaller, portable radiation detectors at border crossings in many countries of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe. The equipment, which is installed at car and truck crossings, railroad crossings, seaports, and airports, can serve two purposes: deterring smugglers from trafficking in nuclear material and detecting cases of actual nuclear smuggling.", "Radiation detection equipment can detect radioactive materials used in medicine and industry, patients who have recently had radiological treatment, commodities that are sources of naturally occurring radiation such as fertilizer, and\u2014of primary concern in terms of nonproliferation\u2014 nuclear material that could be used in a nuclear weapon. Nuclear material includes radioactive source materials--such as natural uranium, low enriched uranium used as fuel in commercial nuclear power reactors, and plutonium and highly enriched uranium--that are key components of nuclear weapons. The capability of the equipment to detect nuclear material depends on a number of factors including the amount of material, the size of the detection device, and whether the material is shielded from detection. For example, a small amount of material shielded by a lead container would likely escape detection while a large amount of material with no shielding would be more likely to cause an alarm. Detecting actual cases of illicit trafficking in weapons-usable nuclear material is complicated because one of the materials that is of greatest concern in terms of proliferation\u2014highly enriched uranium\u2014is among the most difficult materials to detect due to its relatively low level of radioactivity. In contrast, medical and industrial radioactive sources, which could be used in a radiological dispersion device or \u201cdirty bomb,\u201d are highly radioactive and therefore easier to detect. Because of the complexity of detecting nuclear material, the customs officers or border guards who are responsible for operating the equipment must also be trained in how to use handheld radiation detectors to pinpoint the source of an alarm, identify false alarms, and respond to cases of illicit nuclear smuggling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Has Spent about $86 Million to Help Countries Combat Nuclear Smuggling", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 1992 through 2001, six federal agencies received $140 million and spent $86.1 million to combat the threat of nuclear smuggling in about 30 countries, including all of the countries of the former Soviet Union and numerous countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

Whereas the Second Line of Defense program focuses on the nuclear material needed to manufacture a nuclear bomb, the IECP focuses on the other high-technology components needed for a bomb such as equipment for enriching uranium. The program provides assistance to prevent legitimate enterprises, such as businesses that were affiliated with the Soviet Union\u2019s nuclear weapons complex, from intentionally or unintentionally engaging in illicit trade in such goods and technologies. DOE also spent $1.8 million to support State and DOD programs to combat nuclear smuggling.", "The State Department has received the largest amount of funding through the end of fiscal year 2001 for assistance to combat nuclear smuggling in about 30 countries, mostly in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe.  State spent $11.4 million primarily through two programs\u2014the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund and the Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance program. Through the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund, State spent $8.5 million from fiscal year 1994 through 2001 to, among other things, install portal monitors in countries other than Russia. In addition, State provided handheld radiation detectors, dosimeters (to measure levels of radiation), and mobile vans equipped with x-ray machines and radiation detectors that can be driven among a number of border crossings. From fiscal year 1998 through 2001, State\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance program spent $2.7 million to, among other things, purchase three vans equipped with radiation detectors for Russia and another van for Poland. State\u2019s Georgia Border Security and Law Enforcement program (implemented by Customs) also spent $0.2 million to provide radiation detection equipment as part of its assistance to strengthen Georgia\u2019s overall border infrastructure and security against any type of crime, including nuclear material smuggling.

Customs officials attributed the carryover to not receiving funds from State until late in the fiscal year and not obtaining agreements from the recipient countries under which the assistance would be provided.

For example, the new office provided funding to Customs to station 22 in-country advisors, covering 25 countries, that are responsible for coordinating the assistance for all of the six agencies within a country. DOD and DOE officials said that the advisors play an important role in implementing their programs. In addition, the new office has assumed responsibility for much of the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund assistance related to nuclear smuggling. For instance, the office has taken over responsibility for providing and maintaining radiation detection equipment to countries other than Russia.", "Despite these coordination efforts, no one agency is in charge of the overall U.S. effort to provide assistance to combat nuclear smuggling; consequently, the agencies have implemented their programs without always coordinating their efforts through the interagency group. For example, DOD installed portal monitors at three sites in one country of the former Soviet Union before the State official who chairs the interagency group learned of the project.  According to a DOD official, the project was coordinated with other State Department officials.  Similarly, although State provides its radiation detection assistance through DOE, the DOE office that works with State is completely separate from the Second Line of Defense program, and a Second Line of Defense official said that his program and the other office do not communicate with each other. According to the official, a few years ago the two offices were discussing the possibility of merging, but the discussions ended after a new director took over the other office even though Second Line of Defense officials still believe that the two offices should be merged. Even within the State Department, different offices implement their programs without full coordination. For example, the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund approved a project to install portal monitors in a country after agreeing that the Office of Export Control Cooperation and Sanctions would take over State\u2019s radiation detection assistance, and a separate office at State has oversight over the Georgia Border Security and Law Enforcement program even though one of the objectives of the program is to strengthen Georgia\u2019s ability to interdict nuclear smuggling. Finally, even though it funds much of the assistance provided by other agencies, State could not provide accurate information on the other agencies\u2019 program expenditures during the course of our review. For example, State\u2019s records did not match Customs\u2019 financial data on expenditures of funds provided to Customs by State. State officials said that they have now developed a financial database to track how the other agencies have spent State\u2019s funds.", "In addition, DOE, DOD, and State do not share the same views on the appropriate role of each agency. For example, while State sees itself as the agency that is leading the coordination effort and setting policy, a DOD official said that State does not have the necessary expertise or resources to manage the overall U.S. effort. In contrast, DOE officials said that State should have a lead role in coordination and diplomatic support for the assistance programs and that DOE would depend on State to establish the diplomatic basis that would allow the Second Line of Defense program to expand into other countries. However, DOE officials questioned whether State and DOD are the appropriate agencies for installing portal monitors in countries other than Russia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ineffective Coordination Has Resulted in Some Border Crossings Being More Vulnerable to Nuclear Smuggling Than Others", "paragraphs": ["As a result of ineffective coordination, DOE, DOD, and State have installed portal monitors that have different levels of capability to detect weapons-usable nuclear material, leaving some border crossings more vulnerable to nuclear material smuggling than others. While DOE and DOD have installed more sophisticated portal monitors at border sites in Russia and another country, State has installed less sophisticated portal monitors in other countries. In addition, in the mid-1990s, the DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction program provided less sophisticated portal monitors to another country in the former Soviet Union.", "The more sophisticated portal monitors detect two types of radiation\u2014 gamma and neutron\u2014whereas the portal monitors installed by State and the DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction program detect only gamma radiation. The ability to detect neutron radiation translates into a greater ability to detect weapons-usable plutonium, one of the materials of greatest concern in terms of nonproliferation. In addition, according to DOE officials, due to their configuration and sensitivity the State Department portal monitors are less likely to detect small quantities of highly enriched uranium, the other material that is of greatest nonproliferation concern, or material that is shielded, for example by a lead container or certain parts of a vehicle. DOE\u2019s office that installs the portal monitors on behalf of State acknowledged that the less sophisticated portal monitors have a limited capability to detect weapons-usable nuclear material and said that the portal monitors serve mostly as a deterrent to smuggling.  In addition, DOE and DOD have taken different approaches even though the two agencies have installed the same Russian-manufactured portal monitors. For example, DOE officials said that the Second Line of Defense program has calibrated the monitors in Russia to detect a smaller quantity of material than the monitors installed by DOD in another country.  In contrast, a DOD official said that DOE\u2019s approach runs the risk of a high rate of false alarms, which can lead to complacency among officials in charge of responding to alarms.", "State Department officials with the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund said that they used less sophisticated portal monitors because of their lower cost and the difficulty many countries would have in maintaining sophisticated equipment. For example, some countries lack even the basic infrastructure to operate and maintain portal monitors, such as a source of electricity.  Because of the different circumstances existing in each country, State officials said that radiation detection assistance should be tailored to each country\u2019s needs.  The Director of State\u2019s Office of Export Control Cooperation and Sanctions said that State is reevaluating its approach to providing radiation detection equipment, including installing better equipment where appropriate.  Second Line of Defense officials expressed concern about using less sophisticated portal monitors at border crossings on potential smuggling routes leading to countries seeking nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, Second Line of Defense officials said that because of the differences in the portal monitors, DOE would replace State\u2019s portal monitors with more sophisticated equipment if the Second Line of Defense program expands into another country and perhaps use the old portal monitors at lower-priority sites. Overall, Second Line of Defense officials said that the U.S. government assistance to provide radiation detection equipment is diffuse and lacks a single, coherent approach and that the portal monitors should meet a minimum standard for detecting weapons-usable nuclear material.", "The three agencies have also pursued different approaches to providing handheld radiation detection equipment. With support from DOD and State, the U.S. Customs Service has provided customs and border officials with radiation pagers.  In contrast, DOE\u2019s Second Line of Defense program provides larger handheld detectors but not radiation pagers, and DOE officials said that they view the pagers as personal safety devices that are ineffective at detecting weapons-usable nuclear material.

Nevertheless, they told us that the vans could only be operated about 9 months each year and that even when operational, they are very fuel inefficient.

To date, the efforts of the six U.S. agencies participating in these programs and activities have not been well coordinated, and there is no single agency that leads the effort to effectively establish funding priorities and thoroughly assess recipient country requirements.  Coordination is also a problem within agencies providing assistance. We question why, for example, there are two offices within the Department of Energy that are providing radiation detection equipment and two offices within the Department of State that have funded similar types of equipment for various countries. To ensure the efficient and effective delivery of assistance and the timely and effective expenditure of program funds, we believe that the development of a governmentwide plan is needed. Such a plan could identify a unified set of program goals and priorities and define agency roles and responsibilities; determine program cost estimates; establish time frames for effectively spending program funds; develop strategies to maintain and sustain the operation of equipment; and develop exit strategies for each country receiving assistance, including a plan for transferring responsibility for equipment maintenance to the countries.", "We are also concerned about how U.S. equipment is being used by the recipient countries. While foreign officials told us that U.S.-provided equipment had improved their ability to detect radioactive material, some equipment has not been well maintained, adequately accounted for, or installed on a timely basis. A fundamental issue surrounding nuclear smuggling is the sharing of information about incidents that occur in each country. Currently, the agencies that are providing the equipment have limited access to this type of information. There is currently no systematic effort to obtain this data, and the United States depends on the willingness of the countries to voluntary provide information. It is difficult to assess the impact and effectiveness of the U.S.- supplied equipment unless data are routinely obtained and analyzed.

From fiscal year 1997 through 2001, DOE spent $11.2 million on the Second Line of Defense program, including $2.7 million provided by the State Department, to install 70 portal monitors at eight border crossings in Russia and provide 20 handheld radiation detectors. The eight border crossings include an airport in Moscow, six seaports and one railroad crossing. The eight border crossings are the first of close to 60 sites that DOE has included in the Second Line of Defense program based on a study in which DOE evaluated the need for radiation detection equipment at over 300 border crossings in Russia. DOE prioritized the border crossings based on factors that might increase the risk that potential smugglers would use those border crossings to smuggle nuclear material out of Russia. For example, the study placed a higher priority on border crossings that are close to Russian facilities that store weapons-usable nuclear material or to potential markets for smuggled nuclear material. DOE began work at two additional border crossings in Russia in fiscal year 2001 and 17 additional border crossings in fiscal year 2002. DOE expects that it will complete 12 of the sites in fiscal year 2002.", "DOE officials said that they have taken a number of steps to ensure that radiation detection equipment is operated and maintained and that Russia is using the equipment for the intended purpose. First, DOE uses equipment manufactured in Russia by a Russian contractor in order to facilitate equipment installation and maintenance. Then, after the Russian contractor installs the systems, DOE tests the equipment at the border crossings to ensure that the portal monitors are placed in an optimal configuration and calibrated correctly and that they are installed as agreed. For example, DOE conducted testing in October 2000 and found that some portal monitors were not configured optimally or calibrated correctly and that some pedestrian and vehicle crossings did not have radiation detection equipment. DOE officials said that they withheld final payment for installation until the contractor submitted evidence showing that any problems had been resolved.", "According to DOE officials, the Russian government is strongly committed to the Second Line of Defense program and has provided DOE with good access to the border crossings where equipment is being installed. For example, in October 2000, Russian officials allowed DOE to participate in a search of a truck that set off an alarm at one of the portal monitors provided by DOE. (The search revealed that the truck was transporting fertilizer, which can cause a false alarm.) In addition, DOE estimated that Russia spent $300,000 to install 14 pedestrian portal monitors at another terminal of the airport in Moscow.", "DOE budgeted $10 million for the Second Line of Defense program and spent $8.5 million from fiscal year 1997 through 2001, and the program received $12 million in fiscal year 2002 appropriations.

The assistance provided under this program falls into three general categories: export licensing, industry awareness and compliance, and border enforcement. The export licensing assistance helps establish the regulations and procedures for issuing licenses to enterprises that allow them to export their goods and technologies. For example, DOE is providing Ukraine and Kazakhstan with computerized export control licensing systems that are specific to nuclear goods. Industry awareness and compliance consists primarily of workshops for enterprises that need training in understanding the export control system and complying with export control laws and regulations. DOE officials estimate that about 1,000 or so enterprises in Russia, most of which are spin-offs of the nuclear weapons complex, need such training. Border enforcement assistance consists of equipment and training to help customs officials stationed at border crossings recognize nuclear-related good and technologies that require an export license before they can be exported from the country.", "Table 3 shows a breakdown of International Export Control Program expenditures by country and source of funding.
