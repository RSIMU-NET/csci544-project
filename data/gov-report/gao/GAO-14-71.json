This report (1) discusses trends in funded positions at reservecomponent headquarters and (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD has established and implemented processes to efficiently size its reservecomponent headquarters. To do so, GAO reviewed statutes and DOD guidance, analyzed personnel data and headquarters assessments, and interviewed DOD and state officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 2009 and 2013, the total number of funded positions--both full-time support and part-time--at the Department of Defense's (DOD) 75 Army Reserve and Air Force Reserve (Reserves) component headquarters grew from about 30,200 to 31,900 positions (about 6 percent overall). Some organizations grew more markedly, among them the National Guard Bureau (17 percent); Army National Guard Directorate (44 percent); Air National Guard Readiness Center (21 percent); and the Office of the Chief of the Army Reserve (45 percent). DOD officials attribute growth to the conversion of contractor workload into civilian positions and increased missions assigned at certain headquarters. Over the same period, staff levels at the National Guard's 54 state Joint Force headquarters remained flat and the Air Force Reserve shrank by 4 percent.", "DOD has processes in place that are intended to ensure that the number of funded positions at its reserve-component headquarters are set at the minimum level needed to accomplish their mission, but it has not consistently followed those processes at 68 of the 75 headquarters that GAO reviewed. As a result, DOD is unable to determine whether National Guard and Reserve headquarters are sized to be efficient. The National Guard has begun evaluating some personnel requirements, but its efforts do not fully address the management issues GAO identified:", "The National Guard Bureau, which may continue to grow to accommodate its Chief's placement on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is determining its own requirements without external validation. This is inconsistent with Joint Staff, Army, and Air Force processes, which generally involve an external review. In addition, Congress's ability to oversee the bureau's size is limited because DOD's annual report on its Major DOD Headquarters Activities does not include data on the bureau and its more than 600 staff.", "The National Guard has not fully assessed its 54 state headquarters--which contain nearly 21,900 funded positions--since the 1980s. GAO's prior work shows that agencies can reduce costs by consolidating and centralizing functions and eliminating unneeded duplication. The National Guard Bureau, Army National Guard Directorate, and Air National Guard Readiness Center each assess a portion of the state headquarters, but there is no process to assess the headquarters' personnel requirements in their entirety and ongoing efforts do not provide a holistic review.", "The Army and Air Force have not fully reassessed 13 of the 20 reserve component headquarters for which they are responsible. The Army has a reassessment backlog, and the Air Force does not require periodic reassessments and reassesses its headquarters on an ad hoc basis. Some headquarters with significant growth are among those that have not been reassessed, including the Office of the Chief of the Army Reserve and the Air National Guard Readiness Center. In contrast, 5 of the 7 reassessed organizations subsequently reduced their staff levels such as the Air Force Reserve's three numbered air forces, which have shrunk by more than a third since 2009. The Army and Air Force agree their headquarters should be reassessed, but they have not scheduled reassessments across their reserve components."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD externally validate the National Guard Bureau\u0092s personnel requirements and include the bureau in its annual report to Congress; reassess requirements for the 54 state Joint Force headquarters; and develop schedules for reassessing headquarters overseen by the Army and Air Force.

In early  2013, the Secretary of Defense announced the Strategic Choices and  Management Review, which builds on prior efforts and is intended to  assess the potential effect of further reductions, shape the budget, and  provide the foundation for the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. In July  2013, the Secretary of Defense announced plans to reduce the budgets  and personnel of some major headquarters by 20 percent over a 5-year  period. However, the DOD-led efforts to date have not focused on  reserve-component organizations. The Army and Air Force each have  two reserve components\u2014a National Guard and Reserve\u2014and each has  numerous headquarters organizations that manage and oversee  subordinate units, or perform administrative or overhead functions.", "We have issued several reports recently on defense headquarters and on  the department\u2019s ability to determine the right size and mix of personnel it  needs to perform various functions. For example, in May 2013 we found  that authorized military and civilian positions at the geographic combatant  commands\u2014excluding U.S. Central Command\u2014increased by about 50  percent from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2012. We also  determined that DOD\u2019s process for sizing its geographic combatant  commands exhibits several weaknesses, including the absence of a  comprehensive, periodic review of the size and structure of these  commands and inconsistent use of personnel-management systems to  identify and track assigned personnel. DOD concurred with our  recommendation that it improve its visibility over its headquarters  personnel, but did not concur with our recommendation that it conduct  comprehensive and periodic reviews of the geographic combatant  commands\u2019 size. In another May 2013 report, to improve DOD\u2019s  understanding and management of its total workforce, we recommended  that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness to revise DOD\u2019s policies and procedures for  determining the appropriate workforce mix and the identification of critical  functions. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation stating that it  justifies its workforce size on the basis of workload, rather than  competency or skill gaps. In 2012, we found that DOD\u2019s reporting to  support congressional oversight of its Major DOD Headquarters Activities  did not include all major headquarters. In 2010 and 2011, we reported  that DOD had experienced challenges in determining the number of  funded positions for certain Army and Air Force headquarters due to flaws  with developing, maintaining, and implementing their manpower  processes.

Also at your request, appendix II  provides information on DOD\u2019s efforts to study the potential merger of  reserve-component headquarters.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed data on funded positions for  military and civilian personnel at the Army\u2019s and Air Force\u2019s reserve- component headquarters for fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013.  We selected these years because Army officials stated that the Army  Reserve component headquarters structure has remained relatively  constant since 2009. We did not review contractor positions as part of this  review because officials from three of the four components told us that  they were unable to determine the number of contractor positions at the  reserve-component headquarters we identified. To identify component  headquarters, we reviewed DOD and military-service guidance;  organization charts; and interviewed Office of the Secretary of Defense,  National Guard, Army Reserve, and Air Force Reserve officials. We  focused our review on Army or Air Force reserve-component  headquarters that are (1) nondeployable and (2) perform many of the  management headquarters functions identified by DOD in its major  headquarters instruction. We then provided DOD, Joint Staff, National  Guard, and Reserve officials with an opportunity to comment on our final  list of 75 headquarters and these officials agreed the headquarters we  identified met these criteria, while noting that they were not all designated  as Major DOD Headquarters Activities. To identify trends in funded  positions for the Army, we analyzed funded positions as documented on  the Army\u2019s personnel requirements documents referred to as tables of  distribution and allowance. For the Air Force, we analyzed funded  positions documented on its headquarters\u2019 unit manpower documents. To  evaluate DOD\u2019s processes for determining headquarters personnel  requirements and provide information to Congress, we reviewed DOD  and military-service guidance, DOD reports, and manpower assessments  for reserve-component headquarters between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal  year 2013.

National  Guard Bureau officials determined that on average each Joint staff  element would need 30 personnel to perform core functions during the  first phase of the study, which was completed January 2012. However,  National Guard officials noted that the ultimate size and structure of the  joint staff element will vary by state and should correlate with the state\u2019s  assigned missions and personnel. The second phase of the study is  intended to develop a joint manpower document that would document the  state headquarters\u2019 ultimate size and structure. National Guard Bureau  officials expect to complete this phase by fiscal year 2015.", "Second, in addition to the National Guard Bureau\u2019s study, Army National  Guard Directorate officials said that the absence of a holistic assessment  of the state Joint Force headquarters contributed to their completing  assessments of 17 functions, some of which are performed at these  headquarters and are staffed with both Army National Guard and Air  National Guard personnel. Army National Guard officials identified five  offices within the Adjutant General\u2019s personal staff that typically have both  Army National Guard and Air National Guard personnel: the Chaplain\u2019s  Office, the Human Resources Office, the Office of the Judge Advocate  General, the Public Affairs Office, and the Office of the Inspector General.  Army National Guard officials said they are not required to collaborate  with the Air National Guard when determining personnel requirements for  these functions\u2014although individual analysts may choose to do so at  their discretion\u2014and assessments only examine Army personnel  requirements. Army National Guard officials also said that a recently  completed study of the Chaplain\u2019s office and an ongoing study of the  Human Resources office had minimal collaboration with the Air National  Guard. Further, Army National Guard officials noted that even if the Air  National Guard were to be more heavily involved in the Army National  Guard\u2019s studies, there is not a process in place to estimate the workload  for functions that have both Air National Guard and Army National Guard  personnel.", "Three different organizations are responsible for assessing personnel  requirements at the state Joint Force headquarters, and there is no  process in place that provides a holistic assessment. As a result, the state  Joint Force headquarters may be missing opportunities to consolidate or  centralize overlapping functions and services and may be allowing  personnel gaps or overlaps to develop or persist. For example, our review  of the personnel requirements documents for the 54 state Joint Force  headquarters shows that a number of similar positions are approved for  both the Army staff element and the Air staff element within the same  state. In one state\u2019s Joint Force headquarters, the Army staff element  allocated positions for five Judge Advocate Generals, two Public Affairs  officials, and one Chaplain, while the Air Staff element allocated positions  for two Judge Advocate Generals, one Public Affairs official, and two  Chaplains. In a second state Joint Force headquarters, we found that the  Army staff element allocated positions for three Judge Advocate  Generals, three Public Affairs officials, and two Chaplains, while the Air  staff element allocated positions for one Judge Advocate General, two  Public Affairs officials, and one Chaplain. However, it is not clear whether  these positions are all justified because the National Guard Bureau has  not completed a holistic assessment of all the staff elements at these  headquarters.", "While the National Guard Bureau\u2019s and the Army National Guard\u2019s efforts  are important steps in determining personnel requirements at the state  Joint Force headquarters, they are limited because the National Guard  has not established a process for holistically assessing all three elements  at these headquarters. Further, the Army National Guard and Air National  Guard are not required to collaborate when determining personnel  requirements, do not use a formal process to estimate workload for joint  functions in their entirety, and do not have a means for ensuring these  functions are staffed to be efficient. As a result, these studies are unlikely  to ensure that the state Joint Force headquarters avoid gaps or overlaps  in positions and have the minimum personnel required to perform their  assigned missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army and Air Force Have Not Consistently Implemented Processes for Reassessing Personnel Requirements of Reserve- Component Headquarters", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Air Force have not consistently implemented processes for  ensuring their reserve-component headquarters have the minimum  number of personnel, thereby hindering their ability to determine whether  these headquarters have been sized to be efficient.

Army officials said that the manpower  analysis agency has prioritized its review and approval of personnel  requirements reassessments and worked with the Army Reserve to  establish a schedule through fiscal year 2016 for reassessing some  headquarters; however, we found that several of the headquarters  included in our review that had not recently been reassessed were not  included in this schedule. Once the U.S. Army Manpower Analysis  Agency validates an assessment, it is submitted to the Office of the Army  Operations and Plans for approval.

Specifically, the guidance only requires  headquarters embedded in its operational wings be reassessed at least  every 2 years. In contrast, reassessments for the Air Force\u2019s reserve- component headquarters are done on an ad hoc basis. In 2011 and 2012,  the Air Force Reserve reassessed five of its headquarters as part of its  efforts to streamline its operations, not due to any requirement in  guidance. Following this reassessment, the Air Force Reserve shrank  the three numbered Air Force headquarters by more than one-third, and  Headquarters, Air Force Reserve, by more than 10 percent. Another  headquarters that was reassessed, the Air Force Reserve Command,  grew in size by about 7 percent. According to Air Force officials, changes  in headquarters personnel requirements are typically driven by changes  in force structure, made in response to efficiency initiatives, or initiated by  the headquarters\u2019 commanding officer. Air Force officials said that it  would be beneficial to apply a reassessment standard to all of the Air  Force\u2019s reserve-component headquarters, but the Air Force has not taken  steps to initiate such reviews or revise the guidance to require them in the  future.

Human-capital  practices suggest that the size and structure of organizations need to be  reassessed periodically. In total, 68 of 75 the reserve-component  headquarters we reviewed have not been recently reassessed. Until  these organizations are assessed, the Army and Air Force will lack  assurance that they are sized and structured appropriately.

The department further stated  that when shared functions are being studied, coordination should be  increased between the staff elements to ensure that the correct workload  is captured, requirements are not duplicated, and process efficiencies are  maximized. However, we found minimal coordination on studies  examining the five functions that the National Guard identified as being  staffed with both Army National Guard and Air National Guard personnel.  For example, Army National Guard officials told us that a study of the  Chaplain\u2019s office was completed with minimal Air National Guard  participation and only captures the Army National Guard\u2019s personnel  requirements.

We  limited our review to nondeployable headquarters that perform many of  the functions DOD identified as being characteristics of management  headquarters. For the Army, these headquarters had their personnel  requirements documented on tables of distribution and allowance, and we  collaborated with Army National Guard and Army Reserve officials when  developing our list. For the Air Force, we interviewed Air National Guard  and Air Force Reserve officials to identify headquarters units that met our  criteria.

At that time, and again in May 2006, in our report on the  military\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina, we reported that the Reservists  who responded to the disaster\u2014all of whom were volunteers\u2014constituted  a relatively small portion of the response when compared to National  Guard and active component forces because, while states were able to  mobilize National Guard forces, no similar provisions existed to  specifically mobilize Reserve forces for disaster response.", "Since Hurricane Katrina, two key steps have been taken to address  DOD\u2019s response to domestic incidents: (1) implementation of a command  construct whereby a single military officer exercises authority over both  federal military forces and state National Guard forces; and (2)  implementation of new mobilization authorities.", "Dual-Status Commanders. The National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2012 provided that a dual-status commander\u2014military  officers with authority over both federal military forces and state  National Guard forces\u2014should be the usual and customary command  and control arrangement in situations when the armed forces and  National Guard are employed simultaneously in support of civil  authorities, including missions involving major disasters and  emergencies. When an officer is appointed as a dual-status  commander, he or she serves on federal active duty, sometimes  referred to as Title 10 status, as well as on duty in or with the National  Guard of a state, sometimes referred to as Title 32 status. Dual- status commanders exercise command on behalf of both the federal  and the state chains of command and serve as the link between these  two chains of command. According to DOD officials, dual-status  commanders are intended to provide unity of effort, ensuring  coordination of National Guard and federal military resources in  response to domestic emergencies, natural disasters, or designated  planned events. According to DOD officials, dual-status commanders  have been used for select planned events since 2004 and helped  coordinate response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, wildfires in  Colorado, and the bombing at the Boston Marathon in 2013.", "Mobilization Authorities. DOD officials said that following Hurricane  Katrina it was clear to them that the military needed to be empowered  to respond more quickly to disasters. Ultimately, Congress approved  new authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2012, one of which provided DOD with greater access to the  federal reserve during domestic incidents. Section 12304a of Title 10  of the United States Code states that when a Governor requests  federal assistance in responding to a major disaster or emergency the  Secretary of Defense may mobilize any individual or unit of the federal  reserves involuntarily for up to 120 days to respond to the Governor\u2019s  request. The military services were using interim implementation  guidance for these authorities at the time of our review and were  waiting for DOD to finalize its guidance in September 2013.  Additionally, DOD officials told us that Hurricane Sandy is the only  domestic disaster thus far to use the new mobilization authorities  under section 12304a. Since DOD is still developing its process for  implementing these new authorities and has had limited experience  using them it is too early to know whether they will better enable the  states to access federal capabilities when responding to domestic  disasters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Profile for the National Guard Bureau, Army National Guard Directorate, and Air National Guard Readiness Center", "paragraphs": ["Appendix III: Profile for the National Guard  Bureau, Army National Guard Directorate, and  Air National Guard Readiness Center In addition to having full-time civilian and Active Guard and Reserve personnel, the Army National  Guard Directorate has a group of personnel that are categorized as \u201cActive Duty for Operational  Support\u201d.
