More detailed data are needed, however, to delineate the extent and nature of nurse and nurse aide shortages to assist in planning and targeting corrective efforts. Better coordination of NHSC placements, with waivers for foreign U.S.-educated physicians, could help more needy areas.

For example, while hospitals traditionally were the primary providers of acute care, advances in technology, along with cost controls, have shifted much care from traditional inpatient settings to ambulatory or community-based settings, nursing facilities, and home health care settings. In addition, the transfer of less acute patients to nursing homes and community-based-care settings created a broader range of health care employment opportunities. These changes have led to concerns regarding the adequacy of the health care workforce. And while the adequacy of the health care workforce is an important issue nationwide, the distribution of available health professionals is a particularly acute issue in certain locations. These medically underserved areas, ranging from isolated rural areas to inner cities, have problems attracting and retaining health care professionals.", "My testimony will discuss (1) growing concerns about the adequacy of the health care workforce and emerging shortages in some fields, particularly among nurses and nurse aides, and (2) the lessons learned from the experience of one federal program\u2013the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) National Health Service Corps (NHSC)\u2013in addressing the maldistribution of health care professionals.

Direct provider costs of turnover include recruitment, selection, and training of new staff, overtime, and use of temporary agency staff to fill gaps. Indirect costs associated with turnover include an initial reduction in the efficiency of new staff and a decrease staff morale and group productivity. In nursing homes, for example, high turnover can disrupt the continuity of patient care\u2014that is, aides may lack experience and knowledge of individual residents or clients.

Our analysis of national wage and employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicates that, on average, nurse aides receive lower wages and have fewer benefits than workers generally. In 1999, the national average hourly wage for aides working in nursing homes was $8.29, compared to $9.22 for service workers and $15.29 for all workers. For aides working in home health care agencies, the average hourly wage was $8.67, and for aides working in hospitals, $8.94. Aides working in nursing homes and home health care are more than twice as likely as other workers to be receiving food stamps and Medicaid benefits, and they are much more likely to lack health insurance. One- fourth of aides in nursing homes and one-third of aides in home health care are uninsured compared to 16 percent of all workers. In addition, other studies have found that the physical demands of nurse aide work and other aspects of the environment contribute to retention problems.

The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) is one safety- net program that directly places primary care physicians and other health professionals in these medically needy areas. The NHSC offers scholarships and educational loan repayments for health care professionals who, in turn, agree to serve in communities that have a shortage of them. Since its establishment in 1970, the NHSC has placed thousands of physicians, nurse practitioners, dentists, and other health care providers in communities that report chronic shortages of health professionals. At the end of fiscal year 2000, the NHSC had 2,376 providers serving in shortage areas.

For example, it does not count nonphysicians providing primary care, such as nurse practitioners, and it does not count NHSC providers already practicing there. As a result, the current HPSA system tends to overstate the need for more providers, leading us to question the system\u2019s ability to assist HHS in identifying the universe of need and in prioritizing areas.", "Recognizing the flaws in the current system, HHS has been working on ways to improve the designation of HPSAs, but the problems have not yet been resolved. After studying the changes needed to improve the HPSA system for nearly a decade, HHS published a proposed rule in the Federal Register in September 1998. The proposed rule generated a large volume of comments and a high level of concern about its potential impact. In June 1999, HHS announced that it would conduct further analyses before proceeding. HHS continues to work on a revised shortage area designation methodology; however, as of July 2001, it did not have a firm date for publishing the proposed new regulations.", "The controversy surrounding proposed modifications to the HPSA designation system may be due, in large part, to its use by other programs. Originally, it was only used to identify an area as one that could request a provider from the NHSC. Today many federal and state programs\u2014 including efforts unaffiliated with HHS\u2014use the HPSA designation in considering program eligibility.

There are not enough providers to fill all of the vacancies approved for NHSC providers. As a result, underserved communities are frequently turning to another method of obtaining physicians\u2014attracting non-U.S. citizens who have just completed their graduate medical education in the United States. These physicians generally enter the United States under an exchange visitor program, and their visas, called J-1 visas, require them to leave the country when their medical training is done. However, the requirement to leave can be waived if a federal agency or state requests it. A waiver is usually accompanied by a requirement that the physician practice for a specified period in an underserved area. In fiscal year 1999, nearly 40 states requested such waivers. They are joined by several federal agencies\u2014particularly the Department of Agriculture, which wants physicians to practice in rural areas, and the Appalachian Regional Commission, which wants to fill physician needs in Appalachia.", "Waiver placements have become so numerous that they have outnumbered the placements of NHSC physicians. In September 1999, over 2,000 physicians had waivers and were practicing in or contracted to practice in underserved areas, compared with 1,356 NHSC physicians. In 1999, the number of waiver physicians was large enough to satisfy over one-fourth of the physicians needed to eliminate HPSA designations nationwide. Our follow-up work in 2001 with the federal agencies requesting the waivers and 10 states indicates that these waivers are still frequently used to attract physicians to underserved areas.", "Although coordinating NHSC placements and waiver placements has the obvious advantage of addressing the needs of as many underserved locations as possible, this coordination has not occurred. In fact, this sizeable domestic placement effort\u2014using waiver physicians to address medical underservice\u2014is rudderless. Even among those states and agencies using the waiver approach, no federal agency has responsibility for ensuring that placement efforts are coordinated. The Administration has recently stated that HHS will enhance coordination between the NHSC and the use of waiver physicians; however HHS does not have a system to take waiver physician placements into account in determining where to put NHSC physicians. While some informal coordination may occur, it remains a fragmented effort with no overall program accountability. As a result, some areas have ended up with more than enough physicians to remove their shortage designations, while needs in other areas have gone unfilled.", "As the Congress considers reauthorizing the NHSC, it also has the opportunity to address these issues. We believe that the prospects for coordination would be enhanced through congressional direction in two areas. The first is whether waivers should be included as part of an overall federal strategy for addressing underservice. This should include determining the size of the waiver program and establishing how it should be coordinated with other federal programs.

Of these latter locations, 143 had unsuccessfully requested a NHSC provider for 3 years or more. In response to our recommendations, the NHSC has subsequently made improvements in its procedures and has substantially cut the number of HPSAs not receiving providers. However, these procedures still allow some HPSAs to receive more than enough providers to remove their shortage designation while others go without.", "NHSC officials have said that in making placements, they need to weigh not only assisting as many shortage areas as possible, but also factors\u2014 such as referral networks, office space, and salary and benefit packages\u2014 that can affect the chance that a provider might stay beyond the period of obligated service. Since the practice sites on the NHSC vacancy list had to meet NHSC requirements, including requirements for referral networks and salary and benefits packages, such factors should not be an issue for those practice locations. And while we agree that retention is a laudable goal, the impact of the NHSC\u2019s current practice is unknown, since the NHSC does not routinely track how long NHSC providers are retained at their sites after completing their service obligations. The Congress may want to consider clarifying the extent to which the program should try to meet the minimum needs of as many shortage areas as possible, and the extent to which additional placements should be allowed in an effort to encourage provider retention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loan Repayment Is a Better Approach than Scholarships", "paragraphs": ["Another issue that is fundamental to attracting health care professionals to the NHSC is the allocation of funds between scholarships and educational loan repayments. Under the NHSC scholarship program, students are recruited before or during their health professions training\u2014generally several years before they begin their service obligation. By contrast, under the NHSC loan repayment program, providers are recruited at the time or after they complete their training. The scholarship program provides a set amount of aid per year while in school, while the loan repayment program repays a set amount of student debt for each year of service provided. Under the Public Health Service Act, at least 40 percent of the available funding must be for scholarships.", "We looked at which financing mechanism works better and found that, for several reasons, the loan repayment program is the better approach in most situations.", "The loan repayment program costs less. On average, each year of service by a physician under the scholarship program costs the federal government over $43,000 compared with less than $25,000 under loan repayment. A major reason for the difference is the time value of money. Because 7 or more years can elapse between the time that a physician receives a scholarship and the time that the physician begins to practice in an underserved area, the federal government is making an investment for a commitment for service in the future. In the loan repayment program, however, the federal government does not pay until after the service has begun. The difference in average cost per year of service could increase in the future as a result of a recent change in tax law.", "Loan repayment recipients are more likely to complete their service obligations. This is not surprising when one considers that scholarship recipients enter into their contracts up to 7 or more years before beginning their service obligation, during which time their professional interests and personal circumstances may change. Twelve percent of scholarship recipients between 1980 and 1999 breached their contract to serve,compared to about 3 percent of loan repayment recipients since that program began.", "Loan repayment recipients are more likely to continue practicing in the underserved community after completing their obligation. How long providers remain at their sites after fulfilling their obligation is not fully clear, because the NHSC does not have a long-term tracking system in place. However, we analyzed data for calendar years 1991 through 1993 and found that 48 percent of loan repayment recipients were still at the same site 1 year after fulfilling their obligation, compared to 27 percent for scholarship recipients. Again, this is not surprising. Because loan repayment recipients do not commit to service until after they have completed training, they are more likely to know what they want to do and where they want to live or practice at the time they make the commitment.", "These reasons support applying a higher percentage of NHSC funding to loan repayment. The Congress may want to consider eliminating the current requirement that scholarships receive at least 40 percent of the funding. Besides being generally more cost-effective, the loan repayment program allows the NHSC to respond more quickly to changing needs. If demand suddenly increases for a certain type of health professional, the NHSC can recruit graduates right away through loan repayments. By contrast, giving a scholarship means waiting for years for the person to graduate.", "This is not to say that scholarships should be eliminated. One reason to keep them is that they can potentially do a better job of putting people in sites with the greatest need because scholarship recipients have less latitude in where they can fulfill their service obligation. However, our work indicates that this advantage has not been realized in practice. For NHSC providers beginning practice in 1993-1994, we found no significant difference between scholarship and loan payment recipients in the priority that NHSC assigned to their service locations. This suggests that the scholarship program should be tightened so that it focuses on those areas with critical needs that cannot be met through loan repayment. In this regard, the Congress may want to consider reducing the number of sites that scholarship recipients can choose from, so that the focus of scholarships is clearly on the neediest sites. While placing greater restrictions on service locations could potentially reduce interest in the scholarship program, the program currently has more than six applicants for every scholarship\u2014suggesting that the interest level is high enough to allow for some tightening in the program\u2019s conditions.
