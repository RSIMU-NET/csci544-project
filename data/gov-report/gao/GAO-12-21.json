Paying for high-quality child care can be challenging for these families, so the Department of Defense (DOD) offsets costs by subsidizing on-installation child care centers and offering subsidies for approved off-installation care providers. Deployments related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan increased the demand for child care. The extent of military families\u0092 out-of-pocket child care costs for those using subsidized care are not known, and families may face barriers to obtaining DOD-subsidized care.

DOD establishes income-based fee ranges for on-installation child care, but each service sets its own fees and discounts within these parameters. As a result, in school year 2010 the per-child costs that families from the same income categories paid for on-installation care varied by service and installation. For example, the monthly per-child cost for a family with an income of $50,000 could have ranged from $335 to $518. Families\u0092 costs for off-installation child care through private providers are also affected by policy differences among the services. All services offer subsidies for off-installation care that are intended to make families\u0092 costs comparable to those for on-installation care. In an effort to offer benefits to more families, some services use a fixed cap to limit the subsidy amount. In school year 2010, the Air Force and Navy capped their subsidies at $200 per child per month, and families in these services had higher average monthly costs for off-installation care than Army and Marine Corps families, and also had higher costs than what they would have paid for on-installation care. For example, on average, Navy families using off-installation care paid $87 more per month than they would have paid for on-installation care, while Army families paid $63 less. Other factors, such as the number of children in care, also contributed to families\u0092 costs for off-installation care. DOD and the services\u0092 recent policy changes reduced differences among and within services in families\u0092 costs for on-installation care, and DOD plans to further reduce these differences in the next 3 to 5 years. While the effects of these policy changes on individual families\u0092 costs for off-installation care vary by family, families in services with fixed subsidy caps will likely continue to have higher average costs than families in services that do not.", "Military families face two main barriers to obtaining DOD-subsidized child care: lack of awareness and insufficient availability. According to DOD officials and based on GAO\u0092s group discussions, some families remain unaware of subsidized child care, particularly off-installation care, despite DOD\u0092s efforts to provide information at pre-deployment briefings, and through other outreach efforts. Families who are geographically isolated from an installation, such as reservists and recruiters, may be less likely to be aware of subsidized care. The individual services have taken steps to increase awareness of DOD-subsidized child care, such as establishing positions for professionals who educate families about child care options. However, even families who are informed about DOD-subsidized child care may face barriers obtaining it due to a lack of available space at on-installation centers and a scarcity of eligible child care providers off installation. The shortage of on-installation child care spaces resulted, in part, from heavy deployment demands, and DOD has responded by approving construction projects that it anticipates will provide over 21,000 new child care spaces using fiscal year 2008 through 2010 funding. DOD and the services have initiatives under way to increase the availability of eligible off-installation providers. In addition, DOD is developing an agencywide system that will provide servicemembers a central place to request both on-installation and off-installation child care. DOD plans to pilot the system in the spring of 2012 and intends to market it DOD-wide to servicemembers once it is fully implemented. The agency is in the process of contracting for the development of a marketing plan."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About a million members of the United States\u2019 armed servicesbalancing the demands of serving our country and raising a family, and  many need reliable, affordable child care. Deployments related to the  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased the demand for child care.  Paying for high-quality child care can be challenging, so the Department  of Defense (DOD) subsidizes some child care costs for military families.  Families using DOD-subsidized care may pay less than they would pay  for similar child care in the private market. Specifically, DOD subsidizes  the cost of operating Child Development Centers (CDC) that provide child  care on most military installations, allowing these centers to charge fees  that are the same or lower than similar privately operated centers off- installation. However, if on-installation care is unavailable, DOD provides  subsidies to reduce the fees that military families pay for care of  comparable quality in the community (off-installation care). For example,  such subsidies allow servicemembers geographically isolated from an  installation, including members of the National Guard and Reserves and  some active duty personnel such as recruiters or educators, to obtain  DOD-subsidized child care. Although DOD subsidizes a portion of military  families\u2019 child care costs, the extent of out-of-pocket costs are not known,  and families may face barriers obtaining DOD-subsidized care.   are  The Congress, interested in learning more about DOD\u2019s financial  assistance for child care, mandated in the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2010 that GAO report on a number of questions  related to this assistance. As agreed with your offices, we assessed out- of-pocket child care costs for military families and barriers associated with  obtaining subsidized child care. In April 2011 we briefed your committees  on our preliminary findings related to these questions, which are covered  more fully in this report:  1.  What are the out-of-pocket child care costs paid by military families  who use DOD-subsidized child care?  2.  What are the barriers, if any, to obtaining DOD-subsidized care, and  what has DOD done in response?", "To address our objectives, we reviewed the child care fee policies set by  DOD and the services for school years 2009-2010 (school year 2010) and  2010-2011 (school year 2011), including the ranges of allowable fees  charged to families for on-installation care. Some aspects of the services\u2019  fee policies, such as their methods of calculating subsidies for off- installation care, were not contained in written policies. We obtained this  information through interviews with DOD and service officials. We also  obtained data from the services on the actual fees charged per child  using on-installation care in school years 2010 and 2011. In addition, we  analyzed these costs for families using off-installation care for a random  probability sample of 338 families from all four services in school year  2010 based on family files maintained by the contractor that administers  DOD\u2019s off-installation child care subsidies, the National Association of  Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (NACCRRA). Because we  conducted our sample data collection in the spring of 2011, school year  2010 was the most recent school year for which data for a full school year  were available. This analysis allowed us to generalize our findings to all  families receiving DOD subsidies for off-installation child care in school  year 2010. In order to present data on costs for on-installation care that  covered the same time period as our off-installation care cost data, we  analyzed on-installation fee data for school year 2010. We also analyzed  changes to the on-installation fee ranges in school year 2011. We  conducted semi-structured discussion groups with military parents,  including parents who did and did not have their children enrolled in DOD- subsidized child care, during site visits to Joint Base Lewis-McChord,  Wash. (Army/Air Force), and Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, N.C., in  order to identify barriers to obtaining DOD-subsidized child care. The  information obtained during these visits is illustrative and not  representative of each service or of DOD programs as a whole. We  selected large installations that had a Guard and/or Reserve presence  and had significant deployment activity. We provided DOD with criteria  that they used to select parents for our structured discussion groups. We  reviewed relevant policies and guidance, studies, and surveys of military  parents, and interviewed child and youth program officials with DOD and  each of the four services, including officials at service headquarters and  installations.knowledgeable about DOD child care programs, and officials from  national organizations that represent military families.", "We also interviewed NACCRRA officials, researchers  We conducted this performance audit from June 2010 through February  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Today, DOD-subsidized child care is  widely considered to be a high-quality model for the nation. A recent DOD  report said that the Military Child Care Act of 1989, which created DOD\u2019s  current child care structure and was enacted in response to concerns at  the time about quality and availability of services, focused on assuring  high-quality services and expanding access through subsidies. DOD- subsidized care assists military families in balancing the competing  demands of family life, accomplishing the DOD mission, and improving  the financial health of military families. However, DOD-subsidized child  care is not guaranteed to all who need it, and the availability of such care  depends on demand and the services\u2019 budgetary resources. DOD\u2019s goal  is to meet 80 percent of the demand for child care. Table 1 shows the  primary DOD-subsidized child care programs that are available to families  in all four services, although a few other service-specific programs exist.  Most military families who receive child care assistance do so by using  CDCs or other forms of on-installation care.", "Several additional subsidized child care programs have been adopted DOD- wide, such as programs specifically for injured servicemembers\u2019 families,  and respiterather than regularly scheduled care. In addition, services offer several   and hourly care\u2014both of which are intended to offer sporadic,  service-specific subsidized child care programs. For example, Army Child  Care in Your Neighborhood, available only at specified installations, aims to  increase the availability of eligible community-based child care providers and  Air Force\u2019s Extended Duty Care offers child care during nontraditional hours  to support servicemembers working extended or additional shifts to support  the military mission. The services acknowledge that some families may also  use youth development programs\u2014programs outside of School Age Care,  such as recreation programs\u2014as child care, although these are not required  to meet the DOD\u2019s standards for child care and they are not intended to be  used as such.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) establishes eligibility criteria  for subsidized child care and provides oversight and guidance to the  services, which each administer their own child care programs. For example,  OSD defines the following groups as eligible for military child care programs:  active duty military personnel, DOD civilian personnel, reservists on active  duty or during inactive duty personnel training, and DOD contractors. fiscal year 2010, there were approximately 1 million servicemembers with 1.8  million children ages 13 and under, according to our analysis of data from the  Defense Manpower Data Center. According to DOD, its child care system  is serving about 200,000 children from birth to age 12, and NACCRRA  records indicate that in fiscal year 2010, about 25,000 of these children were  served in subsidized off-installation care. OSD specifies that first priority be  given to active duty military and DOD civilian personnel who are either single  parents or whose spouse is employed on a full-time basis outside the home  or is a military member on active duty. However, OSD officials told us that  they are in the process of revising this policy. The revision under  consideration broadens the range of those in first priority status, adding  surviving spouses of servicemembers deceased while on active duty, among  other groups.", "DOD Instruction 6060.2(4.3). Reservists include members of the Reserves and the  National Guard.", "OSD also sets standards for provider eligibility for DOD\u2019s off-installation  child care subsidies. DOD requires that providers under Military Child  Care in Your Neighborhood, intended for longer-term care periods, be  nationally accredited, to help ensure they are comparable in quality to  DOD\u2019s Child Development Programs, such as CDCs. According to DOD  officials, child care can be considered accredited under a number of  different national accreditation and state child care quality programs,  which help ensure that child care providers meet quality standards.  Operation Military Child Care is intended for families of deployed  servicemembers, and DOD requires that, at a minimum, providers be  licensed and inspected annually.", "OSD sets allowable ranges for the fees that families pay for on-installation  child care at CDCs, within which the services must set their fees. In contrast  to private providers, who generally set fees based on a child\u2019s age, OSD sets  fee ranges based on total family income. OSD sets two fee ranges\u2014one  for standard-cost areas, and one for high-cost areas, or areas with high  market rates for child care. Installations in high-cost areas must pay higher  salaries to retain qualified child care staff, and are allowed to charge higher  fees to help cover these additional personnel costs. The services have some  flexibility in how they set their fees for on-installation child care within the  ranges set by OSD. For on-installation care, a family\u2019s cost is the fee that the  service or installation sets minus any fee reductions, such as discounts for  multiple children in care. Other factors affect family-level costs, such as  family size and the number of hours that children are in care.", "The subsidies services offer providers for off-installation child care are  intended to provide benefits comparable to those that families would  receive for on-installation care. As with fees for on-installation care,  however, the services have the ability to determine the extent to which  they subsidize the cost of off-installation care. The services contract with  NACCRRA to administer these subsidies, which NACCRRA pays directly  to DOD-approved child care providers. A family\u2019s cost for off-installation  care is the portion of their provider\u2019s fee not covered by the subsidy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Families\u2019 Child Care Costs Are Largely Driven by Policies, Including Subsidy Caps, Which Vary by Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "For On-Installation Care, Services\u2019 Policies Resulted in Variations in Per-Child Costs", "paragraphs": ["As a result of services\u2019 policies, the per-child monthly cost of on- installation care at a CDC for families within the same income category  varied by as much as $230 in school year 2010, depending on their  service and installation (see fig. 1). However, the per-child monthly costs  for most families in the same income category varied within a smaller  range. For example, the per-child monthly cost for on-installation care for  a family with an annual income of $50,000 could have ranged from $335  to $518 in school year 2010; however, for families in this income category  at most military installations with CDCs, the per-child monthly cost was  within the OSD standard fee range of $335 and $413.", "The services have different policies for setting fees within the ranges set  by OSD. In school year 2010, the Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps all  allowed installation commanders to set fees for on-installation child care,  based on factors such as local market rates for child care. Most  installations set their fees within the OSD standard fee ranges.  Installations in high-cost areas, however, could set their fees using the  OSD high-cost fee range, or by increasing the standard fee by the  percentage of their cost-of-living allowance, which sometimes resulted in  fees that were above the OSD high-cost range. In contrast to the other  services, the Navy set one fee per income category for all of their  standard-cost installations and another fee per category for high-cost  installations. In addition, the services have the discretion, within DOD- prescribed policy, to set their own policies regarding the fee reductions  they offer to families, which generally apply only to on-installation care.  For example, services may offer fee reductions for families with multiple  children in care, families with a deployed servicemember, families with  injured servicemembers, and families experiencing financial hardship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "For Off-Installation Care, Families in Services with Fixed Subsidy Caps Had Higher Average Costs in School Year 2010 than Families in Other Services", "paragraphs": ["In school year 2010, families using off-installation care in the Air Force  and Navy, which capped the monthly amount of subsidy a family could  receive at $200 per child, had higher average monthly child care costs  than did families in the Army and Marine Corps, which did not have fixed  subsidy caps. Across all services, on average, military families paid  about $556 per month for DOD-subsidized off-installation care (see table  2). However, the average monthly costs for Air Force and Navy families  were $787 and $734, respectively, compared to $501 and $556,  respectively, for Army and Marine Corps families. In addition to fixed  subsidy caps, several other factors affected families\u2019 costs for off- installation care, including fee rates charged by private providers.", "Air Force and Navy families had higher average costs by other measures  as well. For instance, families in these services using off-installation care  paid more, on average, than the estimated amount they would have paid  for on-installation care (by 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively). In  addition, on average, Navy families\u2019 costs for off-installation care were 12  percent of their family income, while the average Army family\u2019s costs  were 8 percent of their family income. Air Force and Navy families also  paid a higher percentage of their private providers\u2019 fees (the fee before  being reduced by the subsidy), on average, than Army or Marine Corps  families.", "Families\u2019 costs for off-installation care are affected not only by subsidy  caps, but also by the fees services charge for on-installation care.  Generally, the subsidy amount is the fee charged by the private provider  minus the estimated amount that a family would have paid for on- installation care at a CDC. For example, if an off-installation provider  charges $1,000 per month, and a family would have paid $600 per month  on installation, the subsidy amount would be $400 (if there is no subsidy  cap), and the family would pay the same amount they would have paid on  installation: $600. However, in school year 2010, the Air Force and Navy  set subsidy caps, or limits, on the per-child subsidy for off-installation care  in order to offer benefits to more families. As a result, some families in  these services paid more for off-installation care than they would have  paid on installation. In the example above, if the family was in the Air  Force or Navy, which both had fixed subsidy caps of $200 per month in  school year 2010, the family would have paid $800 per month (the  provider rate of $1,000 minus the subsidy of $200), which is $200 more  than they would have paid on installation. The Army also used subsidy  caps in school year 2010. However, in contrast with the Air Force and  Navy, the Army\u2019s intention was that a family\u2019s subsidy would only be  capped if they used private providers who charged rates above what the  Army considered reasonable for high-quality care in their local market.  The Army caps varied from $153 to $2,576, depending on a number of  family factors, such as total family income. The vast majority of these  caps were above $200, and over half were above $500. Thus, Army  families were likely less affected by their service\u2019s caps than were Navy  and Air Force families, as suggested by the lower average costs of Army  families in our sample.", "In addition to fixed caps, other factors also affect families\u2019 costs for off- installation care, including minimum subsidies, family factors, and  provider rates. Three of the four services offered minimum subsidies in  school year 2010, which families received even if their off-installation  providers charged less than they would have paid on installation (see  table 3). Army officials said that they offered minimum subsidies to  encourage families living off installation to participate in DOD-subsidized  child care programs. Other factors that affect off-installation costs include  family income, which is a factor in the services\u2019 subsidy calculations,  and other family factors such as the number and ages of children in care  and the amount of time that they are in care, which may affect how much  a family pays in fees to a given provider. The fee rates charged by private  providers, which are influenced by child care supply and demand as well  as the geographic location of the local community, affect costs for some,  but not all families. In the absence of subsidy caps, provider rates do not  affect costs, since the family\u2019s subsidy covers the full difference between  their provider rate and estimated on-base fee. For families in services  with subsidy caps, however, the subsidy may not cover the full difference,  in which case families with higher provider rates will have higher costs.", "Recent and planned changes to OSD and the Army\u2019s fee policies will  continue to reduce variation in the amount families in the same income  category pay for on-installation care. In school year 2011, OSD revised  the fee ranges for the first time since school year 2005 to account for  inflation and increases in servicemembers\u2019 incomes and to achieve a  more equitable distribution of fees for military families. Specifically, OSD  divided the top income category into four categories, increased the  maximum income for each category, and increased both the minimum  and maximum fees for all categories except Category I (see table 4).  Under the new fee structure, OSD set a single fee per income category  for high-cost installations, which all high-cost installations are now  required to charge.", "The impact of these revisions on military families\u2019 costs for on-installation  care varied depending on families\u2019 service, installation, and income. In  general, however, the new OSD fee policy reduced the variation in the  per-child monthly cost for families in the same income category using on- installation care among and within services. For example, while in school  year 2010 the per-child monthly cost for on-installation care for a family  with an annual income of $50,000 could have varied from $335 to $518  (see fig. 1), in school year 2011 the per-child monthly cost for families  with the same income could have varied from $358 to $478 (see app. II,  fig. 4 for the full range of fees charged by the services in school year  2011). Costs for families with this income at most installations were within  the OSD standard fee range of $395 to $456 (see table 4).", "OSD officials said that they are working with the services to transition in  the next 3 to 5 years toward a DOD-wide fee policy like the one currently  used by the Navy, with one fee per income category for standard-cost  installations, and another fee per category for high-cost installations.  According to these officials, the new fee policy implemented in school  year 2011 is the first step in this transition.", "OSD\u2019s changes to its fee policy and additional changes the services have  made to fee policies for off-installation care affect costs for some families  using off-installation care, but the extent of these effects is largely  unknown. The new OSD fee ranges affect costs for families using off- installation care, as well as on-installation care, since the on-installation  fee rates are used to calculate subsidies for off-installation care. In  addition, all of the services have recently made changes to their off- installation fee policies that make these policies more consistent in some,  but not all, respects. See table 5 for a summary of these changes.  Subsidy minimums are one area where the services\u2019 subsidy policies for  off-installation care are not consistent, since Navy and Air Force families  receive a minimum of $10 per child per month, all Marine Corps families  eligible for full-time care receive $250 per child per month, and Army  families no longer receive a minimum subsidy. Given that the average  costs for families in our sample in services with $200 subsidy caps were  higher than those for other families, the average costs of Marine Corps  families using off-installation care are likely to rise with the  implementation of the Marine Corps\u2019 $250 subsidy cap. Some Marine  Corps families, however, will see a decrease in their costs if they  previously received a subsidy of less than $250 per child per month. In  general, the effects of these subsidy policy changes will vary by family. In  particular, the effects will vary for families in services with subsidy caps,  because costs for these families are driven partly by private provider fees,  which vary considerably regardless of the services\u2019 policies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Awareness of DOD-Subsidized Child Care Programs and Availability of Care Pose Barriers for Military Families", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Even with Outreach Initiatives, DOD Faces Challenges Educating Military Families about Child Care Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD provides information about subsidized child care programs  through a number of sources, DOD officials and military parents cited  limited awareness of these programs as a key barrier to their use. DOD  uses many outreach methods, such as deployment briefings and other  events, brochures and ads, e-mails to servicemembers, staff assigned to  provide child care information, and Internet avenues, including websites  and social media. Figure 2 shows common sources of DOD child care  information.", "DOD officials stated that while military families living on or near an  installation likely know about child care available through CDCs and  Family Child Care, they may not know about other on-installation child  care programs, such as respite care. Furthermore, both those living on or  near an installation and those living far from an installation may not know  about off-installation programs. For example, many servicemembers we  spoke with did not know about DOD-subsidized off-installation child care.  In addition, those who knew about the DOD-subsidized off-installation  programs had not always learned about them when they needed child  care. For example, two servicemembers we spoke with said that they had  learned about off-installation programs, but only through the community- based provider they were using without benefit of DOD subsidies. One of  these servicemembers said that he had used a community-based  provider for a number of months before the provider told him about the  DOD subsidy program, and this was only when he notified the provider  that he no longer planned to use its services because he could not afford  the child care fees charged. Also, families that learn about DOD- subsidized off-installation child care programs may not be aware of the  eligibility requirements of the programs. For example, officials at the  National Military Families Association told us that many military families  that heard about DOD off-installation subsidized child care believed that  the programs are needs-based, and thus assumed that they were not  eligible for them because their income was too high, even though the  programs are not limited to low-income families. Similarly, two military  spouses we spoke with incorrectly assumed that only those with low  incomes were eligible for such subsidies.", "DOD faces a number of challenges to educating military families about  DOD-subsidized child care, particularly off-installation care. These  challenges include the large quantity of information servicemembers  receive during briefings, the timing of information provided, fewer  opportunities off installation to educate servicemembers about DOD- subsidized programs for those geographically isolated from an  installation, and fragmented child care application procedures. DOD and  the services have taken a number of steps to address these challenges.", "Quantity of information received. DOD officials and an organization  representing military families told us that information on DOD- subsidized child care programs is frequently provided at pre- deployment or other briefings, but because these briefings are often  lengthy and cover multiple topics, servicemembers often do not retain  information about child care. In 2007, we reported that DOD had a  similar concern regarding briefings provided at mobilization sites and  demobilization sites, which DOD considers to be primary educational  tools. DOD officials said then that these briefings are often so full of  critical information that it is difficult for reservists to absorb all of the  details of its health care insurance program. In fact, several  servicemembers we met with noted that they tune out or become  overwhelmed by long briefings and therefore do not retain much of the  information, such as on child care.", "DOD officials recognize this concern and said that they try to ensure  that military families learn about DOD-subsidized child care by  providing them with many opportunities, beyond briefings, to learn  about these programs. For example, because DOD considers  command unit leadership to be key to ensuring readiness, including  supporting spouses and families, DOD has taken steps to help units  provide child care information to their servicemembers and families  through unit contacts. Officials from all four services told us that they  provide information on these programs to these contacts, including  the unit commander and other unit staff designated to provide this  type of information to families. Two services\u2014the Army and Marine  Corps\u2014created professional positions within military units that are  responsible for supporting family readiness by providing assistance to  families, such as child care information. These positions also support  formal volunteer organizations tasked with communicating information  and providing education and support to military families. Although  the Air Force and Navy have not designated such professionals within  units, they have family services professionals outside of units who are  assigned to serve servicemembers in units. For example, the Air  Force has community readiness consultants and family child care  coordinators assigned to serve specific units and provide the same  type of support to families as do Army and Marine Corps unit-based  professionals. Both Air Force and Navy also support similar volunteer  organizations and efforts, such as Navy\u2019s Family Ombudsman  Program. Many servicemembers we spoke with stated that these  family readiness professionals and volunteer organizations are helpful  in learning about DOD-subsidized child care programs, while others  noted that the level of assistance varies.", "Each of the four services has taken additional steps to increase  outreach for these programs. For example, the Marine Corps  prepared a fact sheet on DOD-subsidized off-installation child care  programs, which includes answers to frequently asked questions  including updated information on program policy changes. The Navy  hired an outreach coordinator for installation and community-based  child care programs. Also, the Army and Marine Corps provided  resource and referral staff a \u201cscript\u201d to ensure that staff members  provide consistent, specific information on DOD-subsidized off- installation child care programs. The Air Force developed a marketing  strategy including materials such as pamphlets and an  implementation guide for program staff, intended to provide  information on family child care programs to servicemembers.", "Timing of information provided. Officials from DOD and groups  representing military families told us that information on DOD- subsidized child care is more likely to be absorbed if it is provided  when military families need it. Some servicemembers we spoke with  mentioned that they ignored information on DOD-subsidized child  care programs when they did not need child care, but were interested  in such information when they later needed this service, such as when  they became parents and had to return to work. One servicemember  said briefings targeted to parents-to-be or those with children of  similar ages would help overcome the problem of not getting  information at the right time. For example, without targeted briefings  about child care, not all parents-to-be learn about the need for getting  on waiting lists for on-installation care. On one installation we visited,  not all of the military mothers we spoke with had been advised that  they needed to get on the CDC waiting list, which was about 9  months, as soon as they learned they were pregnant. Those who  were not alerted said that they had to take leave to care for their  infants until they could find child care.", "Services recognize the need for targeted information on child care  and have implemented education programs, such as those for  expectant and new military parents, and mandatory physical training  for postpartum servicemembers, both of which offer the opportunity to  educate participants about the need to get on CDC wait lists. Services  target child care information to military families in other ways, as well.  For example, the Air Force offers a sponsorship program aimed at  facilitating permanent change of station moves. Under this program,  Air Force servicemembers trained as sponsors welcome and assist  colleagues and their families who are new to an installation by  providing information on local services, which can include information  on DOD-subsidized child care options. One Air Force servicemember  we spoke with had a sponsor that had helped her find housing and  child care when she moved to a new installation. Other examples  include the Navy and Air Force\u2019s new programs to market DOD- subsidized child care programs to military families, such as to  reservists who have children and have recently deployed.", "Fewer opportunities off installation to educate servicemembers.  DOD estimates that two-thirds of those stationed in the United States  do not live on an installation and many of these families live long  distances from an installation. However, because DOD child care  programs have traditionally been focused on installations, more  information about DOD-subsidized child care, including daily exposure  to sources of child care information, is available to those living on or  near an installation. For example, installation outreach can include a  walk-in information and referral center and ongoing child care  publicity, such as on marquees on the installation promoting child care  programs. Also, military families that are geographically isolated from  installations are likely isolated from military peers that DOD officials  and several parents we spoke with cited as a source of child care  information. As a result, families of servicemembers who do not live or  work on an installation, such as recruiters and Guard and Reserve  members, may be less aware of DOD-subsidized child care programs,  including those that become available when they deploy. For  example, results from a 2010 Army Guard survey showed that many  Army Guard members were unaware of DOD-subsidized child care,  while most military families living on or near an installation are likely  knowledgeable about the availability of on-installation care.", "Limited exposure to on-installation information about DOD-subsidized  child care may affect Guard and Reserve families to a greater extent  than active duty families that live remote from an installation. These  military families may often identify with the civilian, rather than the  military world, and thus may be less likely to look to the military as a  source of support. One reservist told us that reservists generally  assume that if they do not live near a military installation, military  services will not be available. Thus, many reservists might not even  think to ask about DOD-subsidized child care when they are activated.", "DOD and NACCRRA have both taken steps to address the need to  provide more opportunities to educate servicemembers about DOD- subsidized off-installation child care. DOD implemented the Joint  Family Support Assistance Program to supplement and coordinate  family services provided by the services, including child care, target  military families geographically dispersed from a military installation,  and collaborate with community organizations to enhance the  availability of high-quality family services. The services have also  taken such steps. For example, the Air Force implemented an Air  Force Reserve web page on the Family Members programs, which  includes information on child care available to reservists. Marine  Corps officials stated that in light of the subsidy cap they implemented  in school year 2011 that will make subsidies available to more Marine  Corps families, they have taken additional steps to contact reservists  to educate them about off-installation program information, including  program changes and how to obtain access to programs. In addition  to hiring an outreach coordinator for installation and community-based  child care programs, the Navy is developing marketing and  communication strategies and webinar training specific to the Navy  Reserves in order to better educate reservists about DOD-subsidized  child care programs. The Army makes phone calls to families of  deployed reservists to ask what services they need, including child  care, and provides information and contacts for DOD-offered services.  Also, because Reserve and Guard members may turn to civilian  sources of assistance, NACCRRA officials stated that they asked their  members to inform those who identify themselves as military families  about DOD off-installation child care subsidy programs.", "In addition to learning about DOD-subsidized child care, obtaining  information about applying for this care has also been a challenge  families face, because servicemembers must apply for on-installation  child care at different places than for off-installation child care. Also, for  off-installation programs there are a number of eligibility requirements for  the military family and standards for the community-based provider that  differ depending upon the program. Generally, in order to apply for on- installation child care, including CDCs and Family Child Care, parents  must contact the on-installation child care resource and referral office.  However, if on-installation care programs have waiting lists and the family  needs child care immediately, they must contact another entity, generally  NACCRRA, if they choose to pursue DOD-subsidized off-installation care.  For the most part, this process is separate from the installation\u2019s resource  and referral office and the installation generally does not follow up on  each family\u2019s success in finding off-installation care. Although NACCRRA  assists families in finding an eligible community-based provider, if  available, and applying for DOD-subsidized care, some servicemembers\u2019  spouses and Guard officials found applying for the programs difficult. For  example, several servicemembers\u2019 spouses stated that the website did  not provide clear steps on how to apply for DOD-subsidized child care.  Further, several regional Guard officials stated that applying for off- installation DOD-subsidized child care is complex because requirements  vary among programs, making it difficult to determine the programs for  which a military family may be eligible. Also, they noted that providers that  meet DOD\u2019s requirements, which vary by program, are often not  available, especially for programs with more stringent standards and in  areas far from military installations. Additionally, several military parents  we spoke with said that because there is no one place to find child care  options available to them, particularly for off-installation child care, they  had to research these options themselves in order to find alternatives to  on-installation care.", "DOD is developing a central system intended to enable eligible military  families worldwide, regardless of their service branch, to request military  Child and Youth Program services that meet individual child and family  needs. DOD officials told us that the system is aimed at helping educate  military families about DOD-subsidized child care by identifying programs  the family is eligible for based on information they enter into the system.  Such a system may help alleviate the problem of unclear information on  how to apply for programs and difficulties determining eligibility. DOD  intends to market the system DOD-wide to servicemembers once it is fully  implemented. The agency is in the process of contracting for the  development of a marketing plan which will include assessing marketing  needs and a strategy to market the system to users, in coordination with  the services, among other things. DOD plans to pilot the system in the  spring of 2012, and to begin full implementation of the system in the late  summer or fall of 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Availability of On- Installation Care Is Limited but Increasing, and Eligible Off-Installation Providers Are Scarce", "paragraphs": ["In response to limited availability of on-installation child care and eligible  off-installation providers, DOD and the services are increasing capacity at  on-installation facilities and in the community as part of their commitment  to family readiness. According to DOD officials, the increased demand,  due to high deployments and increased operational tempo, puts pressure  on the services, the Army and Marine Corps in particular. DOD officials  stated that CDC waiting lists are common and DOD officials told us that  Family Child Care home capacity is not increasing. As a result, many  military families may not be able to obtain on-installation care when they  need it. This is particularly an issue for families with children under the  age of 3, especially infants. To meet this demand, DOD is increasing on- installation child care capacity by constructing new CDCs that it expects  will result in meeting 80 percent of the estimated demand for military child  care by 2012. DOD anticipates that construction projects approved in  fiscal years 2008 through 2010 will add over 21,000 additional child care  spaces.", "Military families that cannot obtain on-installation care due to wait lists  and those that are geographically isolated from an installation may be  eligible for DOD-subsidized off-installation care, but community-based  providers who meet DOD\u2019s quality standards are in short supply. Figure 3  shows the circumstances under which servicemembers may be eligible  for DOD-subsidized off-installation care.", "Providers under Operation Military Child Care must be, at a minimum,  licensed and annually inspected by their states, but according to  NACCRRA not all states have requirements to regularly inspect licensed  child care providers. Standards for providers under Military Child Care in  Your Neighborhood are even more stringent. Under this program DOD  requires eligible providers to be nationally accredited, but relatively few  child care providers in the United States are accredited. According to a  NACCRRA review,and 1 percent of family child care homes in the United States were  nationally accredited. Additionally, the percent of child care centers with  national accreditation varied from 2 to 47 percent among states.   in 2008 only about 10 percent of child care centers  DOD is taking steps to increase the number of community-based  providers eligible for DOD subsidies. In the near term, Army Child Care in  Your Neighborhood and Army School-Age Programs in Your  Neighborhood subsidize nonaccredited providers who are participating in  an Army quality improvement program. To help increase providers  participating in these and other off-installation programs the Army  established a full-time position to coordinate and manage community- based child care at selected installations, such as Joint Base Lewis- McChord in Washington. In addition, DOD is making more community- based providers available to military families who qualify for Military Child  Care in Your Neighborhood by allowing the services to waive the  accreditation requirement if it is determined that no accredited provider is  available to the applicant. Further, according to NACCRRA it obtained  agreements from all but three states to inspect licensed providers  annually on a case-by-case basis so that military parents using these  providers can receive subsidized care. Even with these efforts, DOD  officials told us that some military families potentially eligible for DOD- subsidized child care assistance, including many who pay for child care,  do not use subsidized care because they are not willing to switch to an  eligible provider, or because they have no providers nearby who meet  DOD\u2019s standards. In the long term, DOD is piloting a 13-state initiative  working with other federal agencies and state officials to increase the  quality of child care programs by improving state-level child care  oversight and licensing practices. The pilot\u2019s intended purpose is to  increase the number of providers who meet DOD quality standards. DOD  selected these states, in part, because they have large military  populations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The flexibility DOD has given the services to set their own child care fee  policies, including subsidy caps for off-installation care, allows the  services to adjust fees and subsidy amounts to meet their budgetary  needs and respond to local cost-of-living variations. However, this  flexibility has also contributed to differences in the out-of-pocket costs  paid by families with similar incomes, both among and within services.  DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce its on-installation fee ranges for families with  similar incomes and its plan to require all services to charge one fee per  income category in a few years may help provide increased financial  consistency for families moving among installations. It is difficult to  determine the degree to which policy changes, such as those related to  subsidy caps, will affect costs for off-installation care for individual  families, because these costs are driven to some extent by private  provider fees, which vary considerably regardless of the services\u2019  policies. However, it is likely that families in the three services with  subsidy caps will, on average, have higher costs than families in the  Army, which does not. Thus, DOD and the services face a policy trade-off  in determining the extent to which they will shoulder child care costs for  military families who cannot obtain on-installation care. For instance,  differences among the services in families\u2019 costs for off-installation care  could be minimized if all services offered subsidies that made up the full  difference between a family\u2019s private provider rate and what they would  have paid for on-installation care, with no subsidy caps. However, such a  policy change would require increased spending on child care for most of  the services, likely requiring them to divert budgetary resources from  other family programs to provide these higher subsidy amounts. In  addition, eliminating the caps could require greater oversight from the  services to ensure that providers did not raise their fee rates in response  to subsidy increases. On the other hand, some services use subsidy caps  to avoid having to limit the number of families who can benefit from  subsidies for off-installation care, so that all eligible families can have at  least some of their child care costs covered. As DOD and the services  move forward with their new fee policies, balancing these competing  priorities will be critical to supporting military families as they serve their  country, while also using resources carefully in an austere fiscal  environment.", "DOD has taken some important steps to make military families aware of  DOD-subsidized child care programs, particularly off-installation  subsidies, and to make eligible child care available. Additional steps that  DOD is taking, such as waiving accreditation requirements and piloting a  13-state initiative designed to help states increase the quality of private  providers are important in helping families living off installation obtain  safe, reliable child care. As DOD increases the number of eligible child  care providers for off-installation programs and moves toward centralizing  access to DOD-subsidized child care programs through its planned  agencywide system for requesting both on- and off-installation care,  outreach will need to keep pace, with particular attention to families who  live off installation. DOD anticipates that its proposed marketing plan will  help better ensure that servicemembers are aware of this system once it  is fully implemented. Such a plan also provides an opportunity for  services to identify and share communication strategies with the most  potential. How well DOD executes both its marketing plan and  communication strategies will be crucial to ensuring that all families learn  about DOD-subsidized child care, including families that are  geographically isolated from installations and have few opportunities to  benefit from ongoing contact with installation resources, such as walk-in  information centers, on-installation child care publicity, and contact with  other military families who could tell them about military child care  options.

DOD provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix IV of  this report, and technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. In its comments, DOD said that, in general, the report  correctly addresses the issues of providing fee assistance to military  members and assisting with access to child care. DOD also provided  clarification about the following issues: variations in on-installation child  care costs, fee caps, changes in policies to reduce out-of pocket costs,  and family support assistance. DOD also suggested caution in drawing  conclusions based on our random sample.", "Regarding variations in per-child, on-installation child care costs, DOD  stated that in practice the fee variations are smaller than those we  reported due to the limited number of programs utilizing the high-cost fee  option. We believe that the report is very specific about not only the actual  fee ranges but also the percentage of installations that are charging these  fees. As stated in the report, we found that 64 percent of military  installations with CDCs charged fees within OSD\u2019s standard fee range in  school year 2010, which means that over a third of the installations  charged fees within OSD\u2019s high-cost range. The high-cost exceptions to  this were a few installations\u2014a total of six and, again, specifically noted in  the report\u2014that had very high cost-of-living allowances and charged fees  that were above OSD\u2019s high-cost range. We recognize that in school year  2011 the number of military installations with CDCs that charged fees  within OSD\u2019s high-cost range declined to about 11 percent and we noted  this in our final report in response to DOD\u2019s comment.", "DOD commented that eliminating the caps that three of the services have  placed on off-installation care fee assistance may not require increased  spending on child care for those services. DOD provided an Army  analysis that concludes that the average amount of child care fee  assistance the Army paid per child in recent fiscal years was less than the  capped rate currently paid by the other services. However, the Army\u2019s  analysis does not take into consideration the effect of removing subsidy  caps for those services that have such caps. Based on our analysis, over  60 percent of Air Force and Navy families receiving subsidies for off- installation care were affected by these services\u2019 subsidy caps in school  year 2010. Thus, if the Air Force and Navy were to eliminate their subsidy  caps, they would incur paying higher subsidy amounts to over 60 percent  of families using this type of care, which would increase their total  spending on child care.", "DOD stated that in addition to the recent and planned changes to DOD  and the Army\u2019s fee policies that will likely reduce the differences among  the services, the Air Force also implemented fee policy changes reducing  out-of-pocket expenses for families. The Air Force change eliminates  additional fees if a child is in care more than 10 hours per day. However,  our analysis of the child care fees charged by the services did not include  any additional fees they may have charged beyond the base fees for  regularly scheduled care, such as fees for care beyond 10 hours per day.  Thus, eliminating those additional fees would not change the fee  differences among the services that we include in this report.", "DOD also commented that in regard to the family support assistance  provided by professional positions, it believes that the Air Force and Navy  provide the same level of service as the Army and Marine Corps, but in a  different manner. We did not assess the level of family support assistance  provided by each service. Instead, we reported the various ways these  services provide such assistance through professionals within and  outside the units and through the services\u2019 support of volunteer  organizations.

However, since this database does not include the information needed to  calculate families\u2019 out-of-pocket costs, we collected our data variables  from the information contained in paper files NACCRRA maintains for  each family.

In selecting our sample, we  stratified families by service (Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy)  and either Active Duty or National Guard and Reserves (combined group)  component. No prior data existed on the out-of-pocket child care costs of  military families receiving subsidies that would allow us to calculate the  variance in these costs, which we needed to determine our sample size.  Thus, we collected a presample of 157 files (at least 36 from each  service), calculated the out-of-pocket costs for those families, and then  calculated the variance in costs for each service.

We also analyzed  changes to the on-installation fee ranges in school year 2011. DOD and  three of the four services provided data on weekly fees, while the fourth  service (Army) provided monthly fees. We converted DOD and the other  services\u2019 weekly fees to monthly fees using the same calculation used by  the Army to obtain monthly fees. Specifically, we multiplied the weekly  fees by 365/7 (the number of weeks in a year) to get the yearly fee  amount, and then divided by 12 to obtain the monthly fee amount. This  calculation assumes a 365-day year, as well as an equal number of days  in each month. Since months vary slightly in length, the monthly amount  paid by families in services that charge fees on a weekly basis will also  vary slightly. In addition, all Army installations allow families 2 weeks of  vacation per year, during which they do not pay child care fees if their  children are not in care.
