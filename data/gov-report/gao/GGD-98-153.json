Regulatory capital requirements are one tool financial regulators use to help protect customers from losses and ensure the stability of financial markets. In addition to serving these general regulatory purposes, capital requirements can affect the way the financial system functions by influencing how market participants allocate capital resources and conduct business.", "Capital requirements can also have competitive effects within the financial services industry, to the extent that capital requirements differ among competing financial institutions and firms. Today, regulators in all sectors have either adopted or are considering changes in capital requirements that compared to earlier approaches, more quickly and precisely respond to changes that occur in a firm\u2019s actual risk profile. In addition, some regulators are considering more fundamental changes that would simplify capital regulation. Changes in capital regulation are being undertaken or considered in a highly dynamic financial services industry that is itself undergoing change in response to competitive pressures as well as advances in telecommunications, computer technology, and financial analysis\u2014all of which have led to new and innovative financial products and services.

As discussed in chapter 3 of this report, these financial firms use capital to manage the trade-off between risks and returns in order to increase the firms\u2019 efficiency and maximize the returns for stockholders. The capital that a financial firm holds serves a number of firm-specific purposes\u2014chiefly to provide long-term funding of operations and to protect the firm by serving as a cushion to absorb unexpected losses.", "For public purposes, regulators of banks, securities broker-dealers, FCMs, and life insurance companies promulgate capital regulations that set mandatory minimum levels for capital that the firms are to hold as a cushion against unexpected losses. The specific public purposes differ somewhat among the regulators. Generally speaking, however, the financial regulators seek to protect customers of the financial firms from losses and help ensure the stability of financial markets and systems that they regulate. Chapter 2 of this report discusses the capital standards set for banks, securities broker-dealers, FCMs, and life insurance companies and the more specific purposes of each of the financial regulators in setting regulatory capital requirements.", "Traditionally, banks, securities broker-dealers and FCMs, and life insurance companies were engaged in mostly different businesses and faced different risks. After the stock market crash of 1929, Congress created a regulatory and industry structure that separated banking, investment banking, and other financial institutions. Banks were restricted to taking deposits, making loans, and other activities closely related to banking.", "Broker-dealers (the SEC-regulated portion of investment banks) were restricted to brokering securities, underwriting new security issues, and trading securities. Insurance companies continued to be regulated by the states, and their activities were limited to insurance sales and underwriting. As discussed later in this chapter, significant changes have occurred in the financial services industry within the past two decades. As a result, firms that were in traditionally separate sectors are more directly competing with one another; providing similar products; and, hence, facing similar risks in their activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Capital Is the Source of Funding That Cushions a Firm Against Losses That Arise From Risks", "paragraphs": ["Capital is most generally defined as the long-term source of funding for a firm that earns a return for investors (debt and equity) and cushions the firm against losses. Such funding is contributed largely by (1) equity stockholders in anticipation of profits and (2) the firm\u2019s own returns in the form of retained earnings. In some instances, long-term debt is also considered capital.", "Losses cushioned by capital arise from risks that firms face in their business activities. In our work, we found no definitive list of risk categories applicable to all firms covered in our review. For example, the Federal Reserve uses a list of six risk categories, and OCC delineates nine. A group of leading individuals from firms and regulators developed what they termed Generally Accepted Risk Principles (GARP), which lists six risk categories. Most of the financial firms we spoke with told us they use four categories of risk; some said they use as few as three. The listings of risks we reviewed covered much the same causes of possible loss, but they varied in how risks were grouped and in the nomenclature used. This report generally focuses on the following six categories, because regulators and the representatives of financial firms we interviewed identified them as the risks of greatest concern.", "Credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation. Credit risk may arise from either an inability or unwillingness to perform as required by a loan, a bond, an interest rate swap, or any other financial contract. All financial firms face credit risk. For example, banks face credit risks in loans and bonds, insurance companies face credit risks in corporate and municipal bonds, and securities broker-dealers and FCMs face credit risks if other firms that they deal with do not meet their contractual obligations.", "Market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the increase or decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices, such as interest rates, commodity prices, stock prices, or the relative value of currencies (foreign exchange). Because all financial firms hold assets, all financial firms face market risks. However, they may not all face all types of market risks.", "Liquidity Risk is the potential for financial losses due to the inability of a firm to meet its obligations on time because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, such as might occur if most depositors or other creditors were to withdraw their funds from a firm. This is referred to as \u201cfunding liquidity risk.\u201d Liquidity risk also refers to the potential that a firm cannot easily reverse negative financial positions or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (\u201cmarket liquidity risk\u201d). Financial firms face liquidity risk inasmuch as the loss of revenues due to interruptions of cash inflows affects a firm\u2019s ability to cover its liabilities as they come due.", "Operational Risk is the potential for unexpected financial losses due to inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, or fraud. Operational risk is associated with problems of accurately processing or settling transactions and taking or making deliveries on trades in exchange for cash, and with breakdowns in controls and risk limits. Individual operating problems are considered small-probability but potentially high-cost events for well-run firms. Operational risk includes many risks that are not easily quantified but control of which is crucial to the firm\u2019s successful operation. Operational risk can be addressed through prudent management oversight of firm operations, including the establishment of internal controls. All firms face some type of operational risk.", "Business/event risk is the potential for financial losses due to events not covered above, such as credit rating downgrades (which affect a firm\u2019s access to funding); breaches of law or regulation (which may result in heavy penalties or other costs); or factors beyond the control of the firm, such as major shocks in the firm\u2019s markets. Included in business/event risk is a shift in legal status or changes in regulations. All types of financial firms face business/event risk. Insurance/actuarial risk is the risk of financial losses that an insurance underwriter takes on in exchange for premiums, such as the risk of premature death. Although this risk is most commonly associated with insurance companies, it can exist in other firms. For example, banks are authorized to underwrite credit life insurance, which is subject to actuarial risk.", "These risks can be discussed on a risk-by-risk basis, but the potential effect on a firm\u2019s overall financial condition or risk profile cannot be obtained by summing the risks in each category, because risks interact in various ways. That is, the net potential loss from a combination of risks could be greater or less than the sum of potential losses from each individual risk, depending upon the economic relationship among the risks involved. The economic relationship among a firm\u2019s risks depends on the correlation among prices of assets\u2014that is, how the prices move in relation to one another\u2014and the business strategies and holdings of the firm.", "Because the traditional activities of banks, securities broker-dealers, FCMs, and life insurers differed, each of these types of financial firms once tended to have a correspondingly distinct type of risk profile. The predominant risk for banks was credit risk, for securities broker-dealers and FCMs it was market risk, and for life insurance companies it was insurance/actuarial risk. However, for a variety of reasons discussed later in this chapter, the activities and risks of large, diversified financial firms in the highly competitive financial services industry are becoming increasingly similar."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Various Agencies Are Responsible for Regulating the Capital of Banks, Securities Broker-Dealers, FCMs, and Life Insurers", "paragraphs": ["The scope of authority and oversight practices of financial regulatory agencies vary in a number of ways. The activities of banks, bank holding companies, securities broker-dealers, FCMs, and life insurance companies are regulated and overseen by a number of different types of agencies and organizations. Bank holding companies are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), and banks are regulated on an individual institution basis by various federal and state agencies. Securities broker-dealers and FCMs are regulated by SEC and CFTC, respectively. State agencies and self-regulatory organizations (SRO) are also involved in supervising broker-dealers and FCMs. Life insurance companies are regulated and overseen by state regulatory agencies.

In this report, we often refer to these holding company structures as large, diversified firms.", "The dominant form of banking structure in the United States is the holding company. A number of the larger bank holding companies have established nonbank subsidiaries that engage in securities underwriting and brokerage services, insurance sales, and futures trading, as well as other nonbanking activities permitted because they are deemed to be closely related to the business of banking and to produce a public benefit. Figure 1.1 is a simplified illustration of a hypothetical holding company with wholly owned banking and nonbanking subsidiaries and the regulators that oversee the various entities.", "Many large U.S. securities broker-dealers, life insurers, and FCMs have also expanded their range of activities by establishing holding companies at the top of their corporate structures. When creating or acquiring affiliates, these other types of financial firms are not limited to creating or acquiring those that engage in activities related to their own. Banks are allowed to affiliate only with companies engaging in activities closely related to banking and must demonstrate some public benefit in creating or acquiring an affiliate, but other types of financial firms have no such limitations. Figure 1.2 shows a simplified structure of a hypothetical nonbank financial holding company with affiliates engaged in banking activities (through a thrift institution), securities and futures trading, and life insurance sales, among many other types of activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bank Holding Companies Are Regulated on a Consolidated Basis; and Other Types of Regulated Entities on an Individual Basis", "paragraphs": ["As summarized in table 1.1, the regulatory and oversight authorities of financial regulatory agencies differ. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 authorized the Federal Reserve Board to regulate bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. This gives the Federal Reserve Board regulatory and examination authority over all activities of the bank holding company. Affiliates that are banks are supervised by one or more of the federal banking agencies listed in table 1.1. Among other things, this means that capital standards apply at the holding company level and bank level. In addition, FDIC insures bank depositors and has authority to terminate deposit insurance for any FDIC-insured institution.", "In contrast to the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve Board, SEC and CFTC are authorized to regulate only those entities that themselves engage in activities involving securities and futures, respectively, and not the affiliates of those entities. Unlike banks, Congress has not passed legislation authorizing SEC or CFTC to supervise holding companies of securities broker-dealers or FCMs, respectively. However, SEC and CFTC risk assessment rules promulgated pursuant to the Market Reform Act of 1990 and The Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992, respectively, enable those agencies to collect from the regulated entity information about the activities and financial condition of its affiliates and parent firms to assess the risks they pose to the regulated entity\u2019s financial and operational condition, including net capital, liquidity, and the ability to finance operations. These rules do not provide either agency with the legal regulatory authority to examine or set regulatory capital requirements over the parent or affiliates of the SEC-registered broker-dealer or the CFTC-registered FCM, although they do give both agencies a supervisory role with respect to those affiliates.", "State insurance departments are authorized to regulate insurance activities and those firms that sell insurance products. They are not authorized to regulate or examine parents or affiliates of the regulated entities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capital Regulation Is One of Many Tools Financial Regulators Use to Ensure Stability of the Financial System and Markets", "paragraphs": ["Through capital standards and other regulations, regulators of banks, securities broker-dealers, FCMs, and life insurers seek to help ensure public confidence in financial institutions and markets by protecting customers\u2019 funds and limiting losses to various deposit and guarantee funds that further protect customers\u2019 funds. As for securities broker-dealers and FCMs, regulators seek to ensure that registered entities will have a pool of liquid assets available on a daily basis to meet their obligations to customers and other market participants. Capital regulation\u2014requirements that firms hold minimum amounts of capital\u2014is one tool in a kit of many that financial regulators use to help ensure stability and public confidence in the financial system and markets. It is supported by supervision\u2014the monitoring, inspecting, and examining of regulated entities\u2014and enforcement. In some cases, it is also supported by segregation of customer funds or by insurance protection of those funds.", "The oversight activities of financial regulators are similar in some respects and different in others. Each regulator is to promulgate rules (including regulatory capital requirements), monitor firms\u2019 financial condition, perform examinations, and take appropriate actions to enforce relevant regulations and statutes. The oversight activities of SEC and CFTC differ most significantly from those of bank regulators and state insurance regulators because of differing purposes of the regulation. SEC and CFTC, with the assistance of SROs, protect investors and ensure the integrity of the securities and futures markets; bank regulators and state insurance regulators ensure the safety and soundness of entities they regulate.", "Supervision of regulated entities in the banking, securities, futures, and life insurance sectors includes off-site monitoring of financial reports and on-site examination visits. In banking, supervisors are to track the financial condition of their banks on a continuing basis and between on-site examinations. A principal off-site technique banking supervisors use for monitoring the activities and financial condition of their banks is the review of detailed financial statements (Call Reports) that the banks submit quarterly. In addition, the banking regulators use computerized monitoring systems that use Call Report data to compute, for example, financial ratios, growth trends, and peer group comparisons. Banking supervisors also meet with bank senior management from time to time to discuss the current condition of the bank and plans the bank has for the future. Monitoring is a complement to on-site examinations, which lie at the heart of the supervisory process. The purpose of bank on-site examinations is for examiners to evaluate the bank\u2019s overall risk exposure with particular emphasis on what is known as its CAMELS\u2014the adequacy of its capital, and asset quality, the quality of its management and internal control procedures, the strength of its earnings, the adequacy of its liquidity, and its sensitivity to market risk. Banks are usually examined at least once during each 12-month period and more frequently if they have serious problems. In addition, well-capitalized banks with total assets of less than $250 million can be examined on an 18-month cycle.", "In contrast to regulation of banks, regulation of the securities and futures markets is a combination of direct regulation and oversight by federal agencies and indirect regulation and oversight by SROs (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers). Securities broker-dealers and FCMs are required to become members of an SRO and, as SRO members, must comply with SRO rules and regulations. SRO rules and regulations are promulgated under the SEC or CFTC standards and requirements. Securities SRO rules and regulations are often more stringent than SEC rules and require SEC\u2019s approval. SROs must register with SEC or CFTC and are subject to SEC or CFTC oversight. SROs establish rules to govern member conduct and trading, set qualifications for certain market participants, monitor daily trading activity, examine their members\u2019 financial health and compliance with rules, and investigate alleged violations of those rules and securities and futures laws. SEC oversees the regulatory and supervisory activities of the securities industry\u2019s SROs. CFTC oversees the compliance activities of the futures industry\u2019s SROs, which include the U.S. commodity exchanges and the National Futures Association. Both SEC and CFTC also develop, implement, interpret, and enforce statutes and regulations to protect customer funds, prevent trading and sales practice abuses, and ensure the financial integrity of firms holding customer funds. Additionally, SEC and CFTC conduct direct audits of clearing organizations and firms handling customer money to ensure compliance with the capital and segregation rules.", "In contrast to banking, securities, and futures regulation, regulation of the insurance industry is primarily a state, not federal, responsibility. In general, state legislatures set the rules under which insurance companies are to operate, including capital standards; and state insurance regulators are to monitor the health and solvency of the regulated insurance companies. To help coordinate their activities, state insurance regulators have established a central structure\u2014the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), an organization whose members are the heads of the insurance departments of 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 4 U.S. territories and possessions. NAIC\u2019s basic purpose is to encourage consistency and cooperation among the various states and territories as they individually regulate the insurance industry. To that end, NAIC promulgates model insurance laws and regulations for state consideration and provides a framework for multistate examinations of insurance companies.", "State regulators use a number of basic methods to assess the financial strength of insurance companies, including reviewing and analyzing annual financial statements, doing periodic on-site financial examinations, and monitoring key financial ratios. Supervision of life insurers is the responsibility of insurance departments in each state, with the primary responsibility residing with the \u201cdomiciliary\u201d regulator, that is, the regulator in the state where the company is domiciled. The domiciliary regulator is responsible for conducting periodic on-site examinations and for reviewing the required annual and quarterly financial reports. Examiners monitor the financial health of the insurer, along with compliance with rules and regulations, and look for evidence of any unsafe business practices. Regulators in states where the company is licensed and operating, other than the domiciliary state, may participate in on-site examinations with the domiciliary state if they choose. These examinations are called zone examinations. In most states, the typical interval between on-site examinations is 3 to 5 years unless regulators have reason to believe problems exist that could affect the company\u2019s viability.", "Financial regulators may take both informal supervisory and/or formal enforcement actions to ensure that regulated entities undertake corrective steps for identified problems. In banking, such informal actions may include a request that a bank adopt a board resolution or agree to the provisions of a memorandum of understanding to address the problems. If necessary, financial regulators may take formal enforcement actions to compel the management and directors of troubled entities to address problems. Formal enforcement actions in banking include written agreements, cease and desist orders, prompt corrective action directives, termination of deposit insurance, revocation of a bank charter, and closing of the bank. Other actions include assessing fines, such as civil money penalties; and removing an officer or director from office and permanently barring him or her from the banking industry.", "SEC and CFTC have the authority to take supervisory and enforcement actions against the entities they regulate. Their enforcement tools include court injunctions; temporary restraining orders; and various administrative proceedings and sanctions, such as assessment of civil monetary penalties, disgorgement orders, censure, suspension and revocation of registration, and cease and desist orders.", "Additionally, SEC staff provide informal regulation of broker-dealers through no-action letters. In the no-action process, a broker-dealer requests interpretive relief from SEC staff regarding certain transactions or activities. In a typical no-action letter, the staff states that it will not recommend that SEC take enforcement action if the requesting party executes transactions or engages in activities in the limited context stated by the staff. In SEC\u2019s view, limitations in no-action letters related to risk-management issues balance regulatory flexibility with the need to avoid undue risk. The letters are made available to the public and informally address regulatory concerns that by necessity are not detailed in securities statutes.", "As with other financial regulators, insurance regulators have an array of informal and formal actions that can be employed to correct problems identified through the supervisory process. These actions often begin with informal discussions of regulatory concerns with company officials. If problems are not resolved promptly, regulators have a number of more formal tools available, including administrative actions; court orders and injunctions; and culminating with the power to take regulatory control of a company, remove the officers, and either sell or liquidate it. Many of the authorities held by state insurance regulators are enhanced when the Risk-Based Capital Insurers Model Act has been adopted in a particular state. When adopted, this act gives the state\u2019s chief insurance regulator the explicit authority to take regulatory action based on an insurer\u2019s risk-based capital level."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Financial Services Industry Is Changing in Response to a Variety of Developments", "paragraphs": ["Since the late 1970s, significant changes have been occurring in the financial services industry due to a number of market shocks, combined with advances in financial theory and information technology. The interaction of these factors has led to significant expansion of such financial products as derivatives and asset-backed securities, improved methods to measure and manage risks, increased competition in financial services, and mergers of financial firms within and across financial sectors. In addition, these factors have encouraged some firms to offer risk management services to other financial and nonfinancial firms. This risk management has often been based on the use of derivatives and asset-backed securities to repackage risks and returns.", "The creation and growth in derivatives, huge increases in trading activities, and the development of new secondary markets, along with the creation of asset-backed securities, have fundamentally changed the financial landscape. Derivatives and asset-backed securities have permitted financial market participants to better manage market risk by transferring the risk from entities less willing to bear it to those more willing to do so. Derivatives have stimulated trading generally because they gave financial market participants a lower cost way to hedge investments or to take speculative positions. In addition, derivatives products markets have grown rapidly. For example, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association estimates that as of December 31, 1996, the combined notional amount of globally outstanding interest rate swaps and other over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives had grown to $25.45 trillion from $3.45 trillion on December 31, 1990.", "Advances in information technology and financial theory have helped reduce various barriers to competition. The increased speed and lower costs in communicating and transmitting data over large geographical distances eliminated such distance as an obstacle to competition. Moreover, new financial theories and faster computers helped financial firms handle large amounts of data at low cost and analyze the risks and returns created by new financial products. Swaps and other derivatives, which have been growing rapidly, are an example of such technology- and theory-dependent products. Since the tools and skills underlying them were not unique to any one sector of the financial services industry, no one sector has a monopoly on their use; thus, the list of major derivatives dealers includes banks, securities firms, and insurance companies.", "Regulators also have acted in ways to promote greater competition in the financial services industry. For example, the Federal Reserve Board has approved a number of additional activities for banks to offer, including providing investment advice, underwriting insurance related to the extension of credit, tax planning and preparation, data processing, and operating a credit bureau or collection agency. The Federal Reserve Board also approved bond and stock underwriting powers for Section 20 subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Effective in March 1997, the Federal Reserve Board enhanced these powers when it increased from 10 to 25 percent the share of total revenues a bank holding company\u2019s Section 20 subsidiary may derive from corporate equity and debt underwriting. On the basis of these decisions, banks have increasingly acquired or created securities broker-dealer affiliates or subsidiaries. OCC has amended its regulations to permit subsidiaries of national banks to engage in activities that OCC determines\u2014on a case-by-case application basis\u2014to be \u201cpart of or incidental to the business of banking.\u201d", "In addition to banks entering underwriting, an area associated with securities firms, a number of large securities firms have entered a traditional province of banks: commercial loans to corporate borrowers. Recently, securities firms have made and traded such loans, which are commonly linked with securities underwriting. Such services enable the firm to provide a customer with a full range of its financing needs. In a number of instances, banks and securities firms have joined together to provide such loan and security facilities for customers.", "Increasing competition also affects insurance companies and insurance products. During the past several years, life insurance companies increasingly have moved away from traditional whole life and term insurance products and have focused instead on asset growth or investment products such as variable annuities. These products compete with stocks and bonds, retirement vehicles offered by banks, and stock mutual funds and are often sold by financial planners and securities brokers.", "As part of this competition, large, diversified financial firms are increasingly operating in what once were separate banking, insurance, and securities sectors, as discussed earlier. Banks have acquired investment banks; and many types of firms have acquired thrifts, which are similar to banks but can be owned by anyone. For example, a number of insurance companies have applied for thrift licenses. Securities firms have acquired firms that have enabled them to engage in banking activities. For example, in 1997, Merrill Lynch & Company, Inc., and the Travelers Group, Inc., which includes insurance companies and securities firms, both received federal thrift charters. In addition, insurance companies have acquired securities firms. For example, the Travelers Group acquired Salomon Brothers, Inc. (primarily a securities trading firm) in November 1997, and it already owned Smith Barney and Company (primarily a retail brokerage firm). In addition, in April 1998, the Travelers Group and Citicorp announced their intention to merge and create a new entity that is to be called Citigroup. This would be the biggest corporate merger in history; however, there are questions about the implications of current banking laws for the merger. If the laws are not changed, it is possible the new entity would have to divest itself of certain operations, either in insurance or banking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To help Congress and others better understand current regulatory capital requirements, developments in those requirements, and regulatory issues these developments raise, the objectives of this report are to describe, for the banking, securities, futures, and life insurance sectors of the financial services industry, (1) regulatory views of the purpose of capital and current regulatory requirements; (2) the approaches of some large, diversified financial firms to risk measurement and capital allocation; and (3) issues in capital regulation and initiatives being considered for changes to regulatory capital requirements.", "To achieve these objectives, we interviewed officials from financial regulators, including OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, FDIC, SEC, CFTC, and the Office of Thrift Supervision; and the Departments of Insurance for New York and Illinois; academics and consultants who are considered experts in the financial rating agencies\u2019 analysts, including A.M.

We did not test the adequacy of any of the risk measurement and capital allocation systems discussed in this report. In selecting firms for this review, on recommendations from SEC, we chose securities firms that were part of the Derivatives Policy Group (DPG). We chose commercial banks that appeared likely to be required to meet the market risk capital requirements that took effect on January 1, 1998, and life insurance companies that have been involved in the development of risk-based capital standards for that industry. The securities firms we visited are large holding companies and include both SEC-registered broker-dealers and CFTC-registered FCMs. We interviewed officials who could speak about risk management and capital allocation systems for the consolidated financial firm.", "We developed and used a set of common questions in our discussions with these firms.

It is there to absorb losses, thereby allowing banks to continue to operate as going concerns during periods when operating losses or other adverse financial results are being experienced. Capital also helps to promote public confidence, restrict excessive asset growth, and provide protection to depositors and the Bank Insurance Fund administered by FDIC.

For deposits exceeding the $100,000 limit, FDIC is to provide reimbursements based on the value of the assets sold when the bank is closed and liquidated.

Assets with a relatively low likelihood of default are assigned lower risk-weights than assets thought to have a higher likelihood of default. Although the amount at risk is often associated with changing asset prices, the credit risk calculation does not use market price information to evaluate risks, except in the case of derivatives contracts.

Less liquid assets and assets with greater price volatility are more likely to take longer to sell and to be sold at a loss. Thus, the less liquid the position, the greater the haircut on the position. Haircuts generally recognize limited correlation among prices that can affect the actual values received when assets are liquidated.

In some states, a single dollar amount of minimum capital and surplus was applicable to all insurers, regardless of the lines of insurance they wrote. This requirement was, in effect, an entrance requirement and generally did not vary with the size of the insurer or the risks that a company accepted. Thus, the minimum amount of required regulatory capital was unlikely to bear any relationship to the amount of risk on the books of any particular insurer.", "In the latter half of the 20th century, according to NAIC, changes within the insurance industry itself and the economic environment in which it operated raised questions about the long-term viability of traditional insurance products and led insurers to offer new products. These products included variable annuities, variable life insurance, universal life insurance, single-premium deferred annuities, and guaranteed investment contracts. In NAIC\u2019s view, competition among sellers of these products led life insurers to seek higher returns on their investment portfolios, and some of them sought such returns without sufficient consideration of the accompanying higher investment risks.", "According to NAIC, an increase in the number and size of life insurer insolvencies from the 1960s through the 1980s led insurance regulators to believe they needed new tools to deal with changes in the industry resulting from new products and investment strategies.

The amount of capital required varies with the risk an insurer is assuming in its insurance and investment operations, as well as the normal risks to which all businesses are subject. The formula requires companies to hold minimum percentages of various assets and liabilities as capital, with these percentages based on the historical variability of the value of those assets and liabilities. Companies are free to make their own capitalization decisions commensurate with their own level of risk tolerance as long as the level is above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital thresholds. In NAIC\u2019s view, its formula, in effect, imposes a minimum and uniform degree of risk aversion on all companies, but the formula also allows companies to operate freely at any given level above the minimum threshold.", "The NAIC life insurance risk-based formula classifies all of the risks into four major categories: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, and all other business risk. The formula consists of a series of risk factors that are to be applied, usually as multipliers, to selected assets, liabilities, or other specific company financial data to establish the minimum capital needed to bear the risk arising from that item (similar to risk-weights in banking).", "The asset risks are the risks of asset defaults and decreases in market value. For example, the risk factor for cash in the formula is 0.003, which indicates that an insurer must maintain capital equal to three-tenths of 1 percent of its cash holdings to absorb the risk of loss in cash in a bank failure. At the other end of the range, the multiplier for publicly traded common stocks is 0.300, which indicates a requirement for capital equal to 30 percent of the value of the stocks to protect against downturns in the market. The formula also includes charges for risks arising from the ownership of subsidiaries and affiliates, which vary with the nature of these entities. According to NAIC data, asset risks represent by far the largest proportion of risk among the four categories faced by the life insurance industry as a whole.", "The insurance risks, which are unique to the insurance industry, are the risk of underpricing or unfavorable developments in mortality or morbidity. NAIC developed a series of risk factors to determine the capital necessary to absorb those risks that are to be applied to the net amount at risk (face amount less reserves) for life insurance. According to NAIC data, insurance risks are second in magnitude among the four categories of risks for the life insurance industry as a whole. However, for a large number of relatively small companies, this component is the dominant risk-based capital risk.", "NAIC defines interest rate risk as the chance that a change in interest rates will result in an insurer not earning enough return on its investments to meet its interest obligations under its various insurance and annuity contracts. There is also a risk that changes in interest rates will spur disintermediation. The interest rate risk depends on how closely the assets and liabilities are matched in time. The formula is concerned with the risks related to annuity and pension business. Interest rate risk is third in magnitude among the four categories of risk for the life insurance industry as a whole.", "The all-other-business-risk category encompasses risks not included elsewhere in the formula. In developing the risk-based capital formula, the working group recognized that all companies are subject to some risks, such as litigation, that are not contemplated in the parts of the formula used for other categories. However, the group concluded that the derivation of appropriate risk factors for most of these risks was not possible. Also, these risks vary from one company to another. Initially, NAIC decided that the only risk factor to be included in the risk-based capital formula would be a charge for the risk of guaranty fund assessments.", "In addition, the risk-based capital formula also requires the performance of sensitivity tests to indicate how sensitive the formula is to changes in certain risk factors. These tests require the company to recalculate its risk-based capital using revised risk factors for certain specified risks and to report the difference between the basic calculations and the sensitivity tests. The purpose of the tests is to provide additional information for company management and regulators.", "In NAIC\u2019s view, the true impact of the risk-based capital system is in the Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act (the Model Act), which NAIC developed and recommended that the states adopt.

The primary reason for this is because the risk-weights are not adjusted for asset quality within each broad class of assets. Institute of International Finance officials said that the credit risk rules offered perverse incentives to banks to take on riskier loans in that they encourage banks to go up the yield curve in pursuit of a return on capital. This means that the bank is making more long-term loans, which tend to have higher interest rates than do short-term loans, thus simultaneously increasing interest rate risk and potential returns. The Federal Reserve Board Chairman noted a number of weaknesses in the risk-based capital structure for credit risk, including its inability to adjust weights for hedging, portfolio diversification, and management controls. Such adjustments are based on changing price volatility and correlation among prices. Another weakness noted by regulators is that the current risk-based structure does not consider all types of risk.

In this way, the rule does not account for historical price correlation between foreign securities and U.S. securities or between equity securities and debt securities.

A firm using a risky but successful strategy can increase stockholder returns as long as the costs of borrowed funds are less than the return to equity.

In the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation, the value of the assets may not cover the outstanding principal. Because stockholders can obtain larger returns from risky and successful strategies and bondholders cannot obtain added returns from such strategies, bondholders are less likely to encourage or accept increased risk-taking by a firm. Furthermore, if the firm undertakes risky strategies, bondholders may require a higher interest rate as compensation for the increased risk. The higher interest rate decreases the funding advantage of debt financing and lowers profits for stockholders.", "Bondholders depend on, among other things, credit rating agencies for evaluations of the creditworthiness of bonds based, in part, on a firm\u2019s leverage. When a firm receives high ratings, such as an investment grade rating from credit rating agencies, the market then allows the firm to pay a lower interest rate on its debt, which lowers costs. Consequently, firms often manage their operations to receive investment grade credit ratings.

For example, bank regulators are concerned with maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking and payments system and protecting the deposit insurance funds; and securities and futures regulators are concerned with investor protection and ensuring the integrity of the securities and futures markets, respectively.", "Financial regulators and other experts we interviewed discussed the appropriateness of having similar capital requirements for banks, which are covered by government-backed insurance funds, and other firms that are not; or whether it is appropriate for capital requirements of banks, which are part of the payments system, to be similar to capital requirements for firms that are not. Traditionally, bank regulation has been more concerned with systemic risk than has regulation of other financial entities. Some experts have argued that capital regulation must be stricter on entities that pose greater systemic risk than on those that do not.", "Also, financial regulators were concerned that different domestic and foreign capital standards for the various types of financial firms create incentives for firms to change operations in ways that change their regulator, such as moving business overseas, to avoid or offset capital requirements they believe are costly and excessive. Different regulators may have different capital standards for the same product. In some situations, a firm facing the higher capital standard has an incentive to move its activities in that product line into an affiliate that has a different regulator or one that is unregulated. However, in banking, all affiliates within the holding company fall under the holding company capital standards. If a bank believes the standards are too high for a certain product, it may choose to abandon that product line; or it may restructure its transactions to provide a similar service that carries a lower capital requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences Exist Between Regulators\u2019 and Firms\u2019 Estimates of Risk and Needed Capital", "paragraphs": ["An important issue for regulators is how to establish capital requirements that meet their purposes without requiring either excessive or insufficient capital for the risks involved. To a large degree, to increase the value of the shareholders\u2019 equity in competitive markets, large, diversified financial firms have increasingly used statistical and mathematical models to measure and manage economic risks and to determine their optimum capital levels. As firms have been able to apply more sophisticated risk measurement tools, some said they have become increasingly aware of a discrepancy between their internal estimates of risk and the capital needed to support certain activities and the regulatory capital requirements for those activities. Even though firms may hold more total capital than regulatory minimums call for, regulatory capital requirements may impose higher capital levels for some activities than the firms believe to be appropriate.", "The difference between amounts of capital allocated by some financial firms and regulatory capital requirements reflect, in part, differences between the firms\u2019 primary objectives and the purpose of regulators. As discussed in chapters 2 and 3, financial firms and regulators agree that capital serves as a buffer against unexpected losses. However, the primary use of capital for firms is to maximize the value of their shares for stockholders by choosing the best mix of risk and returns. Regulators, on the other hand, impose minimum capital requirements to serve the public interest.", "Currently, financial regulators use a \u201cbuilding block\u201d approach in setting capital requirements\u2014that is, capital requirements are determined largely on the basis of broad classes of risk, and the total capital requirement is the sum of requirements for each risk. Many firms and regulators have argued that this building block approach is inappropriate, because the total risk in the firm is based on the interactions of all risks in the firm\u2019s portfolio, and risks need not be additive. We did not identify any firms that were yet able to hedge across different risks\u2014for example, hedging credit exposures and market exposures against each other. However, some firms said they have developed hedging strategies that allow them to decrease risks by hedging the same risk within and across portfolios\u2014for example, hedging interest rate or foreign exchange risk in different portfolios within the firm. These risk-reducing strategies are often not recognized in existing building block regulatory approaches to setting minimum capital requirements. Thus, because these approaches do not recognize the possibility that total risk may be less than the sum of individual risks if risks offset each other, they could lead to excessive capital requirements.", "In both the banking and securities/futures sectors, capital regulations contain formulas that apply single risk-weightings to a broad range of riskiness within a single category. For example, in banking, the same 8 percent capital requirement is imposed on all unsecured loans to private commercial borrowers regardless of individual creditworthiness, with the result that a high-risk/high-return loan carries no more regulatory capital than a low-risk/low-return loan. As a result, the regulation might give firms an incentive to seek the highest returns within a broad class regardless of underlying risk; or to adjust activities (e.g, develop new products and/or change operations or corporate structures) in a way that reduces or escapes capital requirements. In other words, firms may adjust business to achieve the lowest regulatory capital cost rather than an optimal balance of risk and capital. Also, the securities net capital rule requires registered broker-dealers to apply a 100-percent haircut to any portion of the trading profits, to the extent the profits are unsecured, reflecting SEC\u2019s emphasis on liquidity in its net capital rule.", "Moreover, if capital requirements are not adequately sensitive to risk, they may require either too much or too little regulatory capital for the activities being covered. For example, capital requirements that require firms to hold more capital than they believe to be warranted by the risk can cause them to reorganize their structures, resulting in less regulated financial markets as firms move operations outside of regulated entities. Because securities firms consider the 100-percent haircut for OTC derivatives transactions excessive, for example, they book much of their OTC derivatives business in unregulated affiliates to escape capital requirements and other regulatory oversight for these derivatives activities. Some regulators and we have expressed concern about the lack of regulatory oversight in OTC derivatives activities.", "On the other hand, capital requirements that are too low to protect against risk may result in firms holding only the required amount of capital. As a result, they may not be sufficiently cushioned against potential losses. At the same time, a relatively low capital requirement may induce some institutions to hold excessive amounts of the asset, thus increasing their exposure to the risk. For example, the calculation of bank capital ratios does not explicitly include the interest rate risk inherent in mortgages and other interest-sensitive assets; this may cause banks to hold more of these assets and fewer assets for which the capital requirement more fully captures all the risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Regulatory Use of Firm Estimates of Risk Raises Issues Regarding the Appropriateness of These Estimates for Regulatory Capital Purposes", "paragraphs": ["Although financial regulators are already using firms\u2019 estimates of risk in limited ways, concerns about regulatory insensitivity to risk are leading some regulators to consider increased use of firms\u2019 own estimates of risk for setting regulatory capital requirements.

According to some of the firms\u2019 representatives we interviewed, the firms\u2019 risk estimates address expected losses, but they cannot accurately account for the unexpected losses the firm may face. VAR modeling is often based on day-to-day risks and historical experience and assumes that managers regularly readjust their portfolios as risks change. However, the representatives noted that such models can easily miss low-probability events that could result in large losses, which could pose considerable risk. For this reason, the capital levels indicated by the models may not cover losses during a major market event, such as a financial crisis in an emerging market.

Thus, even when regulators specify the use of common procedures for developing internal models, such as those in the market risk capital requirement for banks, the internal models firms produce differ because each firm designs its model to measure what it sees as its own risk profile. Because a firm\u2019s model was designed for use with a specific risk profile, another firm\u2019s model applied to the same profile might produce a different risk estimate.

Such behavior by firms would raise questions about the dependability of the risk and capital measures used by the firms. Firms might undertake such model alterations if the regulatory minimums for certain risks exceeded the capital level managers wished to put aside for such risks, either because their estimates of risk were lower or their risk tolerances were greater than those set by the regulators.

It was developed in response to perceived difficulties with the internal models approach to market risk capital. For example, banks\u2019 internal models are not designed to measure risk exposure over the time horizons of regulatory concern and thus may not accurately translate to these intervals. In addition, model-based capital calculations cannot account for the fact that some banks will be in a position to reduce their exposure to losses through investment in superior information systems or other aspects of risk management.", "Under the precommitment approach, the bank would specify an amount of capital it believed was adequate to cover its risk exposure over a fixed subsequent interval and would commit to manage its trading portfolio to limit losses over the interval to this amount. If the bank\u2019s losses exceeded the precommitment amount, it would face penalties that could range from public disclosure to additional capital requirements or monetary fines. Under this approach, both the commitment and the bank\u2019s risk management system would be subject to review by regulatory authorities. The penalties associated with a breach of the capital commitment are to provide the incentive for banks to commit honestly and to manage risk to stay within the commitment.", "Some industry analysts considered such an approach to be a major improvement in capital regulation. However, others believe the approach raises a number of issues because of its departure from traditional capital regulation\u2014comparability, interaction with other supervisory policies, enforceability, and the role of penalties.", "Regarding comparability, on the surface it would seem that precommitted amounts would be comparable across firms because the firms are all being asked about the maximum amount they could lose over the same time interval. However, the amounts are likely to differ because they would still be based on subjective estimates of the quality of internal risk management and differences in firms\u2019 tolerances for risk. Comparability might also be compromised because the cost of capital differs across firms.", "With regard to interaction with other supervisory policies, bank supervisors are already required to focus on bank internal risk measurement and management systems. Thus, it is not clear that the adoption of the precommitment approach would eliminate supervisory interest in the validation of such systems.", "With regard to enforcement and the role of penalties, there is a concern not only about the types of penalties that should be used, but also whether it would be counterproductive to enforce them during stressful market conditions. The paper notes that in choosing penalties, it will be important to determine what the goal of penalties is\u2014that is, the degree of incentive they are to provide the bank. Some experts believe that to reliably achieve regulatory objectives, the penalties would need to be bank specific and that the appropriate penalty would depend on a bank\u2019s cost of capital and its individual investment opportunities. However, these factors are not ascertainable by regulators. In addition, recent work by the original designers of the precommitment approach acknowledges that the link between after-the-fact penalties and regulatory capital objectives is tenuous. In the view of a Federal Reserve official, the appropriate penalty for achieving regulatory capital objectives for market risks is bank specific and depends on characteristics that regulators cannot precisely measure. Moreover, an approach that relies on after-the-fact penalties to influence bank behavior implicitly assumes that the bank is forward-looking and takes potential penalties into account when making current capital allocation decisions. This might be a reasonable assumption for healthy banks, but weak banks may not care about future penalties that, in the extreme, might not be enforceable if the bank is insolvent.", "The New York Clearing House Association (Clearing House) conducted a four-quarter test of the precommitment approach that began in October 1996. The pilot was designed to assist the bank regulators and the participating banks and bank holding companies in evaluating and assessing the usefulness and viability of the approach for regulatory capital purposes. In a comment letter to the Federal Reserve, the Clearing House suggested that the U.S. bank regulators consider adoption of this approach for two reasons: (1) it might constitute a way to effectively establish a relationship between an institution\u2019s calculation of value-at-risk for management purposes and prudent capital requirements for regulatory purposes, and (2) it would result in capital requirements for market risks tailored to the particular circumstances of each institution.", "There were 10 participants in the pilot\u20148 U.S. and 2 foreign banking organizations. During the pilot, each participant precommitted the amount of capital it needed to hold against its market risk for four 3-month periods. The pilot was conducted on a consolidated basis in that participants precommitted capital for the consolidated trading operation of the holding company, including bank and Section 20 subsidiaries. After the end of each period, participants reported their results to their primary regulators and provided copies of the reports to the Clearing House. The participants conducted the pilot under the assumption that the penalty would be disclosure, not financial penalties.", "In its report on the pilot\u2019s results, the Clearing House said that the participants believe (1) the precommitment approach is a viable alternative to the internal models approach for establishing capital adequacy of a trading business for regulatory purposes; and (2) when properly structured and refined, steps should be taken to implement it as an alternative to existing market risk capital standards. Further, the participants believe this approach provides strong incentives for prudent risk management and more efficient allocation of capital as compared to other existing capital standards. The Clearing House believes the pilot contributed to the development and depth of the participants\u2019 thinking about the purpose of capital and about the distinction between economic capital maintained for the benefit of shareholders and minimum regulatory capital.", "Pilot results showed that the participants\u2019 precommitted capital amounts were less than the market risk regulatory capital requirements. No participant reported a negative change that exceeded its precommitted capital amount. Finally, the participants believe the benefits of the precommitment approach are likely to apply to other risks of trading businesses, such as operational risk, as well. In their view, the approach avoids many of the complications and inefficiencies that are generated when capital requirements are set separately for each category of risk.", "One high level regulatory official, reflecting the generally held regulatory and industry views, said that the pilot demonstrated that the participants have internal procedures for allocating capital for market and other risks in their portfolios; but it did not, and realistically could not, demonstrate that these internal allocations are sufficiently large to meet regulatory objectives with respect to minimum capital. Even though none of the participants reported losses in excess of their commitments during the pilot, in reality, none of the participants incurred any cumulative loss over any of the four quarters. Hence, no violations would have occurred if no capital had been committed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Approach That Emphasizes Supervision Is Being Explored", "paragraphs": ["Another alternative approach to the evolution of bank capital regulation would be one that emphasizes supervision rather than minimum standards. In a 1995 paper, a Federal Reserve official argued that the distinct uses and characteristics of minimum regulatory capital requirements and firm internal capital allocations make it inadvisable to combine them into a single measure. In his view, they are so naturally contradictory that a hybrid would be much less informative than two individual measures. Moreover, he believes an attempt to bring the two constructs closely in line could undermine the useful objectivity of minimum capital and deprive firms of the flexibility they need to determine optimum capital levels. Under this approach, the firm would be accountable for determining its own appropriate level of capital while abiding by sound practices developed in the context of the business. Firms engaged in trading complex instruments would need to apply sophisticated mathematical techniques; those that focus on, for example, small business lending would have to apply different techniques (e.g., traditional credit analysis). The supervisor would monitor the performance of the firm in the firm\u2019s determination of its appropriate capital level.", "Like the precommitment approach discussed above, this approach also relies on incentives. However, in contrast to the precommitment approach in which penalties are to act as a deterrent to excessive risk taking, the key to the success of this approach would be the supervisor. The supervisor would monitor compliance with minimum requirements as frequently as feasible and then supplement the effectiveness of minimum requirements by ensuring that the firm makes its best efforts to determine an optimum level of capital. In this way, the development and determination of the optimum are best left to the firm, and supervisors would work closely with the firm to ameliorate the situation if they find capital levels declining toward the minimums.

The first prong could be a minimum capital calculation in which the method would be chosen to emphasize comparability across firms; the second prong would be an internal capital calculation in which the bank would have greater freedom to use its own methodology.

This approach would develop a capital framework that would not require ever more complex measures of portfolio risk. The hope in developing such a framework is that a suitable proxy for true economic risk could be found. This proxy would not be intended to be extremely precise, but it would need to roughly capture the bulk of the firm\u2019s exposures. According to the Federal Reserve officials, the key issue for this alternative approach is whether it is possible to achieve this goal. There are two interpretations for this approach. In the first, the aim is for the simple measure of risk to be roughly accurate in that, on average, it produces a measure of risk that is equivalent to what an ideally precise measure would produce. In the second, the goal would be a simple measure of risk that is good enough to determine whether the firm has a dangerously low level of capital.", "Another approach discussed by the Federal Reserve officials in their paper is one that would base capital regulation on observed measures of volatility, such as earnings volatility.

Such an approach would require almost no additional calculations by the bank and, in the authors\u2019 view, it would be objective and verifiable; however, they noted a number of drawbacks to such an approach. First, it is not clear that earnings volatility is itself a good proxy for economic risk.

Inadequate management of these risks had created problems for the bank and thrift deposit insurance funds.", "In response, on December 13, 1994, bank regulators amended risk-based capital standards for depository institutions to \u201censure that those standards take adequate account of concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities,\u201d which include derivatives activities. Regulators are to consider the risks from nontraditional activities and management\u2019s ability to monitor and control these risks when assessing the adequacy of a bank\u2019s capital. Similarly, institutions identified through the examination process as having exposure to concentration of credit risk or as not adequately managing their concentration of risk are required to hold capital above the regulatory minimums. Because no generally accepted approach exists for identifying and quantifying the magnitude of risk associated with concentrations of credit, bank regulators determined that including a formula-based calculation to quantify the related risk was not feasible.", "U.S. bank regulators addressed the interest rate risk portion of section 305 through a two-step process. Step one consisted of a final rule issued on August 2, 1995, that amended the capital standards to specify that bank regulators will include in their evaluations of a bank\u2019s capital adequacy an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank\u2019s capital due to changes in interest rates. The final rules specify that examiners will also consider the adequacy of the bank\u2019s internal interest rate risk management. Step one also included a proposed joint policy statement that was issued concurrently with the final rule. This joint policy statement described how bank regulators would measure and assess a bank\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk.", "Originally, bank regulators intended that step two would be the issuance of a proposed rule based on the August 2, 1995, joint policy statement that would have established an explicit minimum capital requirement for interest rate risk. Subsequently, bank regulators elected not to pursue a standardized measure and explicit capital charge for interest rate risk.", "According to the bank regulators\u2019 June 26, 1996, joint policy statement on interest rate risk, the decision not to pursue an explicit measure reflects concerns about the burden, accuracy, and complexity of developing a standardized model and the realization that interest rate risk measurement techniques continue to evolve. Nonetheless, bank regulators said they will continue to place significant emphasis on the level of a bank\u2019s interest rate risk exposure and the quality of its risk-management process when they are evaluating its capital adequacy.", "The regulators concluded that interest rate risks were too difficult for many institutions to quantify, and concentration risk was too difficult to quantify in a manner that could be used in a risk-based capital calculation.

Section 38 creates a capital-based framework for bank and thrift oversight that is based on the placement of financial institutions into one of five capital categories. FDICIA requires that banks meet both a risk-based and a leverage requirement.", "Capital was made the centerpiece of the framework because it represents funds invested by an institution\u2019s owners, such as common and preferred stock, that can be used to absorb unexpected losses before the institution becomes insolvent. Thus, capital was seen as serving a vital role as a buffer between bank losses and the deposit insurance system. Although section 38 does not in any way limit regulators\u2019 ability to take additional supervisory action, it requires federal regulators to take specific actions against banks and thrifts that have capital levels below minimum standards. The specified regulatory actions are made increasingly severe as an institution\u2019s capital drops to lower levels. By focusing on capital, which absorbs losses, and requiring regulators to take actions when capital levels fall below predetermined thresholds, including requiring closure if capital levels become too low, FDICIA was meant to curb failures and deposit insurance losses if regulators had to close an institution.", "Section 38 of FDICIA requires regulators to establish criteria for classifying depository institutions into the following five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The section does not place restrictions on institutions that meet or exceed the minimum capital standards\u2014that is, those that are well-capitalized or adequately capitalized\u2014other than prohibiting the institution from paying dividends or management fees that would drop them into the undercapitalized category.", "The regulators jointly developed the implementing regulations for section 38 and based the criteria for four of the five capital categories on the international risk-based capital calculation and the leverage capital ratio. The fifth category\u2014critically undercapitalized\u2014is based on a tangible equity-to-total assets ratio.", "The four regulators specifically based the benchmarks for an adequately capitalized institution on the Basle Committee\u2019s risk-based capital requirement, which stipulates that an internationally active bank must have at least 8 percent total risk-based capital and 4 percent tier 1 risk-based capital. The benchmarks are also based on the U.S. leverage capital standard, which generally requires U.S. banks to have tier 1 capital equal to at least 4 percent of total assets. For the definition of a critically undercapitalized institution, the regulators adopted section 38\u2019s requirement of a tangible equity ratio of 2 percent or less.", "As shown in figure I.1, three capital ratios are used to determine if an institution is well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, or significantly undercapitalized. A well-capitalized or adequately capitalized institution must meet or exceed all three capital ratios for its capital category. To be deemed undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, an institution need fall below only one of the ratios listed for its capital category.

In computing net capital, under either the basic or alternative method (discussed below), the broker-dealer must first determine its equity in accordance with GAAP. GAAP liabilities deducted from GAAP assets result in GAAP equity. GAAP requires that the broker-dealer mark to market all securities and commodities positions daily, thereby reflecting unrealized gains (which add to equity) and losses (which subtract from equity)\u2014the current market value\u2014and making it difficult to forbear market losses beyond a day.", "Once GAAP equity is computed, a number of adjustments are made to reflect the estimated value of the broker-dealer if it was liquidated in a hurry. Liabilities that are properly subordinated to the claims of creditors, including customers, are then added back to GAAP equity as well as certain deferred income tax liabilities and accrued liabilities. Assets considered not readily convertible into cash are deducted from GAAP equity. This includes intangible assets (goodwill); fixed assets (furniture, fixtures, and buildings); prepaid items (rent and insurance); and the value of exchange memberships. The broker-dealer also deducts most unsecured receivables, including unsecured customer debits and bridge loans; and charges for delays in processing securities transactions beyond the normal settlement date. These collective additions and subtractions to GAAP equity result in an amount called tentative net capital. Tentative net capital is then reduced by certain percentage deductions, called haircuts, of the current market value of a broker-dealer\u2019s securities and commodities positions and an undue concentration charge, which reflects the risk of a large, concentrated holding in one security, to arrive at the broker-dealer\u2019s net capital.

The 6-2/3 percent requirement says a broker-dealer must have at least $1 of net capital for every $15 of its indebtedness (i.e., a leverage constraint). In the broker-dealer\u2019s first year of operation, its net capital must exceed 12.5 percent of its aggregate indebtedness. Most of the smaller broker-dealers typically use the basic method to compute their net capital requirements because of the nature of their business. Typically, smaller broker-dealers either do not hold customer or broker-dealer accounts and therefore need less than the $250,000 required for broker-dealers that carry customer accounts; or they want to be subject to the less stringent requirements of Rule 15c3-3.", "Under the second method, the so-called alternative method, the broker-dealer is required to have net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2 percent of its customer-related receivables from the reserve calculation of Rule 15c3-3 or, if registered as a futures commission merchant (FCM), 4 percent of the customer funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount of funds in the customer\u2019s account). When a firm is registered both as a securities broker-dealer with SEC and an FCM with CFTC, known as being \u201cdually-registered,\u201d it must comply with both agencies\u2019 regulations. However, a dually-registered firm is required to meet only the capital standard that would cause it to hold the most capital. SEC offers this method to broker-dealers as a voluntary alternative (with self-regulatory organization approval) to the basic net capital requirement. This method is based on the broker-dealers\u2019 responsibilities to customers rather than aggregate indebtedness. Reversion to the basic method by the broker-dealer requires SEC\u2019s approval. This option (most commonly used by large broker-dealers because it can result in a lower net capital requirement than under the basic method), in conjunction with Rule 15c3-3 (discussed below), is designed to ensure that sufficient liquid capital exists to return all property (assets\u2014funds and securities) to customers, repay all creditors, and have a sufficient amount of capital remaining to pay the administrative costs of a liquidation if the broker-dealer fails. The broker-dealer\u2019s ability to return customer property is addressed by Rule 15c3-3. The repayment of creditors and the payment of the broker-dealer\u2019s liquidation expenses is addressed by the 2 percent of customer-related receivables net capital requirement and the deductions from net worth for illiquid assets and risk in securities and commodities positions.
