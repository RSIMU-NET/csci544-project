Since that time, the federal government has made some progress in cleaning up sites that have been labeled as the worst in the nation, and the states have identified and cleaned up additional hazardous waste sites. However, thousands more sites have not yet been addressed at either the federal or the state level. To manage these sites, states began to develop new voluntary cleanup programs that would leverage private funds to pay for cleanups and return the sites to productive use."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal and State Hazardous Waste Cleanup Policies", "paragraphs": ["Under Superfund, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established a process for assessing hazardous waste sites, selecting appropriate techniques for cleaning them up, constructing cleanup methods or remedies, and maintaining the remedies. The law requires EPA to develop and maintain a list of hazardous sites it considers to be the most seriously contaminated, known as the National Priorities List (NPL). If EPA, a state, or any other party identifies a contaminated site, the site can be referred to EPA, which in turn includes it in the agency\u2019s inventory of potential sites. Once in the inventory, the site is assessed to determine whether it is contaminated seriously enough to be placed on the NPL.", "The law makes parties responsible for the contamination\u2014including current and former site owners and site operators, waste generators, and waste transporters\u2014liable for cleanup costs. The federal government may take action to compel a responsible party to perform or pay for a cleanup. Under Superfund, any party that contributed to the contamination, even if this action was legal at the time, is liable and under certain circumstances may be held responsible for the entire cost of the cleanup. EPA may also use the Superfund trust fund, supported primarily by a tax on crude oil and certain chemicals, to pay for the cleanup and then seek reimbursement from responsible parties. Under EPA\u2019s regulations, the fund may be used to finance long-term cleanups only at sites on the NPL. EPA may also use the fund to take short-term actions that address contamination at any site posing an imminent and substantial threat to human health and the environment, regardless of whether the site is included on the NPL.", "Over the past 16 years, the Congress has authorized a total of $15.2 billion to be appropriated from the Superfund. The NPL currently consists of about 1,300 sites. At the time of our review, remedies had been completed at 412 of these sites. EPA has also taken about 4,000 short-term cleanup actions. Approximately 70 percent of the cleanups at NPL sites are now funded by responsible parties, and EPA funds the remaining cleanups from the trust fund. EPA also has a list of about 12,000 sites in various stages of assessment to determine whether they meet NPL criteria, and it expects more sites to be identified and referred for its consideration.", "Forty-one states have followed the federal government\u2019s lead and established their own version of the Superfund law in order to identify and address sites not covered by the federal program. As a result, most states now have departments and staff dedicated to managing hazardous waste cleanups. The states generally address the thousands of sites that do not meet the risk criteria for placement on the NPL. In addition, a state may choose to forgo having EPA assess a site for placement on the NPL and, instead, handle it under the state\u2019s cleanup program. Some states have adopted liability provisions similar to Superfund\u2019s and have developed lists of sites in their state requiring cleanup. These states have relied primarily on enforcement actions against responsible parties to clean up sites, using state funds only to clean sites where responsible parties are recalcitrant or cannot be found.", "After over a decade of federal and state efforts, significant numbers of sites remain to be cleaned up. Because of limited resources, EPA and the states have targeted their enforcement and cleanup efforts to the worst sites on their lists. Furthermore, cities, lenders, developers, and others with an interest in returning contaminated sites to productive use have been reluctant to begin cleanups on their own because, under Superfund\u2019s or the state\u2019s liability provisions, they could then be held liable for entire cleanups. In addition, they might later be held liable for further cleanup actions at the sites if new or more contamination were discovered or stricter environmental standards were established."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Federal Actions to Encourage Voluntary Cleanups", "paragraphs": ["To encourage redevelopment and help clean up sites that have not yet been addressed, most states, in the last few years, have created voluntary cleanup programs. In contrast to the state cleanup programs that rely on enforcement to compel cleanups by responsible parties, these programs allow volunteers, such as site owners or developers, to approach the state and initiate cleanups on their own. As a result, volunteers can avoid the delays and costs associated with the enforcement process and conduct cleanups within the time frames needed for redevelopment or sale. Once a volunteer has completed a cleanup, a state typically certifies that the cleanup meets the state\u2019s requirements and standards, giving the volunteer some assurance that the state is unlikely to require further cleanup in the future.", "Voluntary programs were a natural outgrowth of property transfer laws that many states already had in place. These laws require property owners to disclose whether their property is contaminated with hazardous wastes, either by including this information in the deed or by notifying the potential purchaser directly. However, disclosing the existence of contamination sometimes prevented property sales because of the uncertainty surrounding the cost of cleanup. Voluntary cleanup programs provided owners or buyers with a method for assessing the existing contamination and cleaning it up on their own while affording some assurance that the state would be unlikely to impose additional cleanup requirements at a later date. This arrangement allowed property transactions to move forward.", "Because voluntary programs are likely to produce more cleanups than the states can compel under their enforcement programs alone, the states can also benefit from these programs. However, sites with low development potential\u2014such as those in areas with inadequate infrastructure, high taxes, crime, congestion, or other problems\u2014 are unlikely candidates for voluntary cleanups. The states will have to continue handling these types of sites, as well as any others they exclude from their voluntary programs, through traditional enforcement cleanup programs.", "EPA saw state voluntary cleanup programs as a way to leverage the limited state and federal resources available for hazardous waste cleanups. The agency is currently drafting guidance for establishing agreements with states that would specify, for programs meeting EPA\u2019s criteria, that generally EPA will plan to take further action at sites in a state\u2019s voluntary program only in limited circumstances. By reducing the threat of federal Superfund liability, these agreements could increase potential volunteers\u2019 interest in the programs. In addition, EPA has allowed states to use funds from their fiscal year 1995 and 1996 Superfund cooperative agreements with the agency to develop voluntary programs.", "The Congress has also taken actions to encourage voluntary cleanups of hazardous waste sites. Lenders had feared being named as a responsible party if they foreclosed on a contaminated property. In 1996, the Congress passed legislation limiting lenders\u2019 liability at contaminated sites. As a result, lenders may be more willing to finance projects to redevelop or clean up contaminated sites.", "At the same time states began developing voluntary programs, the federal government\u2019s interest in redeveloping brownfields began to grow. Brownfields are abandoned or underused facilities, usually in industrial or commercial areas, where redevelopment has been hampered by real or perceived environmental contamination. Voluntary cleanup programs are viewed as an important tool for facilitating the redevelopment of brownfields because they allow owners and developers to identify potentially valuable sites and clean them up independently. EPA took several initiatives to encourage the redevelopment of these sites. For example, the agency funded 78 pilot brownfields projects around the country to promote creativity in addressing these types of sites. In addition, to reduce the stigma of association with the Superfund program, EPA classified approximately 29,000 sites from its inventory of potential NPL sites as needing no further action. To focus national attention on brownfields, EPA convened a series of conferences about them and created an interagency working group to draft a coordinated federal brownfield policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairmen of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and its Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment asked us to review state voluntary cleanup programs.

These 15 states constitute over 40 percent of the 35 states that we found had created voluntary programs nationwide. The 15 states were California, Colorado, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Massachusetts and Washington each administer two different voluntary cleanup programs, which we included in our research, for a total of 17 programs in 15 states. We conducted a telephone survey with the managers of the 17 programs and asked them for information on their program\u2019s success in achieving cleanups. We also reviewed materials on the programs that they provided.", "To evaluate these programs\u2019 organization, funding, and major characteristics, we surveyed officials in the 17 programs and asked them to compare the procedural and cleanup requirements of their state\u2019s voluntary cleanup program with those of their state\u2019s enforcement program. We also interviewed national representatives of lenders; developers; and environmental, state, and community development organizations about their experiences with voluntary programs. We reviewed studies on voluntary cleanups conducted by other organizations.", "To determine the effects of federal hazardous waste policies on voluntary cleanups and the types of federal assistance that could help the states develop effective voluntary cleanup programs, we reviewed EPA\u2019s and the Congress\u2019s efforts to support voluntary programs. We surveyed officials of the 17 voluntary programs to obtain their opinions on the current federal efforts and asked them whether the federal government could provide any additional assistance. We interviewed officials in 13 states that currently do not have a voluntary program about their plans for creating one.

Without the voluntary programs, these cleanups would generally not have occurred because the federal and state enforcement programs have not had the resources to support them. Voluntary cleanups can be completed more quickly than cleanups under state enforcement programs, according to state officials, because the voluntary approach eliminates some of the cleanup and enforcement steps. For the same reasons, voluntary cleanups are also less costly for both the states and volunteers. As a result, voluntary cleanups are encouraging economic redevelopment, including that of former industrial sites known as brownfields, by expediting the sites\u2019 return to productive use."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Volunteers Identify and Clean Up More Sites", "paragraphs": ["All of the 17 voluntary programs we reviewed reported identifying and cleaning up significant numbers of sites. Officials for each program we reviewed said that their state\u2019s voluntary program is addressing more potentially contaminated sites than their state\u2019s enforcement program alone could have accomplished. (See fig 2.1.)", "The number of completed cleanups varied from program to program, in part because of differences in the ages of the programs, the attractiveness of the incentives they offered, and the ability of the states to track cleanups (some programs do not learn about voluntary cleanups until after the cleanups have been completed). For example, at the time of our survey, four cleanups had been completed through Tennessee\u2019s voluntary program, which is relatively new (1994) and offers fairly limited incentives, whereas 198 cleanups had been completed through Illinois\u2019 8-year-old program, which offers more incentives. New Jersey and Massachusetts, with the highest numbers of voluntary cleanups, have large staffs devoted to hazardous waste cleanups and long histories of administering these cleanups.", "Voluntary programs address sites that the federal or state enforcement programs could not manage, given their existing cleanup workloads and resources. For example, according to an EPA study, the states in our review had identified about 54,000 sites that could be contaminated enough to merit cleanup under the states\u2019 enforcement cleanup programs. EPA has approximately 12,000 sites that have been identified and await evaluation and approximately 1,300 evaluated sites that have been placed on the NPL and remain to be addressed. Since both the states and the federal government have limited program resources, they will not be able to address all of these sites at once. When volunteers clean up these sites, they free the government programs\u2019 resources for other sites.", "State officials attributed the success of their voluntary programs to the incentives these programs typically provide to attract participants, including (1) relief under state law from future liability\u2014and therefore relief from the risk of incurring additional costs\u2014for past contamination; (2) clearly defined cleanup standards that identify the extent of the necessary cleanup\u2014and therefore the time and costs involved\u2014at the start of a cleanup; and (3) reduced paperwork and cleanup requirements. These incentives allow volunteers to predict their costs and estimate their long-term responsibility for a site more accurately, improving their ability to weigh the costs and benefits of a cleanup and determine whether to make the investment.", "Besides promoting cleanups, voluntary programs have encouraged owners to identify contaminated properties. Every state program official said that volunteers have identified and cleaned up hazardous waste sites that the state had not known of or had not listed as priorities for cleanup before the volunteers initiated the cleanups. Since owners can better assess the cleanup actions and costs they will face under voluntary cleanup programs, they are more willing to notify state officials of their contaminated sites and take action. Two voluntary cleanup programs have explicitly allowed volunteers to assess sites where contamination has been perceived, determine that no contamination is present, and certify the sites as clean if they meet the state\u2019s cleanup standards and need no additional action. This certification helps to remove the stigma of association with hazardous waste at these sites and encourages owners and developers to enter them into the real estate market. Two states reported that such sites represent a substantial portion of the sites in their programs. According to the managers of the Illinois and Minnesota voluntary programs, about half of their completed sites fall into this category."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voluntary Cleanups Cost Less and Take Less Time", "paragraphs": ["Because voluntary programs have fewer paperwork and oversight requirements than enforcement programs, they cost less both for the state and for volunteers, according to officials in every program we reviewed. The states receive funding for their programs by charging volunteers to participate, so their programs are, to some extent, privately financed. Volunteers either pay a fee when they apply for the program or reimburse the state for its costs of overseeing the cleanup. The states also avoid the costs, incurred under enforcement programs, of investigating sites, identifying responsible parties, legally compelling these parties to perform cleanups, and trying to recover their costs. All of the state program officials said that cleanup costs were lower for volunteers than for parties compelled to clean up a site through an enforcement program, although the managers could not quantify the savings. Volunteers avoid the legal costs of responding to an enforcement action and can scale back or eliminate some cleanup steps, according to these officials.", "The less adversarial, more streamlined voluntary process also leads to faster cleanups, according to cleanup managers of the voluntary programs we reviewed. For example, according to Texas cleanup managers, a voluntary cleanup is typically completed within 1 year of a site\u2019s entering the program. Massachusetts\u2019 programs provide specific incentives for volunteers to complete a cleanup within 1 year of discovering contamination. Cleanups are also completed faster because 11 of the 17 voluntary programs set deadlines for reviewing and approving volunteers\u2019 plans and cleanup activities. For example, program officials must often approve a site\u2019s cleanup plan within 30 to 60 days of the plan\u2019s submission. As a result, some states have given very high priority to their voluntary program. Officials in Delaware, Washington, and Wisconsin said that they sometimes give higher priority to overseeing voluntary cleanups than to overseeing state-initiated cleanups because their voluntary programs have shorter time requirements and the volunteers are paying for the oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voluntary Cleanups Lead to Property Redevelopment", "paragraphs": ["Officials in all 17 voluntary programs we reviewed said that their program has restored some unused or underused sites to productive use. Since the cleanups are self-initiated, volunteers can identify potentially valuable pieces of contaminated property for cleanup and target them for redevelopment. The reduced costs and time for cleanup are making the voluntary cleanup and redevelopment of some contaminated sites a viable investment option. Most of these voluntary programs also limit a volunteer\u2019s future liability under state law for a site\u2019s contamination once the site has been cleaned according to the program\u2019s requirements, reducing the risk that the volunteer will face future cleanup costs.", "These incentives to clean up and redevelop sites are especially important for brownfields, the former industrial properties whose redevelopment is hampered by contamination. Several of the voluntary programs we reviewed provided incentives targeted specifically to these sites. Without voluntary programs that set out a method for evaluating and cleaning up these sites, developers may find it easier and cheaper to locate on \u201cgreenfields\u201d\u2014undeveloped property in suburban or outlying areas. By redeveloping brownfields, cities and states hope to boost employment and tax revenue in central urban districts and reduce suburban sprawl.", "Voluntary program managers reported that new businesses have located on some of the brownfield sites addressed through voluntary programs. Examples of successful redevelopment projects include the following:", "Chicago\u2019s brownfield program cleaned up a closed wire-manufacturing facility in cooperation with the Illinois voluntary cleanup program. The site contained underground tanks and vaults filled with solvents and fuel oil that had to be removed. The city then sold the property to an adjacent fuel pump manufacturer, Blackstone Manufacturing. Blackstone built a secured parking lot on the site, allowing the business to add an extra shift of workers and increase production.", "The Cellular One Corporation cleaned up several adjacent lots in New Berlin, Wisconsin, through the Wisconsin Land Recycling Program. The lots had been used for a variety of businesses, including those that repaired, maintained, and stored heavy vehicles. The site had a history of chemical spills, and the ground was contaminated with waste oil sludge, underground and aboveground storage tanks, and miscellaneous debris. Now that the soil has been excavated and treated and the tanks and debris removed, Cellular One plans to build a warehouse and office building on the site.", "Occidental Chemical Corporation operated a facility in Clarksville, Indiana, from 1950 to 1992. The facility, which manufactured laundry detergents, produced sodium and potassium phosphate products and phosphoric acid. The facility\u2019s cleanup was conducted under the Indiana voluntary cleanup program and consisted of demolishing all existing structures and removing over 25,000 cubic yards of soil contaminated with arsenic and phosphorus. Occidental then sold the 26-acre property to a real estate developer after receiving a covenant-not-to-sue from Indiana. A retail developer bought the site and constructed a large retail shopping center.", "Thonet Manufacturing produced furniture in York, Pennsylvania, until the facility burned in 1993. A volunteer cleaned the property under Pennsylvania\u2019s cleanup program, removing debris from the fire, paint containers and other drums, soil contaminated with lead and benzene, and asbestos.

For example, some states established independent voluntary programs, while others combined their voluntary and enforcement programs or relied solely on a voluntary approach to cleanup. While all voluntary programs collected fees from participants to fund their voluntary activities, most programs also used some state support. Although nearly all of the voluntary programs relied on incentives\u2014rather than enforcement\u2014to encourage the transfer and economic redevelopment of potentially contaminated properties, these incentives differed from program to program. Whereas nearly all of the voluntary programs admitted sites contaminated enough to qualify for federal cleanup, two programs managed such sites only through the federal or their state\u2019s enforcement program. A few voluntary programs were more willing than others to release participants from further liability for contamination after completing cleanups. All of the 17 programs reduced the requirements they imposed on cleanups to attract participants, but the changes varied extensively.

Ten of these programs have negotiated agreements with EPA which state that the agency will generally not plan to take further action at sites involved in the program except in limited circumstances. Figure 1 shows the status of voluntary cleanup programs throughout the nation at the time of our review.", "Most of the voluntary cleanup programs we reviewed were administered either as part of a state\u2019s Superfund program or as an alternative to it. Ten of the 17 programs were managed by the same staff who managed the enforcement program, 5 were managed by separate staff, and 2 had almost or fully taken the place of the enforcement program. Pennsylvania relied on its voluntary cleanup program for most of its cleanups, and Colorado had no enforcement program\u2014all nonfederal cleanups in the state were voluntary.", "All of the voluntary programs we reviewed charged volunteers a fee to help cover the costs of administering the program and overseeing the cleanups; however, the amount and type of the fee varied. For example, some of the programs charged volunteers a fee to apply for participation. This fee, which ranged from $200 to $5,000, covered the states\u2019 oversight costs to varying degrees. Other state programs billed volunteers directly to cover their oversight costs for such activities as reviewing the reports that volunteers submit and visiting the sites. (See table 3.1.)", "Not all of the programs we reviewed charged volunteers enough to fully finance their program and had to cover some costs from their general revenues, hazardous waste cleanup funds, and/or federal Superfund cooperative agreement funds. Colorado\u2019s program, for example, can charge a fee of up to $2,000, but this amount may not suffice to cover the costs of overseeing some cleanups. When the fee is insufficient for a Colorado site, the state and the volunteer agree to divide the site into parts, and the volunteer pays an application fee for each part. In Ohio, the program borrowed from the state\u2019s general fund to pay its start-up costs. Low initial participation has since precluded the program from paying for itself or paying back the loan. In contrast, Minnesota\u2019s program charges $75 to $90 per hour for oversight, depending on the salary levels of the staff assigned to the project and an overhead factor.

However, the voluntary programs differed, for example, in the types of sites and in the types of volunteers they allowed to participate in their programs.

Several of these managers expressed their willingness to rely on volunteers who are ready and able to clean up such sites as a means of returning the sites to productive use. The other two programs would not admit such sites because, according to their managers, sites with this level of contamination are more appropriately addressed under a state or federal enforcement program.

First, EPA has been adding fewer sites to the federal Superfund program. Second, EPA recently issued a policy stating its intent to consult with a state\u2019s governor and environmental agency officials before including a site on the NPL, even though a 1996 legislative requirement to obtain the governor\u2019s concurrence has expired. In addition, as we reported in March 1996, some states still have undiscovered sites and significant numbers of sites awaiting assessment to determine the extent of their contamination. For example, a cleanup manager in Illinois reported that environmental officials were still identifying sites that were contaminated enough to qualify for the federal cleanup program.", "Besides restricting the types of sites allowed to participate, some voluntary programs restricted the types of participants. These programs cited the principle that the polluter should pay for the cleanup and not reap certain benefits of voluntary programs, such as significant releases from liability. For example, Delaware and Wisconsin provide less comprehensive releases from liability for responsible parties than for parties that did not contribute to contamination.

Most\u2014but not all\u2014of these programs included language in the certificate releasing the volunteer from further liability for past contamination.", "The third approach, a no-further-action letter, was used by 11 programs. The letter certifies, on the basis of the state\u2019s review of information from the volunteer, that the state does not expect to require further action of the volunteer. The letter does not, in most cases, excuse the volunteer from further liability.

For example, five programs allowed volunteers to use grant funds to subsidize the costs of site assessments or cleanups. Four programs also offered low-cost loans for these purposes in some cases. Four programs provided tax incentives for voluntary cleanups, including tax abatements or tax credits, and targeted these incentives to specific localities and activities. Two programs made tax increment financing available specifically for voluntary cleanups that resulted in redevelopment in certain localities.", "Eight programs did not offer financial incentives at this time.

Participants in these programs generally must meet the requirements by selecting one of three approaches for achieving an appropriate level of cleanup: the amount of a chemical that naturally existed in the local soil and groundwater before the contamination occurred; the cleanup standard established by the state for a contaminant, based on a determination of the maximum amount of the contaminant that can remain in soil or water without posing a risk to public health or the environment: The state analyzes the toxicity of the contaminant and the likelihood that people will be exposed to it to establish this cleanup standard; or the amount of cleanup necessary to control the unique risks posed by a particular contaminant at a particular site, as determined by a formal assessment of that site\u2019s risks. This cleanup level may differ from site to site.", "Officials from several voluntary programs told us that volunteers often select the second approach, cleaning up a site to the state\u2019s established standards. While the first approach sometimes requires the volunteer to restore the site to \u201cpristine\u201d levels and the third approach is uncertain and sometimes costly, the second approach enables the volunteer, at the outset, to estimate the extent and the cost of the cleanup.", "Both the second and third approaches also allow volunteers to link the cleanup standard to the use planned for the site. The standards are less stringent and less expensive to meet if the land will be used for industrial rather than residential purposes because people\u2019s exposure to the site\u2019s contamination will be more limited. The standards for industrial use are often appropriate because many sites are redeveloped for commercial or industrial purposes. Traditionally, the sites cleaned up under the federal Superfund program more often had to meet the most stringent standard for residential land use. In our review, we found that volunteers in 10 of the 17 programs used industrial standards most frequently for their cleanups. (See table 3.5.)", "After selecting a level of cleanup, a volunteer must select a method of cleanup. The federal Superfund program establishes a preference for methods that result in a site\u2019s permanent cleanup. Voluntary programs have not always adopted this preference for permanence, giving volunteers less expensive options to encourage their participation. A permanent remedy either removes or treats contamination in order to meet the applicable cleanup standards. A nonpermanent remedy typically prevents human contact with contamination by containing the waste\u2014by, for example, placing a clay cap or a parking lot over contaminated soil, restricting the land\u2019s use, or placing barriers around the contamination. Permanent remedies tend to be more expensive to implement than nonpermanent ones. The cleanup managers for 8 of the 17 programs we reviewed estimated that nonpermanent methods were used for at least half of their voluntary cleanups of contaminated soil. (See table 3.6.)", "Some voluntary programs do not require the cleanup of contaminated groundwater. For example, to attract volunteers, some programs grant an exemption from their groundwater cleanup requirements if a volunteer can demonstrate that the waste at a site is not causing the contamination.Because groundwater cleanups are usually expensive and time-consuming, this exemption is an important incentive. It allows volunteers to control cleanup costs and increases the likelihood that investing in a site\u2019s redevelopment will prove to be cost-effective.", "Some voluntary programs also allow partial soil cleanups. For example, New Jersey\u2019s program allows a volunteer to evaluate a site and clean up only the portion of a property that is to be redeveloped and to leave the remainder of the property untreated. In Illinois, a volunteer may decide to clean up just one of several chemicals at a site and receive a certification for that chemical alone. At a Superfund or state enforcement site, the cleanup would typically address all of the chemicals that threaten human health or the environment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Programs Vary in Providing for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Less Permanent Cleanups", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in 1995, the types of nonpermanent remedies used in many voluntary cleanup programs need ongoing monitoring and maintenance after the remedies have been implemented to ensure that they remain effective. Such activities can include mowing, inspecting, and repairing a clay cap; periodically sampling groundwater to ensure that chemicals are not leaching into it from the soil or migrating off-site; and inspecting and repairing signs and fences. Also, nonpermanent remedies premised on the restricted use of the land need a method to guarantee that the restrictions are maintained. The voluntary programs we reviewed varied considerably in their requirements for monitoring a site after its cleanup has been approved. (See app. II for a description of each state\u2019s monitoring requirements.) As table 3.7 shows, 2 programs required extensive monitoring, 5 programs required no monitoring, and 10 programs required some monitoring.", "Two of the programs we reviewed monitored cleanups at voluntary sites on a regular basis. Every 5 years, the voluntary program in California and the ordered site program in Washington review sites where follow-on operations and maintenance are necessary or land use is restricted. This approach parallels the Superfund program\u2019s requirement that EPA conduct 5-year reviews of similar cleanups. Officials in these states said they would not feel comfortable releasing volunteers from liability unless the volunteers performed some monitoring.", "Five programs did not provide for active monitoring by state officials after cleanup, even though most of these programs reported that volunteers used either industrial cleanup standards or nonpermanent cleanup methods for at least half of their sites. The program managers cited trade-offs between limiting volunteers\u2019 choices of remedies and monitoring the remedies closely, on the one hand, and achieving high levels of participation, on the other. The Illinois official we spoke with partly attributed the significant numbers of participants in the state\u2019s voluntary program to the availability of alternative remedies and limited monitoring requirements. According to the managers, the large number of cleanups accomplished through their voluntary programs preclude monitoring every site.", "Instead of monitoring these sites themselves, the five voluntary programs generally relied on the private real estate market to enforce maintenance and land-use restrictions. When these programs certified a cleanup\u2019s completion or released a volunteer from future state liability, they generally stipulated in the certification that it would be revoked if the land\u2019s use changed or the cleanup method were not maintained. The program managers consider this stipulation sufficient to guarantee compliance because it would be discovered during the investigation preceding a site\u2019s sale. They argue that if a volunteer does not comply, purchasers and developers will not choose the site for fear that the cleanup certification will be revoked and they will face liability for further action at the site.", "The remaining 10 programs have tried to strike a balance between fairly rigorous and no requirements for monitoring after cleanup. Although these programs do not perform on-site reviews, they do require volunteers to periodically file reports on the conditions at sites with nonpermanent remedies. Compliance with these requirements is generally a condition of retaining the state\u2019s limits on the volunteer\u2019s future liability. For example, the Ohio voluntary program implements an operations and maintenance agreement with the volunteer that requires reporting in exchange for a state covenant not to sue the volunteer for past contamination at a completed site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Programs Provided for a Range of Cleanup Oversight", "paragraphs": ["To speed cleanups and attract participants, most voluntary programs require less oversight than enforcement programs. Both the federal and state governments typically oversee their enforcement program\u2019s cleanups by requiring parties to submit their workplans and progress reports for review or by independently sampling and visiting sites. These procedures provide the enforcement agencies with important information on the quality and adequacy of the cleanups. In comparison, the amount of oversight for voluntary cleanups provided by the programs we reviewed ranged from extensive to minimal. (See app. III for a description of each state\u2019s oversight requirements.) A few program managers in our survey reported providing substantially less oversight for their voluntary cleanups than for their enforcement cleanups. In contrast, several programs based their level of oversight on the characteristics of a site or reduced their oversight at certain stages of a cleanup when it was not critical to ensuring the cleanup\u2019s effectiveness.", "As table 3.8 indicates, five of the voluntary programs we reviewed provided for extensive oversight of voluntary cleanups, three programs required little oversight, and nine programs varied the level of oversight with the sites\u2019 hazards or stage in the cleanup process.", "The five voluntary programs that provide for extensive oversight of cleanups generally apply essentially the same requirements as their state applies to enforcement cleanups. These voluntary programs typically require participants to submit status reports at each stage of the cleanup\u2014when assessing the nature of the site\u2019s contamination, preparing a cleanup plan, and documenting the final cleanup. Officials from these states\u2019 programs usually visit a site during a cleanup to determine whether the volunteer is completing the work according to the workplan. When the cleanup is complete, they may verify the volunteer\u2019s final report by inspecting the site or by analyzing soil or water samples that they have taken to ensure that the cleanup meets the agreed-upon standards. According to one program manager in a state that releases volunteers from future liability, this level of oversight is important because the state may inherit responsibility for the site if the cleanup later proves to be inadequate. Oversight is also necessary because volunteers want to keep their costs as low as possible and the state needs to ensure that cost-cutting measures do not jeopardize the quality of the cleanup.", "At the other end of the spectrum, three of the voluntary cleanup programs we reviewed\u2014the Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Washington IRAP programs\u2014provide little oversight for some or all of their cleanups, even though some of these programs admit sites that could meet the criteria for federal cleanup. For the majority of their sites, these three programs require few reports, seldom require site visits, and do not require verification of a volunteer\u2019s final cleanup report through a site visit or other means. The Washington IRAP program, for example, which has approved 225 voluntary cleanups, allows a volunteer to clean up a site without obtaining the state\u2019s approval or agreement. The program does not oversee the cleanup, but instead reviews the volunteer\u2019s final report to determine whether the cleanup meets the state\u2019s standards. Similarly, for the majority of Pennsylvania\u2019s voluntary sites that use state-established or background cleanup standards, the volunteer is required to submit a final report upon completing a cleanup. A volunteer demonstrating compliance with applicable cleanup standards is relieved of further liability under state law for the contamination addressed by the cleanup and may not be sued either by citizens or by other parties connected with the site\u2019s contamination. All of the voluntary programs requiring little oversight also limit the time available for oversight by providing for the automatic approval of reports that have not been reviewed on time.", "According to the managers of these three programs, limiting oversight to attract participants is necessary and appropriate because voluntary cleanups usually address less contaminated sites than enforcement cleanups. Limiting oversight is further appropriate, managers in Colorado and Pennsylvania said, because voluntary programs are cooperative in nature. Volunteers want the certificate of completion and the release from liability that the state offers so they can use their properties; therefore, according to these managers, they are likely to do good work and provide the state with reliable information. Moreover, in the Pennsylvania program, for example, the liability release can be reopened if new contamination is discovered. As a result, the quality of the information provided by the volunteer is critical. The Colorado program manager also maintained that site visits would be too costly.", "Nine of the voluntary programs have taken a variable approach to oversight that, they maintain, provides them with good information about cleanups without deterring participation. These programs have either reduced their oversight at certain stages or concentrated on more hazardous sites. They require volunteers to submit reports throughout the cleanup process but generally perform fewer site visits than the programs that provide for more extensive oversight. Some volunteers want the additional assurance of a cleanup\u2019s adequacy that a site visit provides. New Jersey provides less oversight for small, less complex soil cleanups and more oversight for complex soil and groundwater cleanups and for longer cleanups. Minnesota bases the number of site visits on the severity of the contamination and the level of cooperation with the volunteer. Seven of these nine voluntary programs approve the final cleanup report submitted by the volunteer but do not independently verify the data because, as two managers explained, they believe the frequent reporting throughout the cleanup process has given them ample information about the quality of the cleanup. Tennessee, on the other hand, varies the number of reports it requires with the conditions at a site, but takes split samples at all sites, either during the cleanup or afterward, to verify the final report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "One-Half of the Programs Limit Opportunities for Public Participation", "paragraphs": ["The voluntary programs we reviewed varied in their requirements for public participation, from those that always required formal public comments to those that made no provision for informing the public about the cleanup.

In contrast, the Superfund program requires anyone conducting a long-term cleanup to give the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed cleanup plan. Public participation is required to assure an affected community that the planned cleanup actions will adequately address the risks that a site poses to public health and the environment. According to one observer and representatives of environmental groups, public participation can be especially important for sites with nonpermanent remedies because the public can help to identify the safeguards that will help keep people away from the contamination. Representatives from community action organizations pointed out that public participation is particularly important for voluntary programs when other checks and balances on cleanups, such as monitoring and oversight, have been reduced.", "As table 3.9 indicates, three of the voluntary programs we surveyed always required public participation, eight required little or no participation, and the remaining five varied their requirements with the conditions at individual sites.", "Three programs always require volunteers to consider how best to inform and involve the public in cleanup issues. The Indiana and Washington ordered site programs, much like the Superfund program, require volunteers to obtain and respond to public comments on cleanup plans. Volunteers may also be required to hold public meetings. In California, volunteers must prepare a community profile and work with state officials to determine appropriate avenues for public participation based on that profile and the site\u2019s projected activities.", "In contrast, eight programs require little public participation. Five require none, and three require only the publication in a local newspaper of a notice about the cleanup. However, as we noted in a 1994 report, newspaper notices are ineffective because community members do not always see them. Nevertheless, according to the managers of these voluntary cleanup programs and volunteers, the programs\u2019 requirements for public participation are sufficient because most of the enrolled sites are only lightly contaminated and are located in industrial neighborhoods. These program managers do not view the Superfund model for public participation as appropriate for voluntary cleanup programs. They maintain that requiring extensive public participation would be counterproductive, adding unnecessary time and costs to cleanups and discouraging volunteers. Program managers in Illinois and New Jersey point out that arranging public meetings and obtaining public comments is very time-consuming. Moreover, according to one state official, the owners of contaminated sites are often anxious to rid themselves of the environmental liability associated with their site and do not wish to publicize its hazards. Finally, other officials explained that a volunteer planning to redevelop a site will have to obtain the approval of local officials, who are responsible for and answer to their constituents.", "The six remaining voluntary programs agree that extensive public participation may not be necessary at every site and have tailored their public participation requirements to site-specific conditions. As discussed, several of these voluntary programs admit sites that are contaminated enough to qualify for the federal Superfund program and its more extensive public participation requirements. Texas requires a volunteer to notify neighboring property owners if the contamination at a site is found to exceed the state\u2019s cleanup standards or if contamination could migrate from the site. Missouri requires the volunteer to hold a public hearing if the state plans to provide a covenant-not-to-sue. The Massachusetts and Tennessee programs require public meetings only if local officials or the public request them.

Most states and volunteers are therefore interested in having EPA clarify the circumstances under which it would be likely to use its authority. For its part, EPA believes that it needs to determine that a state\u2019s program is resulting in adequate cleanups before it agrees that it will not plan to take action at sites addressed by volunteers. Otherwise, if a remedy fails at a site cleaned up under a state\u2019s voluntary program and the volunteer has been granted a release from state liability, EPA may have to address the problem itself or compel the responsible parties to do so.

According to EPA officials, the memorandum establishes broad criteria in order to encompass a wide variety of voluntary programs. EPA expects that individual regional officials will use their own judgment to determine whether a particular program is meeting the criteria.
