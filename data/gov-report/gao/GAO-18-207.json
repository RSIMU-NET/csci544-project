Eleven federal agencies participate in the SBIR program, and 5 agencies also participate in the STTR program. Each program has three phases, which take projects from initial feasibility studies through commercialization activities. SBA oversees both programs.", "In response to the 2011 reauthorization of the programs, SBA and the participating agencies developed benchmarks to measure small businesses' progress in developing and commercializing technologies. GAO was asked to review SBA's and the agencies' efforts related to these benchmarks.

Small businesses that received more than 20 awards for the first phase of the programs in the past 5 fiscal years\u2014excluding the most recent fiscal year\u2014must have received an average of 1 award for the second phase of the programs for every 4 first phase awards. Since 2014, SBA and the agencies participating in the programs have regularly assessed small businesses against this benchmark. From 2014 through 2017, SBA determined that 4 to 7 businesses did not meet the benchmark each year. SBA officials provided GAO guidance on how to enter data into the programs' awards database they said is available to agencies, but GAO found evidence that suggests agencies are not fully utilizing it. For example, GAO found that the database used to perform the assessments contained inaccurate and incomplete data, such as about 2,700 businesses with multiple records with different spellings of their names and more than 1,400 instances in which a unique identification number had errors, such as an incorrect number of digits, all zeros, or hyphens. Thus, it could be difficult to determine which small businesses should be subject to the benchmark.", "Commercialization Benchmark. Small businesses that received more than 15 awards for the second phase of the programs in the past 10 fiscal years\u2014excluding the most recent 2 fiscal years\u2014must have received a certain amount of sales, investments, or patents resulting from their efforts. SBA and participating agencies have assessed small businesses against this benchmark only once, in 2014, and identified 12 businesses that did not meet the benchmark. This is, in part, due to challenges in collecting and verifying the accuracy of the data that small businesses report and that are needed to implement the benchmark, according to officials from SBA and several agencies. For example, agency officials told GAO that some needed data, such as for reported sales, are not consistently applicable across agencies or projects. The Small Business Act and policy directives provide flexibility in how the agencies can implement the benchmark. Working together to implement it as designed or revise it so that it can be implemented could allow the agencies to fulfill statutory requirements.", "SBA and the participating agencies have provided inconsistent information to small businesses about the consequence of not meeting the benchmarks. SBA and the agencies agreed to change how the consequence of not meeting the benchmarks was to be implemented, starting in 2017, from ineligibility to receive certain awards to ineligibility to submit certain proposals. However, as of November 2017, some agencies had not updated this information in their project solicitations. Furthermore, SBA has not updated this information in its policy directives. Without consistent information, businesses may be confused about their eligibility to submit proposals or receive awards and could invest time developing and submitting proposals when they are not eligible to do so."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 11 recommendations to SBA and other agencies to take actions to improve implementation of the benchmarks, including improving the reliability of award data; implementing or revising the Commercialization Benchmark; and updating information about the consequence of not meeting the benchmarks.

The STTR program was initiated a decade  later, in 1992, and has three main purposes: (1) stimulate technological  innovation, (2) foster technology transfer through cooperative R&D  between small businesses and research institutions, and (3) increase  private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D.", "The SBIR and STTR programs are similar in that participating agencies  identify topics for R&D projects and support small businesses, but the  STTR program requires the small business to partner with a nonprofit  research institution, such as a college or university or a federally funded  research and development center.", "Each participating agency must manage its SBIR and STTR programs in  accordance with program laws and regulations and the policy directives  issued by SBA. In general, the programs are similar across participating  agencies. All of the participating agencies follow the same general  process to obtain proposals from and make awards to small businesses  for both the SBIR and STTR programs. However, each participating  agency has considerable flexibility in designing and managing specific  aspects of these programs, such as determining research topics,  selecting award recipients, and administering funding agreements. At  least once a year, each participating agency issues a solicitation  requesting proposals for projects in topic areas determined by the  agency. Each participating agency uses its own process to review  proposals and determine which proposals should receive awards. The  agencies that participate in both SBIR and STTR programs usually use  the same process for both programs. Also, each participating agency  determines whether to provide the funding for awards as grants or  contracts.", "According to the policy directives, SBA maintains a system that records  SBIR and STTR award information\u2014using data submitted by the  agencies\u2014as well as commercialization information, such as information  about patents, sales, and investments reported by small businesses that  received these awards. SBA is to use these data to assess small  businesses that received awards against the benchmarks and identify any  small businesses that did not meet the benchmarks. SBA is to initially  assess the small businesses against the benchmarks and then in April of  each year notify those that do not meet the benchmarks so that the  businesses can review their award data and work with participating  agencies to correct the database if necessary. SBA then is to analyze the  award data again to identify, on June 1, those small businesses that still  do not meet the benchmarks. These small businesses are then ineligible  for certain awards from that date through May 31 of the following year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Challenges Have Limited the Implementation of the Benchmarks, and SBA and Participating Agencies Have Provided Inconsistent Information about the Consequence SBA and Participating Agencies Assessed Small Businesses against the Transition Rate Benchmark, but the Assessments Have Been Based on Inaccurate or Incomplete Data", "paragraphs": ["Data challenges have limited SBA\u2019s and the 11 participating agencies\u2019  efforts to fully implement the benchmarks. Since 2014, SBA and the  participating agencies have regularly assessed small businesses against  the Transition Rate Benchmark, but the assessments have been based  on inaccurate or incomplete data. SBA and the participating agencies  have assessed small businesses against the Commercialization  Benchmark only once, in 2014, because of challenges in collecting and  verifying the accuracy of data. In addition, SBA and the participating  agencies have provided inconsistent information to small businesses  about the consequence of not meeting the benchmarks.", "Since 2014, SBA and the participating agencies have regularly assessed  small businesses against the Transition Rate Benchmark, which, in  general, measures the rate at which businesses move projects from  phase I to phase II. From 2014 through 2017, SBA determined that 4 to  7 small businesses did not meet the benchmark each year and placed  those businesses on a list of those ineligible to receive certain additional  awards.", "However, we found instances in which the data used to generate the list  were inaccurate or incomplete. For example, we identified an instance in  which the data in the awards database changed considerably after SBA\u2019s  initial assessment, indicating that the data used for that assessment were  inaccurate. SBA\u2019s list of small businesses subject to the benchmark in  2015 showed that a small business received 297 phase I awards during  the assessment period. However, data received from SBA officials in  August 2017 showed that this small business received only 1 phase I  award. Agencies can update their data in the awards database at any  time to, for example, submit additional award data or correct previously  submitted award data, which is what an SBA official stated may have  caused this change. Because the small business received only 1 award, it  would not have been subject to the Transition Rate Benchmark. In this  case, the change meant that SBA did not miss identifying a small business that should have been ineligible for an award; however, in other  instances, changes to the data may lead SBA to miss identifying a small  business that should have been ineligible for awards.", "In addition, we identified instances in which the publicly available data on  awards were incomplete, including data that were missing or otherwise  unusable. For example, based on our review of the award data from 2007  through 2016, we identified more than 2,700 small businesses that had  multiple records with different spellings of the same business\u2019s name.  Furthermore, we identified more than 1,400 instances in which a unique  identification number had errors, such as having an incorrect number of  digits, all zeros, or hyphens. SBA officials told us that the quality of the  award information in the database has been an issue, and that accurate  information is important because small businesses may avoid being  identified as subject to the benchmark if their business names and  identification numbers are different across multiple records. For example,  if the database contains 18 phase I awards made within the assessment  period to a small business with a certain unique identification number but  also contains 3 other phase I awards within that period with a different or  missing unique identification number, the small business may avoid being  identified as subject to the benchmark because the data would suggest it  did not meet the threshold of receiving more than 20 phase I awards,  even if it did. As a result, it could be difficult to determine which small  businesses actually received more than 20 awards and should be subject  to the benchmark.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives, and SBA\u2019s Information Quality Guidelines state that SBA  seeks to ensure the quality, utility, and integrity of the information it  shares with the public, among other things. SBA\u2019s policy directives for  the SBIR and STTR programs state that SBA maintains a system that  records SBIR and STTR award information, which is publicly available,  and uses this information to calculate small businesses\u2019 performance  against the benchmark. SBA officials told us they depend on the accuracy  of the data received from the participating agencies to perform SBA\u2019s  assessment. These officials also acknowledged that confirming the  accuracy of SBA\u2019s annual assessments against the benchmarks has  been challenging because agencies can update their data over time. SBA  officials stated that they have sought to improve the quality of the data  after the data are entered into the database, such as fixing instances in  which small businesses\u2019 names were spelled differently across multiple  records; however, the officials said that correcting the data already  entered in the awards database is an ongoing and time-consuming  process. SBA officials told us that there are errors in the database, in part  because SBA has not worked with participating agencies to ensure that  agencies enter high-quality, accurate data into the database. SBA officials  provided us guidance on how to enter data that they said is available to  agencies, but the errors we found suggest that agencies are not fully  utilizing this guidance.

In addition, officials from 2  agencies told us that small businesses can easily circumvent the  benchmark by submitting incorrect data.", "The Small Business Act and the policy directives provide agencies  flexibility in how they can implement the Commercialization Benchmark.  Officials from participating agencies said that they thought the  Commercialization Benchmark should be revised, but they provided  differing views on how to do it. Officials from SBA and 2 agencies told us  that they would consider having individual agencies develop a benchmark  or metric tailored to their agency, in part because the definition of  successful commercialization could vary across the agencies. However,  officials acknowledged that collecting and verifying the accuracy of the  data would still be a concern with this approach. Officials from 2  participating agencies told us that collecting and verifying the accuracy of  the data is a significant amount of work, and officials from a third agency  added that implementing the benchmark independently is impractical  because they do not have the capability to track small businesses\u2019  commercialization efforts. Officials from 1 agency said they preferred to  keep a uniform benchmark across the agencies, in part because having  varying benchmarks could lead to a small business being eligible to  participate in the programs with one agency but not with another.  Although views differed across agencies, working together to find a way  to implement the benchmark as designed or revising it so that it can be  implemented could allow the agencies to fulfill the requirement in the  Small Business Act.", "Officials from 3 agencies told us they would prefer to consider  businesses\u2019 prior commercialization experience as part of their overall  evaluation of businesses\u2019 proposals, rather than implement the current  Commercialization Benchmark. The SBIR and STTR policy directives  currently allow agencies to define the benchmark in terms other than  revenue or investment, such as using a commercialization scoring system  that rates awardees on their past commercialization success. Defining the  benchmark in these terms could help agencies to implement the statutory  requirement. Officials from SBA said they see the value of allowing  reviewers to use professional judgment in determining the  commercialization success of applicants, rather than assessing small  businesses against standard criteria. Officials from 1 agency said that  such a change could help achieve the goal of the benchmark without the  challenges of collecting data from all small businesses participating in the  programs.", "Nine of the 11 participating agencies currently consider prior  commercialization experience as part of their evaluation when making  award selections (see table 2), which shows that evaluating  commercialization experience at individual agencies can be feasible. For  example, project solicitations from the Department of Agriculture, the  Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation state that  these agencies require applicants to provide sales or revenue information  for products resulting from SBIR or STTR awards, and the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s solicitation requires applicants to provide a history of  previous federal and nonfederal funding and subsequent  commercialization of their products.

SBA officials told us  that they and the participating agencies sought to change how to  implement the consequence of businesses not meeting the benchmarks  because of SBA\u2019s and agencies\u2019 difficulties in implementing the  benchmarks. Officials from 4 agencies said that they generally evaluate  and select awards shortly before SBA releases the list of ineligible  companies, leading them to potentially select projects from small  businesses that will be on the ineligible list by the time the award period  begins. Based on our review of award data from October 2014 to May  2017, we identified 13 phase I awards across 5 small businesses with  award start dates during the period that the business was ineligible to  receive such awards. According to agency officials, each of these awards  was selected before the small business became ineligible to receive the  award.

However, the most recent project solicitations available at  that time for 7 other agencies and the other subunit of the agency  mentioned above instead stated that those businesses that do not meet  the benchmarks are ineligible to receive certain awards, consistent with  the prior approach for how to implement the consequence.
