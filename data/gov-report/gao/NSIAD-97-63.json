Initially, the program concept was that each Army component of a unified command would individually plan and contract for its own logistics and engineering services.

The U.S. Army, Europe provides most of the U.S. force and is the major command responsible for the mission\u2019s logistics planning and funding. U.S. forces deployed in support of the implementation force were located in 4 countries and numbered approximately 22,200: about 16,200 in Bosnia, about 1,400 in Croatia, and about 4,600 in Hungary and Italy. Several factors created unique challenges for the Army as it implemented LOGCAP during the Bosnian mission. These factors related to the uncertainty of the U.S. role, the need for rapid deployment once the role was defined, and the harsh weather environment.

The Army\u2019s December 1995 estimate of the cost to provide these services for 1 year, which was developed by the contractor based on the Army\u2019s tasking, was $350.2 million. However, when the Department of Defense submitted its estimate of incremental costs for the Bosnia peacekeeping mission to Congress on February 23, 1996, it reduced the estimate to $191.6 million. The estimate was reduced because officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense believed there was duplication between the services the contractor would provide and the services military personnel would provide. However, Defense Department officials had no documentation supporting the $191.6 million estimate.

Other options to be considered by commanders before selecting LOGCAP include the other military services, allied support, and local contracting. In addition, commanders must consider other factors such as risk to personnel, lift availability, quality of life, and mission duration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Considered in Deciding to Use LOGCAP in Bosnia", "paragraphs": ["The key planning and resource considerations that led to the Army\u2019s decision to use LOGCAP were (1) troop ceilings for active and reserve forces, (2) engineering resources available in the Army force structure, (3) host nation support agreements, and (4) quality of life issues. According to U.S. Army, Europe officials responsible for planning the Bosnian mission, they initially identified a need for a force of 38,000 troops, including 20,000 combat troops. This number of combat troops was considered necessary because U.S. forces had to patrol a 1,200-mile zone between the formerly warring factions. Also, the Joint Chiefs of Staff told U.S. Army, Europe not to expect authorization for more than 25,000 troops: 20,000 in Bosnia and 5,000 in Croatia.", "U.S. Army, Europe also had a ceiling on the reserve forces it could use. For Bosnia, the President authorized the call-up of 4,300 reservists for all the services, 3,888 of which the Defense Department allocated to the Army. The Army used its allocation to activate key support capabilities such as civil affairs and psychological operations units that existed primarily in the reserve forces and could not be contracted. Once these units were activated, most of the 3,888-reserve ceiling had been used, leaving little opportunity to call up other types of support units. Many of the Army\u2019s combat support and combat service support units were in the guard and reserve. An Army planner told us they could have asked the national command authority to increase the force ceiling and reserve call-up authority; however, because they had LOGCAP as an option, it was not necessary to seek these increases to meet support needs.", "The Army also used some units from the other services. According to U.S. Army, Europe officials, the Army did not have enough engineering resources available for deployment to build all the required base camps in the time allotted and received assistance from Air Force and Navy engineering units. By managing the flow of forces into the theater to remain below the 25,000-force ceiling, they were able to use these units and Army engineer units to construct 15 of the base camps. When the initial construction was completed, these units left the area of operations and the remainder of the Army\u2019s force deployed.", "U.S. Army, Europe officials also told us that because the former Yugoslav Republic was not a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, U.S. Army, Europe had no preexisting support agreements in the region. Therefore, little consideration was given to obtaining host nation support to meet the requirements in excess of force ceilings.", "Army officials further stated that quality of life considerations and the fact that the Army lacked the capability to provide some services also favored the use of LOGCAP. For example, the Army\u2019s Deputy Commander for Support in Bosnia cited food and laundry services as areas where the contractor is able to provide a higher standard of service than Army units typically provide during deployments. LOGCAP also was able to provide services, such as sewage and solid waste disposal and janitorial services, that the Army routinely contracts for because the capability is not in the force structure."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Changes in Operational Requirements Largely Drove LOGCAP Cost Increases in Bosnia", "paragraphs": ["The estimated costs for LOGCAP implementation in Bosnia have increased substantially.

Our review shows that the difference in the Army\u2019s estimates was largely driven by changes in operational requirements once the forces arrived in Bosnia. Specifically, the Commander in Chief of U.S. Army, Europe decided to increase the number of base camps from 14 large camps to 34 smaller ones and to accelerate the schedule for upgrading troop housing.

A direct comparison of the two estimates was not possible because of significant differences in (1) the scope of work covered by the estimates and (2) the way costs are reported. For example, in the December 1995 estimate, the contractor estimated the cost to establish and operate an intermediate staging base. This estimate included costs for building the camp; providing laundry, food, and bus service; and operating a construction supply storage yard, a retail fuel section, and an aviation fuel section. The estimate also included costs for mobilizing and demobilizing personnel, material, and equipment and recurring maintenance costs. However, later estimates use 52 separate work categories that do not directly link to the requirements in the original estimate.

Estimated costs for troop housing and facilities rose from an original estimate of $56.5 million to $150.4 million. Our analysis of available data, discussions with Army and contractor officials, and observations of facilities indicated that costs increased largely because the scope of work performed by the contractor increased.", "The number of camps and facilities increased from the 14 large base camps originally planned to 34 smaller camps. In the original plan, the contractor was to build six base camps, one in Hungary and five in Bosnia, and upgrade the eight remaining camps. However, given the change in operational requirements, the contractor built 19 of the 34 camps and upgraded all 34 camps.", "Our discussions with the Commander in Chief of U.S. Army, Europe and his staff revealed that the commander decided to increase the number of camps required because of several factors. Two factors were the size of the U.S. area of responsibility (the United States had to patrol a 1,200-mile zone of separation between the warring factions), and the condition of the soil and limited infrastructure (a very wet and mine-filled terrain and devastated power, water, and communication systems). Other factors were the (1) need to balance force presence in each former warring factor\u2019s sector, (2) condition of the roads leading to potential base camp sites (the construction of new and long roads to potential sites was considered too expensive and raw materials were not available in sufficient quantities at the time), and (3) challenge of relocating former U.N. forces from fixed facilities and into their new areas of operation.", "A U.S. Army, Europe planner told us that conditions on the ground were not well known prior to deployment because U.S. personnel were not allowed into Bosnia until shortly before the operation started. The harsh weather conditions under which the construction took place and the increased requirement for equipment to provide services at the additional camps also increased cost. (See fig. 1 for U.S. base camps in the Balkan peninsula.)", "Estimated troop housing costs also increased because some services were not considered in the original estimate. For example, the contractor\u2019s initial cost estimate assumed that some of the camp sites selected by the Army would need only minimal site preparation. At one site alone, however, approximately 200 railcars of crushed rock were needed to prepare the ground before construction could begin. Many other sites also required significant engineering preparation. (See fig. 2.) Additionally, the initial estimate did not include all costs for the contractor to upgrade camps built by military engineer units. The contractor upgraded 15 of these camps.", "The decision to accelerate the schedule for improving the camps also increased estimated costs. The Army\u2019s December 1995 cost estimate was based on a plan in which both the contractor and the military engineer units would initially erect tents and construct rudimentary support facilities. The camps would then be upgraded by the contractor in two follow-on efforts. (See fig. 3.) In the first effort, the contractor would add wooden floors to the tents; provide lighting, heating, latrines, showers, electric power, and water; and build kitchen and dining facilities. In the second effort, the contractor would provide for level tent pads and tent frames with insulated walls and ceilings. However, a U.S. Army, Europe official told us that because of the harsh weather conditions, which included flooding and mud, the Commander in Chief decided to have the contractor go straight to the end-state standard for all camps and to increase the standard to modular housing units at several camps where conditions were particularly harsh. Because the contractor was not given additional time to meet the higher standards, significantly more equipment and material had to be commercially air transported into the area of operations.

For example, even though a combat support or combat service support function may be replaced by LOGCAP, the Army still has a need for staff supervision of the function.", "According to Army officials, doctrine and guidance on the use of LOGCAP are critical because using a contractor to support a deploying force represents a significant change from the experiences of most Army personnel. Typically, Army practice has been to make the force self-sustaining for the first 30 days in a contingency theater. In this environment, troops live under field conditions. Housing might consist of multiperson tents, toilets are primitive and shared, shower facilities are often nonexistent, and food is often a prepackaged ration.

Moreover, delays in negotiating estimated costs greatly hindered the Army\u2019s ability to evaluate the amount of award fee that the contractor had earned based on quality of performance. The Army Audit Agency explained that the Federal Acquisition Regulation prohibits contract provisions whereby a contractor\u2019s profits are based on the percentage of costs incurred (or costs plus a percentage of costs). For this reason, the regulation requires the contracting officer to negotiate the estimated costs of services being furnished by the contractor. The audit agency also noted that negotiating contract costs in a timely manner is important because (1) once the estimated costs are negotiated with the contractor, the award fee pool is limited to costs that do not exceed those that were negotiated and (2) until the estimate is formalized, the contractor has no real incentive to control costs because increased project costs potentially mean a higher award fee.", "According to the contractor, under the terms of the contract cost control constitutes 35 percent of the award fee and that factor alone is a clear incentive. The contractor also noted that the lack of a definitized estimate precludes the submission of invoices for base or award fee to the government. In the case of Bosnia, Brown and Root Services Corporation reported that it received no fee during the first 10 months of operation.", "The revised statement of work for the Bosnian mission was not approved until March 7, 1996, and the contractor provided a revised estimate on May 24, 1996. By that point, the estimated cost to complete work requested by U.S. Army, Europe stood at $477.4 million. Of this amount, about $325.7 million, or 68 percent, had already been spent. The Corps of Engineers and the contractor reached agreement on an estimated cost for Bosnia on August 12, 1996.", "The Army Audit Agency also found that the Corps and the Defense Contract Management District, International did not implement a systematic method of inspections to monitor contract performance. As a result, they could not ensure that the contractor performed work in accordance with contract provisions, used the minimum number of resources to meet the Army\u2019s requirements, and furnished the appropriate level of support. The Army Contracting Support Agency similarly concluded that not enough people were deployed in the early stages of the operation to monitor contractor performance for the same reasons. Contract oversight was similarly criticized in Somalia and Haiti. For example, a December 1994 Army Audit Agency report on LOGCAP operations in Haiti criticized quality control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Actions to Address Management Problems", "paragraphs": ["On October 1, 1996, the Army transferred LOGCAP management responsibilities from the Corps to AMC. AMC officials have worked with U.S. Army, Europe to identify problems experienced in Bosnia and they intend to make several program changes to improve planning and management and reduce costs. Specifically, they are taking or plan actions, including changing the planning scenarios, developing doctrine and guidance on LOGCAP and senior level training and education, and providing assistance to operating commands when LOGCAP is implemented.", "AMC awarded a new LOGCAP contract on January 30, 1997. The contract is for 1 year with the option of extending it for 4 more years, making the program available until 2002. One major change is that the contract pricing arrangement for the planning portion of the contract has been changed from cost-plus-award-fee to a firm-fixed price. According to the AMC program officer, this change was made because planning costs are easier to estimate than execution costs.", "AMC officials also said that, to improve planning, the new contractor will be required to prepare worldwide and regional plans under two specific hypothetical scenarios: (1) an underdeveloped country with little or no infrastructure and a weak or nonexistent government and (2) a developed country with infrastructure and a viable and diplomatically recognized government. AMC expects that tailoring these plans will enhance execution and improve cost controls during an actual event by better defining LOGCAP requirements.", "AMC has also undertaken several initiatives to address other LOGCAP problems experienced in Bosnia. To improve LOGCAP doctrine and training, AMC directed the U.S. Army Combined Arms Support Command to review and revise Army regulations and field manuals so they properly reflect the program\u2019s goals. The command is revising about 20 Army regulations and field manuals, and it expects to complete this task early in fiscal year 1998. One revised field manual, which was released in September 1996, contains an entire appendix that discusses only LOGCAP. In addition, AMC has asked the Combined Arms Support Command, the Army Command and General Staff College, the Sergeants Major Academy, and the Warrant Officer Career Center to create LOGCAP training courses. The Army hopes to begin providing this training to its senior level staff by the end of fiscal year 1997.", "To address the LOGCAP implementation problems experienced in Bosnia, AMC established logistics support teams to act as the single focal point with operational commands for LOGCAP planning and execution. The teams are to be located in the United States, Korea, and Germany and are to provide command staff advice on LOGCAP and its capabilities and help develop LOGCAP augmentation requirements when an operation is being planned. AMC expects that improving the planning process in this way will enhance cost controls by establishing more precise needs determinations, which will result in better planning and cost estimating to support these needs. In addition, AMC plans to establish and deploy a fully trained group of experts during the initial phases of an operation to provide technical and contractual support to commanders. The size and makeup of this team are flexible, however, and can include LOGCAP technical advisors; personnel, real estate, and communication/automation specialists; contracting and legal officers; pay agents; and planning and operations personnel."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Support Programs May Be Inefficient", "paragraphs": ["The Navy and the Air Force recently created programs to preplan for contractor support, similar in many respects to the Army\u2019s program.

To obtain information on how the Army has used LOGCAP in recent peacekeeping operations, we reviewed the Army\u2019s LOGCAP regulation and implementing guidance. We discussed how this regulation and guidance were applied with officials from the Army\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, Corps of Engineers, Corps of Engineers\u2019 Transatlantic Program Center, and Office of the Chief of Army Reserves. Because Bosnia was by far the largest use of LOGCAP and provided a first-hand opportunity to observe the contract\u2019s implementation, our review focused primarily on that operation. However, we did generally review information related to the other operations where it was used. We also visited the U.S. Army, Europe, the U.S. European Command, and the U.S. forces deployed in Hungary, Croatia, and Bosnia to observe operations, talk with Army and contractor officials, and review records related to the implementation of the contract.", "To determine the LOGCAP cost for Bosnia and the primary reasons for its growth, we obtained the Army\u2019s initial cost estimate, prepared by the contractor, from the LOGCAP program manager at the Corps of Engineers\u2019 Transatlantic Program Center.

We also analyzed the revised cost estimate submitted by the contractor in May 1996 and attempted to compare that cost estimate with the original. A direct comparison of the two estimates was not possible because of significant differences in (1) the scope of work covered by the estimates and (2) the way costs were reported. We discussed the results of this comparison with military leaders responsible for the operation in Hungary, Croatia, and Bosnia and with representatives from the Brown and Root Services Corporation and obtained their views on the factors that contributed to the cost increase. We did not attempt to determine whether the estimated costs were reasonable. Our information on the Defense Department\u2019s estimate of $191.6 million was obtained from our prior work on the cost of the Bosnian peacekeeping mission.", "To identify opportunities to improve LOGCAP, we interviewed officials from U.S. Army, Europe responsible for logistics planning for the Bosnian peacekeeping mission and visited U.S. Army, Europe base camps in Hungary, Croatia, and Bosnia.

These factors related to the uncertainty of the U.S. role, the need for rapid deployment once the role was defined, and the harsh weather environment. The role that U.S. forces would play in Bosnia was uncertain until the Dayton Accords were signed on December 14, 1995. The Accords called for an implementation force to provide a secure environment for approximately 1 year to allow \u201cbreathing space\u201d or a \u201ccooling off period\u201d after several years of conflict. The United States is a major force provider to the implementation force and occupies North American Treaty Organization military leadership positions that are responsible for the operation. The U.S. Army, Europe provided most of the force and is the major command responsible for the mission\u2019s logistics planning and funding. As of July 19, 1996, about 22,200 U.S. troops were deployed in support of the implementation force\u2014about 16,200 to Bosnia, 1,400 to Croatia, and about 4,600 to Hungary and Italy.", "The Accords required that U.S. forces deploy rapidly, and the implementation forces had until January 19, 1996, to be in place and begin enforcement. U.S. troops entered Hungary on December 12, 1995, to establish a staging base for the deployment and on December 16, 1995, they entered Croatia and Bosnia. The key military tasks in Bosnia have been to (1) mark and monitor a 4-kilometer wide zone of separation between the three warring factions, (2) patrol the zone of separation, and (3) oversee the withdrawal of forces and weapons away from the zone and back to their cantonment areas.", "Deployment of the U.S. force occurred during one of the harshest winters on record in the Balkans. Weather conditions, for example, affected construction of a bridge over the Sava River to conduct the deployment operation. An unexpected winter thaw resulted in major flooding, and this bridge project became much larger than originally envisioned. The Army had to use construction material intended to build two spans over the Sava River to build the first span. Also, because of the holiday time of the year, the European rail system was heavily involved in holiday passenger and commercial traffic and rail employees were taking holiday vacations. European rail did not respond to the deployment, which it did not view as a wartime operation, with the sense of urgency it would have for a wartime operation. A rail strike in France further complicated ground transportation because many large railcars needed for the deployment could not be moved from France to Germany.", "Each of these factors affected the manner and extent to which LOGCAP was used. For example, originally the contractor was to build, operate, and maintain a support base in Hungary, while military engineer units were to build the necessary base camps in Bosnia. Later, the contractor was to upgrade the military-built camps. Because of the operational requirements and the harsh winter weather, however, a decision was made to increase the number of camps and to immediately upgrade the camps. Military engineer units could not meet the full construction requirement, and the contractor was brought in to assist with camp construction.
