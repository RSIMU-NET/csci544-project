The same lack of clear goals and information on results had hindered congressional policymaking, spending decisions, and oversight. For a more detailed description of GPRA\u2019s requirements, see appendix I.", "In recent years, the states we selected confronted similar challenges and, in response, implemented reforms similar to those required by GPRA. However, the implementation of their reforms varied. For example, in some states, management reforms took a broad, statewide focus, while in others, reforms were primarily implemented at the agency level. The length of time that the states were involved in management reforms also varied.

Oregon\u2019s statewide strategic plan, known as Oregon Benchmarks, was crafted with widespread public input and adopted by the state legislature in 1991, according to Oregon officials. Oregon business, city, county, community, state, and legislative leaders met in 12 regional meetings over 6 months to develop the plan. Oregon officials said that this statewide participation in the strategic planning process contributed to benchmarks\u2014or goals\u2014that accurately reflected statewide values and priorities. State and legislative officials told us that to solidify support, the Oregon Progress Board worked extensively to introduce the benchmarks to legislators in both parties and both houses of the state legislature.

According to Oregon officials, consensus on priority goals was achieved in diverse areas, such as those concerning children and families, education and workforce preparation, workforce training, health and health care, and economic improvement. For example, one statewide priority goal for children and families was to increase the percentage of infants whose mothers did not use alcohol during pregnancy. The baseline of this measure was 93 percent in 1990; this measure increased to 95 percent in 1992.

Department of Human Resources officials told us agencies were required to identify the statewide goals to which they could make a contribution and develop measures that demonstrated their progress in achieving the goals. In doing so, human resources officials said that agencies found they sometimes needed to change their approaches. For example, before beginning the statewide strategic planning process, the department\u2019s Adult and Family Services Division worked to ensure compliance with the state\u2019s regulations on welfare eligibility. Under Oregon\u2019s strategic plan, the division\u2019s mission shifted from processing welfare clients to helping clients achieve self-sufficiency through a variety of means, such as obtaining child support and education. To demonstrate the progress it made in helping clients meet its self-sufficiency goals, the division measured the average number of months for which clients received welfare and sought to reduce this number from the average of 20 to 17.", "Human resources officials also said that the statewide program goals sometimes required agencies to work across agency and program boundaries to achieve program outcomes that, individually, they could only partially influence. For example, child support recovery staff in the Adult and Family Services Division of the Department of Human Resources said they had now recognized that their services significantly contributed to the division\u2019s overall ability to help achieve Oregon\u2019s self-sufficiency goals. However, child support collections from noncustodial parents were based on the identification of paternity, which fell under the responsibility of the Support Enforcement Division of the attorney general\u2019s office. To increase collections, support recovery staff worked with support enforcement staff. They said that they found that single mothers were missing appointments with support enforcement staff that were intended to identify paternity. To simplify paternity declaration, child support recovery staff and support enforcement staff established a procedure that involved mothers signing affidavits declaring paternity with Adult and Family Services Division social workers.", "Oregon officials said that the state benchmarks also have helped agencies and nonstate organizations, such as private businesses, work as partners to achieve common statewide goals. According to the Oregon Progress Board director, nonstate organizations had a great capacity to help the state achieve the benchmarks. For example, according to a 1992 Progress Board report on the benchmarks, to achieve Oregon\u2019s goal of diversifying its economy, the state established benchmarks to increase the share of employment in businesses that added value to the state\u2019s natural resources, such as wood products and agriculture, before they were exported. However, the Progress Board director said that state government had only a marginal ability to achieve those benchmarks on its own. Therefore, the Progress Board encouraged the industries Oregon had targeted for growth to develop and track their own performance measures, such as increased sales and employment, that would demonstrate growth in those industries.", "After we completed our review, a report was issued by independent reviewers chartered by the Oregon Progress Board that gave an assessment of the Oregon Benchmarks as a mechanism for guiding the state\u2019s strategic plan and as a framework for developing performance measurements. Among other things, the reviewers reported that \u201cremarkable\u201d progress had been made in the development and use of benchmarks by the executive and legislative branches, local governments, and the private sector. However, the report also recommended that more concerted effort was needed to (1) increase the value and use of the benchmarks by the legislature and citizens; (2) increase the integration of the benchmarks into current state policy initiatives, agency programs, and performance measurement processes; and (3) provide more conscious attention to developing and evaluating effective strategies for achieving the benchmarks. For example, the evaluation recommended that the Progress Board (1) provide information, including workshops, to new and returning legislators to discuss the benchmark process and advantages of focusing on results-oriented issues; (2) provide each manager with regular performance reports that identify outcomes of the effort under that particular manager\u2019s responsibility; and (3) encourage and sponsor in-depth examination of benchmark trends and analyses of reasons for progress made, or not made, toward benchmark targets, and use those findings as a major part of the Progress Board\u2019s biennial report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Virginia Reported It Used Strategic Planning to Help Build a Common Focus Within an Agency", "paragraphs": ["Since its creation in 1985, staff at all levels of Virginia\u2019s Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy have been involved in the department\u2019s strategic planning process to define the organization\u2019s mission, values, goals, objectives, and strategies.

The legislative auditor also suggested a number of ways to increase the legislature\u2019s use of performance information. For example, the legislative auditor endorsed efforts to use agencies\u2019 performance reports as a focal point for legislative oversight.

For example, as we noted earlier, the Minnesota Trade Office used intermediate outcome indicators and customer surveys to help guide its efforts. Similarly, the legislative auditor reported that the Minnesota Department of Revenue expected to use measures such as customer satisfaction and the tax compliance gap (the percentage of taxpayers who should file returns but do not) to help with spending decisions, daily operations, and accountability.", "North Carolina also has sought to increase the use of results-oriented performance information during budget deliberation. A governmentwide audit by a committee of 27 public officials and private citizens recommended, among other reforms, the development of a results-oriented budget process to enable the legislature to focus on the intended outcomes of expenditures rather than budget line items. The committee felt that this budget reform was so important that it proposed implementing results-oriented budgeting before the audit was completed. In response, the executive branch implemented a results-oriented budgeting process on a pilot basis in two areas, health and environmental programs, then on a broader basis in six program areas for the 1995-96 biennium.", "The pilot performance budgets were not used by the legislative committees in their 1993-94 biennium budget deliberations. According to an official of the Fiscal Research Division of the state legislature, budget officials did not consult state legislators and their staffs on their needs and requirements for performance information to be included in the pilot performance budgets. This official said that budget officials first should have introduced legislators and their staffs to the concept of outcome performance measures and demonstrated the value of changing from the then current line-item budgets to performance budgets. Next, the official said, budget officials should have determined the types of outcome measures legislators needed, established the reliability of the performance measures, and reported the performance information in user-friendly format. Both planning and budget officials said that rushed implementation limited the agencies\u2019 ability to develop outcome measures for their budgets. In developing a results-oriented budget for 1995-96, as required by 1994 amendments to the North Carolina Executive Budget Act, planning and budget officials implemented a process that produced outcome measures in the selected program areas.

CORE and the Minnesota Department of Employee Relations, which administered the state\u2019s human resource management system, met with hundreds of stakeholders, including agency managers, personnel directors, line employees, union representatives, legislators, and others to determine what was wrong with the human resource management system and how to restructure it to be more effective. As described in the CORE report, Minnesota\u2019s human resource management system had been designed in 1939 to ensure stability and standardization at a time when government was characterized by political patronage and inequitably applied personnel policies. CORE determined that this system had grown too complex and unresponsive to meet the needs of government and the people it served. Among the many problems CORE addressed were performance appraisal and training systems that did not attempt to link employee performance and development to customer needs and the achievement of agency goals.", "As described in its report, CORE found that the current performance management system focused on evaluating how an employee performed a defined set of activities rather than how an employee accomplished objectives that contributed to agency mission and goals. To address this problem, CORE sought to design a performance management system that would link an agency\u2019s performance goals to its work assignments and employee performance evaluations.", "CORE also reported that employee training and development needed to support the achievement of organization mission and goals. Focus group discussions led by CORE revealed, among other things, that the agencies needed to improve their training development by examining trends and planning for workforce skills needs. CORE proposed linking training and development decisions to organizational goals, objectives, and performance by using goals and outcome measures as the criteria for planning, prioritizing, and arranging training and development activities. In its report, CORE offered this hypothetical example of such a linkage: \u201cTrain X people to operate Y equipment to perform Z, which supports a certain program or goal of the organization.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managerial Flexibility Piloted in Florida", "paragraphs": ["\u201cn 1991, the Governor\u2019s Commission for Government by the People . . . recommended that pilot agencies act as laboratories for other agencies, experimenting with flexibility concepts, beginning with the test elimination of constrictive state personnel and budget requirements. The . . . ommission noted that the personnel and budget systems often concentrate on inputs and ignore outcomes, limit a manager\u2019s flexibility to move resources as needs change, hide the true costs of programs, and encourage managers to waste money.\u201d", "On the basis of the commission\u2019s findings, the Florida legislature established budget and personnel flexibility pilot projects in several departments. Through the pilot projects, selected departments were given the authority to act outside of the normal personnel and budget requirements of Florida statutes. They were granted greater flexibility to (1) establish their own personnel classification systems and pay plans and (2) transfer funds and budget authority internally without prior approval from the Executive Office of the Governor.", "According to an audit by the Florida legislature\u2019s Office of the Auditor General, through its pilot, the Department of Revenue sought to recruit and retain a superior workforce, improve workforce productivity and morale, and ensure that its personnel system and procedures supported the workforce. The department implemented the pilot program by finding savings within its existing budget. The department used its personnel flexibility to streamline its grievance and disciplinary procedures; adopt flexible work days, hours, and work sites; provide pay raises not tied to promotion or working later shifts; experiment with various uses of administrative leave; and establish new job classifications. The department used its budgetary flexibility to transfer positions and funds within planned expenditures to fund new priorities in programming and office automation, purchase personal computers, and provide raises to employees.", "According to a senior Florida official, the productivity pilots influenced executive and legislative willingness to reform Florida\u2019s planning and budget system to encompass greater managerial flexibility and accountability for outcomes. For example, this official said Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation was able to use the personnel program designed by the Department of Labor and Employment Security, a pilot agency, as the basis for its broad-banded approach, reducing the number of job classes from 1,718 to 96."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Management reforms that are under way in Florida, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia reflect a common objective shared by the states to make their governments more results oriented. Although each of these states implemented different reforms to respond to its individual needs and political environment, the reforms included requirements similar to those of GPRA, such as strategic planning and performance measurement, and the alignment of certain management systems. The experiences of the states we selected led to a common conclusion among the officials we interviewed that the management reforms similar to those contained in GPRA required a long-term effort, but could help to improve agencies\u2019 effectiveness and efficiency.", "For example, the states\u2019 experiences suggest that strategic planning and performance measurement could be an important means for stakeholders to obtain agreement on common goals and measure progress toward achieving those goals. The states reported that they used strategic planning to improve working relationships within and across agencies and across levels of government aimed at achieving desired outcomes. Performance measures were designed to provide the critical information needed to assess the degree to which the desired outcomes were being achieved. The states\u2019 experiences suggest that, if successful, GPRA could serve as a powerful tool for developing and communicating agreement across the federal system on programs\u2019 goals and for measuring progress in achieving those goals.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Vice President; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; other interested congressional committees; the governors of the states visited; and other interested parties.

Under GPRA, agency strategic plans are the starting point for agencies to set goals for programs and measure the performance of the programs in achieving those goals.", "In addition, GPRA requires agencies to submit, beginning in fiscal year 1999, annual program performance plans to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and program performance reports to the President and Congress. Program performance plans are to describe how agencies are to meet their program goals through daily operations and establish target levels of performance for program activities. In these plans, agencies are to define target levels in objective, measurable terms so that actual achievement can be compared against the targets. Agencies\u2019 individual performance plans are to provide information to OMB for an overall federal government performance plan that OMB is to develop and submit annually to Congress with the president\u2019s budget. In their program performance reports, agencies are to show (1) program achievements compared to the targets specified in the performance plans; and (2) when a target has not been met, an explanation of why the target was not met and what actions would be needed to achieve the unmet goals.", "GPRA also allows agencies to propose in their annual performance plans that OMB waive certain administrative requirements. These administrative waivers would provide federal managers with more flexibility to structure agency systems to better support program goals. Under GPRA, the administrative requirements eligible for waiver would be nonstatutory and involve only budgeting and spending within agencies. In return, agencies would be held accountable for \u201cachieving higher performance.\u201d", "Finally, GPRA requires a 2-year test of performance budgeting in not less than five agencies, at least three of which have had experience developing performance plans. Under the test, performance budgets are to provide Congress with information on the direct relationship between proposed program spending and expected program results and the anticipated effects of varying spending levels on results.", "GPRA calls for phased implementation so that selected agencies can develop experience from implementing its requirements before implementation is required for all agencies. In fiscal year 1994, OMB selected 53 agencies or programs to pilot strategic planning, performance planning, performance measurement, and performance reporting and will select additional pilot agencies in fiscal years 1995 and 1996. OMB also will be selecting agencies from among the initial pilots to pilot managerial flexibility and test performance budgeting in fiscal years 1995 and 1998, respectively. Although GPRA does not call for governmentwide implementation of strategic planning and performance planning until fiscal years 1998 and 1999, respectively, OMB and the administration\u2019s National Performance Review have strongly endorsed these reforms and have encouraged all agencies to develop their strategic and performance plans as soon as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Management Reforms: Examples of Public and Private Innovations to Improve Service Delivery (GAO/AIMD/GGD-94-90BR, Feb. 11, 1994).", "Improving Government: Actions Needed to Sustain and Enhance Management Reforms (GAO/T-OCG-94-1, Jan. 27, 1994).", "Management Reform: GAO\u2019s Comments on the National Performance Review\u2019s Recommendations (GAO/OCG-94-1, Dec. 3, 1993).", "Improving Government: Measuring Performance and Acting on Proposals for Change (GAO/T-GGD-93-14, Mar. 23, 1993).", "Federal Performance Management: Agencies Need Greater Flexibility in Designing Their Systems (GAO/GGD-93-57, Feb. 24, 1993).", "Performance Budgeting: State Experiences and Implications for the Federal Government (GAO/AFMD-93-41, Feb. 17, 1993).", "Quality Management: Survey of Federal Organizations (GAO/GGD-93-9BR, Oct. 1, 1992).", "Program Performance Measures: Federal Agency Collection and Use of Performance Data (GAO/GGD-92-65, May 4, 1992).", "Organizational Culture: Techniques Companies Use to Perpetuate or Change Beliefs and Values (GAO/NSIAD-92-105, Feb. 27, 1992).", "Government Management Issues (GAO/OCG-93-3TR, Dec. 1992).", "Financial Management Issues (GAO/OCG-93-4TR, Dec. 1992).", "Information Management and Technology Issues (GAO/OCG-93-5TR, Dec. 1992).", "Program Evaluation Issues (GAO/OCG-93-6TR, Dec. 1992).", "The Public Service (GAO/OCG-93-7TR, Dec. 1992).", "The Chief Financial Officers Act: A Mandate for Federal Financial Management Reform (GAO/AFMD-12.19.4, Sept. 1991).", "Service to the Public: How Effective and Responsive Is the Government?
