It is particularly important that NORTHCOM coordinate with the National Guard Bureau (NGB), because NGB has experience dealing with state and local authorities during incidents and functions as NORTHCOM's formal link to the states. GAO was asked to (1) determine the extent to which NORTHCOM has ongoing efforts to coordinate with the states and NGB in planning, exercises and other preparedness activities and (2) identify the extent to which there are any gaps in this coordination. To do this, GAO surveyed the state adjutants general, the highest ranking guardsman in each state, and received a 100 percent response rate, and reviewed interagency coordination plans and guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NORTHCOM has several ongoing efforts to improve coordination with the states and NGB in planning for its missions and responding to requests for civil support. For example, during hurricane season NORTHCOM facilitates weekly conferences with the relevant local, state, and federal emergency management officials, through which it has begun to build more productive relationships. NORTHCOM also conducted two large-scale exercises and participated in over 25 smaller regional, state, and local exercises annually to help responders prepare for man-made and natural disasters. In addition, NORTHCOM has been informally including NGB in reviewing its plans. We identified gaps in coordination between NORTHCOM, the states, and NGB in three areas: (1) NORTHCOM officials minimally involved the states in the development of its homeland defense and civil support plans. Less than 25 percent of the state adjutants general reported that they were involved in developing and reviewing these plans. For civil support, NORTHCOM officials told us that they are reaching out directly to states to better understand states' plans and capabilities, but for homeland defense, they rely on NGB to provide states perspectives. (2) NORTHCOM was not familiar with state emergency response plans and has no process for obtaining this information. Fifty-four percent of the state adjutants general reported that they believed that NORTHCOM was not at all or only slightly familiar with their states' emergency response plans. This may be attributable, in part, to the fact that NORTHCOM does not have an established and thorough process for cooperating and interacting with the states. By not obtaining and using information on states' plans and capabilities, NORTHCOM increases the risk that it will not be prepared to respond to an incident with the needed resources to support civil authorities. (3) A 2005 agreement, which is intended to provide the procedures by which NORTHCOM and NGB interact, does not fully or clearly define each agency's roles and responsibilities for planning for homeland defense and civil support. The lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities has resulted in confusion and duplicative or wasted efforts. For example, as required in NORTHCOM's homeland defense plan, NGB compiled the states' homeland defense plans and made them available to NORTHCOM; however, NORTHCOM planners told us that they neither requested nor needed access to this information. Without clearly defined roles and responsibilities, there is a risk that NORTHCOM's and NGB's responses to an event could be fragmented and uncoordinated. Addressing these gaps could help integrate intergovernmental planning for catastrophic incidents, enhance overall coordination, and help ensure that NORTHCOM's plans for its missions and responses to incidents are as effective as possible."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States homeland continues to face an uncertain, complex  security environment with the potential for terrorist incidents and natural  disasters.

Because  protecting and defending the homeland is a shared responsibility with  states potentially requiring assistance from federal agencies and  organizations, effective coordination and integrated planning across all  levels are critical for an effective national response. We have previously  reported that to facilitate rapid and effective decision making during a  crisis, legal authorities, roles and responsibilities, and lines of authority at  all government levels must be clearly defined, effectively communicated,  and well understood. NORTHCOM also recognizes the importance of  coordination with other federal agencies and states for its missions,  especially in support of civil authorities, stating that such coordination will  facilitate the creation and implementation of coordinated policies,  collaborative plans, and unified operations.", "Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and, more recently, the  uncoordinated national response to Hurricane Katrina, Congress and other  organizations have emphasized the need to improve the national response  to an incident.

The relationship of  NORTHCOM and NGB is even more important with Congress\u2019s recent  passing of legislation to elevate NGB to a joint activity of DOD and expand  NGB\u2019s functions to include assisting the Secretary of Defense with  coordinating the use of National Guard forces and resources with other  federal agencies, the adjutants general of the states, U.S. Joint Forces  Command, and NORTHCOM for their use in operations conducted under  Title 32 or in support of state missions. Although NGB is NORTHCOM\u2019s  formal channel of coordination with states for National Guard related  matters, NORTHCOM also coordinates with the states through the state  adjutants general, known as TAGs\u2014the highest-ranking guardsman in  each state.

Our review focused on  NORTHCOM\u2019s coordination efforts since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. To  determine the states\u2019 perspectives on the extent to which NORTHCOM is  coordinating with the states and identify any gaps, we surveyed the TAGs  who are within NORTHCOM\u2019s area of responsibility. When we discuss  NORTHCOM\u2019s coordination with the states, we are primarily referring to  coordination with the TAGs. The survey questionnaire and results can be  found in appendix I.

Homeland security is a concerted  national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce  America\u2019s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover  from attacks that do occur. The DHS is the primary federal agency for  homeland security issues. DHS\u2019s responsibilities extend beyond terrorism  to preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from a wide  range of matter domestic disasters and other emergencies.

Civil support missions include domestic disaster relief  operations for incidents such as fires, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.  Such support also includes counterdrug operations and management of  the consequences of a terrorist incident employing a weapon of mass  destruction. DOD is not the primary federal agency for such missions  (unless so designated by the President) and thus provides defense support  of civil authorities only when (1) state, local, and other federal resources  are overwhelmed or unique military capabilities are required;                     (2) assistance is requested by the primary federal agency; and                    (3) NORTHCOM is directed to do so by the President or the Secretary of  Defense.", "Civil support is based on a tiered response to an incident; that is, incidents  must be managed at the lowest jurisdictional levels and supported by  additional response capabilities when needed (see fig. 3). Local and  county governments respond to emergencies daily using their own  resources and rely on mutual aid agreements and other types of assistance  agreements with neighboring governments when they need additional  resources. For example, county and local authorities are likely to have the  resources needed to adequately respond to a small-scale incident, such as  a local flood, and therefore will not request additional resources. For  larger-scale incidents, when resources are overwhelmed, local and county  governments will request assistance from the state. States have  capabilities, such as the National Guard, that can help communities  respond and recover. If additional resources are required, the state may  request assistance from other states through interstate mutual aid  agreements, such as the Emergency Management Assistance Compact  (EMAC). If an incident is beyond the community and state capabilities,  the governor can seek federal assistance. The federal government has a  wide array of capabilities and resources that can be made available to  assist state and local agencies to respond to incidents.", "Overall coordination of federal incident management activities, other than  those conducted for homeland defense, is generally the responsibility of  DHS.

In some  instances, national defense assets may be needed to assist FEMA or  another agency in the national response to an incident. Defense resources  are committed after approval by the Secretary of Defense or at the  direction of the President. When deciding to commit defense resources,  officials consider military readiness, appropriateness of the  circumstances, and whether the response is in accordance with the law.

By only relying on NGB, NORTHCOM may not be able to maintain  awareness of the environment in which the command may be operating,  including critical infrastructure locations relevant to its operations, which  is important to fully carrying out its homeland defense mission.", "In the case of civil support and as outlined in the National Response  Framework, because NORTHCOM plays a supporting role to other federal  agencies and subsequently to state and local governments, NORTHCOM  officials told us that they are starting to reach out directly to states to  obtain their perspectives and incorporate these into future revisions of  NORTHCOM\u2019s defense support of civil authorities plan. In order to  effectively develop a civil support plan, NORTHCOM needs to know what  its requirements may be. DOD recognizes that these requirements are  driven both by the capabilities gaps of the primary federal agencies and  those of the state and local governments. In either homeland defense or  civil support, increasing the current level of state involvement in the  development of NORTHCOM\u2019s plans could help integrate  intergovernmental planning for catastrophic incidents, enhance overall  coordination, and help ensure that NORTHCOM\u2019s plans for its missions  and responses to incidents are as effective as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NORTHCOM Lacks Familiarity with State Emergency Response Plans and May Not Be Aware of Capabilities and Potential Gaps", "paragraphs": ["We found that NORTHCOM generally was not familiar with state  emergency response plans and has not obtained detailed information on  states\u2019 plans and capabilities to determine the specific challenges it may  face in conducting homeland defense or civil support operations.  According to our survey, 54 percent of the TAGs believe that NORTHCOM  is not at all or only slightly familiar with their states\u2019 plan (see table 4). In  written comments in our survey, several TAGs reported that NORTHCOM  should be more familiar with state emergency response plans, and should  determine how best to support the states\u2019 plans and, where appropriate,  incorporate these plans to ensure a unified effort. Developing a  synchronized and coordinated planning capability at all levels of  government is important for a coordinated national response to domestic  incidents. In part, NORTHCOM is not more familiar with these plans  because it has no established and thorough process regarding  coordination with the states or for gaining access to emergency response  plans, and it is not specifically required by DOD to obtain information on  state emergency response plans or determine state and local capabilities  and potential resource gaps. NORTHCOM planners told us that they do  not need access to state emergency response plans because they are doing  strategic-level concept plans and this level of detail would be more  appropriate for tactical level planning, such as planning done by  NORTHCOM\u2019s subordinate commands, like Army Forces North.  However, NGB and FEMA officials told us that one of NORTHCOM\u2019s  biggest challenges is its current inability to anticipate the capabilities and  requirements of state and local governments during a civil support  incident because of the lack of advanced planning and coordination  between NORTHCOM, states, and local governments. Furthermore,  NORTHCOM officials told us that the complexity of the planning involved  for a large-scale disaster is such that even if states can adequately plan for  the resources they will need, they do not always have adequate multistate  plans to integrate the state, local, federal, and nongovernmental responses.  By not obtaining and using information on state plans and capabilities,  NORTHCOM increases the risk that it will not be adequately prepared to  respond to an incident with the needed resources, including the types,  numbers, and timing of capabilities (trained personnel and equipment).", "One of NORTHCOM\u2019s subordinate commands, JTF-CS, has been  collecting state emergency response plans so that if called upon to provide  assistance in a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield  explosive (CBRNE) incident, its Commander will have as much advance  information as possible regarding state plans, resources, and potential  areas where assistance may be required. JTF-CS found that some state and  local governments are reluctant to share their plans because they fear that  DOD will \u201cgrade\u201d their plans or that potential capability gaps will be made  public, with an accompanying political cost. A NORTHCOM official told us  that there will always be some tension between the states and DOD and  other federal agencies as a result of the nation\u2019s constitutional structure.  JTF-CS is therefore extremely careful about how it shares its emergency  plan analyses and has made progress in gaining access to these plans  through DHS.", "DHS has collected and assessed state emergency response plans as part of  a nationwide plan review to determine the status of catastrophic planning  for states and 75 of the nation\u2019s largest urban areas. Participation in the  review was a prerequisite for receipt of fiscal year 2006 DHS homeland  security grant funds. The review concluded that no individual plan or  resource base can fully absorb and respond to a catastrophe and that  unsystematic planning and the absence of an integrated planning system is  a national operational vulnerability. The annex to Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 8, issued in December 2007, directs the  establishment of a comprehensive approach to national planning through  an integrated planning system. This system is to include, among other  things, a description of the process that (1) links regional, state, local, and  tribal plans, planning cycles, and processes and allows these plans to  inform the development of federal plans and (2) fosters the integration of  such plans and allows for state, local, and tribal capability assessments to  feed into federal plans. DHS may, therefore, be one source from which  NORTHCOM could obtain information on state emergency response plans  and capabilities.", "Given its relationship with the states, NGB could also be a conduit for  NORTHCOM to share its plans with states and obtain information on  states plans and capabilities. In addition, NGB officials suggested that  emergency preparedness liaison officers (EPLO) could be a potential  conduit for NORTHCOM and states to share plans. EPLOs are senior  reserve officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps who  represent the federal military in each state and in each of the 10 FEMA  regional offices. EPLOs coordinate the provision of military personnel,  equipment, and supplies to support the emergency relief and cleanup  efforts of civil authorities. According to NGB officials, expanding the  EPLO program to include sharing plans with states would provide a closer  link between NORTHCOM and the states without the sensitivity of state  sovereignty issues. The DCOs who are also located in FEMA\u2019s 10 regional  offices could potentially serve as NORTHCOM\u2019s points of contact for the  EPLOs.", "NORTHCOM has taken actions to improve the coordination of its  homeland defense and civil support plans and operations with federal  agencies. However, in its role either in support of other federal agencies  or as the primary agency in homeland defense incidents, NORTHCOM  does not have adequate information on states\u2019 plans and capabilities. By  minimally involving the states in its homeland defense and civil support  plans and not becoming familiar with information on states\u2019 emergency  response plans and capabilities, NORTHCOM increases the risk that it may  not be prepared with the needed resources to respond to an incident.  These gaps may be attributable in part to the fact that NORTHCOM does  not have an established and thorough process for cooperating and  interacting with the states. One model of such a process is NORTHCOM\u2019s  security cooperation plans with Canada and Mexico, since the states are  each separate governments within the federal system. For example,  NORTHCOM\u2019s cooperation plan with Canada and Mexico outlines a  strategy for planning, assessing, and executing security objectives and  other strategic priorities. These objectives include advancing common  interests, reducing impediments to cooperation, encouraging improved  capabilities and willingness to operate in coalition, and improving  combined homeland defense capabilities. Without a similar kind of  cooperation plan for the states within its area of responsibility,  NORTHCOM cannot optimally involve the TAGs and other state or local  officials in its planning activities and develop a process for obtaining and  using information on state emergency plans and capabilities. Moreover,  without such a cooperation plan, NORTHCOM is not likely to reduce  confusion, facilitate effective planning, and facilitate effective and efficient  responses to incidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NORTHCOM and NGB Responsibilities for Homeland Defense and Civil Support Are Not Clearly Defined", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s National Response Framework and NORTHCOM\u2019s Concept of  Operations both emphasize that NORTHCOM should coordinate with  federal, state, and local partners before, during, and after an incident.  Coordination with NGB is particularly important, because NGB has  experience working with state and local authorities during incidents and it  functions as NORTHCOM\u2019s formal link to the states. We previously  reported that as with preparing for and responding to any type of disaster,  leadership roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined, effectively  communicated, and well understood to facilitate rapid and effective  decision making. Furthermore, we reported that without clearly defined  roles and responsibilities, the potential remains for confusion and gaps or  duplication by the combatant commands relative to other agencies. The  National Strategy for Homeland Security also emphasizes that a lack of  clarity regarding roles and responsibilities across all levels of government  can lead to gaps in the national response and delay the ability to provide  life-saving support when needed.", "In July 2005, NORTHCOM and NGB signed a memorandum of agreement  outlining their command and coordination relationship. This  memorandum, which is intended to provide the procedures by which the  two entities interact, broadly establishes that NORTHCOM and NGB \u201cwill  coordinate on policy, program and planning actions related to missions  and requirements affecting the National Guard.\u201d The memorandum further  provides for the location of a small NGB office at NORTHCOM to advise  NORTHCOM\u2019s Commander regarding National Guard-related issues. The  mission of this office is to advise and assist NORTHCOM\u2019s Commander on  all matters involving the National Guard, provide a conduit to NGB leaders  and staff, and promote integration of National Guard priorities and  capabilities into NORTHCOM\u2019s plans and operations. The staff members of  this office provide input to numerous requests for information from  NORTHCOM. This office is not intended to serve as the only point of  coordination between NORTHCOM and NGB. Officials told us that there is  no formal process in place for the NORTHCOM National Guard Office to  coordinate with NGB headquarters. Such a process could improve  coordination between the NGB liaison office and NGB headquarters.", "Our analysis of the memorandum, NORTHCOM\u2019s Concept of Operations,  the regulation describing the organization and function of NGB, and other  documents showed that there is no detailed guidance on NORTHCOM\u2019s  and NGB\u2019s roles and responsibilities for homeland defense and defense  support of civil authorities. Clearly defined responsibilities help to ensure  unity of effort, prevent duplication, and enable efficient use of resources.  As a result of the lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities between  NORTHCOM and NGB, we found several instances in which there was  confusion and duplicate or potentially wasted efforts. For example, some  TAGs survey responses indicated that because responsibilities are not  clearly defined, both NGB and NORTHCOM are requesting the same  information during an incident. In addition, NORTHCOM\u2019s homeland  defense plan required NGB to collect state homeland defense plans and  make them available to NORTHCOM. NGB compiled and reviewed these  plans from the states and territories within NORTHCOM\u2019s area of  responsibility and made them available to NORTHCOM on its Web portal.  However, NORTHCOM planning officials told us that they did not request  that NGB compile these plans and that, in fact, they do not have a need for  state supporting plans because such plans will not affect how  NORTHCOM\u2019s strategic-level homeland defense concept plan is written.  Nevertheless, NGB spent resources collecting information that has not  been used by NORTHCOM. As discussed above, we believe NORTHCOM  officials should be reviewing these plans to ensure that they have  sufficient awareness of the environment in which they may be operating to  fully carry out the command\u2019s homeland defense mission.", "In addition, we found that NGB has developed a Joint Capabilities  Database that includes all National Guard capabilities and has made this  database available for NORTHCOM\u2019s use. However, NORTHCOM officials  told us that rather than use the database, they prefer to rely on NGB staff  to provide them National Guard readiness and capabilities data. NGB  officials also told us that they have not encouraged NORTHCOM to use the  database thus far because they are still finalizing the procedure for  maintaining and updating the database with information from all states  and territories. The officials said that they expect to have these issues  worked out within the next few months in advance of the hurricane  season and to begin to encourage NORTHCOM to make use of the  database. NGB\u2019s goal with the database is to provide a national look at the  National Guard\u2019s capabilities.", "Without clearly defined lines of coordination and roles and responsibility,  federal efforts may not be used in the most effective and efficient manner.  This is increasingly important as DOD is currently developing a database  of federal emergency response capabilities, including those for active and  reserve DOD units and National Guard capabilities in each state, and  FEMA is currently developing a list of organizations and functions within  DOD that may be used to provide support to civil authorities during  natural or man-made disasters. Coordinating all of these efforts will be  critical to ensuring the efficient use of federal resources as well as to  reduce the risk of potential capabilities gaps.", "An NGB official told us that NORTHCOM and NGB have not revised the  2005 memorandum of agreement to more clearly define their  responsibilities because they were waiting for the National Guard  Empowerment Act, which was partially incorporated into the National  Defense Authorization Act for 2008, to be signed into law and,  subsequently, for a new NGB charter to be developed and issued by the  Secretary of Defense. The National Guard Empowerment Act includes  provisions that may enhance the level of coordination between  NORTHCOM and NGB. For example, the Secretary of Defense is required  to prepare a plan coordinating the use of the National Guard and members  of the armed forces on active duty when responding to an incident and  include protocols for DOD, NGB, and the governors of the states to carry  out operations in coordination with one another. An NGB official told us  that the process of preparing this plan will require more coordination  between NORTHCOM and NGB. More important, NGB\u2019s charter, which is  currently undergoing revision based on the new act, potentially could  resolve a number of ambiguities by more clearly defining the roles and  responsibilities of NGB and its relationships with other agencies, such as  NORTHCOM. Further, the NGB official told us that the revised charter will  greatly simplify negotiations of a revised memorandum between the two  agencies. Without clearly defined responsibilities for NORTHCOM and  NGB, there is the potential for a lack of effective coordination between the  two agencies and duplicative or wasted efforts. Clearly identifying roles  and responsibilities is increasingly important because responding to a  major disaster in the United States\u2014natural or man-made\u2014is a shared  responsibility of many agencies across all levels of government and cannot  be effectively accomplished by one agency. Without effective interagency  coordination and planning and clearly defined roles and responsibilities,  there is a risk that NORTHCOM\u2019s, NGB\u2019s, and other nationwide efforts to  respond to an incident may be fragmented and uncoordinated, such as in  the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Within the federal government, there is an increasing realization that the  nation needs to integrate not just the response to an incident, but also the  plans of many entities at all the levels involved in responding to such  incidents. This planning integration will help ensure that when the federal  government responds, its response will be as effective as possible.  NORTHCOM\u2019s recent efforts to coordinate with states and NGB have  helped address some of the uncertainty in the homeland defense and civil  support planning process and have improved NORTHCOM\u2019s ability to  coordinate in the event of an actual incident. However, without an  established and thorough process for requesting, obtaining, and using  information on state emergency plans and capabilities\u2014whether from  coordination with DHS or NGB or from direct interaction with states\u2014 NORTHCOM may be missing opportunities to better plan its missions and  manage its risk in a more informed manner. Moreover, NORTHCOM may  not be fully prepared to support states, resulting in ineffective planning  and fragmented, uncoordinated responses to incidents.", "Given that NORTHCOM and NGB both have increasingly important  responsibilities for homeland defense and defense support of civil  authorities, it is imperative that these entities work together to effectively  prepare for DOD\u2019s response to an incident.

We asked respondents about their familiarity and  involvement in NORTHCOM\u2019s homeland defense plan and the defense  support of civil authorities plan. We also asked about their experiences in  working and communicating with NORTHCOM, including their  participation in NORTHCOM exercises and involvement of NORTHCOM in  their state exercises.

We sent a questionnaire to TAGs of all 49 states in  NORTHCOM\u2019s area of responsibility and the District of Columbia.", "The self-administered electronic survey was sent via electronic mail to the  TAGs and their chiefs of staff. More specifically, we sent the questionnaire  by e-mail in an attached Microsoft Word form that respondents could  return electronically after marking checkboxes or entering narrative  responses into open answer boxes. Alternatively, respondents could  return it by mail after printing the form and completing it by hand. We sent  the original electronic questionnaire on April 4, 2007. We sent out  reminder e-mail messages, with replacement surveys, at different time  intervals to all nonrespondents in order to encourage a higher response  rate. In addition, we made several courtesy telephone calls to  nonrespondents to encourage their completion. All questionnaires were  returned by September 19, 2007.

However,  the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors,  commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in  interpreting a particular question, sources of information available to  respondents, or entering data into a database or analyzing them can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in  developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing them to  minimize such nonsampling errors. For example, social science survey  specialists designed the questionnaire in collaboration with GAO staff who  had subject matter expertise. In addition to an internal expert technical  review by GAO\u2019s Survey Coordination Group, we pretested the survey with  two TAGs by telephone to ensure that the questions were relevant, clearly  stated, and easy to understand. Since there were relatively few changes  based on the pretests and we were conducting surveys with the universe  of respondents, we did not find it necessary to conduct additional pretests.  Instead, changes to the content and format of the questionnaire were made  after the pretests based on the feedback we received. When we analyzed  the data, an independent analyst checked all computer programs. All data  were double keyed during the data-entry process, and GAO staff verified a  sample of the resulting data to ensure accuracy.", "In addition to analyzing the frequency and distribution of marked  checkbox survey responses, we also analyzed the open-ended narrative  survey responses for trends and recurring themes. For instance, although  we did not directly ask a question about the defense coordinating officers  (DCO) now located in each FEMA region, the DCOs were cited several  times by TAGs as improving their communications with NORTHCOM.  When the TAGs were not in agreement or had different perspectives on  issues, we also summarized conflicting responses to illustrate the  complexity of NORTHCOM\u2019s unique relationship with the states and any  ongoing efforts to resolve these issues.
