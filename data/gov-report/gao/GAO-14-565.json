There are six key strategic workforce-planning principles, and most are similar to elements of the statutory reporting requirements, such as assessing critical skills and competencies. A key principle that is not addressed in the statutory requirements is strategic alignment, which links workforce strategies to an agency's mission and goals, and aligns them with, among other things, budget formulation. DOD's 2013-2018 plan noted the need to integrate the department's plan with the budget process but did not include specific details and, according to officials, DOD does not have actions underway to do so. Further, the plan identified strategies addressing some critical-skill staffing gaps, but did not provide specific information on the funding required to implement most of these strategies. The plan also did not align with recent recruiting, retention, and readiness initiatives to improve the morale of DOD's civilian workforce as reported to congressional defense committees.

Only 1 of the 31  strategies\u2014developed by the Intelligence functional community and  identified in the plan\u2014provided detailed information on the amount of  funding required to implement the strategy. However, for some strategies,  DOD\u2019s plan stated that funding was, among other things, at the discretion  of the DOD components or to be included in component budgets. For  other strategies, DOD\u2019s plan stated that additional funding may be  necessary. In each case where funding information was not provided, the  plan provided no additional detail on the amount of funding needed to  implement the strategies.", "Furthermore, the importance of DOD aligning its workforce plan with other  strategic workforce initiatives is demonstrated in a December 2013 letter   That letter  that DOD provided to the congressional defense committees.outlined steps the department is taking to minimize any negative effect on  the morale of its civilian workforce and long-term consequences on  recruiting and retention due to DOD\u2019s implementation of civilian furloughs  conducted during the summer of 2013. DOD\u2019s letter stated the morale of  the civilian workforce had been declining for a number of reasons,  including the furloughs, and stated that the department expected future  furloughs and budget uncertainties to further this downward trend. The  department also stated it anticipates that these issues will factor heavily  into employees\u2019 decisions about when to depart, as well as individuals\u2019  decisions about when to apply for positions within the department, which  will have an effect on recruiting, retention, and readiness.", "We recognize that DOD\u2019s letter to the congressional defense committees  on this matter was sent after its strategic workforce plan was provided to  Congress. We note, however, that the steps outlined in DOD\u2019s letter are  targeted at minimizing the declining morale of the department\u2019s civilian  workforce. The strategic workforce plan includes recruitment, retention,  and development strategies aimed specifically at addressing gaps in  critical skills within the department\u2019s functional communities. However,  without aligning the steps DOD describes in its letter to congressional  defense committees with its strategic workforce plan, DOD may lack  assurance that these efforts will support its overall strategic workforce- planning goals including, for example, how it will address gaps.", "To address these issues, DOD stated that the department continues to  focus on its strategic workforce-planning efforts that include strategies  identified and carried out by the functional communities aimed to recruit,  retain, motivate, and develop the present and future civilian workforce.  However, DOD officials stated during this review that the recruiting,  retention, and workforce development strategies outlined in the  department\u2019s strategic workforce plan are developed by the individual  functional communities and are implemented and funded as appropriate  primarily at the component level. Therefore, these strategies do not  constitute a department-wide approach to addressing morale,  recruitment, and retention issues related to past or future furloughs or  budget uncertainties. Further, as our analysis of DOD\u2019s current strategic  workforce plan shows, DOD has not completed its competency or  competency-gap assessments to know where it should target its efforts,  nor did its plan include the funding required to carry out such strategies.", "DOD\u2019s strategic workforce plan currently is not fully aligned with the  budget process or other workforce initiatives because there is no  requirement for DOD\u2019s plan to be aligned with these other efforts.  Additionally, there is not a common understanding of how the  department\u2019s strategic workforce plan will be or should be used within the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.  Officials from the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service, who have  overall responsibility for DOD\u2019s strategic workforce plan, told us they do  not envision the plan being linked to other strategic workforce efforts, but  added that they believe the workforce planning process itself has value  for those involved in the development process.", "In contrast, officials from the Total Force Requirements and Sourcing  Policies Directorate within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness told us that the strategic workforce plan in  its current form is more useful as a source of demographic information on  the department\u2019s civilian workforce than as a strategic document intended  to guide workforce decisions. These officials further stated that the plan  would be more useful as a strategic document if certain actions were  taken, such as aligning the strategic workforce plan with the DOD budget  process, among other things. In addition, although the plan states that  DOD intends to align it with the DOD budget and total force\u2013management  processes, it did not include specific details or time frames for doing so.", "According to officials with the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory  Service, they have been unable to make progress on these efforts  because of a lack of information and challenges in coordinating with other  offices within DOD. These officials further stated that they do not foresee  these challenges being resolved before the department issues its next  strategic workforce plan. Our analysis of the Fiscal Year 2013-2018  Strategic Workforce Plan in particular indicates that without fully aligning  DOD\u2019s strategic workforce plan with the budget process and management  workforce initiatives, such as those to address recruiting, retention, and  readiness issues associated with declining morale, the department will  not be in the best position to make informed management and resource  decisions about its workforce.", "What we found in our analysis of the Fiscal Year 2013-2018 Strategic  Workforce Plan is in line with a body of work we have conducted in recent  years examining other DOD strategic workforce efforts, which found that  not aligning the plan with other strategic workforce initiatives is a long- standing issue within DOD. These include workforce-sizing decisions and  total force\u2013management efforts.", "In July 2012, we testified on our observations of DOD\u2019s planning for  its civilian workforce requirements and reported on DOD\u2019s efforts  since the 1990s to reduce its civilian workforce. Specifically, we found  that these efforts did not focus on taking a strategic approach to its  workforce downsizing and reshaping efforts, which resulted in  imbalances to the shape, skills, and retirement eligibility of its  workforce. We found that this was especially true of the civilian  acquisition workforce, which from September 1989 to September  1999 was reduced by almost 47 percent. This rate of reduction  substantially exceeded that of the rest of the DOD workforce. We  concluded that 11 consecutive years of downsizing produced serious  imbalances in the skills and experience of the highly talented and  specialized civilian acquisition workforce, putting DOD on the verge of  a retirement-driven talent drain. Moreover, we found that the lack of  an adequate number of trained acquisition and contract-oversight  personnel has, at times, contributed to unmet expectations and placed  DOD at risk of potentially paying more than necessary.", "In January 2013, we reported on DOD\u2019s efforts to implement its self- imposed cap on its civilian workforce levels, and found that the  department had not completed its competency-gap assessments\u2014 identifying gaps in the existing or projected civilian workforce that  should be addressed to ensure the department has continued access  to needed critical skills and competencies. As a result, we  concluded that information on competency gaps was unavailable to  help inform decision making about DOD\u2019s civilian workforce when  implementing the cap. We also concluded that a fully developed  workforce plan, with all completed gap assessments, would help DOD  make informed decisions about reducing its workforce and develop  strategies to mitigate skill shortages that affect achieving the mission.  As a result, we recommended that DOD involve functional community  managers and use information from its critical skill and competency- gap assessments as they are completed to make informed decisions  for future changes to the workforce and that it document its strategies.  DOD partially concurred with our recommendation and stated that it  aligns its workforce, both in size and structure, to mission  requirements and justifies the current size and possible reductions or  increases to the workforce based on mission workload rather than  competency or skill gaps needed to deliver capabilities. However, we  concluded in that report that DOD is not in a position to justify the size  of its workforce until it has fully addressed its statutory requirement to  identify areas of critical-skill and competency gaps within the civilian  workforce. At the time of our current review, DOD maintained its  civilian workforce cap, and, in addition, section 955 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required the  Secretary of Defense to ensure that the civilian and service contractor  workforces are appropriately sized to support and execute the  National Military Strategy, taking into account military personnel and  force-structure levels, and to develop an efficiencies plan for those  workforces. Section 955 further requires that the efficiencies plan  achieve savings in total funding of the civilian and service contractor  workforces that are not less than certain savings achieved from  reductions in military end strength over a 6-year period, subject to  certain exceptions.", "In May 2013, we reported on DOD\u2019s total force\u2013management efforts  and found that DOD had taken some steps to improve its  understanding and management of its total workforce, but it had not  assessed the appropriate mix of its military, civilian, and contractor  personnel capabilities in its strategic workforce plan as required by  law. We concluded that the department was hampered in its ability  to make more-informed strategic workforce mix decisions, which are  crucial to meeting DOD\u2019s statutory responsibility to manage its total  workforce. We recommended that DOD revise its existing workforce  policies and procedures according to current statutory requirements in  Section 129a of Title 10 of the United States Code as well as  regulatory requirements set forth in the Office of Federal Procurement  Policy\u2019s September 2011 policy letter to address the (1) determination  of the appropriate workforce mix, and (2) identification of critical  functions. DOD partially concurred and stated that the department\u2019s  strategic workforce plan is an integral tool in informing policies and  procedures for retention, recruitment, and accession planning and  helps inform the demographic makeup of its civilian personnel  inventory. DOD also stated that the department justifies its workforce  size based on mission workload, rather than competency or skills  gaps. However, we concluded in that report that DOD is required by  law to establish policies and procedures that require the use of the  strategic workforce plan when making determinations of the  appropriate mix of total workforce personnel necessary to perform its  mission, and to include in the strategic workforce plan an assessment  of the appropriate mix of military, civilian, and contractor personnel  capabilities.
