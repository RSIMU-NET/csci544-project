However, AID's ability to measure the impact of its activities on reducing transmission of HIV/AIDS is limited by (1) inconsistent use of performance indicators, (2) sporadic data collection, and (3) lack of routine reporting of results to headquarters. As part of its approach for allocating the 53 percent increase in funding for HIV/AIDS prevention activities in sub-Saharan Africa for fiscal year 2001, AID prepared a plan to expand monitoring and evaluation systems in countries designated as in need of significant increases in assistance. However, when implemented, the monitoring and evaluation requirements in the plan will not initially include all countries where AID missions and regional offices in sub-Saharan Africa implement HIV/AIDS programs. Further, the plan does not specify to whom these data will be reported or how the information will be used.

Further, given the scale of the epidemic, AIDS has  grown beyond a public health problem to become a humanitarian and  developmental crisis. For example, the National Intelligence Council  concluded that the persistence of infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, is  likely to aggravate and in some cases provoke economic decline, social  fragmentation, and political destabilization. In addition, the Council found  that the epidemic threatens to weaken the military capabilities of countries  and because of the involvement of sub-Saharan African troops in  international peacekeeping efforts it could hinder those activities as well.

In July 2000, USAID also began to fund other activities\u2014such as  treatment for tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections and care for  AIDS orphans\u2014aimed at mitigating the impact of the disease.", "USAID has a decentralized organizational structure (see fig. 1), which vests  most of the authority for developing and implementing programs in the  country offices, or missions. Four regional bureaus, such as the Africa  Bureau, support field mission activities through the provision of technical,  logistical, and financial assistance. The Global Bureau\u2019s HIV/AIDS Division  negotiates contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with private  voluntary organizations that missions can access for particular expertise,  such as development of HIV/AIDS prevention communication campaigns.  The Global Bureau also funds research that can be used to improve mission  programs, supports the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS), and coordinates efforts by other U.S. government agencies,  such as the Centers for Disease Control, to address the epidemic in  developing countries.

The increasing  prevalence of HIV/AIDS has had a substantial impact on the region\u2019s  population, resulting in (1) high death rates, (2) increased infant and child  mortality, (3) reduced life expectancy, and (4) large numbers of orphans.  The epidemic has also offset gains from investment in social and economic  development. Despite the efforts of USAID and international donors,  however, several challenges to slowing the epidemic\u2019s spread remain.  These include social, cultural, and political issues endemic to the region."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effect of the AIDS Epidemic on the Population of Sub-Saharan Africa", "paragraphs": ["The most direct impact of AIDS has been to increase the overall numbers of  deaths in affected populations. UNAIDS estimates that since 1993, the  number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa has tripled  to 25.3 million and more than 17 million people have died. According to the  U.S. Census Bureau, estimated death rates have increased by 50 to 500  percent in eastern and southern Africa over what they would have been  without AIDS. For example, in Kenya the death rate is twice as high, at 14.1  per 1,000 population, as opposed to the 6.5 per 1,000 it would have been  without AIDS.", "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, infant and child mortality rates in  sub-Saharan Africa are also significantly higher than they would have been  without AIDS. For example, in Zimbabwe infant mortality without AIDS  would have been 30 per 1,000 in 2000. With AIDS, the infant mortality rate  in 2000 was 62 per 1,000. The Census Bureau estimates that by 2010, more  infants in Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Namibia will die from  AIDS than from any other cause. Rising child mortality rates due to AIDS  are most dramatic in countries where death from other causes, such as  diarrhea, had been significantly reduced. For example, in South Africa,  Census Bureau data show that 45 percent of all deaths among children  under age 5 in 2000 were AIDS related. In Zimbabwe, 70 percent of child  deaths in 2000 were AIDS related, and AIDS-related deaths there are  expected to increase to 80 percent by 2010.", "According to the World Bank, one of the most disturbing long-term trends  associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic is reduced life expectancy. By 2010  to 2015, life expectancy is expected to decline 17 years in nine countries in  sub-Saharan Africa, to an average of 47 years. For example, the Census  Bureau estimates that a child born in 2000 in Botswana can expect to live  only 39 years. Without AIDS, that child would have a life expectancy of  71 years. In addition, the Census Bureau estimates that life expectancy in  Botswana will decline to 29 years by 2010, a level not seen since the  beginning of the 20th century. This dramatic decrease in life expectancy in  the region represents a reversal of the gains of the past 30 years. Figure 3  shows the impact of AIDS on longevity in 13 sub-Saharan African countries.", "Also, because of AIDS, children in sub-Saharan Africa are being orphaned  in increasingly large numbers. According to UNAIDS, by the end of 1999,  approximately 13 million children worldwide had been orphaned by AIDS,  with 95 percent of them in Africa. Further, according to a report prepared  for USAID, orphans will eventually comprise up to 33 percent of the  population under age 15 in some African countries. While orphans in  Africa have traditionally been absorbed into extended families, the advent  of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has caused these family structures to be  overburdened, leaving many children without adequate care. The World  Bank notes that orphans are more likely to be malnourished and less likely  to go to school. According to UNAIDS, orphans are frequently without the  means to survive and therefore may turn to prostitution or other behaviors  that heighten their risk of contracting HIV themselves. Figure 4 shows the  numbers of AIDS orphans in 12 African countries in 1999.", "The spread of HIV/AIDS has begun to negatively affect population growth  rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Typically, developing countries experience a  population growth rate of 2 percent or greater, compared with much lower  rates in developed countries. As late as 1998, the Census Bureau predicted  that the AIDS epidemic would have no effect on population growth in  sub-Saharan Africa because of the region\u2019s high fertility rate. However, the  Census Bureau now predicts that by 2003, Botswana, South Africa, and  Zimbabwe will all be experiencing negative population growth due to high  prevalence of HIV and the low fertility and high infant and child mortality  rates in these three countries. By 2010, the Census Bureau estimates that  the growth rate for these countries will be (-1) percent, the first time that  negative population growth has been projected for developing countries.  Population growth is expected to stagnate in at least five other countries in  the region, including Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, and  Swaziland."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of AIDS Epidemic on Social and Economic Development", "paragraphs": ["AIDS has had a significant effect on social and economic development in  the region as increasing numbers of people in their most productive years  have died. For example, according to USAID, AIDS directly affects the  education sector as the supply of experienced teachers is reduced by  AIDS-related illness and death. The World Bank estimates that more than  30 percent of the teachers in Malawi and Zambia are already infected with  HIV. According to UNAIDS, during the first 10 months of 1998 1,300  teachers in Zambia died of AIDS\u2014the equivalent of about 66 percent of all  new teachers trained annually. In addition, fewer children are attending  school. The death of a parent is a permanent loss of income that often  requires the removal of children from school to save on educational  expenses and to increase household labor and income.", "The agriculture sector has also been affected by the epidemic. Agriculture,  the biggest sector in most African economies, accounts for a large portion  of economic output and employs the majority of workers. However, as  farmers become too ill to tend their crops, agricultural production declines  for the country. For example, according to UNAIDS, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, many  cases of reduced cultivation of crops such as cotton, coffee, and cocoa  have been reported. Likewise, in Zimbabwe, agricultural output has fallen  by 50 percent over a 5-year period during the late 1990s, due in part to  farmers becoming sick and dying from AIDS.", "In addition, the cost of doing business in Africa has increased in many  sectors of the economy due to HIV/AIDS. The epidemic\u2019s costs to  employers include expenditures for medical care and funeral expenses. A  1999 report prepared for USAID found that because of the increased  levels of employee turnover due to HIV/AIDS, employers also are  experiencing greater expenses due to the recruitment and training of new  employees. According to the United Nations International Labour Office, to  combat increased costs, some employers in sub-Saharan Africa have begun  to hire or train two or three employees for the same position because of the  concern that employees in key positions may get sick and die from AIDS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Challenges Have Hindered International Efforts to Slow the Spread of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa", "paragraphs": ["While international organizations have worked to stem the spread of the  disease, funding constraints, cultural and social traditions, the low  socioeconomic status of women, weak health care infrastructure, difficulty  reaching men in uniform, and the slow response of national governments  have impeded their efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Donor Spending Falls Short of Need", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, UNAIDS estimated that at least $3 billion is needed annually for  HIV prevention and care in sub-Saharan Africa.

USAID\u2014which has been the largest international donor to fight HIV/AIDS  in Africa\u2014spent $114 million in the region in fiscal year 2000, of its total  worldwide HIV/AIDS budget of $200 million. As shown in table 1, USAID  efforts translated into per capita expenditures for 23 sub-Saharan African  countries in fiscal year 2000 ranging from $0.78 in Zambia to $0.03 in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "The social stigma surrounding issues of sex and death in African culture  makes it difficult to discuss the risks of HIV/AIDS and measures to prevent  the disease. A 2000 report by the Congressional Research Service notes  that unwillingness by religious or community leaders to discuss condom  use or risky behavior limits efforts to introduce condoms or HIV testing as  ways to prevent further spread of the disease. According to UNAIDS,  discrimination may also lead people who are infected to hide their status to  protect themselves and their families from shame.  For example, a 2000  UNAIDS report stated that in 1999 in Rusinga Island, Kenya, children  whose parents had died of AIDS would tell others that witchcraft or a curse  had been the cause of death instead. Traditional beliefs and practices in  sub-Saharan Africa also contribute to the spread of the disease and limit  the effectiveness of prevention programs. For example, a common custom  promoted by traditional healers in Zambia is for a widow to engage in  sexual relations to \u201ccleanse\u201d herself of the spirit of the deceased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Low Socioeconomic Status of Women Impedes Their Ability to Take Precautions Against Infection", "paragraphs": ["Transmission of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is primarily from heterosexual  contact and, unlike other places in the world where men have higher rates  of infection, 55 percent of people with AIDS in the region are women.  According to UNAIDS, African girls aged 15 to 19 are approximately eight  times more likely to be HIV positive than are boys their own age. Between  the ages of 20 and 24, women are still three times more likely to be infected  than men their age. These young women are usually infected by older men,  often through coerced or forced sex, according to the Congressional  Research Service. The higher infection rates among women are due, in  part, to the higher vulnerability of the female reproductive tract to  infection. However, according to UNAIDS, high infection rates are also  caused by women\u2019s limited ability to make informed choices to prevent the  disease, due to their low socioeconomic status. Low levels of education for  women in the region make it more difficult for them to find work, forcing  them to rely on men for economic sustenance. According to USAID, laws in  some countries, such as Kenya, do not allow women to inherit property. As  a result, with no job skills or education, a woman may choose prostitution  to support her children following the death of her spouse. In addition,  because women lack economic resources of their own and may fear  abandonment by or violence from their male partners, they have little or no  control over how and when they have sex. According to UNAIDS, a woman  may be fearful to ask her male partner to use a condom because he may  interpret her actions as implying that she knows of his infidelities or that  she has been unfaithful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weak Health Care Systems Make It Difficult to Stem the Epidemic", "paragraphs": ["The epidemic is overwhelming the already fragile health care systems in  sub-Saharan Africa, and weak health care infrastructure is a barrier to  diagnosis, treatment, and care of the affected populations.

The countries of the region frequently lack  basic commodities such as syringes as well as safe drug storage,  laboratories, and trained clinicians. Further, according to USAID,  mother-to-child transmission of HIV is increased by the lack of access to  drugs that block HIV replication, while this treatment has reduced mother-to-child transmission to less than 1 percent in developed countries.  According to UNAIDS, AIDS patients take up a majority of the hospital  beds in many cities, leaving non-AIDS patients without adequate care.

For example, the HIV infection rate for the armed  forces of Tanzania is estimated to be 15 to 30 percent, compared with about  an 8 percent prevalence rate for the general population. According to  USAID, in developing countries, military and police forces generally tend to  be a young and highly mobile population that spends extended periods of  time away from families and home communities. As a group, this  population is likely to have more contact with casual sexual partners and  commercial sex workers and engage in high-risk sexual behavior. As a  result, the group is at increased risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS and transmitting  it to the general population. Military and police forces have constant  interaction with civilian populations where they are posted; therefore, they  have been identified as an important target group for campaigns for the  prevention and mitigation of HIV/AIDS. However, according to USAID,  militaries have been unwilling to release detailed reports on HIV  prevalence among troops, which has limited the ability of donor assistance  groups such as USAID from working with African militaries and police  forces.", "Another factor limiting USAID in working with African military and police  forces is a legislative restriction prohibiting assistance for training, advice,  or financial support to foreign military and law enforcement forces. In  1996, USAID\u2019s General Counsel took the position that the restrictions do  not prohibit participation of foreign police or military forces in USAID\u2019s  HIV/AIDS prevention programs if three conditions are met: (1) the  programs for police and military forces are part of a larger public health  initiative, and exclusion of these groups would impair achievement of the  overall public health objectives; (2) the programs must be the same as  those offered to the general population; and (3) neither the programs nor  any commodities transferred under them can be readily adapted for law  enforcement, military, or internal security functions. A USAID official in  one country told us that the USAID legal adviser in her region requires a  justification for each activity directed toward police or military forces and  that this is a disincentive to pursuing such activities. Overall, we found that  only 8 of the 19 missions reported working with the military or police  forces.

Overlapping  contributions of HIV/AIDS prevention programs of national governments  and of other donors make direct causal linkage of behavior or prevalence  changes to USAID\u2019s activities hard to measure. To assess its programs,  USAID must rely on proxy measures because HIV has a long latency period,  and limited surveillance data are available in the region. Generally  accepted proxy measures include knowledge of HIV/AIDS and sexual  behavior changes, such as increased condom use.

For example, the mission in Nigeria reported supporting an information  campaign among sex workers, transport workers, and youth to increase  condom use. In addition, the mission in Malawi supported voluntary HIV  testing and counseling services in two cities, Lilongwe and Blantyre.", "Ten USAID missions and one regional office that conducted behavior  change communication activities reported increased knowledge and  awareness about HIV/AIDS, to measure the effectiveness of these types of  programs. For example, six missions and one regional office provided  information that showed an increase in knowledge of condoms as a means  of preventing HIV infection among people surveyed. The mission in Ghana  reported that there was an increase in the proportion of people who knew  that a healthy-looking person could have HIV (from 70 percent of women  and 77 percent of men in 1993 to 75 percent and 82 percent, respectively, in  1998) but reported no change in the proportion who were aware of  mother-to-child transmission (82 percent of women and 85 percent of men  in 1993; 83 percent and 85 percent, respectively, in 1998).

The challenge for  HIV/AIDS prevention then is one of expanded acceptance, availability, and  use by high-risk groups. USAID projects in sub-Saharan Africa encourage  production and marketing of condoms by the private sector to ensure the  availability of affordable, quality condoms when and where people need  them.", "USAID uses sales of condoms marketed through its program as a measure  of the results of its condom promotion activities. USAID missions in 15 of  19 countries and one of three regional offices reported increased condom  sales, with decreased sales reported in Malawi and Uganda. According to  a USAID contractor, sales of condoms promoted under USAID\u2019s program  decreased in Malawi because of an economic downturn in that country and  because another donor was providing free condoms. Sales in Uganda were  affected by the introduction of a competing brand of condoms distributed  by another donor. Between 1997 and 1999, the number of condoms sold  more than doubled in Benin, from 2.9 million to 6.5 million, and increased  in Zimbabwe from 2 million to 9 million.

According to these officials, the waiver process can take up to 4 weeks for each waiver, depending on the workload of the contracting  specialist, the location of the office applying for the waiver, and the amount  of the purchase. In January 2001, USAID instituted a policy to grant source  and origin waivers for extended periods of time in emergency situations.

USAID commented that the report did not include some important  steps that USAID has taken to overcome internal factors that could  hinder HIV/AIDS program expansion. USAID provided documentary  evidence to support its assertion that the agency has streamlined its  procurement policies for purchasing HIV/AIDS diagnostic kits. We  therefore modified our report to add a specific reference to USAID\u2019s  initiation of a policy in January 2001 that extends a waiver of the \u201cBuy  American Act\u201d requirements to allow for the purchase of HIV products  manufactured offshore."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to Mr. Hutton, David Bernet, Leslie Bharadwaja, Aleta Hancock,  Lynne Holloway, Jessica Lucas, Rona Mendelsohn, and Tom Zingale made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ordering Information", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report is free.
