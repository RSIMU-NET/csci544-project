First, commercial firms use an approach that evolves a product to its ultimate capabilities on the basis of mature technologies and available resources. This approach allows only the product features and capabilities achievable with available resources in the initial development. Further product enhancements are planned for subsequent development efforts when technologies are proven to be mature and other resources are available. Second, commercial firms ensure that a high level of knowledge exists at key junctures during a product's development. The knowledge-based process includes three points: (1) Before a program is launched, successful programs match customer needs and available resources--technology, engineering knowledge, time, and funding; (2) About midway through development, the ability of the product's design is demonstrated to be stable and meet performance requirements; and (3) Before production begins, programs must show that a product can be manufactured within cost, schedule, and quality targets. In contrast, the F/A-22 program illustrates what can happen when a major acquisition program is not guided by the principles of evolutionary, knowledge-based acquisition. When the program was started, several key technologies were not mature. Program managers proceeded through development without the requisite knowledge to effectively manage program risk and, at the start of production, key manufacturing processes were not under control. The F/A-22 program has undergone significant cost increases. Instead of fielding early capabilities to the war fighter, the development cycle has extended to 19 years, so far, and original quantities have been significantly reduced, raising concerns about the capability the program will eventually deliver. DOD recognizes the need to get better weapon system outcomes, and its newest acquisition policy emphasizes the use of evolutionary, knowledge-based acquisition concepts proven to produce better outcomes in developing new products. However, policy changes alone are not enough. Leadership commitment and attention to putting the policy into practice for individual programs is needed to avoid the problems of the past.

There are  important competing priorities. Health care costs are growing at double- digit rates, and spending on homeland security will likely grow as we seek  to defeat terrorism worldwide. We face an oncoming demographic tidal  wave, and by 2035 the number of people who are 65 or older will have  doubled, creating much larger demands on the federal budget. The  demand of funding for entitlement programs continues to grow, creating  increasing pressures on discretionary funding for other federal priorities  like education and defense.

As per your request, I will compare acquisition  practices and decisions made for the F/A-22 with these best practices for  developing new products. The divergence between F/A-22 experiences and  best product development practices, we believe, largely explains why the  F/A-22 has been in development for over 16 years and its cost has grown  substantially. It is also a primary contributor to other performance issues  that are currently faced by the program. My testimony will also include  observations on what can be done at this time to limit further negative  outcomes in the F/A-22 program.

Because of the lengthy time to develop new weapons, many enter the field  with outdated technologies and a diminished supply base needed for  system support. Frequently, this requires upgrades to the capability as  soon as the new system is fielded. As previously noted, these inefficiencies  have often led to reduced quantities of new systems. In turn, legacy  systems remain in the inventory for longer periods, requiring greater  operations and support cost that pull funds from other accounts, including  modernization.

First, a match must be made between the customer\u2019s needs and the  available resources\u2014technology, engineering knowledge, time, and  funding\u2014before a program is launched. Second, a product\u2019s design must  demonstrate its ability to meet performance requirements and be stable  about midway through development. Third, the developer must show that  the product can be manufactured within cost, schedule, and quality targets  and is demonstrated to be reliable before production begins. The following  table illustrates more specifically what we have learned about how  successful programs gather knowledge as they move through product  development.", "DOD programs often do not employ these practices. We found that if the  evolutionary, knowledge-based acquisition concepts were not applied, a  cascade of negative effects became magnified in the product development  and production phases of an acquisition program. These led to acquisition  outcomes that included significant cost increases and schedule delays,  poor product quality and reliability, and delays in getting new capability to  the war fighter. This is often the case in DOD programs as shown in our  past work on systems like F/A-22 fighter, C-17 airlifter, V-22 tiltrotor  aircraft, PAC-3 missile, BAT antitank munition, and others. We did find  some DOD programs that employed best practice concepts and have had  more successful program outcomes to date.

This initial decision  sets the stage for the eventual outcome\u2014desirable or problematic. The  match is ultimately achieved in every development program, but in  successful development programs, it occurs prior to program launch. In  successful programs, negotiations and trade-offs occur before a product  development is launched to ensure that a match exists between customer  expectations and developer resources. The results achieved from this  match are balanced and achievable requirements, sufficient investment to  complete the development, and a firm commitment to deliver the product.  Commercial companies we have visited usually limit product development  cycle-time to less than 5 years.", "In DOD, this match is seldom achieved. It is not unusual for DOD to  bypass early trade-offs and negotiations, instead planning to develop a  product based on a rigid set of requirements that are unachievable within  a reasonable development time frame. This results in cost and schedule  commitments that are unrealistic. Although a program can take as long as  15 years in DOD, the program manager is expected to develop and be  accountable for precise cost and schedule estimates made at the start of  the program. Because of their short tenures, it normally takes several  program managers to complete product development. Consequently, the  program manager that commits to the cost and schedule estimate at the  beginning of the program is not the same person responsible for achieving  it. Therefore, program accountability is problematic. Ironically, this  outcome is rational in the traditional acquisition environment. The  pressures put on program managers to get programs approved encourage  promising more than can be delivered for the time and money allotted.  They are not put in a position to succeed.", "The differences in the practices employed by successful commercial firms  and DOD reflect the different demands imposed on programs by the  environments in which they are managed. Specific practices take root and  are sustained because they help a program succeed in its environment.  The way success and failure are defined for commercial and defense  product developments differs considerably, which creates a different set  of incentives and evokes different behaviors from managers. Attempts at  reforming weapon system acquisitions have not succeeded because they  did not change these incentives. All of the participants in the acquisition  process play a part in creating incentives.

It was not until September 2000, or 9 years into  development, that the integrated avionics reached a maturity level  acceptable to begin product development. During development, the  integrated avionics was a source of schedule delays and cost growth.  Since 1997, avionics software development and flight-testing have been  delayed, and the cost of avionics development has increased by over $980  million dollars. Today, the avionics still has problems affecting the ability  to complete developmental testing and begin operational testing, and the  Air Force cannot predict when a solution will be found.", "Design\u2014The effects of immature technologies cascaded into the F/A-22  development program, making it more difficult to achieve a stable design  at the right time. The standard measure of design stability is 90 percent of  design drawings releasable by the critical design review. The F/A-22  achieved only 26 percent by this review, taking an additional 43 months to  achieve the standard. Moving ahead in development, the program  experienced several design and manufacturing problems described by the  F/A-22 program office as a \u201crolling wave\u201d effect throughout system  integration and final assembly. These effects included numerous design  changes, labor inefficiencies, parts shortages, out of sequence work, cost  increases, and schedule delays.", "Production\u2014At the start of production, the F/A-22 did not have  manufacturing processes under control and was only beginning testing  and demonstration efforts for system reliability. Initially, the F/A-22 had  taken steps to use statistical process control data to gain control of critical  manufacturing processes by full rate production. However, the program  abandoned this best practice approach in 2000 with less than 50 percent of  its critical manufacturing processes in control.

The Air Force estimated that in late 2001, when it  entered production, it should have been able to demonstrate almost 2  flying hours between maintenance actions. Instead, it could fly an average  of only 0.44 hours between maintenance actions. Since then there has  been a decrease in reliability. As of November 2002, development test  aircraft have been completing only 0.29 hours between maintenance  actions. Additionally, the program was slow to fix and correct problems  that had affected reliability. At the time of our review in July 2002,  program officials had identified about 260 different types of failures and  had identified fixes for less than 50 percent of the failures.

The problems  identified are of particular concern, given Air Force plans to increase  production rates and make a full rate production decision in 2004. The  problems include:    unexpected shutdowns (instability) of the avionics,    excessive movement of the vertical tails,    overheating in rear portions of the aircraft,    separations of the horizontal tail material,   inability to meet airlift support requirements, and    excessive ground maintenance actions.", "These problems are still being addressed, and not all of them have been  solved as yet.

Despite remaining testing and outstanding problems, the Air Force plans  to continue acquiring production aircraft at increasing annual rates and  make the full rate production decision in 2004. This is a very risky strategy,  given outstanding issues in the test program and the system\u2019s less than  expected reliability.

First, the current OSD production estimate  does not include $1.3 billion included in the latest Air Force acquisition  plan. Second, schedule delays in developmental testing could further  postpone the start of the first F/A-22 multiyear contract, which has already  been delayed until fiscal year 2006.

Last, we found several risk factors that may  increase future production costs, including the dependency of certain cost  reduction plans on Air Force investments that are not being made to  improve production processes, the availability of funding, and a reduction  in funding for support costs. In addition, DOD has not informed Congress  about the quantity of aircraft that can be procured within existing  production cost limits, which we believe could be fewer than the 276  currently planned.
