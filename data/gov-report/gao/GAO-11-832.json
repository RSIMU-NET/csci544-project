In response, international financial institutions (IFI), including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), have taken actions to increase financial assistance for affected countries. Between 2008 and 2010, Congress appropriated $3.3 billion to the World Bank's International Development Association, which funds development programs in LICs. Congress also authorized the U.S. representative at the IMF to vote to approve the sale of some of the IMF's gold to increase lending to LICs. LICs' ability to repay debt remains important as financing levels rise and decisions are made about the mix of loans and grants they receive. GAO was asked to examine (1) the economic impact of the crises on LICs, (2) IFIs' responses and reported results, and (3) IFIs' assessment of the impact of the crises on LICs' ability to repay their debt. GAO analyzed documents and information from the World Bank and the IMF, including data on macroeconomic indicators, financial commitments, and debt analyses.

The crises also slowed foreign direct investment in LICs, which had been growing steadily since 2000. During the crises period, LICs' average economic growth slowed from 7.1 percent in 2007 to 5.3 percent in 2009. IFIs have reported that lower growth rates caused by the crises could lead to increases in poverty in LICs, and our previous work shows that many LICs were experiencing protracted food emergencies and had severe and widespread malnourishment even prior to the onset of the crises. During the crises, food and fuel prices rose significantly, then declined, and have risen again in 2011 to levels experienced during the crises. In response to the crises, IFIs increased funding and disbursed some funds more quickly to LICs, but the impact of these actions on LIC government spending has been difficult to establish. Between 2008 and 2010, the World Bank committed $18.1 billion through regular lending and five crisis response initiatives, an increase of 39 percent from the pre-crises period. Total first year disbursements also increased by 12.7 percent. Three of four of the initiatives designed to increase the speed of disbursements met their goal. However, the proportion of committed funds that have been disbursed in the first year following project approval declined, as compared to the pre-crises period. Disbursement rates depend on several factors, including recipient country capacity, need, and governance; and the type of lending. The World Bank's International Finance Corporation responded to the crises through investments, trade initiatives, and enhanced coordination with donors, but its response was limited by the availability of resources and recipient countries' limited ability to implement programs quickly. The IMF boosted lending to LICs more than sixfold to $4.9 billion, which governments could use to bolster their reserves or make international payments. While most LIC governments' spending increased during the crises, we found that the impact of World Bank and IMF actions on spending has been difficult to establish. According to IFIs' analysis, the crises did not significantly impair LICs' ability to repay their future debt, and thus did not necessitate an increase in their access to grants, which do not have to be repaid, relative to loans. The reliability of this analysis depends on the realism of IFIs' projections, which include quick economic recovery, implementation of policy reforms, and low inflation. According to IFIs' projections, the ability of six LICs to repay their debt improved during the crises, and thus they received more loans instead of grants. However, the IMF subsequently reported renewed risks to the global economic recovery, meaning that projections for future export growth, government revenue, and inflation might be too optimistic. This report contains no recommendations. The World Bank, IMF, and U.S Treasury generally agreed with our findings but identified areas to provide greater context."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 40 poorest countries in the world, known as low-income countries  (LICs), have been negatively impacted by successive and overlapping  food, fuel, and financial crises since 2007.

In response to the crises, IFIs have taken  actions to increase financial assistance for affected countries.", "Between 2008 and 2010, Congress appropriated $3.3 billion to the World  Bank\u2019s International Development Association (IDA), which funds health,  education, infrastructure, agriculture, economic, and institutional  development programs in about 80 developing countries, including LICs.  During this period, IDA launched crises response programs in LICs to  protect the poor and vulnerable, maintain and increase social and  infrastructure spending, and\u2014in conjunction with the World Bank\u2019s  International Finance Corporation (IFC)\u2014support and promote private  sector activity. In 2009, Congress authorized the Secretary of the  Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director to the IMF to vote to  approve the sale of a limited amount of the IMF\u2019s gold to, among other  things, provide additional lending to LICs.

Recognizing that debt relief recipients  remain vulnerable to future debt problems, caused by shocks, such as food  and fuel price increases or adverse weather events, the World Bank and  IMF jointly conduct a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) to assess how a  country\u2019s current level of debt and prospective new borrowing affect its  ability to service its future debt. An important output of the DSA is a  country\u2019s debt distress rating, which is used to determine the mix of grants  and loans provided by IDA to countries. For example, countries classified at  a high risk of debt distress receive 100 percent grants from IDA, which do  not have to be repaid, while countries at moderate risk receive a blend of  50 percent grants and 50 percent loans, which are provided at below- market rates.", "You asked us to assess the IFIs\u2019 response to LICs\u2019 needs during the  crises.

We interviewed officials from these institutions, as well as from the  Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID). We compiled data for macroeconomic indicators from IMF, World  Bank, and United Nations (UN) databases and compared each LIC\u2019s  macroeconomic performance during the crises period of 2007 through  2009 to the pre-crisis period of 2004 through 2006. We selected three  countries in Africa for more thorough analysis: Burundi, Ethiopia, and  Tanzania. We selected these countries based on several criteria, including  the number of IFI projects and amount of IFI financial support. Our  selection of countries is nongeneralizable and meant to be illustrative, not  representative. We focused on the amount and speed of financial  assistance and the extent to which IFI actions caused increases in recipient  governments\u2019 spending, but we recognize that there are other less  quantifiable considerations for assessing the impacts and effectiveness of  IFI financial assistance. We analyzed World Bank data on financial  commitments and disbursements made to LICs between 2005 and 2007,  the pre-crisis period, and between 2008 and 2010, the crises response  period, to evaluate whether the World Bank\u2019s crisis response was  consistent with the institutions\u2019 stated goals. We used information on IMF  program and funding levels to determine the nature and size of the IMF\u2019s  response to the crises and assessed the sensitivity of the results of an IMF  analysis of government spending in LICs in 2009 using data from the IMF  and the World Governance Indicators. We analyzed joint IMF-World Bank  debt analyses, IMF program documents, and World Bank Country  Assistance Strategies to assess IMF-World Bank efforts to monitor debt  sustainability for the three case study countries.

Prior to, and partly in parallel with the financial  crisis, global food and fuel prices increased sharply between mid-2007 and  mid-2008. In some cases this exacerbated the impact of the financial crisis  and some governments banned food exports. Although international food  and fuel prices dropped precipitously as the global financial crisis unfolded  in late 2008, they have resurged to record highs again in 2011, igniting  concerns about a repeat of the 2008 food crisis and its negative impact on  poor people in developing countries, particularly LICs.", "IFIs and global leaders have launched a coordinated international  response to the crises. In March 2009, the World Bank announced a  comprehensive crises response framework that could channel additional  donor contributions to poor countries to bolster ongoing World Bank  activities.

To  respond to the crises within the context of this fixed set of resources, IDA  could choose to shift its priorities toward crisis response, accelerate  disbursements of existing IDA funds, or provide additional funds from  donors or internal resources.", "To complement regular IDA lending during the crises, the World Bank  established a crisis response framework comprised of five initiatives that  committed $12.2 billion in financial assistance to LICs between 2008 and  2010. These commitments included $10.8 billion in existing IDA funds  and $1.4 billion in new financial assistance. The five initiatives are:  the Global Food Crisis Response Program (food program),  established in May 2008 to help countries reduce the impact of high  food prices on the poor by providing rapid financial assistance, policy  advice, and social protection services such as food stamps and  school feeding programs for the most vulnerable;  the IDA Fast Track Facility, established in December 2008 to help  countries offset the impacts of the financial crisis on governments\u2019  budget expenditures, including social and infrastructure programs;  the Rapid Social Response Program (social protection program),  established in April 2009 to help countries mitigate the impacts of  crises by promoting social protection programs through rapid  financing of immediate interventions in safety nets and other areas,  and by improving capacity needed to establish and implement  effective safety net systems;  the Infrastructure Recovery and Assets Platform (infrastructure  program), established in March 2009 to help countries mitigate the  impacts of the crises by supporting critical infrastructure investments  and new project development and implementation, and;  the Pilot Crisis Response Window, established in November 2009 to  help reduce the need for countries to make tradeoffs between  financing crises response efforts or long-term development programs  by providing new financing that was additional to countries\u2019 existing  IDA funds.", "In response to the crises, IDA committed $1.4 billion in new financial  assistance to 36 LICs between 2008 and 2010. Four of the five  initiatives\u2014the food, social protection, and infrastructure programs and  the Pilot Crisis Response Window\u2014aimed to increase the amount of  financial assistance available to LICs using additional donor contributions  and internal World Bank resources. We found that IDA committed $1.1  billion in new financial assistance to LICs through the Pilot Crisis  Response Window and $288 million in new grant assistance to LICs  through the food and social protection programs. The World Bank  reported that governments\u2019 requests for social protection grants to  establish and enhance safety net systems provided by the social  protection program significantly exceeded the availability of new  resources. By April 2011, LICs had submitted 133 project proposals  totaling $161 million against available funding of about $58.5 million.  These projects were to establish or enhance social protection activities  and safety net systems benefiting the poorest, as well as to improve the  data and institutional capacity necessary for effective implementation.  The World Bank further reported that it has established a permanent  Crisis Response Window effective July 2011 that could be used to  continue to fund activities supporting both crises response and  preparedness in IDA-eligible countries, including LICs. Finally, donors  did not provide additional funding to the infrastructure initiative, which was  originally designed to provide up to $3 billion to help offset the impact of  soaring energy prices.", "Four of the five IDA initiatives\u2014the Fast Track Facility, food program, social  protection program, and Pilot Crisis Response Window\u2014were designed to  increase the disbursement speed of commitments made from existing IDA  funds. While disbursement rates are a useful metric for capturing the World  Bank\u2019s response to the immediate needs of recipient countries through the  crises response initiatives, we recognize that there are other less  quantifiable considerations for assessing the impacts and effectiveness of  development assistance. These initiatives were also designed to increase  the speed of project preparation and processing, which occurs prior to  project approval. According to the World Bank, preparation time was  reduced during the crisis for both investment lending and development  policy lending programs. To determine whether the disbursement speed of  commitments made through the crises response initiatives had increased,  we compared the first year disbursement rates for each initiative to the first  year disbursement rate of projects approved from 2008 through 2010 that  did not fall under any initiative. The World Bank uses a different  methodology to report disbursement rates. We did not use the World  Bank\u2019s standard disbursement rate methodology because our analysis  sought to isolate those activities which were explicitly undertaken in  response to the crises.", "These initiatives committed approximately $3.9 billion to 32 LICs from  existing IDA funds. Three of four initiatives increased the speed of  disbursements. The infrastructure program, which committed $6.9 billion  in existing IDA funds in addition to the $3.9 billion, did not have a goal to  increase the speed of disbursements. More specifically:  \uf0b7  The first year disbursement rate was 69.1 percent for the Fast Track  Facility, compared to a first year disbursement rate of 33.5 percent for  projects that were not funded through an initiative.  \uf0b7  The first year disbursement rate was 64.5 percent for the food  program, compared to a first year disbursement rate of 33.5 percent  for projects that were not funded through an initiative. However, we  found that almost half of the commitments made through existing IDA  funds, about $405 million, went to three projects in Ethiopia and  Bangladesh. When these projects are excluded from the analysis, the  disbursement rate for this initiative declines to 39 percent.  \uf0b7  The first year disbursement rate for the social protection program was  34.1 percent, slightly higher than the first year disbursement rate of  33.5 percent for projects that were not funded through an initiative.  However, the social protection program did not increase the speed of  disbursements when compared to social protection projects approved  during the pre-crises period, which had a first year disbursement rate  of 47.8 percent. According to the World Bank, increasing the speed  of disbursements for social protection programs in LICs has been  challenging due to a lack of existing social protection programs and  recipient countries\u2019 capacity to effectively implement them. To  address this challenge and facilitate crises preparedness in LICs, the  World Bank intends to continue to finance the development of social  protection programs. In early 2011 donors emphasized the  importance of a continued focus on capacity building and improved  data collection in LICs, to help overcome these constraints.  \uf0b7  The Pilot Crisis Response Window did not increase the disbursement  speed of commitments, with a first year disbursement rate of 27.5  percent, compared to a first year disbursement rate of 33.5 percent for  projects that were not funded through an initiative (see fig. 9).", "In 2009, the Development Committee, an advisory group to the World  Bank and IMF, also urged the acceleration of the delivery of financial  assistance to recipient countries. However, we found that the World Bank  did not accelerate disbursements for both investment lending projects or  development policy lending projects for the group of LICs on average as a  whole even though a majority of countries received disbursements faster  during the crises response period. Specifically, the average first year  disbursement rate to LICs was 16.8 percent for all investment lending  projects approved between 2008 through 2010, as compared to an  average first year disbursement rate of 17.3 percent for all investment  lending projects approved between 2005 through 2007. Similarly, the  average first year disbursement rate to LICs was 90.7 percent for all  development policy lending projects approved between 2008 through  2010, as compared to an average first year disbursement rate of 96.9  percent for all development policy lending projects approved between  2005 through 2007. Overall, the average first year disbursement rate to  LICs was 31.1 percent for all projects approved between 2008 and 2010,  as compared to an average first year disbursement rate of 39.3 percent  for all projects approved between 2005 and 2007, a difference of about 8  percentage points. According to U.S. Treasury, this decline in part reflects  the World Bank\u2019s need to ensure that recipient country capacity and  governance controls were sufficiently robust to absorb the additional  resources provided during the crisis period.", "However, at the individual country level, total commitments in 22 of 36  LICs, including commitments made to both investment lending projects  and development policy lending projects, were disbursed faster during the  crises period than during the pre-crises period. Disbursement rates,  which vary over time, depend on a number of factors, including recipient  country capacity, need, and governance, and the type of lending. For  example, commitments to Burundi, a fragile state with limited capacity,  increased by 114 percent while disbursements increased by 46 percent,  which results in a lower disbursement rate during the crises response  period. (See fig.10.) LIC governments reported mixed experiences  relating to the timeliness of the World Bank\u2019s response to crises. Some  governments said they received financial support very rapidly, while  others noted that World Bank support had been sluggish. For a more  detailed analysis of World Bank commitments and disbursement rates to  individual countries, see appendix III.", "The World Bank reported that speed was facilitated by the Bank\u2019s new  rapid response policy and increased use of development policy lending  where circumstances permitted. In addition, World Bank and U.S.  Treasury officials reported that the restructuring of existing lending  portfolios facilitated an expedient response in some countries.", "Two initiatives were designed to support domestic spending in recipient  countries during the crises, in areas including social services, education,  and infrastructure. In 2010, the World Bank reported that both initiatives\u2014 the Fast Track Facility and the infrastructure program\u2014met this goal. For  example, the World Bank reported that the Fast Track Facility operation in  the Democratic Republic of Congo prevented the government from having  to cut essential social spending or resort to inflationary spending.

Additionally, for the infrastructure program,  the World Bank developed a rapid diagnostic tool to identify at-risk  countries and provide a detailed assessment of crises impacts and  associated country infrastructure spending needs, but conducted the  diagnostic in only one LIC, Bangladesh.

Between  2008 and 2010, IFC increased its new lending commitments in LICs while  new IFC commitments overall declined and foreign direct investment in  LICs declined by 17 percent between 2008 and 2009. As a result, IFC\u2019s  investments during the crises in LICs increased as a percentage of net  foreign direct investment. Annual IFC commitments in LICs in fiscal years  2009 and 2010 exceeded $900 million each year, while commitments in  fiscal year 2008 were about $460 million. IFC also committed a total of  $1.1 billion to LICs through two crisis response initiatives, the pre- existing Global Trade Finance Program and the new Global Trade  Liquidity Program, which supported $3.4 billion in trade through credit  guarantees and risk sharing.", "According to officials, IFC also developed new approaches for  coordinating with other multilateral institutions in LICs at the regional  level. The Joint Action Plan for Africa, established in 2009, for example,  developed a method for IFC to collaborate more closely with other  lenders in support of development activities in Africa.

Internally, under its Articles of Agreement IFC must  undertake its financing on terms and conditions which it considers  appropriate, taking into account, among other things, the terms and  conditions normally obtained by private investors for similar financing. In  addition, IFC has relatively limited resources as compared to other IFIs.  Officials told us that because of these constraints, much of its crisis  response relied on donor governments to provide additional funds. In some  cases, this dependence negatively affected the speed of IFC\u2019s response  because IFC could not respond until donor governments fulfilled their  commitments. IFC also faced external capacity constraints in recipient  countries. For example, officials explained that in Ethiopia, foreign  investors, including IFC, are often subject to additional scrutiny by the  government, which has limited IFC\u2019s ability to do business there.

Governments could  use these funds to boost international reserves, cushion against shocks,  or meet balance-of-payment needs. Moreover, the IMF changed its  lending instruments to address crisis impacts, aiming to make them more  flexible and tailored to specific country needs. For example, according to  the IMF, the newly created Rapid Credit Facility provides low-access,  rapid, and below-market-rate financial assistance to LICs facing an urgent  balance-of-payments need, without requiring program-based conditions.  According to IMF officials, these efforts were supplemented by technical  support and surveillance activities, which also played a role in assisting  LICs through the crises. In addition, the IMF reported that its policy advice  and programs in LICs were supportive of a countercyclical policy  response and higher government spending during the crisis.

In  order to conclude that differences in government spending are driven by  IMF programs, the groups of countries being compared need to be as  similar as possible. Our analysis of the data underlying the IMF\u2019s  assertion found that non-program LICs consistently differed from program  LICs across certain measures of institutional quality and macroeconomic  policy. Furthermore, the finding that program LICs increased spending  more than non-program LICs is highly sensitive to the inclusion of a few  countries in the group of non-program LICs, which either did not need a  program or could not obtain one. Non-program LICs had lower scores on  a variety of measures of institutional quality, such as political stability,  government effectiveness, and rule of law. Countries with institutional  weaknesses in these categories may overlap with the fragile states, as  shown in fig. 2. In addition, non-program LICs had higher inflation rates  and larger budget deficits prior to the crises than LICs with IMF-supported  programs, which may indicate that non-program countries had less  capacity to use fiscal and monetary policy to respond to the crises.", "We conducted several analyses to determine if the IMF\u2019s results were  sensitive to small changes in the underlying sample of countries designed  to make the set of non-program LICs more like LICs with IMF programs.  In one analysis, we omitted the countries with the two lowest scores on  political stability in 2009 (Sudan and Yemen) from the set of non-program  LICs, thereby making the sample more similar to program LICs. Based on  the new sample, program LICs no longer increased spending more than  non-program LICs. In another analysis, we omitted the countries with the  two largest budget deficits prior to the crisis (Eritrea and Guyana) from  the set of non-program LICs and similarly found that program LICs no  longer increased spending more than non-program LICs. Importantly, it  does not necessarily follow from these sensitivity analyses that IMF- supported programs were ineffective at increasing spending. A  reasonable estimate of what might have happened in the absence of an  IMF-supported program is necessary to assess the impact of programs  on spending, which the IMF analysis implicitly assumes is the experience  of non-program LICs. A more rigorous analytical approach would be  needed to conclude that IMF-supported programs resulted in increased  government spending during the crises.

This projected strong GDP growth  depends on several factors, including an increase in anticipated export  earnings from privatization of the coffee sector, which accounts for about  two-thirds of total exports, and integration into the East Africa Community,  which could give Burundi access to a broad market of about 120 million  people and attract more investment. However, Burundi might not meet  the GDP projection if it does not realize the higher export earnings from  reform of the coffee sector. Privatization of the coffee sector is occurring  more slowly than expected, with only 13 of 117 coffee processing facilities  sold because there were few interested buyers. While the government  plans to accelerate the sale of the remaining stations beginning in 2011, it  is not clear whether investors will buy them.

While the overall impact  of the crises on LICs may have been milder than in the advanced  economies, the high rate of poverty in these countries increases their  overall vulnerability. For example, our previous work shows that many  LICs were experiencing protracted food emergencies and had severe and  widespread malnourishment even prior to the onset of the crises. The IFIs  responded to the crises by increasing the amount of resources made  available to the LICs. The IMF increased lending to LICs more than  sixfold to almost $5 billion. The World Bank committed $18.1 billion  through regular lending and five new crises response initiatives that  committed $12.2 billion in financial assistance to LICs, including $1.4  billion in new funding. The World Bank provided funding as a mix of loans  and grants, depending on the performance and debt vulnerability of each  country. The World Bank was able to meet its goal of increasing the  speed of disbursement for several initiatives, but the overall picture is  mixed, especially when compared to the pre-crises period. Furthermore,  in the case of both institutions, the impact of these new resources on LIC  government spending during the crises has been difficult to establish.  According to the World Bank and IMF, the crises did not significantly  impair the countries\u2019 ability to repay their future debt, because they  expected the world economy to reestablish its pre-crises growth levels  and the LICs to implement reforms necessary to achieve projected future  growth levels. However, the increased risk to the global recovery and the  extreme volatility of commodity prices may undermine the realization of  these expectations. To date, the mix of loans and grants provided by the  multilateral development banks have been largely unaffected by the  crises.

We acknowledge that disbursement  rates, which vary over time, depend on a number of factors, including  recipient country capacity, need, and governance, and the type of  lending. The World Bank said there is growing evidence that IDA- supported public spending for essential services increased. As we  previously reported, IFIs do not independently track developing countries\u2019  poverty-reducing expenditures and instead rely upon developing  countries\u2019 governments to provide such data, even though the accuracy  of these data and country capacity to provide this information is  questionable. Finally, regarding debt sustainability, the World Bank noted  that our analysis is based on a sample of just three countries and thus  cannot assess the realism of the 2010 DSA projections. We based our  conclusions on our assessment of the realism of the 2010 DSA  projections for three countries as well as on the current risks to global  economic recovery, reported by the IMF in August 2011.", "The IMF indicated broad agreement with the findings of our report,  including the overview of the impact of the crisis on LICs. While the IMF  suggested that our assessment is narrow, we paid sufficient attention to a  range of response efforts, mentioning the IMF\u2019s call for countercyclical  policy responses, improved macroeconomic conditions in LICs, doubling  of access levels, and modifications to lending instruments. The IMF  acknowledged that comparing program with non-program countries does  not prove a causal link from program engagement to higher spending and  notes a recent related study. We include a reference to the study entitled  \u201cWhat Happens to Social Spending in IMF-Supported Programs\u201d but also  note that it does not necessarily reflect the results during the crises  response period. The IMF also stated that growth assumptions underlying  LIC DSAs have been borne out so far and that DSAs have built-in  methods for addressing risks. We described the IMF\u2019s use of alternative  scenarios and stress tests to arrive at a country\u2019s debt distress rating.  However, we noted that these tests are very general and do not  adequately reflect country-specific risks including political instability,  adverse weather, global economic crises, and failure to implement  reforms or make planned investment. Our analysis of the three countries\u2019  DSAs is intended to be illustrative and not generalizable. Our conclusion,  that projections which might be too optimistic could be mitigated by future  DSAs and additional grants, is not dependent on these three countries.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We analyzed variables including real gross domestic product (GDP),  current account, fiscal deficit, government expenditures and revenue,  consumer price index measure of inflation, and foreign direct investment.  We obtained these data series from the widely used IMF and World Bank  databases\u2014World Economic Outlook, International Financial Statistics,  and World Development Indicators. We computed LICs\u2019 average economic  performance with respect to each of the key economic variables, including  current account and fiscal deficits and inflation, using a real GDP weighted  average based on purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP, so that the  resulting weighted average reflects each country\u2019s size in terms of their  share in total GDP of the entire group of LICs. We used the PPP GDP  weights to construct weighted averages for the other variables, including  fiscal and current account deficits, government revenue and expenditures,  and the consumer price index measure of inflation.", "We analyzed the LIC group\u2019s macroeconomic performance over the 2007  through 2009 crises period, and compared this to the group\u2019s  performance during the pre-crisis period from 2004 through 2006 to  determine whether economic performance improved or deteriorated. We  also disaggregated the results to determine which countries experienced  improvements and deteriorations in each of the key macroeconomic  variables. We corroborated our results with data from the economic and  financial forecasting firm, IHS Global Insight. We also examined and  assessed the DSA\u2019s incorporation of World Economic Outlook  assumptions concerning the global pace of recovery, including those of  the country\u2019s key trading partners. We also compiled information on  international food and oil price data from the UN Food and Agriculture  Organization\u2019s Food Price Index and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Additionally, we reviewed IMF country reports and World Bank Country  Assistance Strategies, which also contain limited historical information on  the key macroeconomic variables.

For the IMF, we reviewed IMF  country reports; countries\u2019 letters of intent; research papers; and the  Independent Evaluation Office reports. We also reviewed joint World  Bank-IMF publications. We interviewed officials from these institutions, as  well as from the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for  International Development.", "To evaluate whether the World Bank\u2019s crisis response was consistent  with the institution\u2019s stated goals of increasing the speed of  disbursements, we analyzed World Bank data on financial commitments  and disbursements made to LICs between 2005 and 2010. To do this, we  determined the first year disbursement rate for all projects approved  during the crises response period (2008 through 2010); all projects  approved during the pre-crises period (2005 through 2007); and all  projects approved during the crises response period under each initiative,  as well as those approved during the crises response period outside of  any initiative. We did not use the World Bank\u2019s standard disbursement  rate methodology because our analysis sought to isolate those activities  which were explicitly undertaken in response to the crises. For our  analysis, this included only projects approved after the World Bank first  stated its intention to respond to any of the three crises. This occurred in  early 2008, with the establishment of the Global Food Crisis Response  Program. We also identified the total number of projects and the amount  of funding committed in association with any of the World Bank\u2019s crisis  response initiatives.", "To measure the speed of disbursements, we first calculated the total  disbursements for each project that took place during the first four  quarters following project approval. We then determined the average  disbursement rate by using a weighted average, which is computed as  the ratio between the sum of first year disbursements and the sum of the  commitments. One type of project, \u201cadditional financing\u201d projects, tracks  disbursements under the \u201cparent\u201d project, though commitment amounts  are recorded under the \u201cadditional financing\u201d project. In our dataset, there  were 160 of these projects, out of a total of 622. To ensure that  disbursements from \u201cadditional financing\u201d projects were captured in our  analysis, we developed a methodology that calculated the remaining  commitment balance of the \u201cparent\u201d project as of the quarter in which the  additional financing project is approved. We then added the balance to  the new commitment from the additional financing project to form the  denominator of the disbursement ratio. We then calculated the first year  disbursement rate by determining the first four quarters of disbursements  under the \u201cparent\u201d project following the approval date of the \u201cadditional  financing\u201d project. We used disbursement data through June 2011, the  latest available, to ensure as many projects as possible (97 percent of all  projects) had 4 quarters of disbursements. Eighteen projects approved in  the fourth quarter of 2010 had only 3 quarters of disbursement data. We  used disbursement data through June 2008 for the pre-crisis period to  make our analysis comparable. We then compared various disbursement  rates to one another to reach our conclusions. We assessed the reliability  of the data we used in our analysis by comparing the consistency of the  data among the various sources, and discussing the data with World  Bank and IMF officials. For the data used to determine World Bank  disbursement rates, we interviewed World Bank officials to understand  their database and correct errors in the data. We determined that the data  used in our analysis were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine U.S. dollar values associated with the IMF\u2019s response to the  crises, we used information on IMF program and funding levels. To  calculate the portion of the $250 billion in support that the LICs received,  we totaled the amount each country received in Special Drawing Rights,  the IMF\u2019s unit of account, and multiplied that by the August 28, 2009  conversion rate to arrive at a U.S. dollar value. To calculate that IMF  loans to LICs increased more than sixfold from approximately $748  million between 2005 and 2007 to about $4.9 billion between 2008 and  2010, we used data from the \u201cIMF Lending Arrangements\u201d online tool.  For each year, we totaled new lending to LICs in Special Drawing Rights,  then converted that total to dollars using the year-end exchange rate. We  also assessed the sensitivity of the results of an IMF analysis of  government spending in LICs in 2009 using data from the IMF and the  Worldwide Governance Indicators. We compared program LICs and non- program LICs using measures of institutional quality from the World  Governance Indicators and indicators of macroeconomic policy from the  IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook database. We conducted sensitivity  analyses by omitting countries with the lowest scores on certain  measures of institutional quality or the least favorable pre-crisis  macroeconomic policies from the sample of non-program LICs.

We selected  these countries based on criteria that include the number of IFI projects,  amount of IFI financial support, and country conditions. For example,  between fiscal years 2008 and 2010, Ethiopia and Tanzania were in the  top three recipients of IDA assistance by dollar value, receiving  approximately $4.8 billion, while Burundi is a post-conflict fragile state.  For each of our three case-study countries, we analyzed the country\u2019s  2010 World Bank-IMF Bank DSAs, as well as the associated IMF  program reviews and Article IV consultations, and World Bank Country  Assistance Strategies.

These include the DSA\u2019s  projections and assumptions regarding key macroeconomic variables,  such as real GDP and export growth, and the divergence of the growth  rates of these variables from their historic values; assumptions regarding  the LIC\u2019s implementation of reforms and productivity-increasing  investment; and assumptions concerning the country\u2019s vulnerability to  external shocks, including adverse weather, political or regional instability,  and rising food and fuel prices.", "To determine economic performance over the study period for our three  case study countries, and to calculate historical growth rates for key  macroeconomic variables, we relied primarily on IMF and World Bank  databases\u2014World Economic Outlook, International Financial Statistics,  World Development Indicators, and Balance of Payments Statistics. We  also utilized data from IMF Article IV consultations and country program  reviews. We compared GAO-calculated 10-year historical averages for  the most important macroeconomic variables with the DSA\u2019s historical  averages for these variables, which form the basis for the DSA\u2019s  projections and debt ratios. We evaluated the IFIs\u2019 determination of a  country\u2019s risk of debt distress partly based on the extent to which the  values of historical key macroeconomic variables diverge from their  projected values; and, if so, whether the DSA provides reasonable  justification for this divergence. In making this assessment, we also  considered additional information available in the Article IVs, World Bank  Country Assistance Strategies, and Global Insight Country Intelligence  Reports. We also based our assessment of the IFIs\u2019 determination of the  country\u2019s risk of debt distress on the DSA\u2019s consideration of country- specific factors, such as the country\u2019s susceptibility to weather-related  shocks; political instability; and implementation of institutional reforms that  would enhance a country\u2019s growth prospects, particularly in the economic  and debt management areas.

We then  determined the average disbursement rates for different groups of  projects by using a weighted average, which is computed as the ratio  between the sum of first year disbursements and the sum of the  commitments for all projects that belonged to a group.   4.  We acknowledged that disbursement rates, which vary over time,  depend on a number of factors, including recipient country capacity,  need, and governance, and the type of lending.    5.  As we previously reported, IFIs do not independently track developing  countries\u2019 poverty-reducing expenditures and instead rely upon  developing countries\u2019 governments to provide such data, even though  the accuracy of these data and country capacity to provide this  information is questionable. We focused on the Fast Track Facility  and the infrastructure program because these two initiatives were  explicitly designed to support domestic spending in recipient countries  during the crises.  6.  We based our conclusion that the underlying macroeconomic  projections might prove too optimistic on the realism of the 2010 DSA  projections for three countries\u2014Burundi, Ethiopia, and Tanzania\u2014as  well as on the current risks to the global economic recovery and rising  commodity prices, reported by the IMF in August 2011. Our analysis  of the three countries\u2019 DSAs is intended to be illustrative and not  generalizable. Our conclusion, that projections which might be too  optimistic could be mitigated by future DSAs and additional grants, is  not dependent on these three countries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the International Monetary Fund", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We reported on a wide range of IMF responses, including the IMF\u2019s  call for countercyclical policy responses, improved macroeconomic  conditions in LICs, doubling of access levels, and modifications to  lending instruments.  2.  We believe that comparisons of program and non-program country  performance can be misleading without appropriate context or  analysis. The IMF acknowledged that comparing program with non- program countries does not prove a causal link from program  engagement to higher spending and notes a recent related study.   The study found that IMF-supported programs were associated with  increased spending on education and health as percentage of GDP or  a percentage of spending in LICs, based on data from 1985 through  2009. We include a reference to the study, entitled \u201cWhat Happens to  Social Spending in IMF-Supported Programs\u201d\u2014which was released  after our audit work had concluded\u2014and we described its conclusions  and relevance in a footnote. In particular, the study\u2019s results represent  the average effect of an IMF-supported program over the time period,  and therefore do not necessarily reflect the results during the crises  response period.    3.  We discussed the DSAs\u2019 assumption for \u201cquick recovery\u201d in relation to  both LICs and the global economy. The IMF forecasted LICs\u2019 recovery  in line with the forecast of a quick recovery for the global economy,  which was expected to boost demand for LICs\u2019 exports. In August  2011, the IMF reported renewed risks to the global recovery, which  means that projections for future export growth could be too  optimistic. However, in commenting on this report, IMF noted that the  \u201cquick recovery\u201d assumption had been borne out so far. Our report  described the IMF\u2019s use of alternative scenarios and stress tests to  arrive at a country\u2019s debt distress rating. However, we noted that  these tests are very general and do not adequately reflect country- specific risks including political instability, adverse weather, global  economic crises, and failure to implement reforms or make planned  investment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Cheryl Goodman, Assistant Director; Marc Castellano; RG Steinman;  Michael Hoffman; Elizabeth Kowalewski; and Arian Terrill made key  contributions to this report.
