Small and large employers purchasing health insurance generally had comparable premiums in 1998, but this comparison does not fully reflect the challenges facing small employers in providing health insurance for their employees. Although the premiums were similar, the health plans offered by small employers were slightly less generous on average--they had slightly higher average cost-sharing requirements for their employees and were somewhat less likely to offer some benefits, excluding, for example, mental health services and chiropractic care. Also, insurers' costs to administer employer-based health insurance and protect against potentially large health care costs result in a larger share of small employers' premium dollars being spent on these nonbenefit expenses. Nearly all states have passed laws that limit the ability of insurers to vary premiums charged to small employers on the basis of the group's risk factors, including health.

The Congress and states have enacted laws and continue to consider proposals intended to assist small employers in purchasing coverage, but many small employers continue to cite cost as a major obstacle to providing coverage. Concerned about the affordability of health insurance for small employers, you asked that we review the challenges small employers face in providing health insurance for their employees. Specifically, we examined   small and large employers\u2019 health insurance premiums and benefit plans, insurers\u2019 costs to provide health insurance to small and large employers, the effect of state efforts to restrict the premiums that insurers charge   other state efforts to help make coverage more affordable for small employers.", "To compare premiums for coverage offered by small and large employers and the health characteristics of individuals insured through small and large employers, we analyzed data available from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2019s (AHRQ) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)\u2014both its survey of employers\u2019 health plan premiums (insurance component) for 1996 and 1998 and its survey of individuals\u2019 demographics, employment, health characteristics, and medical spending and utilization (household component) for 1996. We obtained unpublished data from the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust (Kaiser/HRET) Employer Health Benefits 2000 Annual Survey to compare aspects of health plans provided by small and large employers. Unless otherwise noted, the MEPS and Kaiser/HRET data include health plans that are fully insured\u2014that is, the employer purchases the plan from a third-party insurer\u2014and those that are self funded\u2014that is, the employer assumes some or all of the financial risk associated with providing coverage. To analyze the effects of state premium restrictions, we obtained premium quotes through insurance agents affiliated with the National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU) for three hypothetical small employers in a selected city in each of five states (California, Florida, Maryland, New York, and Texas) with varying approaches to regulating insurance premiums for the small group market. To obtain state-specific information on the small group market, we interviewed state insurance regulators in these states. We also interviewed health policy experts, insurers, actuaries, and associations representing these groups; reviewed relevant literature on the small group health insurance market; and drew on our earlier work.", "Appendix I provides more detailed information on our methodology.

In 1998, whereas 96 percent of employers with 50 or more employees offered health insurance, 71 percent of employers with 10 to 49 employees provided coverage and only about 36 percent of employers with fewer than 10 workers offered health benefits to their employees.The primary reason small employers cited for not offering coverage was cost.", "During the early 1990s, concern about small employers\u2019 access to health insurance and the affordability of providing coverage to their employees led most states to adopt small group insurance market reforms. While the extent and scope of reforms varied across states, most states included reforms guaranteeing that small employers seeking coverage would be accepted for at least certain plans offered by insurers (known as guaranteed issue);   guarantees that small employers could renew health insurance even if they had high claims except under certain circumstances, such as the failure to pay premiums (guaranteed renewal); limits on how long insurers could deny coverage for medical conditions individuals had at the time they obtained coverage (limits on preexisting condition exclusions); and limits on the variation allowed in premiums.", "States regulate insurance products sold within their borders, but their laws do not affect all employers.

While many of the state reforms already met or exceeded the HIPAA minimums, HIPAA ensured consistency in the definition of small employers (those with 2 to 50 employees) and established minimum standards regarding guaranteed issue, guaranteed renewal, and limits on preexisting conditions applying to both insured and self-funded health plans. States could exceed these minimum standards in their own statutes and regulations.

In comparison, single premiums at small and large employers varied by about 369 percent and about 306 percent, respectively.", "While small and large employers generally paid, on average, about the same amount for health insurance coverage, small employers received less value for their premium dollars for several reasons. Small employers generally purchased coverage with higher cost-sharing requirements for their employees compared to larger employers. Also, small employers tended to receive slightly fewer covered benefits for the same premiums paid by large employers.", "To make coverage more affordable, small employers tend to purchase plans that require higher deductibles and higher maximum annual out-of- pocket costs for their employees. Average annual deductibles in preferred provider organizations\u2014the plan type most often purchased by workers covered by small employers\u2014are more than $100 higher for employers with 3 to 50 employees than for larger employers. A higher deductible typically translates into a lower premium. For example, actuarial experts estimate that a plan with an annual $200 deductible would reduce claims costs by about $65 per year compared to the same plan with a $100 deductible. Further, workers covered through small employers typically are potentially liable for higher out-of-pocket costs than those employed by larger employers. Specifically, about 35 percent of workers covered through small employers have maximum annual out-of-pocket limits that are $2,500 or more, compared to about 20 percent of workers covered through large employers.", "In addition, workers covered through small employers are less likely to receive certain benefits.

These expenses can range from around 5 percent to 30 percent of the premium dollar, depending on the size of the employer, type of plan, and insurer.The smaller the size of the group the larger the share of the premium that goes towards paying for expenses other than benefits. This is due in part to the fact that small employers have fewer individuals over which to spread expenses and certain costs are lower or can be avoided by large employers. Insurers\u2019 administrative activities, such as marketing and billing, increase small employers\u2019 premiums more because, with fewer people to share the costs, they cannot obtain the financial savings afforded to larger groups. For example, if it costs an insurer $5 a month to generate a bill for each employer, this cost spread over a group of five people would increase each person\u2019s monthly premium by $1. In contrast, for a group with 100 people this same activity would increase the monthly premium for each person by only 5 cents.", "In addition, some expenses associated with insurance for most small employers may be avoided or reduced for large employers who assume the financial risk for their employees\u2019 health coverage or perform some administrative functions internally. By self-funding, large employers avoid expenses such as state premium taxes assessed on insurance sold in the state that typically represent about 1 percent to 3 percent of health insurance premiums. In addition, large employers may perform some administrative activities, such as employee enrollment and education, which insurers or agents perform for, and therefore charge, small employers. Large employers typically purchase insurance with the assistance of benefits consultants, whom they pay a fixed hourly or lump sum fee. A recent survey by Kaiser/HRET estimated that the average administrative cost borne internally by large employers\u2014those with 200 or more employees\u2014for providing health benefits is approximately $250 per covered worker. This would increase the cost per covered employee by approximately 6 percent.

Insurers are more concerned about increased financial risk to cover people through small employers for three reasons. First, insurers are unable to predict risk as accurately for small employers as they are for large employers. Estimates of a group\u2019s future expenses that are based on prior health care use tend to be more accurate the larger the group is. Actuaries indicate that until a group approaches about 500 people its prior health care use and costs are not reliable enough to be the only data used in setting premiums. Second, insurers report that small employers, especially those with two or three employees, may be costly because they are more likely to seek coverage only when their employees anticipate needing it, a phenomenon known as adverse selection. Third, since smaller groups generate smaller amounts of premium revenue, insurers may be less willing to assume the potential risk of one individual incurring a catastrophic accident or illness that could elevate costs significantly and generate expenses exceeding premium revenues contributed by the group as a whole.", "To protect against these risks, insurers may review the medical history for each individual in the small group and set the group\u2019s premiums accordingly\u2014a practice known as medical underwriting. The degree to which medical underwriting is done depends on the size of the group. Very small groups are often screened most extensively, with each person required to provide a detailed medical history. As the group size increases, approaching 20 individuals or more, fewer questions may be asked. Such individual level assessments are not typically done for large employers so this cost accrues only for insurers when selling coverage to small employers.", "Furthermore, some insurers may add a surcharge of 1 percent to 5 percent of small employers\u2019 premiums to increase their financial reserves\u2014a pool of money they invest to help ensure that there will be sufficient funds should an unanticipated large expense occur. This surcharge tends to be higher when the insurer is less certain of the risk of the group and may be imposed in lieu of or in addition to medical underwriting.

Tight restrictions allow no or little variation in premiums, while looser restrictions allow premiums to vary widely according to the health risk and demographic characteristics presented by each small employer. In states that do not allow insurers to set premiums based on health status, small employers with employees who have health conditions pay the same premiums as those with employees who do not have any health conditions, all other characteristics being the same. In states allowing insurers to adjust premiums for health and other characteristics, premiums for small employers with high-risk employees can be several times higher than those for employers with low-risk employees. Overall, average premiums, adjusted for geographic differences in the cost of physician services, were about 6 percent higher in states that did not allow rates to vary for employees\u2019 health status than in those that did.

In these states, premiums are allowed to vary only for geographic location of the group, plan or benefit design, and family size. As of June 2000, 10 other states had adopted modified community rating laws that also prohibit variation in premiums based on the health status of employees, but may allow some variation for other factors. For example, Maryland allows premiums for small employers to vary only by limited amounts for age, geographic location, and family size.", "Most other states allow premiums to vary based on health as well as other factors, but restrict the degree to which variation is allowed; these restriction categories are called rating bands. In these states, insurers can charge higher premiums for small employers insuring employees with certain characteristics\u2014such as older individuals, women of childbearing age, smokers, individuals in poor health, and employees in certain industries\u2014that are considered high risk or costly. However, the amount of variation is limited. For example, California allows insurers to consider age, family size, geographic area, and health factors when setting premiums, but limits the amount of variation for health factors to plus or minus 10 percent. Other states with rating bands allow much wider variation for health and other factors. For example, Texas allows factors such as age, sex, geography, group size, industry, and health to be considered in setting premiums, but limits the amount premiums can be adjusted for health to plus or minus 25 percent. As of June 2000, 35 states used rating bands when setting premiums.

In addition, some studies have indicated that tax incentives to individuals need to represent a significant portion of the premium\u2014perhaps half or more\u2014to result in many individuals newly purchasing health insurance. However, the Kansas and Massachusetts subsidies would represent less than 20 percent of a small employer\u2019s typical single coverage premium. Furthermore, the temporary nature of some state programs\u2014such as the Kansas subsidy that lasts for 5 years\u2014may limit their effectiveness. Experts report that small employers may be hesitant to begin offering coverage even with subsidies if they are uncertain that the subsidy will be available for the long term because employers do not want to drop coverage once they begin offering it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["While federal and state reforms over the last decade have generally made health insurance more accessible for small employers, many small employers and their employees continue to face challenges in affording health insurance. Recognizing the difficulties and costs that many small employers face in offering their employees health insurance, the Congress has considered several proposals to assist small employers in sponsoring health insurance, such as proposed tax incentives and new purchasing arrangements. These efforts are directed toward helping to make health insurance more affordable for small employers by subsidizing costs for the employers or their employees or by helping small employers gain some of the advantages large employers have in purchasing health insurance. The complexity and diversity of the small-group health insurance market as well as the experience of the states in regulating premiums and trying other approaches to expand coverage are important considerations in crafting effective reforms.", "Small employers often get less value for their premium dollar than large employers and, in states that do not tightly restrict premium variation, small employers with high-risk employees may pay substantially higher premiums than those with lower-risk employees. As a result, many small employers with uninsured workers and dependents in such states may face higher premiums if they provide coverage because fewer of these uninsured individuals report being in excellent health and they therefore may represent a higher risk to insurers.", "States\u2019 experiences indicate that efforts to increase affordability and access can have some benefits\u2014such as increasing the availability of a wider array of plan options for small employers or helping to ensure that small employers with high-risk employees pay lower premiums. However, they generally have not made coverage more affordable overall or been sufficient to encourage many new small employers to begin providing coverage. Other efforts, such as purchasing cooperatives and scaled-back benefit offerings, have not attracted a large share of the small group market to date. Further, recently enacted temporary state subsidies and incentives may not be sufficient to encourage many small employers to offer coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From External Reviewers", "paragraphs": ["Several private insurance experts, an expert on the MEPS database, and a health insurance industry representative provided comments on a draft of this report. In general, these reviewers concurred with our findings. Two reviewers noted that while health insurance premiums were higher in states that implemented tighter rating restrictions compared to the remaining states, other factors in local health care markets, such as the types of plans available or mix of industries, might also explain these differences. We revised the report to reflect that these other factors may also account for some premium differences across groups of states. Another reviewer further emphasized that while federal and state small- group reforms have made health insurance more accessible, affordability still remains a major obstacle to more small employers offering coverage to their workers. The reviewers also made technical comments that we incorporated where appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its date.
