States are also required to spend a significant amount of their own funds under TANF, but they can include certain expenditures made by nongovernmental third parties toward their MOE requirement. Some stakeholders support this option because it helps states meet MOE requirements, but others question whether this approach is consistent with program goals. GAO was asked to update the information presented in its 2012 report on this topic ( GAO-12-929R ).", "This report updates information on, among other things, (1) the extent to which states count nongovernmental third-party expenditures for services as TANF MOE spending, and (2) the types of nongovernmental third-party services provided that states counted as TANF MOE spending.", "To obtain this information, GAO surveyed state TANF directors in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and reached a 100-percent response rate. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, reviewed HHS expenditure data, and interviewed HHS officials. Lastly, GAO interviewed TANF officials in three states selected to reflect geographic diversity and variety among other factors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nearly one-third of states (16 of 51) reported counting nongovernmental third-party expenditures toward their states' required spending level under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) block grant in fiscal year 2015, according to GAO's survey of all state TANF directors. TANF requires states to maintain a significant portion of their own historic financial commitment, called maintenance of effort (MOE), to welfare-related programs. In addition to its own spending, a state may count toward its MOE requirement certain in-kind or cash expenditures by nongovernmental third parties\u2014such as food banks\u2014as long as these services are allowable under TANF, are provided to needy families, and the state meets other requirements. The number of states counting such expenditures as MOE spending increased substantially between fiscal years 2009 and 2010, perhaps in part due to requirements necessary to obtain additional funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). After fiscal year 2010, the number of states counting nongovernmental third-party expenditures toward their TANF MOE requirements fell, but remained higher than pre-Recovery Act levels for other reasons. States that reported such expenditures as TANF MOE spending cited reasons such as developing public-private partnerships and meeting state MOE requirements.", "Of the 16 states that reported counting nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE spending in fiscal year 2015, most said the types of services they counted involved food assistance and programs serving youth, according to GAO's survey. For example, one state reported working with a food bank to count the value of the food the bank provided to families deemed needy under state TANF rules."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report. HHS agreed with the findings, and provided written comments on the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block  grant provides $16.5 billion in federal funds to states to assist low-income  families. While the block grant provides states with a fixed amount of  federal dollars annually, it also includes a requirement that states  maintain a significant portion of their own historic financial commitment,  called maintenance-of- effort (MOE), to welfare-related programs. In  federal fiscal year 2014, states spent a total of $31.9 billion for TANF- related benefits and services\u2014$16.6 billion in federal TANF funds and  $15.3 billion in state TANF MOE.  This total includes any expenditures  made by nongovernmental third parties, such as nonprofit organizations,  that states counted toward their TANF MOE requirement, which is  permitted under TANF regulations. Some stakeholders note that the  option to count nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE  spending provides states flexibility and helps them meet TANF  requirements. Others have questioned whether counting  nongovernmental third-party expenditures toward a state\u2019s TANF MOE  requirement meets the original intent of the requirements. In addition,  some policymakers have noted that this option may reduce the overall  level of services available to low-income families in a state if, for example,  that state counts services already provided by third parties while reducing  its own spending.", "Given that program changes currently being considered as part of TANF  reauthorization would affect state counting of nongovernmental third-party  spending toward TANF MOE requirements, GAO was asked to update  the information presented in its 2012 report on this topic.  This report  discusses the (1) extent to which states count nongovernmental third- party expenditures toward their states\u2019 TANF MOE requirements, (2)  types of nongovernmental third-party services provided, and (3) reasons  states cited for counting nongovernmental third-party expenses as TANF  MOE spending.", "To obtain this information, we updated the questionnaire we fielded in  2012 and pretested the updated questionnaire with two state TANF  directors.  We then administered the questionnaire by e-mail to the  TANF directors of all 50 states and the District of Columbia from  November through December 2015.  Where necessary, we followed up  with states to clarify their responses and obtained a 100 percent response  rate. While we did not validate specific information administrators  reported through our survey, we reviewed their responses and conducted  follow-up, as necessary, to determine that their responses were complete,  reasonable, and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To  characterize survey responses about nongovernmental third-party  provided services and potential effects of discontinuing the use of the  option to count nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE  spending, we conducted content analysis on the responses for two open- ended survey questions. For these analyses, two individuals  independently categorized the survey responses and then reconciled any  coding discrepancies. We also reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations; interviewed federal officials from the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Administration for Children and  Families, which oversees states' use of TANF block grant funds; and  reviewed HHS expenditure data. We assessed the reliability of these data  by reviewing existing information about the data and the system that  produced them and by interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about  the data. Based on the results of these steps, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Lastly, to  gather specific examples and a deeper understanding of how states have  counted nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE  spending, we interviewed state officials in three states. These states were  chosen to reflect variety in survey responses regarding the number of  years nongovernmental third-party services were counted as TANF MOE  spending, the nature of services provided, geographic diversity, and the  percentage of MOE spending that consisted of nongovernmental third- party expenditures.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2015 through  February 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The TANF block grant was created through the Personal Responsibility  and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) and was  designed to give states the flexibility to provide both traditional welfare  cash assistance benefits as well as a variety of other benefits and  services to meet the needs of low-income families and children. TANF  has four broad goals: (1) provide assistance to needy families so that  children may be cared for in their own homes or homes of relatives; (2)  end dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting  job preparation, work, and marriage; (3) prevent and reduce out-of- wedlock pregnancies; and (4) encourage the formation and maintenance  of two-parent families. Within these goals, states are responsible for  designing, implementing, and administering their welfare programs to  comply with federal requirements, as defined by federal law and HHS.", "The creation of TANF significantly changed the federal government\u2019s role  in financing welfare programs in states. PRWORA ended low-income  families\u2019 entitlement to cash assistance by replacing the Aid to Families  with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with the TANF block grant.  Each state\u2019s TANF block grant amount is generally based on the amount  of the state\u2019s spending under AFDC. With the fixed federal funding  stream, states assume greater fiscal risks in the event of an economic  recession or increased program costs. In acknowledgment of these risks,  PRWORA also created a TANF Contingency Fund that states could  access in times of economic distress.  In addition, during the most recent  recession, the federal government created a $5 billion Emergency  Contingency Fund for state TANF programs through the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), available in  federal fiscal years 2009 and 2010.", "PRWORA coupled the block grant with an MOE provision, which requires  states to maintain a portion of their own historic financial commitment to  their welfare programs as a condition of receiving their full federal TANF  allotments.  For example, these provisions generally require that each  state spend at least 80 percent (75 percent if the state meets certain  performance standards) of the amount it spent on welfare and related  programs in fiscal year 1994, before TANF was created.  In addition to  its own spending, under HHS regulations, a state is permitted to count  toward its TANF MOE requirement certain in-kind or cash expenditures  by third parties\u2014such as nongovernmental organizations (including  nonprofit organizations or other private parties)\u2014as long as the  expenditures meet other TANF MOE requirements, including those  related to eligible families and allowable activities.  In addition, an  agreement must exist between the state and the nongovernmental third- party organization allowing the state to count the expenditures toward its  TANF MOE requirement.", "HHS noted in its preamble to the final rule for TANF issued in 1999 that  the MOE cost-sharing requirement reflected Congress\u2019 recognition that  state financial participation is essential for the success of welfare  reform.  It also noted that Congress wanted states to be active partners  in the welfare reform process.  Allowing states to count  nongovernmental third-party expenditures toward their MOE requirement  was a policy choice HHS first articulated in December 2004.  HHS later  set forth the policy in a rule as part of the regulations implementing the  Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.  If a state fails to meet its TANF MOE  requirement for any fiscal year, HHS is required by law to reduce dollar- for-dollar the state\u2019s basic TANF grant amount for the following fiscal  year.", "States\u2019 levels of MOE spending can affect other TANF requirements,  such as their required work participation rates. States are generally held  accountable for ensuring that at least 50 percent of all families with a  work-eligible individual receiving TANF assistance participate in work  activities for a specified number of average hours per week over the  month subject to a provision known as the caseload reduction credit,  which allows states to reduce the work participation rate they are required  to meet based on reductions in the size of their TANF caseload.  In  addition, under federal regulations, if states spend in excess of their  required MOE spending level (excess MOE), they may be allowed to  increase their caseload reduction credits and thereby lower the work  participation rates they must meet.  For example, our previous work  found that in fiscal year 2009, 32 of the 45 states that met their required  work participation rates for all TANF families claimed excess state MOE  spending toward their caseload reduction credits.  We have not updated  this analysis, and information on how many states use excess MOE to  reduce their required work participation rate is not readily available,  according to HHS officials. However, HHS\u2019s most recent TANF  expenditure data reported by states show that for fiscal year 2014, about  half of states reported total MOE expenditures at the 100-percent level or  above.", "According to HHS data, until fiscal year 2006, state TANF expenditures  counted toward TANF MOE requirements remained relatively stable.  Specifically, according to HHS data, spending hovered around required  minimum MOE levels (either 75 percent or 80 percent of the amount the  state spent in 1994).  Further, from fiscal years 2006 through 2009, the  level of TANF spending states counted toward MOE requirements  increased each year, according to HHS data. In aggregate, state MOE  expenditures have remained above the 100-percent MOE level since  2009. Several reasons account for higher levels of reported MOE  spending since 2006. First, many states (20) had to meet a higher MOE  spending requirement because they accessed TANF Contingency Funds  from fiscal years 2007 through 2010. According to HHS officials, many  states have continued accessing these funds through the present day.  Second, some states may have increased their level of MOE spending to  access the Emergency Contingency Fund, which almost all states did in  fiscal years 2009 and 2010. To access these funds, states were required  to increase their basic assistance caseload and spending or spend more  state funds for short-term, non-recurrent benefits or subsidized  employment than they had in a corresponding quarter in an earlier base  year. Third, many states claimed additional MOE spending to help them  meet work participation rate requirements.", "Some stakeholders have raised questions about counting  nongovernmental third-party expenditures toward a state\u2019s TANF MOE  requirement; these questions fall into two main categories. First, some  stakeholders question whether allowing states to count spending by  nongovernmental third-party organizations as TANF MOE spending is in  keeping with the goal of maintaining or increasing the level of state  provided services, considering these nongovernmental third-party  services may have been provided whether or not the state counted them  as MOE spending. If reported MOE spending does not actually reflect  maintaining or increasing service levels, the overall level of services  available to low-income families and children in the state may decrease.  HHS officials note that nongovernmental third-party expenditures do not  necessarily represent added state spending and that counting  nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE spending can  reduce a state\u2019s financial commitment in meeting its basic MOE  requirement. HHS officials said that prohibiting this practice would help to  ensure that states maintain their commitment to needy families as the law  intended. Second, some stakeholders have noted that allowing states to  count such spending toward MOE requirements makes it easier for states  to lower the work participation rates they are required to meet, decreasing  the share of adults on welfare expected to work or prepare for work.  On  the other hand, some stakeholders have noted that allowing states to  count nongovernmental third-party expenditures as MOE spending helps  states meet TANF requirements and facilitates public and private  partnerships."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Most States Do Not Regularly Count Nongovernmental Third-Party Expenditures as TANF MOE Spending, Some States Make Greater Use of It than Other States", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "One-Third of States Counted Nongovernmental Third- Party Expenditures as TANF MOE Spending in Fiscal Year 2015", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2015, around one-third of states (16 of 51) reported counting  nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE spending.

In addition, state officials also reported taking steps to  ensure the value of services counted as TANF MOE spending reflects  those expenditures associated with TANF eligible participants. For  example, Ohio officials told us that they calculate the value of food  assistance services provided by the Second Harvest Food Bank to TANF  recipients using data this organization collects on the percentage of  families it serves that are TANF eligible and the monetary value of food  distributed and purchased over a specified time period. Similarly, officials  in Arizona reported that through an agreement with the Association of  Arizona Food Banks, the state counts toward its TANF MOE requirement  the value of the food assistance services the food bank provides to  families considered eligible for TANF services as defined by the state and  the administrative expenses associated with providing this service. Lastly,  New Hampshire state officials told us they estimated the monetary value  of the services provided by the Granite YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of  Greater Nashua using data provided by these organizations.

Officials in all three states with whom  we spoke said that the public-private partnerships were valuable,  longstanding, and predated the state\u2019s decision to count TANF MOE  expenditures toward its TANF MOE requirement.

A fifth of these states  (5 of 25) responded that they would be extremely or very likely to cut  services in another area to meet the TANF MOE requirement (see fig. 7).  According to an official from Georgia, where nongovernmental third-party  expenditures comprised 60 percent of the states\u2019 MOE spending in fiscal  year 2015, there is a moderate probability that the state would cut funding  to other services and direct the funding to services that contribute to their  TANF MOE requirement. Similarly, officials from Ohio, where  nongovernmental third-party expenditures comprised 8 percent of TANF  MOE spending in fiscal year 2015, reported that the state would either  secure additional funding from its general revenue fund or another  program\u2019s general revenue funding would be reduced to meet the TANF  MOE requirement, but the decision would be made through the state\u2019s  biennial budget process. While states that have counted  nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE spending in  multiple years reported the most concerns about the possibility of not  being able to do so in the future, one official from Maine, for which  nongovernmental third-party expenditures were counted toward the TANF  MOE requirement once from fiscal years 2007 to 2015, also reported that  the state would not meet its TANF MOE requirement if it was unable to  use this option in the future.", "In our survey, officials from some states identified in open-ended survey  responses additional concerns should counting nongovernmental third- party expenditures as TANF MOE spending no longer be allowed.  Specifically, several (8 of 18) reported they would not meet the work  participation rate requirement if they were no longer allowed to count  nongovernmental third-party expenditures toward their states\u2019 TANF MOE  requirement.  For example, officials in one state reported that without  the option to count nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF  MOE spending the state would not be able to meet required work  participation rates during economic downturns, when fewer employment  opportunities are generally available.  Furthermore, of the states that  noted additional concerns on our survey, several (6 of 18) reported they  would be unable to meet TANF MOE requirements should counting  nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE spending no  longer be allowed. One state official noted that in recent years, the state  has used nongovernmental third-party spending as a budgetary strategy  to save state dollars. Specifically, the state has reduced its general fund  spending on TANF-related services while continuing to meet TANF MOE  requirements by counting expenditures made by existing programs in the  community toward the state\u2019s TANF MOE requirement. Further, four  states reported that if they were no longer able to count nongovernmental  third-party expenditures toward their states\u2019 TANF MOE requirement, they  would lose partnerships with nongovernmental third-party organizations.  Lastly, two states reported that without the ability to count  nongovernmental third-party expenditures as TANF MOE spending, they  would not be able to access additional federal funds from the TANF  Contingency Fund.
