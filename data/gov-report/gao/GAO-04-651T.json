From 1996 through 2001, the average daily food intake increased from 1,300 to 2,300 calories. From 1997-2002, Iraq sold more than $67 billion of oil through the program and issued $38 billion in letters of credit to purchase commodities.

This estimate includes oil revenue and contract amounts for 2002, updated letters of credit from prior years, and newer estimates of illicit commissions from commodity suppliers. Both the U.N. Secretary General, through the Office of the Iraq Program (OIP) and the Security Council, through its sanctions committee for Iraq, were responsible for overseeing the Oil for Food Program. However, the Iraq government negotiated contracts directly with purchasers of Iraqi oil and suppliers of commodities, which may have been one important factor that allowed Iraq to levy illegal surcharges and commissions. While OIP was responsible for examining Iraqi contracts for price and value, it is unclear how it performed this function. The sanctions committee was responsible for monitoring oil smuggling, screening contracts for items that could have military uses, and approving oil and commodity contracts. While the sanctions committee responded to illegal surcharges on oil, it is unclear what actions it took to respond to illicit commissions on commodity contracts. OIP transferred 3,059 Oil for Food contracts--with pending shipments valued at $6.2 billion--to the CPA on November 22, 2003. However, the CPA stated that it has not received all the original contracts, amendments, and letters of credit it needs to manage the program. These problems, along with inadequate CPA staffing during the transfer, hampered the efforts of CPA's Oil for Food coordination center in Baghdad to ensure continued delivery of commodities. Poor planning, coordination, and the security environment in Iraq continue to affect the execution of these contracts. Inadequate oversight and corruption in the Oil for Food program raise concerns about the Iraqi government's ability to import and distribute Oil for Food commodities and manage at least $32 billion in expected donor reconstruction funds. The CPA has taken steps, such as appointing inspectors general, to build internal control and accountability measures at Iraq's ministries. The CPA and the World Food Program (WFP) are also training ministry staff to help them assume responsibility for Oil for Food contracts in July 2004. The new government will have to balance the reform of its costly food subsidy program with the need to maintain food stability and protect the poorest populations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s review of the United  Nations (U.N.)

The members of the sanctions committee were members of  the Security Council. Subsequent Security Council resolutions specifically  prohibited nations from exporting to Iraq items that could be used to build  chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. In 1991, the Security Council  offered to let Iraq sell oil under a U.N. program to meet its peoples\u2019 basic  needs. The Iraqi government rejected the offer, and over the next 5 years,  the United Nations reported food shortages and a general deterioration in  social services.", "In December 1996, the United Nations and Iraq agreed on the Oil for Food  program, which permitted Iraq to sell up to $1 billion worth of oil every 90  days to pay for food, medicine, and humanitarian goods. Subsequent U.N.  resolutions increased the amount of oil that could be sold and expanded  the humanitarian goods that could be imported. In 1999, the Security  Council removed all restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could sell to  purchase civilian goods. The United Nations and the Security Council  monitored and screened contracts that the Iraqi government signed with  commodity suppliers and oil purchasers, and Iraq\u2019s oil revenue was placed  in a U.N.-controlled escrow account.

In February 2002, the United Nations  reported that the Oil for Food program had considerable success in  several sectors such as agriculture, food, health, and nutrition by arresting  the decline in living conditions and improving the nutritional status of the  average Iraqi citizen.", "The Public Distribution System run by Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Trade is the food  portion of the Oil for Food program.

As early as June 1996, the  Maritime Interception Force, a naval force of coalition partners including  the United States and Great Britain, informed the sanctions committee  that oil was being smuggled out of Iraq through Iranian territorial waters.  In December 1996, Iran acknowledged the smuggling and reported that it  had taken action. In October 1997, the sanctions committee was again  informed about smuggling through Iranian waters.
