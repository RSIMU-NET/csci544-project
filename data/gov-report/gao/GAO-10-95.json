JIEDDO was established to coordinate and focus all counter-IED efforts, including ongoing research and development, throughout DOD. This report, which is one in a series of congressionally mandated GAO reports related to JIEDDO's management and operations, assesses the extent to which 1) capability gaps were initially identified in DOD's effort to defeat IEDs and how these gaps and other factors led to the development of JIEDDO, 2) JIEDDO has maintained visibility over all counter-IED efforts, 3) JIEDDO has coordinated the transition of JIEDDO-funded initiatives to the military services, and 4) JIEDDO has developed criteria for the counter-IED training initiatives it will fund. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed and analyzed relevant documents and met with DOD and service officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["With the escalation of the IED threat in Iraq, DOD identified several counter-IED capability gaps that included shortcomings in the areas of counter-IED technologies, qualified personnel with expertise in counter-IED tactics, training, dedicated funding, and expedited acquisition processes. For example, prior to JIEDDO's establishment, many different DOD entities focused on counter-IED issues, but coordination among these various efforts was informal and ad hoc. DOD's efforts to focus on addressing these gaps culminated in the creation of JIEDDO, but its creation was done in the absence of DOD having formal guidance for establishing joint organizations. Further, DOD did not systematically evaluate all preexisting counter-IED resources to determine whether other entities were engaged in similar efforts. JIEDDO and the services lack full visibility over counter-IED initiatives throughout DOD. First, JIEDDO and the services lack a comprehensive database of all existing counter-IED initiatives, limiting their visibility over counter-IED efforts across DOD. Although JIEDDO is currently developing a management system that will track initiatives as they move through JIEDDO's acquisition process, the system will only track JIEDDO-funded initiatives--not those being independently developed and procured by the services and other DOD components. Second, the services lack full visibility over those JIEDDO-funded initiatives that bypass JIEDDO's acquisition process. With limited visibility, both JIEDDO and the services are at risk of duplicating efforts. JIEDDO faces difficulties with transitioning Joint IED defeat initiatives to the military services, in part because JIEDDO and the services have difficulty resolving the gap between JIEDDO's transition timeline and DOD's base budget cycle. As a result, the services are mainly funding initiatives with funding for overseas contingency operations rather than their base budgets. Continuing to fund transferred initiatives with overseas contingency operations appropriations does not ensure funding availability for those initiatives in future years since these appropriations are not necessarily renewed from one year to the next. This transition is also hindered when service requirements are not fully considered during the development of joint-funded counter-IED initiatives, as evidenced by two counter-IED jamming systems. As a result, JIEDDO may be investing in counter-IED solutions that do not fully meet existing service requirements. JIEDDO's lack of clear criteria for the counter-IED training initiatives it will fund has affected its counter-IED training investment decisions. As a result, JIEDDO has funded training initiatives that may have primary uses other than defeating IEDs. In March 2009, JIEDDO attempted to update its criteria for joint training initiatives by listing new requirements; however, these guidelines also could be broadly interpreted. Without specific criteria for counter-IED training initiatives, DOD may find that it lacks funding for future initiatives more directly related to the counter-IED mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Improvised explosive devices (IED) continue to be the number one threat  to U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. During 2008, IEDs accounted for  almost 40 percent of the attacks on coalition forces in Iraq. In 2009,  insurgents\u2019 use of IEDs against U.S. forces in Iraq began to decline for the  second straight year since 2003, while in Afghanistan the number of  monthly IED incidents increased to more than 800 in July 2009. Through  fiscal year 2009, Congress has appropriated over $16 billion to the Joint  IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) to address the IED threat. In addition,  other Department of Defense (DOD) components, including the military  services, have devoted at least $1.49 billion to the counter-IED effort.  Along with the escalation in Afghanistan, the IED threat is expanding  throughout the globe with over 300 IED events per month worldwide  outside of Iraq and Afghanistan, according to JIEDDO. There is  widespread consensus that this threat will not go away and that IEDs will  continue to be a weapon of strategic influence in future conflicts.", "Prior to JIEDDO\u2019s establishment in 2006, no single entity was responsible  for coordinating DOD\u2019s counter-IED efforts. DOD established JIEDDO and  directed it to focus (lead, advocate, and coordinate) all DOD actions in  support of the combatant commanders\u2019 and their respective joint task  forces\u2019 efforts to defeat IEDs as weapons of strategic influence.  DOD\u2019s  directive mandates that JIEDDO\u2019s director serve as the DOD point of  coordination for initiatives across the full range of efforts necessary to  defeat the IED threat, integrate all counter-IED solutions throughout DOD,  and coordinate with other DOD components for ongoing midterm research  and development initiatives and long-term science and technology efforts.", "In a series of reviews in response to direction in Senate Report 109-292, we  first reported in March 2007 on several issues related to JIEDDO\u2019s  management and operations, including JIEDDO\u2019s lack of a strategic plan  and the resulting effects on the development of its financial and human  capital management programs. We made several recommendations to the  Secretary of Defense to improve the management of JIEDDO operations,  stressing the development of JIEDDO\u2019s detailed strategic plan.  Subsequently, we also reported on JIEDDO\u2019s financial management  processes and internal controls and JIEDDO\u2019s coordination of intelligence  support efforts. Due to concerns over JIEDDO\u2019s performance and its  ability to effectively coordinate DOD\u2019s response to IEDs, Congress, in the  Conference Report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense  Authorization Act, mandated that we review JIEDDO\u2019s efforts in this  regard. In response, this review assesses the coordination of DOD\u2019s  counter-IED efforts, specifically focusing on the extent to which (1)  capability gaps were initially identified in DOD\u2019s effort to defeat IEDs and  how these gaps and other factors led to the development of JIEDDO, (2)  JIEDDO has maintained visibility over all counter-IED efforts, (3) JIEDDO  has coordinated the transition of JIEDDO-funded initiatives to the military  services, and (4) JIEDDO has developed criteria for the counter-IED  training initiatives it will fund. In another ongoing engagement, we also are  examining what progress JIEDDO has made to improve its management of  internal processes.", "To assess the extent to which capability gaps were initially identified in  DOD\u2019s effort to defeat IEDs and how these gaps and other factors led to  the development of JIEDDO, we met with officials from JIEDDO, the Army  Asymmetric Warfare Office, the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other current and former DOD  officials involved in the establishment of JIEDDO. We also examined  documentation including DOD Directive 2000.19E, which established  JIEDDO, and documentation and briefings relating to JIEDDO\u2019s evolution.  To assess the extent to which JIEDDO has maintained visibility over all  counter-IED efforts, coordinated the transition of JIEDDO-funded  initiatives to the military services, and defined what constitutes a counter- IED training initiative, we met with officials from organizations including  the Army Asymmetric Warfare Office, Army Training and Doctrine  Command, Army National Training Center, Marine Corps Warfighting  Laboratory, Marine Corps Training and Education Command, Training  Counter-IED Operations Integration Center, Joint Forces Command,  JIEDDO Joint Center of Excellence, U.S. Central Command, Technical  Support Working Group, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and JIEDDO.

Terrorist and insurgent groups facing overwhelming  conventional forces had previously used IEDs in a variety of scenarios,  including the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, the ship-borne  attack against the USS Cole in 1999, and the airborne attacks of September  11th, 2001. In a 2006 report examining the requirements for truck armor,  we stated that the Army had previously identified the IED as a threat to  U.S. forces prior to the beginning of operations in Iraq.", "Following the end of major combat in 2003 in Iraq, insurgents began to  rapidly adjust their tactics due to the overwhelming firepower and  accuracy of U.S. and coalition military forces in conventional warfare. As  U.S. forces began to respond to this asymmetric threat, a new tactic  emerged as the preferred enemy form of fire, the IED. Beginning in June  2003, IED incidents targeting coalition forces began to escalate from 22  per month to over 600 per month in June 2004. In June 2006, these  incidents reached more than 2,000 per month. At one point in 2006,  coalition forces in Iraq were experiencing almost 100 IEDs per day. The  initial IED attacks in Iraq used nonconventional tactics, techniques, and  procedures with a magnitude U.S. forces had not seen before. This threat  involved an enemy that takes advantage of and adapts to the environment  and is not restricted by conventional rules of engagement. For example,  insurgents began using tactics such as buried or camouflaged roadside  bombs, vehicle-borne IEDs (car bombs), and suicide bombers to attack  coalition forces. Not only was the enemy flexible, but these insurgents also  had the ability to rapidly respond to countermeasures.", "Due to the magnitude and previously mentioned changes made by the  enemy in its tactics, techniques, and procedures, several counter-IED gaps  related to the IED threat were identified by DOD:  technology gaps\u2014shortage of jammers, robots, and other technology,  almost none of which were geared towards homemade roadside bombs,    personnel gaps\u2014lack of qualified personnel to analyze the threat and  collect and distribute information on intelligence, forensic evidence, latest  tactics, techniques, procedures, and other data,  training gaps\u2014training on latest tactics, techniques, and procedures not  available, equipment often supplied without training or instructions, and  jammers interfered with communications equipment,  funding gaps\u2014little to no dedicated funding for counter-IED efforts, and    DOD acquisition process gaps\u2014no process for rapidly developing and  fielding new equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Efforts to Address Counter-IED Capability Gaps Culminated in the Creation of JIEDDO", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s efforts to address counter-IED gaps culminated in the creation of  JIEDDO.

In recognition of the lack of  official guidance for planning joint activities, the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) is developing a formal process for establishing future joint  organizations. Despite steps taken to focus DOD\u2019s counter-IED efforts,  most of the organizations engaged in the IED defeat effort prior to JIEDDO  continue to develop, maintain, and in many cases expand their own IED  defeat capabilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Different DOD Entities Began Focusing on Counter-IED Issues in an Effort to Address Capability Gaps", "paragraphs": ["As IED attacks in Iraq reached nearly 300 per month by October 2003 and  over 400 per month by May 2004, many different DOD entities at the  service and joint levels began focusing on addressing capability gaps in the  areas of counter-IED technologies, qualified personnel with expertise in  counter-IED tactics, training, dedicated funding, and expedited acquisition  processes. Many of these efforts were carried out by the Army and Marine  Corps, in addition to a number of joint and interagency efforts.", "Army officials stated that within the Army, individual units throughout Iraq  began to focus on counter-IED efforts as IED incidents increased in Iraq.  Army units developed their own counter-IED tactics, techniques, and  procedures as insurgent tactics evolved, and soldiers began using an  increasingly wide range of electronic jammers in varying configurations to  counter remote-detonated IEDs. According to Army officials, the Army  also employed Explosive Ordnance Disposal technicians to disable and  dispose of suspected IEDs. Army officials stated that these personnel  began relying on remote-controlled robots as the number of IED incidents  and the level of complexity of the devices increased, and Explosive  Ordnance Disposal technicians were initially among the few personnel  with counterexplosives training in-theater. To support these initial efforts,  according to Army officials, the Army relied on the Rapid Equipping Force  to quickly acquire counter-IED technology such as jammers and robots.  This organization was established in 2002 to identify and pursue off-the- shelf or near-term materiel solutions that could be acquired and fielded  quickly without having to rely on the Army\u2019s normally lengthy acquisition  processes, Army officials stated. The Operational Needs Statement, a  process that enables commanders to request a materiel solution for an  urgent need, was another method of rapidly acquiring technology  solutions.", "Marine Corps officials stated that initial Marine Corps counter-IED efforts  were centered on the Marine Corps Combat Development Command,  which was responsible for managing materiel requests, known as  Universal Needs Statements, from deployed personnel. This organization  began to receive a larger number of counter-IED-related requests as the  IED threat escalated, according to Marine Corps officials, increasing from  2 in 2002 to 8 in 2003, and 26 in 2004. Overall, 13 percent of all requests  during this 3-year period were counter-IED-related. According to Marine  Corps officials, in response, the organization established a counter-IED  cell in 2004 to focus exclusively on counter-IED-related requests. The cell  was later transferred to the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, and  expanded to include personnel with more specialized technical expertise.  Marine Corps officials stated that the Urgent Universal Needs Statement  was developed during this period as a means of providing commanders  with an expedited process for requesting critically needed capabilities,  including counter-IED solutions. Through this process, Marine Corps  officials stated that they have been able to develop and field equipment in  a significantly shorter time frame than the normal acquisition processes,  sometimes within several weeks.", "At the joint and interagency level, a variety of organizations were engaged  in intelligence support and counter-IED technology acquisition. Early joint  efforts included the Combined Explosives Exploitation Cell, which was  established by the Army in 2003 to perform physical, biometric, and  tactical exploitation of evidence from IED attack scenes. Staffed by a  combination of Army, law enforcement, and intelligence personnel, the  organization provided Army, Marines, and Special Forces units with in- theater analyses of IED construction techniques and enemy tactics,  techniques, and procedures, and also collected biometric data, such as  fingerprints, in an effort to identify specific bomb makers. While the  organization often collected evidence from IED attack scenes itself, it also  collaborated with Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and drew on data  provided by these teams in their analyses. Since 2004, the Naval Explosive  Ordnance Disposal Technology Division has served as the administrative  sponsor and primary source of technical and engineering support for the  organization. According to an Army official, the Technical Support  Working Group was involved in developing counter-IED technology  solutions as part of the Combating Terrorism Directorate of the Joint Staff  Operations Center, which in turn was responsible for counter-terrorism  force protection efforts, including counter-IED efforts. The Terrorist  Explosive Device Analytical Center was established in 2003 to leverage  law enforcement, the intelligence community, and military capabilities to  perform technical and forensic analyses on recovered IED components in  the United States and provide actionable intelligence to field personnel.  Army officials told us that, in contrast to the Combined Explosives  Exploitation Cell, it focused on higher-level strategic issues rather than  tactical ones, and included personnel from the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, DOD, and the  intelligence community.", "Army and Marine Corps officials stated that communication and  cooperation among these various efforts lacked overall coordination, with  multiple entities independently engaged in attempts to address various  facets of the larger IED problem. Although the Army had direct experience  with IEDs due to its presence in Iraq, according to an Army official, it had  no single coordinator for even its own IED defeat efforts. For example,  Army officials stated that coordination of counter-IED efforts between  Army units occurred in-theater at the working level as personnel facing  similar enemy tactics exchanged successful tactics, techniques, and  procedures, but little synchronization of Army-wide efforts was occurring.  Army and Marine Corps officials stated that some coordination between  the Army and the Marine Corps took place, for example, on the use of the  different electronic jamming systems used by each service, but  communication was carried out on an ad hoc basis and generally occurred  only in Iraq as commanders from both services attempted to overcome  IED-related threats. At the interagency level, counterterrorism force  protection efforts, including the Technical Support Working Group, were  coordinated by the Combating Terrorism Directorate of the Joint Staff  Operations Center. However, an Army official stated that this organization  was left with limited capabilities by 2003 as many of its resources had  been reallocated to the Department of Homeland Security after the attacks  of September 11, 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JIEDDO Evolved through a Series of Attempts to Focus Counter-IED Efforts", "paragraphs": ["As IED attacks increased following the invasion of Iraq, JIEDDO evolved  through a series of attempts to focus counter-IED efforts.

For example, in late 2003, recognizing the need for  closer coordination and greater focus on its counter-IED efforts, the Army  took the initial steps toward what would later become a joint-level  organization with the establishment of the Army IED Task Force.", "According to an Army official, the IED Task Force consisted of a  coordinating cell in Washington and two field teams in Iraq, and was  largely focused on operational and training efforts in an attempt to address  both the lack of personnel in-theater with counter-IED training and the  need for better training on effective tactics, techniques, and procedures.  The field teams, including former Special Forces personnel, developed  effective tactics, techniques, and procedures, which they then relayed to  the Center for Army Lessons Learned. An IED cell was established at the  center to analyze these practices and incorporate lessons learned in the  training of outgoing troops to Iraq, while an Army official stated that the  coordinating cell in Washington provided leadership and facilitated  communication between the field teams, field commanders, and the  center. Army officials also stated that the IED Task Force fielded a limited  amount of counter-IED-related technology in cooperation with the Rapid  Equipping Force, including more sophisticated jamming equipment,  vehicle armor, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal robots. However, an  Army official stated that with an initial budget of $20 million and no formal  authority to coordinate counter-IED efforts outside of the Army, the IED  Task Force lacked both the funding and authority to undertake a large- scale, departmentwide effort.", "In 2004, senior leaders began to believe that greater emphasis should be  placed on developing a technology solution rather than focusing on  training as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures, according to Army  officials. In June 2004, the commander of the CENTCOM wrote a  memorandum to the Deputy Secretary of Defense requesting a Manhattan  Project-like effort to find a technical solution to the IED problem. In  response to the CENTCOM memorandum, the Deputy Secretary of  Defense created a Joint Integrated Process Team in July 2004. This team  was intended to identify, prioritize, and resource materiel and nonmateriel  solutions, and the Army IED Task Force was elevated to the joint level and  renamed the Joint IED Defeat Task Force, with a budget of $100 million.", "In an attempt to enhance visibility over all DOD initiatives and to further  focus the counter-IED effort, in June 2005, DOD Directive 2000.19 elevated  the Joint IED Defeat Task Force to report directly to the Deputy Secretary,  gave it a budget of over $1.3 billion, and clarified its role as the focal point  for all efforts in DOD to defeat IEDs. The Joint Integrated Process Team  was transformed into an advisory group to the Joint IED Defeat Task  Force\u2019s director, and a retired four-star general was recruited to head the  Task Force in an effort to raise its profile among other senior DOD  leaders, according to a former senior DOD official. However, a DOD  official stated that by 2006, the Joint IED Defeat Task Force had begun to  encounter difficulties attracting and retaining qualified personnel due to  its temporary status.", "In late 2005, the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense began working  with the Joint Staff and the Director of Administration and Management  to give the task force more permanence and to provide more manpower  continuity. Several solutions were proposed by the Director of  Administration and Management, including placing the task force within  the Joint Forces Command, making it a Staff Element within OSD, or  creating a Jointly Manned Entity under OSD. Consequently in February  2006, DOD Directive 2000.19E turned the joint task force into a permanent  joint entity and jointly manned activity of DOD\u2014JIEDDO\u2014with a budget  of nearly $3.7 billion, with the intention to provide the institutional  stability necessary to attract and retain qualified personnel, according to a  DOD official.", "These various actions that led to the development of JIEDDO were done in  the absence of DOD having formal guidance for establishing joint  organizations. According to a former DOD official, JIEDDO developed  largely through informal communication among key individuals in various  services and agencies. For example, a former DOD official stated that after  the establishment of the Army IED Task Force, the Secretary of the Navy  became aware of its work and began meeting regularly with its director,  and these meetings eventually led to the idea of elevating the IED Task  Force to the joint level. Furthermore, DOD did not systematically evaluate  all preexisting counter-IED resources in order to determine whether other  entities were engaged in similar efforts within DOD, according to DOD  officials. Although the Technical Support Working Group, for example,  was already in existence at the time of the establishment of the Army IED  Task Force in 2003, an Army official stated that Army officials were under  pressure to find an immediate solution and that creating a new working  group or task force would be the most efficient approach to overcoming  the IED problem. In addition, an Army official stated that existing  organizations, such as the Technical Support Working Group, were too  focused on technology solutions, but even after the CENTCOM\u2019s 2004  memorandum requesting a technology solution, as noted above, a DOD  official stated that the possibility of using preexisting counter-IED  resources rather than creating a new organization was not considered  when the decision to establish JIEDDO was made.

However, even with these boards, JIEDDO has  approved some counter-IED initiatives without vetting them through the  appropriate service counter-IED focal points because the process allows  JIEDDO to make exceptions if deemed necessary and appropriate.", "Specifically, the process allows the Director of JIEDDO\u2019s counter-IED  training center to make exceptions when training requirements and  training support activities need to be accelerated to meet predeployment  training requirements. For example, at least three counter-IED training  initiatives sponsored by JIEDDO\u2019s counter-IED joint training center were  not vetted through the Army counter-IED focal point before being  approved for JIEDDO funding. These initiatives included a $9.5 million  upgrade to counter-IED training areas, a $19.1 million search rehearsal site  to replicate conditions in Iraq, and a $1.5 million initiative to augment the  number of personnel trained on IED signal jamming at an Army training  center. In addition to not having visibility over these initiatives, Army  officials later rejected the transition or transfer from JIEDDO of each of  these initiatives for fiscal year 2011. In particular, Army officials rejected  the search rehearsal site and signal jamming personnel augmentation  initiatives because the Army had already been pursuing similar efforts.  JIEDDO officials acknowledged that while it may be beneficial for some  JIEDDO-funded initiatives to bypass its acquisition process in cases where  an urgent requirement with limited time to field is identified, these cases  do limit service visibility over all JIEDDO-funded initiatives.", "Army officials also cited examples where JIEDDO allowed certain science  and technology initiatives with high-technology readiness levels to bypass  the first stages of JIEDDO\u2019s process to select initiatives. Officials from the  Army\u2019s Adaptive Networks, Threats, and Solutions Division stated that this  step limits the Army\u2019s visibility over JIEDDO\u2019s funding decisions. They  cited six initiatives that bypassed JIEDDO\u2019s acquisition process, including  one designed to predetonate IEDs. While this method may shorten the  time required for procurement, it denies the service counter-IED  representatives at JIEDDO\u2019s initiative vetting boards the opportunity to  review the initiatives.", "JIEDDO also has bypassed its acquisition process by working directly with  individual service units and organizations to address specific counter-IED  capability gaps. For example, JIEDDO worked directly with the Army\u2019s  Training and Doctrine Command to establish the Joint Training Counter- IED Operations and Integration Center without input from the Army\u2019s  Adaptive Networks, Threats, and Solutions Division. As a result, the Army  counter-IED focal point was initially unaware of the initiative and  expressed confusion about how the initiative would be integrated into the  Army\u2019s overall counter-IED effort. Additionally, this training center was  not based on a theater-based urgent need. Furthermore, Army officials  voiced concerns about the implications of assigning a service  responsibility for what is essentially a joint training function. Additionally,  officials with the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab described the  coordination and accountability challenges involved when JIEDDO\u2019s  counter-IED training center works directly with a Marine unit to deliver  counter-IED equipment, making it difficult for the Marine counter-IED  focal point to monitor counter-IED activity and quantify the amount of  funding it receives from JIEDDO. Overall, service officials have said that  not incorporating their views on initiatives limits their visibility of JIEDDO  actions and could result in approved initiatives that are inconsistent with  service needs.

In our 2008 report, we  recommended that DOD develop a more effective process to ensure funds  designated for sustainment costs are included in its budget cycle.  However, DOD still lacks a comprehensive plan to ensure that the services  have the proper funding to sustain an initiative following a transition.", "According to DOD\u2019s Directive, JIEDDO is required to develop plans for  transitioning joint IED defeat initiatives into DOD base budget programs  for sustainment. As described in its instruction, JIEDDO plans to fund  initiatives for 2 fiscal years of sustainment. After that, the initiative is  supposed to be either disposed of or passed to one of the services for its  continued sustainment through a transition or transfer. In a transition, one  of the services is expected to pick up sustainment costs for an initiative by  placing it into a base budget program as an enduring capability. In a  transfer, one of the services may sustain the initiative through funding for  current contingency operations. In comments on our prior report, JIEDDO  stated that it would work with DOD to develop a more effective process to  ensure that funds designated for sustainment costs are included in its base  budget cycle. However, since that report, service officials have stated that  JIEDDO\u2019s process has not yet been improved and that JIEDDO\u2019s transition  timeline may not allow the services enough time to request and receive  funding through DOD\u2019s base budgeting process. As a result, DOD  continues to transfer most initiatives to the services for funding as  permanent programs, with service overseas contingency operations  appropriations, rather than with service base budget funding. According to  JIEDDO\u2019s latest transition brief for fiscal year 2010, JIEDDO  recommended the transfer of 19 initiatives totaling $233 million to the  services for funding through overseas contingency operations  appropriations and the transition of only 3 initiatives totaling $4.5 million  into service base budget programs. Continuing to fund transferred  initiatives with overseas contingency operations appropriations does not  ensure funding availability for those initiatives in future years, since these  appropriations are not necessarily renewed from one year to the next.", "In addition to the small number of transitions and transfers within DOD,  the services often decide to defer indefinitely their assumption of funding  responsibility for JIEDDO initiatives following JIEDDO\u2019s intended 2-year  transition or transfer point. According to the fiscal year 2011 JIEDDO  transition list, the Army and Navy deferred or rejected the acceptance of  16 initiatives that JIEDDO had recommended for transition or transfer,  totaling at least $16 million. Deferred or rejected initiatives are either  sustained by JIEDDO indefinitely, transitioned or transferred during a  future year, or terminated. When the services defer or reject the transition  of initiatives, JIEDDO remains responsible for them beyond the intended  2-year transition or transfer point, a delay that could diminish its ability to  fund new initiatives.", "Lastly, JIEDDO has delivered training aids to the Army without ensuring  that it had the appropriate funds to sustain the equipment. As a result,  Army officials have stated that they are unable to quickly reallocate  funding from current programs to pay for these sustainment costs. For  example, JIEDDO provided counter-IED training aids, such as surrogates  for mine-resistant vehicles to support training at the Army\u2019s combat  training centers, without first coordinating with the Army\u2019s Combat  Training Center Directorate to plan for their future sustainment.  Consequently, this directorate had not planned for the $12.7 million  requirement to sustain the vehicle surrogates and other training  equipment. As a result of unplanned sustainment costs such as these, the  services could face unexpected, long-term sustainment requirements in  the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JIEDDO\u2019s Initiative Transitions Are Hindered When Service Requirements Are Not Fully Considered", "paragraphs": ["JIEDDO\u2019s initiative transitions are also hindered when service  requirements are not fully considered during the development and  integration of jointly-funded counter-IED initiatives. According to DOD\u2019s  Directive, JIEDDO is required to integrate joint-funded counter-IED  initiatives throughout DOD. However, service officials stated that  transitioning JIEDDO-funded initiatives, such as counter-IED radio  jamming systems, is made more difficult when service requirements are  not fully considered throughout the systems\u2019 evaluation process. In 2006,  DOD established the Navy as single manager and executive agent for  ground-based jamming systems for DOD. Under this arrangement, the  Navy oversees several boards to review and evaluate jamming system  proposals, including a program board at the general officer level and a  technical acceptance board at the field officer level. Though the services  participate on each of these boards, the counter-IED jamming program  board approved, with JIEDDO funding, two ground-based, counter-IED  jamming systems that did not fully meet the services\u2019 needs. In the first  example, CENTCOM, in response to an urgent operational needs  statement originating from its area of operations, published a requirement  in 2006 for a portable IED jamming system for use in theater. In 2007,  JIEDDO funded and delivered to theater a near-term solution to meet this  capability gap. However, Army officials stated that the fielded system was  underutilized by troops in Iraq, who thought the system was too heavy to  carry, especially given the weight of their body armor. Since then, the joint  counter-IED radio jamming program board has devised a plan to field a  newer portable jamming system called Counter Remote Control IED  Electronic Warfare (CREW) 3.1. According to JIEDDO, CREW 3.1 systems  were developed by a joint technical requirements board that aimed to  balance specific service requirements for portable systems. While  CENTCOM maintains that CREW 3.1 is a requirement in-theater, and  revalidated the need in September 2009, officials from the Army and  Marines Corps have both stated that they do not have a formal  requirement for the system. Nevertheless, DOD plans to field the  equipment to each of the services in response to CENTCOM\u2019s stated  operational need. It remains unclear, however, which DOD organizations  will be required to pay for procurement and sustainment costs for the  CREW 3.1, since DOD has yet to identify the source of final procurement  funding. In a second example, Army officials stated that they were not  involved to the fullest extent possible in the evaluation and improvement  process for a JIEDDO-funded, vehicle-mounted jamming system, even  though the Army was DOD\u2019s primary user in terms of total number of  systems fielded. The system, called the CREW Vehicle Receiver/Jammer  (CVRJ), ultimately required at least 20 proposals for configuration changes  to correct flaws found in its design after the contract was awarded. Two of  the changes involved modifying the jammer so it could function properly  at high temperatures. Another change was needed to prevent the jammer  from interfering with vehicle global positioning systems. Army officials  stated that had they had a more direct role on the Navy-led control board  that managed configuration changes to the CVRJ, the system may have  been more quickly integrated into the Army\u2019s operations. As this  transpired, the Army continued to use another jamming system, DUKE, as  its principal counter-IED electronic warfare system. Not ensuring that  service requirements are fully taken into account when evaluating and  developing counter-IED systems creates the potential for fielding  equipment that is inconsistent with service requirements. This could also  delay the transition of JIEDDO-funded initiatives to the services following  JIEDDO\u2019s 2-year transition timeline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "JIEDDO Lacks Clear Criteria for Defining What Counter-IED Training Initiative It Will Fund", "paragraphs": ["JIEDDO devoted $454 million in fiscal year 2008 to support service  counter-IED training requirements through such activities as constructing  a network of realistic counter-IED training courses at 57 locations  throughout the United States, Europe, and Korea. Although JIEDDO has  supported service counter-IED training, its lack of clear criteria for the  counter-IED training initiatives it will fund has affected its counter-IED  training investment decisions. According to its directive, JIEDDO defines a  counter-IED initiative as a materiel or nonmateriel solution that addresses  joint IED defeat capability gaps, but the directive does not specifically lay  out funding criteria for training initiatives. Since our last report, JIEDDO  has attempted to clarify what types of counter-IED training it will fund in  support of in-theater, urgent counter-IED requirements. In its comments to  our previous report, JIEDDO stated that it will fund an urgent in-theater  counter-IED requirement if it \u201cenables training support, including training  aids and exercises.\u201d JIEDDO also stated in its comments that it will fund  an urgent in-theater counter-IED requirement only if it has a primary  counter-IED application. Beyond JIEDDO, CENTCOM officials have  stated that they will process counter-IED capabilities only if they are  primarily related to countering IEDs.", "Though JIEDDO has since published criteria for determining what joint,  counter-IED, urgent requirements to fund, it has not developed similar  criteria for the funding of joint training initiatives not based on urgent  requirements. As a result, JIEDDO has funded training initiatives that may  have primary uses other than defeating IEDs. For example, since fiscal  year 2007, JIEDDO has spent $70.7 million on role players in an effort to  simulate Iraqi social, political, and religious groups at DOD\u2019s training  centers. JIEDDO also spent $24.1 million on simulated villages at DOD\u2019s  training centers in an effort to make steel shipping containers resemble  Iraqi buildings. According to Army officials, these role players and  simulated villages funded by JIEDDO to support counter-IED training are  also used in training not related to countering IEDs. Lastly, according to  its 2008 annual report, JIEDDO used counter-IED funding to purchase  authentic Iraqi furniture and other items to create a realistic environment  for counter-IED search rehearsals. In March 2009, JIEDDO attempted to  clarify its criteria for training initiatives not based on urgent requirements  by requiring counter-IED training initiatives to be (1) counter-IED related,  (2) joint in nature, (3) derived from an immediate need, and (4) unable to  be funded by a service. As with JIEDDO\u2019s urgent needs criteria for  training, these guidelines could also be broadly interpreted, as  demonstrated by the above examples. Without criteria specifying which  counter-IED training initiatives it will fund, JIEDDO may diminish its  ability to fund future initiatives that are more directly related to the  counter-IED mission. DOD also could hinder coordination in managing its  resources, as decision makers at both the joint and service level operate  under unclear selection guidelines for which types of training initiatives  should be funded and by whom."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["JIEDDO and the services lack full visibility and coordination of the wide  range of counter-IED measures throughout DOD, which presents  difficulties for DOD in efficiently using its resources to defeat IEDs.

DOD also stated that it has developed recommended changes for DOD  Directive 2000.19E that will address coordinating the transition of counter- IED solutions. DOD noted that these changes will be staffed to DOD and  the services during the periodic update of DOD Directive 2000.19E.

DOD also stated that fully vetted  coordination with the services prior to funding an effort or initiative could  delay the fielding of material that would save lives. DOD therefore  suggested that this recommendation be incorporated with our second  recommendation to notify the services of all JIEDDO-funded initiatives or  the language to this recommendation be changed to reflect DOD\u2019s  position. While we recognize the need to respond rapidly to support  warfighter needs and that our previous recommendations will help gain  awareness of JIEDDO-funded initiatives as they are being developed, we  continue to support our recommendation and reiterate the need for the  integration of service requirements and full coordination prior to funding  an initiative to ensure that these efforts are fully vetted throughout DOD  before significant resources are committed.", "In commenting on our recommendation for JIEDDO to evaluate counter- IED training initiatives using the same criteria it uses to evaluate in- theater-based joint counter-IED urgent requirements, and incorporate this  direction into existing guidance, DOD concurred with the intent but not  the language of this recommendation.
