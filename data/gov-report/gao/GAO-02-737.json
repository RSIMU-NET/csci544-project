DOD has adopted multidisciplinary and multifunctional definitions of their acquisition workforce, but the civilian agencies have not. DOD and the civilian agencies reviewed have developed specific training requirements for their acquisition workforce and mechanisms to track the training of acquisition personnel.

But achieving this has been difficult. Our work continues to show that some of the government\u2019s largest procurement operations are not always run efficiently, either because requirements are not clearly defined, because prices and alternatives are not fully considered, or because contracts are not adequately overseen. At the same time, the ongoing technological revolution requires a workforce with new knowledge, skills, and abilities. Moreover, the nature of acquisition is changing from routine simple buys toward more complex acquisitions, such as information technology services, and toward new business practices, such as performance-based contracting and the use of purchase cards.", "To ensure an adequate professional acquisition workforce, the Congress enacted a series of reforms in the 1990s, which required agencies to establish policies and procedures for effective management and training of their acquisition workforce, to include certain positions in the definition of the acquisition workforce, and to establish qualification, educational, and training requirements for positions identified as part of the acquisition workforce. You asked us to assess agency progress in this regard. Particularly, you asked us to determine whether agencies have (1) definitions of their acquisition workforces that include all significant acquisition-related functions as required by the Congress, (2) established training requirements for these workforces, (3) a means for ensuring that those requirements are met, and (4) allocated sufficient funding to provide required training.", "Our review focused on the Department of Defense (DOD); the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA), Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS); the General Services Administration (GSA); and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). These agencies represented 87 percent of total contract dollars obligated in fiscal year 2000 and employed 82 percent of the government\u2019s contract specialists and purchasing agents, which are the primary career fields in the acquisition workforce."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Congress and others have been addressing the question of how to strengthen the acquisition workforce since 1974 when the OFPP was created to establish governmentwide procurement policies for executive agencies. One of the primary responsibilities of this office and its Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) is to strengthen acquisition workforce training. The concern about the quality of the acquisition workforce deepened in the 1990s, as it became clear that the government was experiencing significant contracting failures partly because it lacked skilled personnel to manage and oversee contracts. There was also concern that program managers and other personnel integral to the success of the acquisition process were only marginally involved with the contracts. Two of the most significant steps taken in this regard were the passage of the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act in 1990 and the Clinger-Cohen Act in 1996. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act, among other things, provided specific guidance on DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce definition. The Clinger-Cohen Act required civilian agencies to establish acquisition workforce definitions. Those definitions were to include contract and procurement specialist positions and other positions \u201cin which significant acquisition-related functions are performed.\u201d  The Clinger-Cohen Act also required civilian agencies to collect standardized information on their acquisition workforce and establish education, training, and experience requirements that are \u201ccomparable to those established for the same or equivalent positions\u201d in DOD and the military services. Table 1 provides more details on this act and other legislation and federal agency initiatives.", "OFPP Policy Letter 97-01 directs executive agencies to establish core training for entry and advancement in the acquisition workforce. Agencies normally establish specific core training required to meet the standards for certification in each career field in their acquisition workforce (e.g., contracting officers, CORs, and COTRs). For contracting officers, agencies usually establish several warrant levels, with specified contracting authority for each level. Agencies issue permanent warrants only to contracting officers who have completed the core training required for each warrant level and who have the necessary work experience and formal education. Because contracting officers\u2019 warrant levels generally correspond to their grade levels, employees\u2019 career development and advancement is dependent on attending and passing required core training courses. The OFPP policy letter also established continuing education requirements for contract specialists and contracting officers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has a Broader Definition of Acquisition Workforce", "paragraphs": ["DOD includes a wide variety of disciplines\u2014ranging from contracting, to technical, to financial, to program staff\u2014in its acquisition workforce definition, but civilian agencies have employed narrower definitions that are largely limited to staff involved in awarding and administering contracts. Having a broader definition is important because it is one method to facilitate agencies\u2019 efforts to ensure that training reaches all staff integral to the success of a contract. While most civilian agencies acknowledge that the acquisition process requires the efforts of multiple functions and disciplines beyond those in traditional contracting offices, few have broadened their definitions of the acquisition workforce to include them. Officials at two agencies we reviewed said that they had not broadened their definitions because officials responsible for managing the acquisition workforce did not have management responsibility for or control of the training of individuals in offices other than their own."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Has a Multifunctional and Multidisciplinary Definition of Acquisition Workforce", "paragraphs": ["DOD is required by the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act to include, at a minimum, all acquisition-related positions in 11 specified functional areas in its definition of its acquisition workforce.

Using the Refined Packard methodology, DOD now includes personnel in its acquisition workforce from three categories: (1) specific occupations that are presumed to be performing acquisition-related work no matter what organization the employee is in, (2) a combination of an employee\u2019s occupational series and the organization in which the employee works, and (3) specific additions and deletions to the first two categories. DOD is currently coding the positions and employees identified by the Refined Packard methodology into its official personnel systems.

However, HHS, which has CORs and COTRs (which it refers to as project officers) not under control of the acquisition office, established regulations requiring the head of each contracting activity ensure their CORs and COTRs receive specified training. In addition, DOE, which has similar oversight concerns, has established an \u201cumbrella\u201d directive governing acquisition career development.

In addition, DAU offers assignment-specific training. Annually, advisors from each DOD career field determine whether certification standards and assignment-specific training requirements should be updated and whether training curricula are current. Any changes must be approved by the Director of Acquisition Education, Training, and Career Development before they are published in the DAU catalog. The DAU curriculum includes courses identified by the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology & Logistics) as integral to the education and training of personnel in identified positions.

The civilian agencies, with the exception of VA, viewed their systems as being interim. As a result of not having a centralized management information system, these agencies must rely on the data submitted periodically by training coordinators in their various locations throughout their agencies. Also, this data is often maintained on unofficial manual records or on various spreadsheets, making it difficult for the responsible acquisition officer to verify its accuracy. Because of ACMIS development delays, VA developed its own management information system to alleviate these problems, and it is currently entering historical employee training data into the database.", "ACMIS is to be a federal Web-accessible database of records to track acquisition workforce training and education. It is expected that the data in ACMIS will be used in making budgeting, staffing, and training decisions and monitoring the status of staff warrants. The baseline data for ACMIS will come from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Centralized Data Personnel File and agency workforce databases. Those records will then be supplemented with education, training, warrant, and certification data provided by individuals in the acquisition workforce. In addition, the system is to provide for computer-to-computer interfaces for bulk and automated data transfers (i.e., updates from agency personnel files or updates of multiple employee records with a common set of data, such as the completion of a course).", "The development of the new system, however, has experienced considerable delays. Although OFPP tasked FAI to develop the system in September 1997, it has not yet been implemented. In 2000, we reported that delays in developing the system were largely attributable to difficulties in obtaining agreement on the requirements for the system.", "Since our report, FAI, under OFPP direction, has published functional specifications and data requirements for the system.

Officials explained that knowing what training courses employees will need, determining the courses that will be provided to meet training needs, and knowing the costs of providing each course, including related travel costs, allowed them to establish the funding required for needed training. DOD employs a centralized approach in determining its funding requirements for acquisition workforce training for its services and components. Using its management information system and estimated costs, DOD and the military services and components go through the iterative process of reconciling course needs, class size, instructor availability, and other costs, such as travel. DAU funds (1) the cost of developing and presenting the courses and (2) the travel expenses for DOD employees attending the courses. The civilian agencies we reviewed employ similar procedures relying on the data available to them in their interim systems comprised of spreadsheets and unofficial manual records.", "DOD, the military services, and civilian agencies stated they had sufficient funds to meet their current minimum core training requirements.

A DOD official noted that fiscal year 2001 budget reductions combined with 2 years of \u201cstraight-line\u201d budgets have precluded DAU from providing all the courses requested by the DOD components. Also, while all employees received core training for their current positions and grades, they were often unable to receive core training needed to obtain warrants at the next higher level to allow them to work on larger contracts and to be competitive for promotion to a higher grade. Army and Navy officials cited similar concerns regarding DAU\u2019s budget reductions. Air Force officials stated that anticipated increases in the acquisition workforce, because of the implementation of the Refined Packard methodology, the replacement of retirees, and its planned increases in cross training between acquisition specialties to meet strategic objectives, would require additional funding for core training in the future.", "A DOE official said that DAU\u2019s budget cuts also potentially affect DOE\u2019s ability to meet its future training requirements because of its reliance on DAU-provided courses.
