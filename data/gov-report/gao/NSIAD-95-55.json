The stockpile is stored at eight Army installations in the continental United States and one installation on the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. It consists of various lethal weapons, such as rockets, bombs, and projectiles, and bulk containers that contain nerve and mustard agents. Exposure to the agents can result in death.", "In 1993, the United States signed the U.N.-sponsored Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and the Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, commonly referred to as the Chemical Weapons Convention. The United States agreed to dispose of (1) binary chemical weapons, recovered chemical weapons, and former chemical weapon production facilities within 10 years and (2) miscellaneous chemical warfare materiel within 5 years of the date the convention becomes effective. If ratified by the U.S. Senate, the convention becomes effective 180 days after the 65th nation ratifies the treaty, but not sooner than January 13, 1995. Under the terms of the convention, chemical weapons buried prior to 1977 are exempt from disposal as long as they remain buried. In the United States, burial was a common disposal method for chemical warfare materiel until the late 1950s. Should the United States choose to excavate the sites and remove the chemical weapons, the provisions of the convention would apply. DOD officials estimate that the convention will enter into force in fiscal year 1996.", "In the fiscal year 1993 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 102-484), the Congress directed the Army to report on its plans for disposing of all nonstockpile chemical warfare materiel within the United States. In 1993, the Army issued a report describing the nonstockpile chemical materiel, potential disposal methods, transportation alternatives, and disposal cost and schedule estimates. The report concluded that it would cost the Army $1.1 billion ($930 million in direct project disposal costs and $170 million in programmatic costs) to destroy, primarily by incineration, demolition, and neutralization, the nonstockpile chemical materiel required by the convention within the required time frames. Programmatic costs are associated with more than one disposal project or program category. For example, the portion of management and personnel costs that support more than one project is considered programmatic costs. Also, estimated costs to procure and test equipment to be used at more than one site are included in the programmatic cost estimate. The Army also reported that it would cost $16.6 billion ($12.04 billion in direct disposal costs and $4.56 billion in programmatic costs) to recover and destroy, primarily by incineration and neutralization, buried chemical materiel within 40 years. These estimates are considered rough order of magnitude estimates, typically used when a program is not fully developed. According to program officials, the Army plans to issue a supplement to its 1993 survey and analysis report, which will include revised cost and schedule estimates, in mid-1995. Appendix II describes the Army\u2019s nonstockpile chemical warfare materiel.", "The Army Chemical Demilitarization and Remediation Activity, formerly named the Army Chemical Materiel Destruction Agency, is responsible for storing, transporting, and disposing of nonstockpile chemical warfare materiel.

However, because of uncertainties about the nature and magnitude of the materiel or the disposal methods to be used, the Army recognizes that its $17.7-billion cost estimate for the nonstockpile disposal program cannot be relied on for budget purposes. Appendix IV lists the disposal methods used by the Army to develop its program cost and schedule estimates.", "Whenever possible, the Army plans to dispose of nonstockpile chemical materiel on-site. However, there may be occasions when it is not feasible or practical for the Army to do so, and transportation to another disposal location may be required. Factors the Army intends to consider are population proximity and density, chemical weapon type, condition of the munitions, and public safety and environmental policy.

According to Army officials, the chemical elements in binary weapons are not lethal agents until they are combined during flight to a target; therefore, handling and disposing of the chemical elements and components should not pose any major problems.

Available records indicate that some burial sites may still contain active chemical agents and explosives; therefore, they pose a threat to human health and the environment.", "According to Army officials, the lack of knowledge about buried chemical warfare materiel has created considerable difficulty in selecting appropriate disposal methods. The Army has conducted various analyses, including comprehensive documentation surveys, site visits, and interviews, to identify potential burial sites. Even at well-documented sites, the actual amount, chemical agent, condition, and type of buried materiel will remain relatively unknown prior to excavation and visual identification. Based on preliminary analyses, the Army has identified potential chemical warfare materiel at 215 burial sites in 33 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington, D.C. (See fig. 1.) The Army has determined that 30 of the 215 potential burial sites warrant no further remediation activity.

Prior to excavation, the Army will conduct soil samples and metal detection surveys as well as install monitoring wells to estimate the nature and extent of contamination and develop remedial alternatives. The Army could excavate by hand, which has been frequently used in the past. It is also studying the use of robotics in excavating buried materiel, although acceptable technology is not readily available. According to Army officials, mechanical means are more likely to cause a chemical release or detonation. The actual excavation method for recovering buried chemical warfare materiel cannot be selected until the Army completes further technical and environmental studies and the public has been involved in the Army\u2019s selection.", "The Army estimates that it will cost $12.04 billion, plus $4.56 billion in programmatic costs, and take 40 years to recover and dispose of the buried chemical materiel. It included the estimated costs (1) of fixed incinerators for three of the four large burial sites, (2) for capping the remaining large site, and (3) of transportable incineration and neutralization systems for small sites. The transportable incineration and neutralization systems, when developed, will comply with safety and environmental requirements and be capable of moving or being moved from one disposal site to another.

In the 1990s, we reported that the Army did not adequately anticipate and plan for (1) the time needed to obtain the necessary environmental approvals and permits for the stockpile disposal program and (2) the strong public opposition to the chemical weapons incineration process. Further, we reported that the stockpile program had been delayed by design, equipment, and construction problems at the new disposal facility at Johnston Atoll.

However, lessons learned were not discussed in the Army\u2019s 1993 survey and analysis report on the nonstockpile program.

Under the act, the Environmental Protection Agency may authorize individual states to administer and enforce hazardous waste programs in lieu of the federal program. The act also allows states to establish requirements more stringent than federal standards. For example, the states of Kentucky and Indiana enacted legislation that require the Army to demonstrate the absence of any acute or chronic health or environmental effects from incineration of chemical weapons before an environmental permit will be granted. There are miscellaneous chemical warfare materiel, former chemical weapon production facilities, and five potential burial sites located in these states.", "The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act provides overall cleanup procedures for nonstockpile sites and incorporates the standards of other federal and state statutes if they are applicable or relevant and appropriate to the cleanup process.
