During this period the average number of physicians per 100,000 people increased from 214 to 239 and the mix of generalists and specialists in the national physician workforce remained about one-third generalists and two-thirds specialists. Growth in physician supply per 100,000 people between 1991 and 2001 was seen in historically high-supply metropolitan areas as well as low-supply statewide nonmetropolitan areas. Between 1991 and 2001, all statewide nonmetropolitan areas and 301 out of the 318 metropolitan areas gained physicians per 100,000 people. Of those 17 metropolitan areas that experienced declines in the number of physicians per 100,000 people, only 2 had fewer total physicians in 2001 than 1991. Overall, nonmetropolitan areas experienced higher proportional growth in physicians per 100,000 people than metropolitan areas, but the disparity in the supply of physicians per 100,000 people between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas persisted. Nonmetropolitan counties with a large town (10,000 to 49,999 residents) had the biggest increase in physicians per 100,000 people of all county categories but their supplies per 100,000 people were still less than large and small metropolitan counties' supplies in 1991 and 2001.

Several federal programs provide funding to train physicians and encourage physicians to work in underserved areas. Other programs  attempt to encourage physicians to train as general or primary care  practitioners rather than specialists.", "In anticipation of the reauthorization of several programs administered by  the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) that fund  physician education and encourage physicians to practice primary care in underserved areas, you asked us to provide information on the physician supply in the United States. We are providing information on (1) the  national physician supply, supply per 100,000 people, and the generalist  and specialist mix in 1991 and 2001 and (2) changes from 1991 to 2001 in  physician supply, supply per 100,000 people, and the geographic  distribution of that supply in metropolitan and statewide nonmetropolitan  areas.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed physician supply data from 1991  and 2001 for the nation, 318 individual metropolitan areas, 48 statewide  nonmetropolitan areas, and county categories. To provide information on  the physician workforce and its generalist-specialist mix, we analyzed  data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile  and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) Physician Masterfile. We  used data from the Census Bureau for resident population estimates based  on the 2000 Census. We aggregated county-level information to  metropolitan and statewide nonmetropolitan areas. We used urban  influence codes, a county categorization system developed by researchers  with the Economic Research Service in the Department of Agriculture, to  categorize metropolitan counties according to the size of the metropolitan  area and nonmetropolitan counties according to the size of the county\u2019s  largest city and proximity to metropolitan areas. We also reviewed  relevant literature and interviewed experts on the U.S. physician  workforce. For more information on our scope and methodology see  appendix I. We performed our work from April through October 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["From the 1950s until the early 1970s, concerns about physician shortages  prompted measures by the federal and state governments to increase  physician supply. Federal and state governments supported the growth in  the physician population by providing funds for constructing medical  schools and increasing medical school class sizes, offering loans and  scholarships to medical students, and paying hospitals through Medicare  to subsidize residency training costs. Concurrent with these initiatives, the  total physician supply and per-capita supply increased in the United  States.", "By the 1980s and through the 1990s, however, concerns were raised about  the adequacy of the physician supply. A 1981 study by the Graduate  Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) and a series  of reports from 1992 to 1999 by the Council on Graduate Medical  Education (COGME) forecast a national physician surplus. COGME  based these estimates on its determination that the appropriate target for  physician supply ranged from 145 to 185 physicians per 100,000 people.  These estimates were predicated in part on the belief that managed care,  with its emphasis on preventive care and reliance on primary care  gatekeepers exercising tight control over access to specialists, would  become a more typical health care delivery model. COGME and others  have noted that managed care has not become as dominant as predicted.  By 2000, some research concluded that physician supply increased even  more than these studies predicted. Some researchers, however,  questioned whether there was a national surplus of physicians.", "A report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) describes why studies of the  physician workforce vary. According to the IOM report, disagreement  about the adequacy of physician supply arises because there is no single  accepted approach to estimating physician supply or demand. Varying  assumptions related to factors that may affect future supply or demand  can lead to different conclusions about the adequacy of future physician  supply. Projecting future physician supply depends on the approach used  to count physicians, measure their productivity, and estimate the rate of  entrance into and exit from the profession. Estimating demand for  physicians\u2019 services requires even more assumptions. Demand for  physicians\u2019 services can be estimated using current and projected service  utilization patterns or by determining an ideal level of care to treat the  projected incidence and prevalence of illness among the population. In  addition, physician practice patterns, the use of new technology, the  supply and role of nonphysician providers, and rates and levels of  insurance coverage also affect estimates of the demand for and supply of  physicians\u2019 services.", "In spite of the difficulty of determining whether the overall number of  physicians is indeed the right number, there is little disagreement that  physicians have been located disproportionately in metropolitan areas  relative to the U.S. population. Geographic disparities in physician supply  have persisted even as the national physician supply has increased  steadily. Economic factors and professional preferences have all been  offered as evidence to explain why physicians, and specialists in  particular, locate in metropolitan areas. For example, physicians depend  on the availability of hospitals, laboratories, and other technology, and  metropolitan areas tend to have more of these facilities and equipment  than nonmetropolitan areas. Small nonmetropolitan areas generally lack a  large enough population or hospital resources to support a specialty  practice, because specialists handle less prevalent but more complicated  illnesses and require more specialized support facilities and technology.", "To influence overall physician supply and address perceived physician  shortages in certain areas, several federal programs fund efforts to address  these issues. The bulk of federal dollars to support physician education is  through Medicare\u2019s graduate medical education (GME) payments to  teaching hospitals, which totaled an estimated $7.8 billion in 2000, the  latest year for which data were available. These GME payments are  distributed based on the number of physicians being trained and  Medicare\u2019s share of patient days in the hospital. Medicare also pays  physicians a 10 percent bonus above the usual payment amount for  services they provide to beneficiaries in health professional shortage areas  (HPSAs). These Medicare Incentive Payments totaled $104 million in  2002.", "Programs intended to encourage health professionals to practice in  underserved areas and to support the training and education of health  professionals are administered by HRSA, within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS). HRSA programs include the National Health  Service Corps (NHSC) and grant and loan support programs for health  professions education and training. Most of these programs address three  objectives of improving the distribution of health professionals in  underserved areas, increasing representation of minorities and individuals  from disadvantaged backgrounds in health professions, and increasing the  supply of health professionals. They also address other objectives such as  improving the quality of education and training. In fiscal year 2001,  spending for the NHSC was $70.8 million and spending for health  professions education and training programs was $266 million. Funds for  the NHSC and for health professions education and training programs  support a range of health professions including medicine.
