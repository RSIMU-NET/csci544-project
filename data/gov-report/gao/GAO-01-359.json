Individual grants fund specified activities for a fixed period of time, but may be amended to add more activities, time, or funding. According to EPA\u2019s automated grants information system, in fiscal year 1999, the agency awarded project grants totaling about $716 million. EPA has recognized the oversight and management of grants as a material weakness in its Fiscal Year 1997 Integrity Act Report to the President and Congress. In addition, audits by the EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) have disclosed improper use of funds by grantees. Grants are governed by regulations promulgated by EPA to ensure consistency and compliance with authorizing statutes and governmentwide administrative policies. Among other things, the regulations address grantee reporting requirements and allowable uses of grant funds. EPA regulations provide the agency authority to deviate from certain regulations on a case-by-case basis.

During fiscal year 1999, EPA awarded $1.8 billion for continuing environmental programs and $716 million for environmental projects\u2014the subject of this report. Grants are funded by EPA\u2019s headquarters offices, such as the Office of Research and Development and Office of Air and Radiation, and by EPA regional offices. The administration of these grants (from activities prior to the award though the closeout of completed or inactive grants) has been delegated to EPA\u2019s Grants Administration Division, and 10 regional Grants Management Offices.", "EPA carries out its\u2019 grant programs within the framework of the strategic goals and objectives contained in its strategic plan. The plan sets forth 10 goals with 41 objectives and 123 subobjectives that cover its major programs, such as those for clean air, clean water, and pesticides. For example, EPA\u2019s clean air goal has 4 objectives and 14 subobjectives. One of the four objectives is \u201cAttain National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone and Particulate Matter.\u201d This objective in turn has several subobjectives, including \u201cNational Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone.\u201d", "Once potential grantees submit their grant applications, EPA officials review them. If the grant application is approved, the grantee is awarded the grant and funds are made available for the purposes specified in the grant. In connection with the grant award, EPA\u2019s program office officials determine how the grant will support a particular strategic goal, objective, and subobjective. In fiscal year 1999, EPA began coding new grant awards by \u201cprogram result codes,\u201d which are aligned with goals, objectives, and subobjectives. Before 1999, EPA officials assigned \u201cprogram element codes\u201d to grant awards, which reflected the program and EPA office awarding the grant.", "EPA awards grants to organizations and individuals under regulations that establish uniform administrative requirements throughout the agency. The regulations cover a range of grant activities\u2014from those prior to the award through the closeout of completed or inactive grants\u2014and a variety of topics, such as grantee reporting requirements and allowable uses of grant funds. Particular regulations cover grants to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations (40 C.F.R. part 30), as well as assistance to state, local, and Indian tribal governments (40 C.F.R part 31). Other EPA regulations cover grants under specific programs, such as Superfund (40 C.F.R. part 35, subpart O), and specific types of assistance, such as fellowships (40 C.F.R. part 46).

These grants were provided for a wide range of activities supporting investigations, surveys, studies, and special purpose assistance in the areas of air and water quality, hazardous waste, toxic substances, and pesticides. These grants are also used for evaluating economic or social consequences related to environmental strategies and for other efforts to support EPA environmental programs. Finally, the grants are used to identify, develop, or demonstrate pollution control techniques or to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pollution. The following examples illustrate the variety of activities funded by these grants: In February 1999, EPA awarded a $10,000 grant to Monitor International, a nonprofit organization located in Annapolis, Maryland, to develop a feasibility study and action plan for a science and education center in Indonesia. In August 1999, EPA awarded a $1.5 million grant to the West  Virginia University Research Corporation, National Research Center for Coal and Energy. With the grant funds the center was to provide technical assistance, outreach, a library of databases, maintenance of a Web site, and publications on the design, implementation, and maintenance of alternative wastewater treatment and collection systems for small communities.   EPA awarded research project grants totaling $690.9 million.", "Generally, these grants were to fund laboratory and other research into a variety of environmental problems, such as air pollution and its impact on asthma. For example, EPA awarded a $4.6 million grant to the University of New Orleans in September 1999 for research and development on technical solutions to waste management problems faced by the academic, industrial, and governmental communities.", "EPA awarded about $408.8 million in grants to states and other government entities and to nonprofit organizations to conduct cleanup activities at specific hazardous waste sites and to implement the requirements of the Superfund program. For example, in September 1999, EPA awarded a $1.5 million grant to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to complete an investigation and study at a waste site in order to select a cleanup remedy for controlling the risks to human health and the environment.", "The Senior Environmental Employment program, for which EPA makes grants authorized by the Environmental Programs Assistance Act of 1984, accounted for approximately $199.1 million. Under this program, EPA awards cooperative agreements to organizations to enable individuals 55 or older to provide technical assistance to federal, state, or local environmental agencies for pollution prevention, abatement, and control projects. For example, in September 1999, EPA awarded a $1.3 million grant to the National Older Worker Career Center to provide general support to EPA\u2019s staff within the Office of Pesticides Program.", "EPA awarded $108.3 million in training grants to government, educational, and nonprofit entities, which provide environmental related training in a variety of topics.

The PRC code is entered into EPA\u2019s automated systems to record the obligation of funds under the goals. Because some grants fund a variety of activities, more than one PRC code may be designated for a particular grant.

The PRC indicated that the grant was to support the Results Act subobjective of working with states and tribes to ensure reporting consistency under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. In June 1999, EPA awarded a $2 million grant to the University of Missouri to conduct research on the economic, social, biological, physical, and ecological benefits of tree farming. The PRC indicated that the grant was to support the Results Act objective of promoting and implementing sector-based environmental management approaches that achieve superior environmental results at less cost than through conventional approaches. In August 1999, EPA awarded a $20,000 grant to the Urban Land Institute to conduct a conference on smart growth that was coded for Clean and Safe Water goal activities, such as watershed assessment and protection, coastal and marine protection, water quality criteria and standards, or Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico activities. In January 2000, EPA awarded a $228,000 grant to Michigan State University to examine public opinions regarding the value of wetland ecosystems. The PRC indicated that the grant was to support the Results Act subobjective of cleaning up contaminants that are associated with high-priority human health and environmental problems. In May 2000, EPA awarded a $64,000 grant to Science Services, a nonprofit organization located in Washington, D. C., for hosting an international science and engineering fair for high school students competing for monetary science awards. The PRC indicated that the grant was to support the Results Act goal of supporting research in global climate change. In June 2000, EPA awarded a $8,000 grant to Environmental Learning for Kids, Denver, Colorado to educate culturally diverse families about environmental issues; activities included overnight camping trips, and monthly outdoor workshops.

Deviations from regulations for 6 grants, made under EPA\u2019s Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program, were not determined on a case-by-case basis. The STAR fellowship grant program, which is administered by EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development (ORD), by design provides grants with greater dollar amounts and longer time periods than allowed by EPA\u2019s regulations. According to an EPA official, the STAR program, which began in 1995, is EPA\u2019s largest fellowship program in terms of dollars and number of fellowships. According to ORD officials, the program was designed to be consistent with other federal fellowship programs for scientists.", "STAR fellowship grants deviate from EPA\u2019s grant regulations governing fellowships in three ways:   While the regulations place a limit of $750 on grant funds that can be used to purchase books and supplies, STAR fellowship grants provide up to $5,000 for this purpose.", "The regulations limit fellowships to 1 year, while STAR fellowships provide up to two years for master degree students and up to 3 years for doctoral students.", "The regulations stipulate that grant funds may be used for purchasing books and supplies if provided directly to the student; however, STAR fellowship grants funds are used to directly pay the educational institution for these items.", "EPA does not track the number of deviations it makes. However, regulations require that the authority for each deviation must be documented in the appropriate grant file. The agency awarded 471 STAR fellowship grants in fiscal years 1996 through 1999, totaling $34.1 million in funding. EPA prepared and processed a request for deviation for each of these grants.", "ORD officials stated that they wanted the STAR fellowship program to parallel a National Science Foundation fellowship program, which authorizes greater funding levels and longer funding periods than allowed by EPA\u2019s regulations. They also stated that they thought providing payments for books and supplies directly to an institution would provide better stewardship and control over the funds and ensure funds were used for authorized purposes. The officials stated that, rather than amending the regulations solely for the STAR program, which it considered time- consuming and a low priority, they opted to use deviations in awarding the grants and currently do not have staff in place to work on amending the regulations. They acknowledged, however, that the regulations are outdated and should be reviewed for possible revision The other deviations we reviewed had been made on a case-by-case basis:   Eleven of these deviations involved EPA waiving a requirement that the grant budget date and the project period ending date coincide. For example, in January 1999, EPA amended a grant awarded in March 1997 to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management to provide an additional $200,000 for research in establishing an ambient air monitoring network for mercury deposition within New England. The project period and the budget period ending dates were changed from March 1999 to March 2001, deviating from EPA\u2019s regulations that require the budget period not exceed 2 years from the award date. EPA approved the deviation, allowing the grantee to expand the number of sampling sites to obtain a better measurement of the pollution problem.", "EPA made nine deviations that waived the grantee matching funding requirement for the grant. For example, in September 1999, EPA awarded a $4.6 million grant to the University of New Orleans to fund the University Urban Waste Management and Research Center, which provides research and technical assistance to cities with wet weather conditions typical of coastal areas. EPA waived the minimum 5- percent nonfederal matching share requirement for the university. However, this deviation proved unnecessary because the regulation requiring matching funds had been repealed in 1996.
