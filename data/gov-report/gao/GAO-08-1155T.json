Asthma is the third-most common cause of childhood hospitalization, resulting in $3.2 billion in treatment costs and 14 million lost school days annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1997, EPA created the Office of Children's Health and convened the Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee) to provide advice and recommendations to assist in developing regulations, guidance, and policies to address children's health. In April 1997, the President signed Executive Order 13045, creating an interagency Task Force to recommend federal strategies for protecting children. Our testimony is based on ongoing work on the extent to which EPA has used the Advisory Committee and addressed the committee's key recommendations. It also includes information about the Task Force.

Our analysis found that the Advisory Committee met more than 30 times and discussed a variety of environmental health issues with dozens of officials from EPA offices such as Pesticides and Toxic Substances, and Research and Development. However, we identified just three instances where EPA specifically asked the committee for recommendations and advice on regulations--most notably an October 1997 request that the committee identify five regulations or standards for EPA to re-evaluate in order to better protect children. In the absence of focus and direction from EPA, the Advisory Committee has taken the initiative to write more than 70 letters to the Administrator since 1998 containing hundreds of recommendations on a wide variety of children's health concerns. EPA has not addressed key recommendations from its Advisory Committee, particularly those in a major April 2007 letter and in recent letters advising EPA on proposed revisions to national air quality standards. The April 2007 letter, which marked the 10th anniversary of the Executive Order, provided recommendations in seven key areas. These included the need for EPA to eliminate environmental health disparities among low-income and minority children. While EPA generally responds to the Advisory Committee's letters, the agency has not fulfilled the Administrator's commitment in his response to the 10th anniversary letter to collaboratively review recommendations from the advisory committee. The Office of Children's Health had begun forming internal workgroups, but a new acting director stopped the process in late 2007 to hold individual meetings with EPA's assistant administrators, and the process remains stalled. We also analyzed EPA's responses to the committee's specific recommendations on three recently-considered EPA air quality standards--the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter, ozone, and lead--and we found that EPA either offered to consider the committee's recommendations as part of the public comment process or rejected them. The President's Task Force, which was authorized in April 1997, provided high-level interagency leadership and coordination on children's environmental health, but it expired in April 2005. According to the children's health experts with whom we spoke, the task force provided important leadership on initiatives such as the National Children's Study and the Healthy Schools Environmental Assessment Tool. The task force also developed federal strategies to address four threats to children--asthma, developmental disorders, cancer, and unintentional injuries. In 2003, the President ordered the task force to be extended by 2 years, but the order eliminated the provision for reassessing the task force. Since the task force's expiration, EPA no longer has a high-level infrastructure or mandate to coordinate federal strategies for children's environmental health and safety."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to appear here today to discuss our ongoing work regarding  the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) efforts to protect children  from environmental health risks such as pollution in the air, lead paint in  homes, pesticide residues on food, and treatment-resistant microbes in  drinking water.

For example, EPA has noted that  children may receive higher doses of environmental contaminants because  they spend more time close to the ground, touch their hands to their  mouths more often, and, in proportion to their body weight, breathe more  air, consume more food, and drink more water than adults. Contaminants  may also affect children disproportionately because they have unique  exposure pathways\u2014through the placenta and breast milk. Furthermore,  children are more vulnerable to contaminants than adults because of the  relative immaturity of their biochemical and physiological functions. For  example, air pollutants that would produce slight breathing difficulties in  adults may contribute to more serious breathing problems in young  children because of their smaller airways. Also, EPA has noted that  children have limited ability to communicate and urge action about  protecting their environment, so others must act on their behalf.", "The Children\u2019s Health Protection Advisory Committee, as a committee  chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act must follow broad  requirements for balance, independence and transparency. The  membership of the Advisory Committee includes a diverse range of  viewpoints from 29 individuals including researchers, academicians,  health care providers, environmentalists, children\u2019s advocates,  professionals, and government employees who advise EPA on regulations,  research, and communication issues relevant to children. The current  chairman of the Advisory Committee, only the second since the committee  began meeting in 1998, has been in place since 2003. As required under  FACA, a designated federal official from EPA\u2019s Office of Children\u2019s Health  oversees the Advisory Committee\u2019s activities, including approving meeting  agendas and attending all meetings.

According to the Advisory Committee\u2019s charter, the  committee is to send its letters to the EPA Administrator. In addition, the  Advisory Committee announces meetings ahead of time and gives notice  to interested parties about such meetings. The plenary sessions of  meetings are open to the public and EPA ensures that meeting minutes are  prepared and posted to their website.", "As shown in figure 1, the committee has directed the vast majority of its  letters to the EPA Administrator but periodically directs letters to other  EPA officials such as the Director of the Office of Research and  Development.", "According to the committee\u2019s operating procedures and principles, \u201call  recommendations must reflect the consensus of the committee and that in  achieving consensus, all relevant perspectives, interests and concerns of  committee members are reflected.\u201d To accomplish detailed reviews of  children\u2019s health issues in order to achieve consensus, the committee  typically forms a taskgroup from its members that meets separately with  staff from the Office of Children\u2019s Health.

Nonetheless, a senior-staff steering  committee continued to meet until 2005 to provide coordination and draft  strategies to address the threats to children\u2019s health.", "The President\u2019s Task Force identified four major environmental and safety  threats to children\u2014asthma, developmental disabilities (including lead  poisoning), cancer, and unintentional injuries, and it recommended  national strategies for each of them. The task force recognized that an  integrated solution was needed across the federal government to address  the complex interaction between a child\u2019s biology, behavior, and the  physical, chemical, biological, and social environment. According to the  children\u2019s health experts with whom we spoke, the task force provided  critical leadership on several important initiatives such as the National  Children\u2019s Study and the Healthy Schools Environments Assessment Tool  (Healthy SEAT). These national programs focus heavily on the  environmental influences on children, with the National Children\u2019s Study  examining the role of environmental factors on health and disease and  Healthy SEAT offering school districts a self assessment tool for  evaluating environment, safety and health hazards. In addition, the  departments and agencies that made up the task force partnered to  prepare a fiscal year 2001 interagency budget initiative to fund the task  force\u2019s initiatives in the four priority areas. The Secretary of Health and  Human Services and the Administrator of EPA submitted the request to  the Office of Management and Budget with the recommendation that it be  included as part of the President\u2019s budget request that year. Officials told  us that OMB\u2019s involvement helped ensure that adequate funds were  available to these agencies to address children\u2019s health.", "Since the task force\u2019s expiration, EPA and HHS no longer have a high-level  infrastructure or mandate to coordinate federal strategies for children\u2019s  environmental health and safety. According to the EPA staff and children\u2019s  health experts with whom we spoke, the task force could have helped the  federal government respond to the health and safety concerns that  prompted the 2007 recall of 45 million toys and children\u2019s products, 30  million of them from China. Furthermore, since the provision of the  executive order expired in 2005, the task force no longer reports the  results of its efforts to the President. Those reports collected and detailed  the interagency research, data, and other information necessary to  enhance the country\u2019s ability to understand, analyze, and respond to  environmental health risks to children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In 1997, the President issued an executive order on Protection of Children  from Environmental Health and Safety Risks calling on federal agencies to  work together to protect children\u2019s health from environmental risk. In the  same year, EPA established an Office of Children\u2019s Health Protection and  formed its Children\u2019s Health Protection Advisory Committee. In the  intervening decade, we have seen a number of successful efforts to  strengthen environmental protections for children, including the landmark  Food Quality Protection Act, which provides protections from pesticides.  However, we also have seen growing evidence that children\u2019s  environmental experience before birth, early in life, and through  adolescence may have lifelong consequences and may affect subsequent  generations.", "EPA\u2019s Advisory Committee and others have recently raised concerns that  the agency\u2019s focus on children\u2019s environmental health has diminished  since the executive order was signed. Based on our review of EPA\u2019s use of  the Advisory Committee and the agency\u2019s general unresponsiveness to the  committee\u2019s key recommendations, coupled with the expiration of the  President\u2019s Task Force, we believe the agency needs to reinvigorate its  focus and leadership on children\u2019s environmental health in order to meet  current and emerging challenges facing the nation\u2019s children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To honor the Administrator\u2019s commitment to the Children\u2019s Health  Protection Advisory Committee, we are recommending that the Office of  Children\u2019s Health Protection expeditiously complete the cross-agency  process to review the committee\u2019s key recommendations. We are further  recommending that the Administrator examine ways to more proactively  use the committee to reinvigorate its focus on protecting children\u2019s  environmental health.", "Madam Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
