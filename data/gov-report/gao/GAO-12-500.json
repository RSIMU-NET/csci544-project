FDA meets its performance goals by completing its review and issuing an action letter\u0097such as an approval or a response detailing deficiencies that are preventing the application from being approved\u0097for a specified percentage of applications within a designated period of time. FDA designates NDAs and BLAs as either priority\u0097if the product would provide significant therapeutic benefits when compared to available drugs\u0097or standard.

The percentage of priority efficacy supplements receiving an approval letter at the end of the first review cycle fluctuated from FY 2000 through FY 2010, ranging between 47 percent and 80 percent during this time.

The most commonly mentioned issues raised by industry and consumer advocacy stakeholder groups were actions or requirements that can increase review times (such as taking more than one cycle to approve applications) and insufficient communication between FDA and stakeholders throughout the review process. Industry stakeholders also noted a perceived lack of predictability and consistency in reviews. Consumer advocacy group stakeholders noted issues related to inadequate assurance of the safety and effectiveness of approved drugs. FDA is taking steps that may address many of these issues, including issuing new guidance, establishing new communication-related performance goals, training staff, and enhancing scientific decision making.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS generally agreed with GAO\u0092s findings and noted that they reflect what the agency reported for the same time period.

Additionally, both  industry stakeholders and two consumer advocacy group stakeholders  noted that after sponsors submit their applications, insufficient  communication from FDA prevents sponsors from learning about  deficiencies in their applications early in FDA\u2019s review process. According  to these four stakeholders, if FDA communicated these deficiencies  earlier in the process, sponsors would have more time to address them;  this would increase the likelihood of first-cycle approvals.

FDA is in the  process of reviewing its regulations to identify burdensome, unclear,  obsolete, ineffective, or inefficient regulations and is soliciting stakeholder  input on additional rules that could be improved.

Additionally, under the draft user fee  agreement, FDA would inform sponsors of the planned review timeline  and any substantive review issues identified thus far within 74 days of  receipt for 90 percent of original NDAs, BLAs, and efficacy supplements.  FDA would also issue guidance, develop a dedicated drug development  training staff, and provide training on communication for all CDER staff  involved in the review of investigational new drugs.increase its utilization of patient representatives as consultants to provide  patient views early in the product development process and to ensure  those perspectives are considered in regulatory discussions.
