The  military may face increased competition for qualified people over the next  few years because of continued increases in the number of high school  graduates going on to college and labor shortages projected through at  least 2010. The U.S. Department of Education projects that the number of  high school graduates will increase by 11 percent by 2010-2011, and  enrollment in degree-granting institutions is predicted to increase  20 percent by 2011.

Research has shown  that family satisfaction with military life can influence a service member\u2019s  decision whether to remain in the military. Consequently, Congress has  authorized, and DOD instituted, a number of services to support military  families. The Military Family Act of 1985 established a spousal employment  assistance program. In 1989, Congress directed DOD to establish a  relocation assistance program. In 1992, DOD established guidance for  implementing, overseeing, staffing, and funding family support centers at  installations to deliver programs such as personal financial management  training, employment assistance, relocation assistance, deployment  assistance, and child and spouse abuse prevention programs.", "Health care benefits for military families have also been enhanced. For  example, Congress recently eliminated most copayments for active duty  families enrolled in DOD\u2019s managed health care program and extended  benefits for dependents living with a member of the uniformed services in  remote areas. In the area of education, Congress authorized DOD in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 to grant reenlisting  service members who possess critical skills the option to transfer a portion  of their educational assistance benefits to their spouse and dependents.  With respect to child care, DOD has made progress improving the quality,  availability, and affordability of military child care. DOD is working to  expand capacity to meet a range of child care needs, including initiatives to  extend care hours, subsidize the cost of obtaining child care at commercial  centers, offer cash incentives to increase the number of family child care  providers, and construct additional child development centers on  installations. Lastly, DOD has identified a need to reach out to the  two-thirds of military personnel and their families who reside off of  installations, to make them aware of their benefits, and to deliver services  to them. One approach DOD is taking is to increase its use of the Internet  by adding information and transactional features to Web sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Further Improve Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Although a number of family-friendly benefits are available to active duty  service members, opportunities exist to improve current benefits in this  area that could aid in the retention of military personnel.

Many service  members are in dual-income households, with spouses contributing on  average about 25 percent of the family\u2019s income. In 1999, 48 percent of  officers\u2019 spouses and 55 percent of enlisted members\u2019 spouses were  employed in the civilian labor force, while 7 percent of officers\u2019 spouses  and 8 percent of enlisted members\u2019 spouses were unemployed and  seeking work.", "Many working spouses are underemployed. According to a 2002 DOD  study, the spouses of military service members earn an average of 24 to  30 percent less than their civilian counterparts. In part, this wage  differential, which increases for those with higher levels of education, is  due to local labor market conditions. Some installations are located in  remote areas characterized by relatively poor labor market conditions.  Military spouses face several other employment challenges, such as  frequent relocations that make it difficult to sustain a career and accrue  retirement benefits. The families of junior enlisted personnel face  particular financial difficulties as the result of housing and transportation  costs, the high cost of credit, and child care expenses. The income that  spouses earn can help to mitigate some of these problems. DOD believes  spouse employment is necessary for many military families to meet basic  family expenses.", "In the last few years, DOD has taken a number of steps to enhance its  spousal employment assistance program, which has been in existence  since 1985. DOD held a \u201cspouse employment summit\u201d in 2000 to identify  needed actions. DOD is now focusing on establishing partnerships with  private-sector employers who can offer jobs with \u201cportable tenure,\u201d which  enables spouses to relocate and stay with the same employer. Other efforts  include expanding employment preference for spouses working in Europe  and establishing partnerships with federal agencies to increase private- sector career opportunities. For example, DOD is developing a partnership  with the Department of Labor to resolve issues such as the different state  residency and licensing requirements for jobs in teaching, nursing, and  child care. DOD is seeking Labor\u2019s assistance to help spouses who work in  these fields overcome employment barriers when they relocate. The Navy  and the Marine Corps have also launched a partnership with a civilian  employment services firm at two installations. These initiatives are in the  early stages of development. As a result, it is too early to gauge their  effectiveness in promoting spousal employment.", "At installations, DOD offers services to help active duty military spouses  find civilian jobs. Services include job searching and career planning, skills  assessments, training to facilitate entrance into the workforce, resume  writing, interviewing, and networking. Neither DOD nor the services have  systematically tracked demand for employment assistance at installations  or developed outcome oriented performance measures to help evaluate  which of these kinds of services provided by installations contribute most  effectively to spousal employment. DOD\u2019s Social Compact proposed a  number of metrics to measure spousal employment and to assess progress  made in meeting the goals of the spousal employment assistance program.  Some of the proposed measures would track changes in spousal  employment, the percentage of federal and DOD jobs filled by military  spouses, and the extent to which services and policies are standardized.  These proposed measures would enable DOD to collect useful information  on spousal employment issues. However, none of them would track the  extent that spouses use the program or gauge the effectiveness of the  services offered (such as career counseling, interviewing, and training) in  helping spouses find jobs appropriate to their knowledge, skills, and  abilities. As a result, DOD cannot determine which services offered through  its spousal employment assistance program are most effective in achieving  programmatic goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extended Time Off for New Parents", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s Social Compact, the department\u2019s strategic human capital plan for  quality-of-life issues, states that retaining personnel is essential to building  and sustaining DOD\u2019s highly skilled workforce. It further states that  lifestyle values of American workers from which the department draws are  changing: People want more time for themselves and their families, and  they want more time at home. Wise employers are selectively adopting new  practices to strengthen their relationship with the workers they want to  keep, the Social Compact states. In this regard, a benefit that offers the  potential for helping the department retain trained, experienced personnel  is extended time off for new parents. Up to 10 percent of active duty female  service members become pregnant each year, and there were about  75,000 military children under age 1 as of March 2001. While new military  mothers and fathers may take time off after the birth of a child, the military  does not offer extended time off to new parents. New mothers may take  6 weeks of paid convalescent leave, which is similar to sick leave in the  private sector. Both new mothers and new fathers may also use annual  leave. The services stated that they do not track information concerning  the number of women who separate from active duty service because of  parental responsibilities. We previously reported that of the 28,353 women  without prior military service who enlisted in fiscal year 1993, 2,074  separated because of pregnancy between the 7th and 48th month of  enlistment. Another 706 separated because of parenthood. These  separations accounted for more than one-third of the attrition for female  enlistees who joined the services in 1993. Replacing trained, experienced  personnel who leave is expensive. DOD estimated for fiscal year 1998 that  it had spent $35,000 per enlistee by the time enlistees had been recruited  and trained for 6 months.", "The U.S. Coast Guard\u2014which is part of the Department of Transportation  in peacetime but operates under the Navy during wartime\u2014has offered  extended time off for new parents since the early 1990s. The agency\u2019s  \u201ccare of newborn children\u201d program permits eligible officers and enlisted  personnel to separate from active duty for a period of up to 2 years.  During the separation period, members do not receive pay and benefits, but  they may elect to join the Coast Guard Reserve and receive reserve pay and  benefits. Upon completion of their separation period, the members are  guaranteed reappointment to active duty at the same grade or rate they  held when they left. Although the program was originally aimed at retaining  women, other factors such as the emergence of dual-income and single- parent families, as well as other economic and cultural changes, created  the need for enhanced family care opportunities for both men and women.  Of 244 service members separated under the program as of June 1999, 133  were women and 111 were men. The Coast Guard found that 47 percent of  members who had separated under the program had returned to active  duty when their separation period ended.", "In comparison, private-sector employers with more than 50 employees are  required by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to allow their  employees to take 12 weeks of unpaid leave to meet family obligations,  such as maternity or paternity leave, adoptions, and care for a spouse,  child, or parent with serious health conditions. The act, which also covers  federal government civilians but not military personnel, does not require  private-sector employers to provide paid time off. Paid maternity and  paternity leave in the private sector appears to be rare. In 1997, only  2 percent of employees had access to paid family leave programs,  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of the nine private-sector  companies we contacted, one allowed employees to take up to 3 years of  unpaid leave after the birth of a child and to return to a comparable  position. Another company gave mothers 12 weeks paid leave with the  option to take additional unpaid time off. If she returned within 6 months,  the company guaranteed her position; if she returned after 1 year, the  company guaranteed employment, but not the same position."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Offers Wide Array of Benefits for Active Duty Service Members", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our analysis, we found no significant gaps between the  types of benefits offered to active duty service members as part of the  military\u2019s benefit package and those offered by private-sector employers.  Most important, DOD offers all four of the core benefits that are offered by  most private-sector firms. These benefits are retirement, health care, life  insurance, and paid time off. As shown on the following page in figure 2,  DOD also offers a wide array of additional benefits. (See app. III for a  description of selected military benefits.) Many private-sector firms offer  additional employee benefits as well.", "On the basis of our prior work on military compensation and  DOD\u2019s compensation studies, we have noted several difficulties in  making direct comparisons between military and private-sector benefits.  Such comparisons must account for (1) the demands of military service,  such as involuntary relocation, frequent and lengthy separations from  family, and liability for combat; (2) certain principles of military  compensation that are absent in the private sector, such as the principle  that military compensation must work equally well during peace or war;  (3) the difficulty in identifying appropriate private-sector industries and  jobs to use as benchmarks for the military; (4) difficulties associated with  measuring the value of employee benefits; and (5) military personnel  practices\u2014such as hiring primarily at the entry level and \u201cup or out\u201d  rules\u2014that are uncommon in the private sector.", "For these reasons, we did not make direct analytical comparisons  between individual benefits offered by the military and those offered by the  private sector. For instance, we did not attempt to determine whether the  military retirement system is based on certain criteria, more or less  lucrative than private-sector pension plans. However, we sought to identify  the types of benefits found in the private sector\u2014both traditional and  emerging benefits\u2014and used this information to determine whether there  are potential gaps in the benefit package offered to active duty  service members.", "The shaded areas of the figure indicate those benefits that are typically considered core benefits in the  private sector.", "This chart is not a comprehensive listing of all benefits offered to active duty military personnel.", "Private-sector employers take a great variety of approaches when  designing their benefit package. Even so, three thematic trends have  become evident over the last decade or two. Specifically, private-sector  companies are (1) offering a growing number and array of benefits\u2014such  as long-term care insurance, convenience benefits, and elder care  assistance\u2014while also making changes to their traditional core benefits;  (2) introducing more flexibility in their benefit packages; and (3) adding  benefits to help employees balance work and life responsibilities. (See  app. IV for information on trends in specific benefits offered by private- sector firms.) While private-sector firms use pay and benefits packages to  attract and retain employees, they are also concerned about controlling  costs. Employers increasingly are sharing a growing portion of benefit  costs with employees, particularly health care costs, while requiring them  to assume more responsibility for managing their benefits. Some employers  have reduced certain benefits or ceased to sponsor coverage. We recently  testified that the availability of employer-sponsored retiree health benefits  eroded during the late 1990s and that rising cost pressures on employers  may lead to further erosion of these benefits.", "Like the military, the private sector also has reacted to demographic  changes in the workforce. Since the 1970s, the American workforce has  become more educated, more heterogeneous, and older. The numbers of  dual-earner families, working women, and single parents have increased.  Employers have reacted by offering benefits aimed at helping employees  balance work and life demands. Since the 1980s, employers have begun  offering benefits such as dependent care assistance, parental leave, flexible  work schedules, and convenience services such as on-site credit unions  and cafeterias and health promotion programs. Flexible schedules that  allow employees to adjust the beginning and ending of their work day,  work more hours per day but shorter weeks, or share a job with another  part-time employee are some of the ways that employers help employees to  manage their work and family responsibilities. Flexible benefit plans also  help employees by allowing them to select additional benefits that may  help balance work-life priorities.", "Our work comparing the military\u2019s overall benefit package with the array of  benefits in the private sector showed that several military benefits have  their analogues or counterparts in the private sector. As we noted earlier,  the military offers benefits in the four core areas; however, the military may  structure its benefits differently. For example, whereas the military  retirement system requires 20 years of service to be vested, private-sector  firms typically have much shorter vesting periods or no vesting period at  all. However, military personnel can begin receiving retirement pay and  benefits as soon as they attain 20 years of service and retire from active  duty, but private-sector employees typically must wait until at least age 55.  The military\u2019s health care benefit (TRICARE) is provided to service  members and their families through a network of more than 500 military  treatment facilities, supplemented by civilian providers. The cost of this  care to service members and their dependents is nil or minimal. Active duty  service members and their families enrolled in TRICARE Prime do not pay  enrollment fees, annual deductibles, or copayments. Family members who  use TRICARE Extra pay no enrollment fees but are responsible for annual  deductibles and cost shares of 15 percent. Family members who use  TRICARE Standard also do not pay enrollment fees. However, they pay a  cost share of 20 percent plus the difference between the TRICARE  allowable charge and the doctor\u2019s charge. Private-sector firms, in contrast,  typically offer individual and family health care through private insurers  and normally require employees to share the cost burden. According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1999, medium and large private-sector  employers paid the full cost of health coverage for 25 percent of  participants with individual coverage and 15 percent of those with family  coverage. Of those participants required to contribute to their health  coverage, the average monthly cost was approximately $45 for individual  coverage and $151 for family coverage. In the core benefit area of life  insurance, DOD offers low-cost rates on group life insurance.", "Service members pay $20 a month for the maximum $250,000 coverage. In  2001, coverage was extended to members\u2019 spouses and eligible children.  Finally, in the core benefit area of paid time off, all service members  receive 30 days annual leave and may carry over as many as 60 days  accrued leave to the next year. The military offers numerous other forms of  paid leave for specific reasons.", "In some areas, the military offers benefits that would not normally be  available to civilians working for private-sector firms. For example, service  members and their dependents may obtain discount prices by shopping at  military commissaries (grocery stores) and exchanges (department stores).  They also have privileges to use an extensive array of community facilities  to include, among others, fitness centers, swimming pools, officer and  enlisted clubs, libraries, community centers, hobby shops, and golf  courses. Some private-sector firms offer amenities such as fitness centers  and company stores to their employees, but few, if any, can match the  breadth of facilities and programs available on a military installation. It also  would be rare to find private-sector firms offering, as the military does, free  housing or housing allowances to all of their employees.", "Military benefits, overall, have been enhanced in recent years. During the  1990s, some service members expressed concerns that their pay was falling  behind that in the private sector and that their benefits were eroding,  particularly their health care and retirement benefits. Such perceptions  were cited as one cause of the retention problems the military was  experiencing at that time. Congress subsequently enacted legislation to  increase military pay and enhance benefits. These efforts were aimed at  improving the financial well-being and quality of life of service members  and at addressing recruiting and retention problems. For example,  Congress approved across-the-board pay raises of 4.8 percent for  fiscal year 2000 and 3.7 percent for fiscal year 2001, along with targeted pay  raises to mid-level officers and enlisted personnel. For fiscal year 2002,  Congress approved pay raises ranging between 5 and 10 percent,  depending on pay grade and years of service. Major enhancements to  benefits included the restoration of retirement benefits that had been cut for military service members who entered military service on or  after August 1, 1986, and increases in the basic housing allowance to  reduce out-of-pocket housing expenses for service members not living in  military housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Many military spouses want to work, and many families need dual incomes  to meet basic expenses. However, frequent relocations associated with the  military lifestyle can hinder spousal employment and decrease satisfaction  with military life. The ability to assess the effectiveness of the employment  assistance service offered at military installations is one critical step in  developing this program. Doing so could enable DOD to better target  resources and tailor services to meet the employment assistance needs of  military spouses.", "As competition with the private sector for qualified personnel increases,  DOD must continue to explore and evaluate benefits that address  changing workforce demographics, help meet mission needs, and  positively impact recruitment and retention efforts. The majority of female  service members are in their childbearing years, and up to 10 percent of  servicewomen annually become pregnant while on active duty. In addition,  the emergence of dual-income and single-parent families has created a  need for enhanced family care opportunities and flexibility for both men  and women. The lack of extended time off for parents following the birth or  adoption of a child could be negatively impacting retention. Moreover,  replacing trained, experienced personnel who leave is expensive. Because  DOD does not track the number of service members who separate due to  parental responsibilities, the magnitude of this issue is unknown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness to  develop measures for tracking and assessing the effectiveness of  installation-level services offered through DOD\u2019s spousal employment  assistance program and  assess the feasibility, costs, and benefits of offering extended time off to  parents of newborn or adopted children as one way to increase  retention of trained, experienced personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with our  recommendation on tracking and assessing the effectiveness of  installation-level services offered through DOD\u2019s spousal employment  assistance program.
