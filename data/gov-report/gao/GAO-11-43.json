In a 2005 report, GAO recommended that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in its role overseeing governmentwide information security, take several steps to help agencies better secure their wireless networks. GAO was asked to update its prior report by (1) identifying leading practices and state-of-the-art technologies for deploying and monitoring secure wireless networks and (2) assessing agency efforts to secure wireless networks, including their vulnerability to attack. To do so, GAO reviewed publications, guidance, and other documentation and interviewed subject matter experts in wireless security.

Agencies have taken steps to secure their wireless networks, but more can be done to improve security and to limit vulnerability to attack. Specifically, application was inconsistent among the agencies for most of the following leading practices: (1) Most agencies developed policies to support federal guidelines and leading practices, but gaps existed, particularly with respect to dual-connected laptops and mobile devices taken on international travel. (2) All agencies required a risk-based approach for management of wireless technologies. (3) Many agencies used a decentralized structure for management of wireless, limiting the standardization that centralized management can provide. (4) The five agencies where GAO performed detailed testing generally securely configured wireless access points but had numerous weaknesses in laptop and smartphone configurations. (5) Most agencies were missing key elements related to wireless security in their security awareness training. (6) Twenty agencies required encryption, and eight of these agencies specified that a virtual private network must be used; four agencies did not require encryption for remote access. (7) Many agencies had insufficient practices for monitoring or conducting security assessments of their wireless networks. Existing governmentwide guidelines and oversight efforts do not fully address agency implementation of leading wireless security practices. Until agencies take steps to better implement these leading practices, and OMB takes steps to improve governmentwide oversight, wireless networks will remain at an increased vulnerability to attack."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the last several years, federal agencies have increasingly adopted the  use of wireless technologies.

In addition, agency employees  traveling with wireless-enabled devices may be able to connect to an  agency network via any one of the many public Internet access points or  hot spots. Installation can be easier and less costly because the network  can be established without having to pull cables through walls or ceilings  or modify the physical network infrastructure. Wireless networks can also  be easily scaled from small peer-to-peer networks to very large enterprise  networks. For example, an agency can greatly expand the size of its  wireless network and the number of users it can serve by increasing the  number of access points.

They can also detect  misconfigured WLAN clients, rogue access points, ad hoc networks, and  other possible violations of an organization\u2019s WLAN policy. In addition,  these systems can position an organization to proactively assess its  wireless network at regular intervals. However, a wireless intrusion  detection or prevention system is a significant expense, and it may not be  appropriate in all cases.

For each of these  agencies, we used a laptop equipped with an antenna that served as a  mobile scanning device and walked or drove around the perimeters of  publicly accessible areas of their headquarters facilities in the Washington,  D.C., area to collect data to determine wireless technologies that were  deployed in the buildings. We also conducted scans of multiple agency  facilities in another major metropolitan area outside of the Washington,  D.C., region. This area was chosen based on the following criteria:    contained regional offices for the multiple major federal agencies in  locations that were sufficiently dispersed to not have too many 802.11  signals within a narrow proximity; and    had several regional offices with additional field offices nearby.", "Based on the initial data collected from scans at the headquarters and field  locations, we chose 5 of the 24 agencies at which to complete additional  detailed wireless security testing, specifically, the Departments of  Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, and the  Social Security Administration. These agencies were selected based on  several criteria, including the amount of usage of wireless technologies,  the level of centralization of IT management, and potential security issues  revealed by the initial scan results. More in-depth testing at these agencies  included a review of the configurations of client devices, wireless  infrastructure, and monitoring practices. We inspected client devices to  determine if security controls had been implemented to protect the local  network. We also examined each agency\u2019s network infrastructure to  determine if access points were encrypted and configured to deny  unauthorized access. Finally, we determined if the agencies monitored the  IEEE 802.11 wireless spectrum.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 to November  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Lon Chin and Vijay D\u2019Souza  (Assistant Directors), Monica Anatalio, Mark Canter, William Cook, Neil  Doherty, Rebecca Eyler, Nancy Glover, Matthew Grote, Min Hyun, Javier  Irizarry, Franklin Jackson, Vernetta Marquis, Sean Mays, Lee McCracken,  and Michael Stevens made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
