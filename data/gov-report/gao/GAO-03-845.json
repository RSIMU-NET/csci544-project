GAO also concluded that FERC faced significant human capital challenges to transform its workforce to meet such changes. In responding to the report, FERC said that the new Office of Market Oversight and Investigations (OMOI) it was creating and human capital improvements under way would address these concerns. GAO was asked to report on FERC's progress in (1) establishing an oversight and enforcement capability for competitive energy markets and (2) improving agency-wide human capital management."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FERC has made strides in putting an energy market oversight and enforcement capability in place, but work remains to ensure that its efforts will be comprehensive and systematic. Since FERC declared OMOI functional in August 2002, the office has focused primarily on outlining its vision, mission, and primary functions; developing basic work processes; integrating its use of an array of tools to oversee the markets; and hiring staff with market experience. OMOI is also assessing its data needs and developing its working relationships with others, such as the industry's market monitoring units. Nonetheless, the office still has work to do in the following two key areas. Clearly defining its role: OMOI has not clearly defined its role and the activities that it will engage in to achieve its mission. For example, the office has not yet decided on the level of detail at which it will review electricity markets. This decision has substantial implications for the office's data, technology, resource, and staff skill mix needs. Developing formal processes and written procedures: OMOI's processes are largely informal and ad hoc, and it has few written procedures to ensure that its efforts are coordinated, systematic, understood by its staff, and transparent to its stakeholders. Although OMOI has had some early accomplishments--such as a $20 million civil penalty against a company for anticompetitive behavior--it is difficult to judge how effective the office will be until its role and major processes are clearly set out. FERC is also making progress toward addressing its considerable human capital management challenges, but additional actions could increase its likelihood of success. FERC's success in these efforts is important because the extent to which it can carry out its mission in a changing environment depends on its ability to adjust its staff skills and abilities in a difficult context. For example, over half of its workforce will be eligible to retire by 2007. In response, FERC has, among other things, expanded its use of certain personnel flexibilities, such as recruiting and retention bonuses, and is considering use of additional flexibilities. More importantly, FERC, in February 2003, developed a human capital plan. However, the plan does not contain some elements key to successful implementation, including (1) details on specific activities and resources needed to implement its human capital initiatives and (2) results-oriented measures that can be used to track the agency's progress in implementing the initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness. FERC also has not established time frames for many of its human capital initiatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. electricity and natural gas industries\u2019 transition to competitive  markets has not been smooth. Volatile prices, energy shortages, financial  difficulties such as the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation (the nation\u2019s  largest energy trading company before its financial problems), and  accusations of price manipulation have raised questions about the  transition to competitive markets and the federal government\u2019s ability to  regulate and oversee these new markets to protect market participants and  consumers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)\u2014the  federal agency primarily responsible for regulating and overseeing these  industries\u2014will play an important role in developing competitive  wholesale markets and in protecting consumers against market abuses.", "In June 2002, we reported that FERC had not yet adequately revised its  regulatory and oversight approach to respond to the transition to  competitive energy markets. We also pointed out that FERC faced  significant human capital and organizational structure challenges as it  transformed its workforce to effectively regulate and oversee these  evolving markets. For example, we noted that the agency did not have  enough staff with knowledge of competitive energy markets, and that its  market oversight function was too dispersed across the agency. In addition,  we noted that FERC was attempting to regulate and oversee the markets  with outdated legal authorities that were mostly derived from laws enacted  when the industries were composed of highly regulated monopolies. We  made a number of recommendations to address these issues and improve  the agency\u2019s capability of overseeing competitive energy markets. FERC  agreed with our conclusions and said that the report\u2019s recommendations  were consistent with the agency\u2019s plans for its new Office of Market  Oversight and Investigations (OMOI) and human capital management  improvements.", "In response to concerns about its capability to oversee the evolving energy  markets, FERC announced, in January 2002, that it was creating OMOI. In  making the announcement, FERC stated that the new office would report  directly to the Chairman of FERC, and its functions would include  understanding energy markets and risk management issues, measuring  market performance, investigating compliance violations, and analyzing  market data. In April 2002, FERC hired the office\u2019s director, who began to  plan its operations and hire its staff. In August 2002, the FERC Chairman  declared that OMOI, with about half of its planned personnel in place, was  a formal, functioning office within the agency. This change in FERC\u2019s  approach to monitoring markets\u2014requiring a reassessment and  reprioritizing of how it does business\u2014will not be easy. Experience in  public and private organizations has shown that for an organization to  successfully \u201ctransform\u201d itself, it must often change its culture to be more  results oriented, collaborative, and customer focused.", "In light of FERC\u2019s stated commitment to and your interest in market  oversight, you asked us to assess FERC\u2019s progress in (1) establishing an  oversight and enforcement capability for competitive energy markets and  (2) improving agencywide human capital management. As agreed with your  office, we focused our review of FERC\u2019s market oversight and enforcement  efforts on OMOI\u2019s formation and operations. To respond to this request, we  reviewed appropriate plans, studies, reports, and other documents, such as  budget justifications, relating to OMOI\u2019s activities and FERC\u2019s human  capital management initiatives. We also interviewed OMOI\u2019s managers and  FERC officials responsible for agencywide human capital management  programs. In addition, we surveyed OMOI\u2019s employees to obtain their views  on the office\u2019s effectiveness, morale, and work environment. About 87  percent of the employees responded to our survey. Furthermore, we  contacted the heads of four units operating at the time of our review with  responsibility for monitoring regional wholesale electricity markets under  FERC\u2019s guidance to obtain their views on OMOI\u2019s progress in establishing  an oversight and enforcement capability for energy markets. We performed  our review from October 2002 through June 2003 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

A  range of federal, state, and local entities regulate different aspects of these  functions. While generation siting, intrastate transportation, and retail sales  are generally regulated by state or local entities, wholesale sales and  interstate transportation generally fall under federal regulation, primarily  by FERC. Under federal law, FERC is responsible for ensuring that the  terms, conditions, and rates for the interstate transportation of natural gas  and electricity, certain sales for resale of natural gas, and wholesale sales of  electricity in interstate commerce are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d Other federal  agencies also play an important role in regulating energy markets. For  example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates  commodity futures and options markets in the United States and protects  market participants against manipulation, abusive trade practices, and  fraud.", "For nearly a century, the natural gas and electricity industries were  regulated as natural monopolies and dominated by a relatively few, large  public utilities that produced, transported, and sold natural gas and  electricity to the ultimate users. This monopoly structure controlled the  entry, prices, and profits of industry participants. Under this regulatory  framework, FERC established individual utilities\u2019 terms, conditions, and  rates for transportation and wholesale sale of natural gas and electricity in  interstate commerce. To ensure that the rates these utilities charged were  just and reasonable, FERC based the rates on the utilities\u2019 cost to provide  the service plus a fair return on investment, which is generally referred to  as cost-of-service regulation.", "With technological, economic, and policy developments over the past two- to-three decades, these industries have undergone a transition\u2014commonly  known as \u201crestructuring\u201d\u2014from this highly regulated environment to one  that places greater reliance on competition to determine entry, prices, and  profits. Natural gas was first to make the shift, facilitated by passage of the  Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and subsequent FERC orders in 1985 and  1992 that opened pipeline transportation to all on equal terms and required  pipeline companies to completely separate or \u201cunbundle\u201d their  transportation, storage, and sales services. As a result, natural gas became  a commodity bought and sold separately from its transportation.", "The electricity industry has experienced similar restructuring, starting  about the same time but evolving more slowly than the natural gas industry.  The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act in 1978 introduced competition  by requiring electric utilities to buy electricity produced by nonutility,  electric power generators. Then in 1992, the Congress passed the Energy  Policy Act, authorizing FERC to require utilities, on a case-by-case basis, to  allow competitors to use their transmission lines for wholesale sales of  electricity. In 1996, FERC ordered that electric transmission systems be  opened to all qualified wholesale buyers and sellers of electric energy.", "FERC also required utilities to \u201cfunctionally unbundle\u201d their generation and  transmission businesses to prevent discriminatory practices, such as not  allowing competitors equal access to transmission lines. One option FERC  provided the utilities to help them achieve unbundling was to transfer  management of their transmission lines to an independent system operator  (ISO) that would manage the system without any special interests and for  all users\u2019 benefit. Since 1996, six ISOs have formed and are operating, each  with its own set of operating rules. Of these, four ISOs\u2014California; New  England; New York; Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland Interconnect  (PJM)\u2014operate interstate wholesale electricity markets in which  electricity suppliers and buyers submit bids to sell and buy power.", "In 1999, FERC issued an order encouraging all privately owned electric  utilities to voluntarily place their transmission facilities under the control  of a broader market entity called a regional transmission organization  (RTO). As a result, ISOs created under a previous FERC order would be  supplanted by larger RTOs, which would cover the entire nation. The  rationale behind FERC\u2019s approach to forming RTOs was that the nation\u2019s  transmission systems should be brought under regional control in order to  eliminate the remaining discriminatory practices in use, better meet the  increasing demands placed on the transmission system, improve  management of system congestion and reliability, and achieve fully  competitive wholesale power markets. FERC is in the process of trying to  establish these organizations to cover the continental United States and has  currently approved two RTOs\u2014Midwest ISO and PJM.", "In approving the formation and operation of ISOs and RTOs, FERC requires  these organizations to, among other things, establish market monitoring  units. These units are to provide for objective monitoring of the markets  operated by the ISO or RTO to identify market design flaws, market power  abuses, and opportunities for efficiency improvement. The market  monitoring units of four ISOs or RTOs\u2014California, New England, New  York, and PJM\u2014have been operating for several years under FERC\u2019s  approval. FERC has also approved a market monitoring unit for the  Midwest ISO, but Midwest does not currently operate a centralized power  market (it plans to do so by December 2003). FERC approves the units\u2019  market monitoring plans and requires the units to periodically report on  their monitoring activities.", "In July 2002, FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to provide a  standard market design for all electric transmission providers. FERC\u2019s  fundamental goal in this initiative is to create \u201cseamless\u201d wholesale  electricity markets, nationwide, that allow sellers to transact easily across  transmission boundaries and allow customers to receive the benefits of a  lower cost and more reliable electricity supply. Accordingly, FERC\u2019s  standard market design proposal contains a wide range of rules to  standardize the structure and operation of wholesale electricity markets  and transmission services. Among other things, it (1) describes the rules for  how a portion of the nation\u2019s electricity will be exchanged in organized  markets, (2) defines a new transmission service, and (3) establishes new  market power mitigation and monitoring requirements. The proposal has  been highly controversial. FERC estimates that the proposed standard  market design rule has generated about 1,000 sets of formal comments  reflecting concerns and reservations about the scope and details of the  proposal. In April 2003, FERC issued a white paper explaining how it  intends to change its proposal in response to the comments and concerns  that had been raised. When the white paper was issued, FERC expected the  final rule to be promulgated later in the year. However, in commenting on  our draft report, FERC said that it is planning to hold technical conferences  in different regions of the country this fall and has postponed the issuance  of any final rule.", "With the opening of pipelines and transmission lines, other energy  producers and marketers began to compete with the traditional utilities to  the point that a complex structure of formal and informal primary and  secondary energy markets has evolved. As competition has increased,  FERC has allowed more and more producers and marketers to sell their  energy at prices determined in the marketplace. This evolution to  competitive energy markets is requiring FERC to fundamentally change  how it does business. With the shift to market-based prices for natural gas  and electricity, FERC has concluded that its approach to ensuring just and  reasonable prices has to change: from one of reviewing individual  companies\u2019 rate requests and supporting cost data to one of proactively  monitoring energy markets to ensure that they are working well to produce  competitive prices. FERC established OMOI to coordinate and bring about  this shift in the agency\u2019s energy market oversight efforts. Like the agency\u2019s  other major offices, OMOI reports directly to the Chairman of FERC (see  fig. 1).", "OMOI has organized its staff into eight divisions, which are grouped into  three main units: (1) Market Oversight and Assessment, (2) Investigations  and Enforcement, and (3) Management and Communication (see shaded  area of fig. 1). The Market Oversight and Assessment unit performs a  variety of tasks related to monitoring energy markets, monitoring financial  markets, researching new data sources, publishing reports on market  surveillance, and assisting with ongoing investigations. The Investigations  and Enforcement unit performs a variety of tasks related to investigating  market abuse, conducting audits of entities under FERC\u2019s jurisdiction, and  manning the enforcement hotline. Finally, the Division of Management and  Communication and the OMOI director\u2019s office provide administrative and  management support.", "OMOI\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2003 is about $13.5 million and  provides funding for 110 staff years, which includes $500,000 in contracting  services.

Recognizing that  responsibility for making energy markets work well is shared with the  industries (including the ISOs and RTOs and their market monitoring  units), individual market participants, the states, other FERC offices, and  other federal agencies, it is important that OMOI clearly define its role in  achieving comprehensive oversight of the markets.

Statements in the proposed rule indicate that just and reasonable  prices are those produced by structurally competitive markets. However,  the statements do not define what a structurally competitive market is. In  addition, these statements concern the operations of market monitoring  units rather than FERC\u2019s own role and responsibilities. Furthermore, the  proposed rule has been highly controversial and may be substantially  delayed and/or modified.", "The heads of the market monitoring units told us they recognize the  difficulty of defining just and reasonable prices. They also said that they  believe FERC had made progress in doing so. However, they generally  believed that FERC had not yet gone far enough. For example, the head of  the California ISO\u2019s monitoring unit told us that for FERC to define what it  will consider just and reasonable prices in a competitive marketplace is  critical to achieving the Federal Power Act\u2019s goal. She stated that a clear  standard for just and reasonable is also critical to performing monitoring  and oversight functions, and, without such a standard, existing ISOs or  RTOs cannot move forward and other geographical areas will have no  confidence in ISOs or RTOs and will not wish to develop them. On the  other hand, the heads of the ISO New England, PJM, and New York ISO  monitoring units stated that FERC should not develop overly detailed or  prescriptive definitions that would reduce needed flexibility. The heads of  the PJM and ISO New England units said that FERC should instead develop  a strong policy statement or paper defining the term at a general or  theoretical level and leave it to the market monitoring units to  operationalize or put it into practice. Similarly, the head of the New York  ISO unit cautioned that, with overly prescriptive criteria, market  participants can structure behavior to avoid specific rules, conditions, or  definitions, while engaging in behavior that would not be deemed  acceptable. He added that, in orders that it has issued in individual cases,  FERC has established precedent that prices can be considered just and  reasonable when they are the product of workably competitive markets,  and determining whether a market is competitive requires some room for  considering individual circumstances.", "FERC officials, including OMOI managers, told us that they recognize the  importance of defining just and reasonable prices in a competitive energy  marketplace but are finding it difficult to do. For example, the Senior  Energy Policy Advisor to the Chairman of FERC told us that FERC has  been trying to define the term for several years. The Director of OMOI said  that OMOI has the operational responsibility to give guidance on just and  reasonable rates, but agreed that an important consideration for the agency  is the level of detail at which it needs to be defined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FERC Has Not Clearly Defined Market Power", "paragraphs": ["In its proposed standard market design rulemaking, FERC provides some  details on what it considers market power. In the proposed rule, FERC  states that market power is the ability to raise price above the competitive  level. The agency further states that identifying market power with  precision is difficult, both because it is difficult to identify the competitive  price (which should recover both fixed and variable costs over the long  run) and because it can be difficult to isolate the impact of one entity on  the competitive market. FERC adds that, in the proposed rule, it is  incorporating the concept of when to intervene in the markets, rather than  defining what constitutes market power. The market monitoring units  would review market data, such as bidding patterns, to identify and  intervene in market situations in which market power could be occurring.  In its April 2003 white paper explaining the changes it planned to make in  the final standard market design rule, FERC said that it would require the  ISOs and RTOs to have clear and enforceable rules to define and police  market manipulation and gaming strategies by market participants trying to  unduly exercise their market power. The white paper also said that the  ISOs and RTOs would be required to have a clear set of rules governing  market participant conduct with the consequences for violations clearly  spelled out. The white paper then provided areas of anticompetitive  behaviors\u2014such as physical and economic withholding of supplies\u2014that,  at a minimum, should be included.", "Again, the heads of the market monitoring units did not believe that FERC  had yet gone far enough in defining market power. The head of the  California ISO monitoring unit said that FERC needs to define what it will  consider market power, and that the definition must be agreed on in order  for FERC to perform its market development and oversight obligations.  She added that inappropriate or anticompetitive behavior need not be  defined through an exhaustive list of specific market behaviors but rather  through a general set of characteristics. According to the heads of the  market monitoring units of ISO New England and PJM RTO, FERC should  develop a policy statement or paper on market power rather than a highly  detailed definition. In contrast, the head of the NY ISO\u2019s market monitoring  unit stated that FERC needs to define what it will consider market power  only in the context of specific market monitoring proposals. He told us that  his market monitoring unit has been very successful in preventing market  power by using very specific tests for market power abuse, enabling the  unit to take appropriate action with minimal delay. He added that FERC  should not adopt generic definitions that would restrict the ability of the  New York ISO to implement the tests and market mitigation measures that  have been approved for its use.", "The Director of OMOI agreed that a clarifying definition of market power to  communicate the parameters of acceptable market behavior is needed. He  added that developing such a definition is complex, and his office has to be  careful in deciding what constitutes market power abuse because there is a  necessary element of judgment involved in determining what is and what is  not abuse in individual cases that should not be eliminated with a  definition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMOI Has Not Explicitly Set Out How It Will Integrate Its Work with That of Others", "paragraphs": ["An important OMOI function is to integrate its work with that of others  inside and outside of FERC who also have a role in market oversight or  who carry out related responsibilities.

The office is currently leading FERC\u2019s effort to establish a  standard market design for wholesale electricity markets. Thus, it is  important for the offices to work together so that OMOI can (1) better  understand the markets that are being created and that OMOI is to oversee  and (2) provide effective input from an oversight standpoint into  structuring the markets. In addition, OMOI officials told us that they share  oversight responsibility with other federal agencies\u2014particularly the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2014in areas where the financial and  futures markets overlap or affect the physical natural gas and electricity  markets. For example, OMOI officials stated that OMOI, along with the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice,  would be responsible for detecting the false reporting of natural gas prices  or volumes to index publishers (see app. III). Moreover, as we discuss later  in this report, OMOI is relying heavily on the market monitoring units to  oversee electricity markets.", "OMOI has various initiatives under way to build its working relationship  with these parties. However, because of the market monitoring units\u2019  substantial role in its market oversight approach, OMOI has devoted  considerable attention to improving its working relationship with these  units, and its efforts with respect to other FERC offices and other federal  agencies are in the early stages. For example, in responding to our survey,  about 50 percent of OMOI managers and staff expressed dissatisfaction  with communication with other FERC offices. (About 26 percent were  satisfied, about 14 percent were as equally satisfied as dissatisfied, and 10  percent had no basis to judge.) In providing more detailed responses,  several OMOI staff indicated that they thought communication and  cooperation between OMOI and FERC\u2019s Office of Markets, Tariffs, and  Rates was a problem. In addition, the head of a market monitoring unit told  us that he has had to inform OMOI staff about the issuance of orders  initiated in other FERC offices.", "The Director of OMOI told us that he understands these concerns about the  office\u2019s working relationship with other FERC offices. According to the  Director, OMOI wanted to first get its \u201cact together\u201d before reaching out to  the other offices. He added that OMOI has been working hard the past  couple of months with FERC\u2019s Office of Markets, Tariffs, and Rates and  Office of the General Counsel to establish more formal connections.", "OMOI officials told us that they plan to coordinate their work with other  federal agencies to better incorporate their knowledge and views about  related market activities. For example, the Director of OMOI\u2019s Division of  Financial Market Assessment told us that he would like to develop a formal  information-sharing arrangement with the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission so that OMOI has better access to financial information. He  said that while FERC has limited jurisdiction over financial markets, OMOI  wants to monitor these markets because the financial marketplace affects  the health of wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. According to  OMOI officials, they have regularly scheduled meetings with the Federal  Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to discuss overlapping  issues, specifically focusing on antitrust and market manipulation  practices.", "As we previously reported, events such as the collapse of the Enron  Corporation bring to light the importance of clarifying jurisdiction across  the federal government as restructuring progresses. As we pointed out,  effective coordination between FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission is particularly important because of jurisdictional  uncertainties regarding the oversight of on-line trading activities, such as  those previously operated by Enron. In the same way, we also noted that in  a Senate Governmental Affairs report and memorandum, and other  congressional hearings, both FERC and the Security and Exchange  Commission have been questioned about their lack of diligence in  following through on Enron\u2019s activities\u2014even though they had indications  of improper conduct. The report commented that effective coordination  between agencies prevents companies from exploiting the lack of oversight  in areas where neither agency may have taken full responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMOI Has Not Decided on the Level of Detail at Which It Will Review Market Transactions", "paragraphs": ["According to OMOI, its primary functions are to assess market  performance, ensure conformance with Commission rules, and produce  internal and external reports on the results. This description of its  functions is general and broad at this point. According to OMOI\u2019s Deputy  Director for Market Oversight and Assessment, as the office builds its  capability, it must decide at what level of detail it should monitor the  markets. This issue largely centers around whether OMOI should operate  at a high level\u2014that is, assess the markets\u2019 overall performance and major  outcomes, such as competitiveness, supply, and price, and leave the  detailed monitoring to the market monitoring units\u2014or \u201cget down in the  weeds\u201d to review market transactional data as market monitoring units do  for their individual markets. The Deputy Director anticipates that OMOI  will operate somewhere in between these two levels. The level at which  OMOI reviews the markets affects both the number and skill mix of the  staff that OMOI needs. For example, the head of the New York ISO\u2019s market  monitoring unit told us that, by the end of 2003, his unit will have 30 staff,  consisting of engineers, economists, business majors, analysts, and  information technologists, to cover the New York market alone. He  indicated that OMOI would need many more staff than this if it plans to  review the markets at the same level of detail on a national basis.", "The responses to our survey and our discussions with OMOI staff indicate  that opinions vary on this issue. In responding to our survey, 57 percent of  OMOI\u2019s managers and staff said that top management had clearly defined  what role OMOI will play in monitoring markets, while about 32 percent  disagreed. (The remaining 11 percent neither agreed nor disagreed.)  Additional comments provided for our survey indicate that agreement has  not been reached on how OMOI should carry out that role. Survey  respondents expressed concerns that OMOI was not reviewing and  analyzing market data in enough depth. For example, some OMOI staff said  that OMOI should be continuously reviewing market data on a real-time  basis to identify market power abuses. During our interviews, OMOI  managers also expressed different opinions about the issue.

On the other hand, another  division director told us said that he was not certain what the office\u2019s vision  for overseeing the markets will be, and that he was not sure if it has the  information technology capability to perform detailed analysis of market  transactions like the market monitoring units do. He also stated that OMOI  would need to have staff who performed this work on a daily basis in order  to become skilled at it, and that they could not gain this expertise on an ad  hoc basis.", "OMOI\u2019s stakeholders have also expressed varying views. For example, the  heads of the market monitoring units have generally suggested that OMOI  leave the detailed monitoring of market transactions to them and focus on  broader, national issues.

These anomalies generally include large price increases or  spikes or unexpected constraints in areas of the national grid of electric  transmission lines or the natural gas pipeline network. For example, OMOI  monitored a natural gas price spike in February 2003 and tracked its effects  on the electricity market in the New York area. When anomalies are  identified, OMOI staff investigate to determine the cause by calling the  applicable market monitoring unit or using data in the center or otherwise  available to FERC. Depending on the results of this examination, the  results are presented to the commissioners and other agency managers as  an early warning of market problems or OMOI initiates a preliminary  investigation or operational audit. In some cases, OMOI staff has worked  with ISO or RTO representatives to change market rules that led to the  identified anomaly.

It also has limited information on the operations of the electric  system. Operations information, such as data on power plant outages and  the availability of capacity on transmission lines, is important to detect and  analyze changes in the markets and to identify potential anticompetitive  behaviors.", "In addition, the center does not have access to nonfederal information  needed to assess reliability of the electric power grid and monitor overall  electricity market performance. This information includes data system  frequency (a measure of how well the system is balancing electricity  demand and supply), power flows on key transmission lines, and  transmission between parties. According to OMOI officials, market  performance and electricity system reliability are mutually dependent, and  such information would help them to determine whether market  participants are behaving anticompetitively. The center also does not have  access to a third party source for price or quantity information on most  bilateral transactions of wholesale electricity, which are the major portion  of market transactions.

Since the hotline\u2019s creation in FERC\u2019s Office of General Counsel in  1987, the number of complaints and inquiries has increased substantially.  For example, the hotline received 145 complaints and inquiries in fiscal  year 1996, compared with 584 in fiscal year 2002. FERC\u2019s goal has been to  respond to and resolve the complaints and inquiries very quickly. For  example, FERC set a goal in its fiscal year 2003 performance plan to  resolve 80 percent of the complaints and inquiries within 1 week of the  initial contact. When a complaint or inquiry is received (by telephone,  letter, or E-mail), an attorney is assigned to investigate. The attorney  contacts the other party, usually the same day, and attempts to resolve the  issue. If the issue cannot be resolved through this informal process, the  complainant can file a formal complaint or, if OMOI finds indications of a  more egregious violation of rules or regulations, it can launch an  investigation into the matter.", "With the hotline\u2019s transfer to OMOI in August 2002, it has become an  important market oversight tool by providing market participants the  opportunity to anonymously and informally make complaints to OMOI  about anticompetitive actions by other parties. According to the  Enforcement Hotline Director, the hotline\u2019s underlying philosophy is that of  a neighborhood watch with participants patrolling their own markets. To  this end, OMOI has encouraged market participants and the general public  to call, e-mail, or write the hotline to complain or report market activities  that may be an abuse of market power, an abuse of an affiliate relationship,  a tariff violation, or another type of violation by an entity regulated by  FERC. According to OMOI, hotline calls have included complaints about  bidding anomalies, price spikes, inappropriate use of certain financial  instruments, fluctuations in available capacity on electric transmission  lines and natural gas pipelines, discrimination in interconnection to the  electric grid, and improper market transactions between a company and an  affiliate. Hotline complaints have led to or contributed to decisions to  initiate several enforcement investigations.", "OMOI officials also told us that the hotline staff has been focusing more  attention on tracking market-related calls to look for trends because OMOI  is trying to use the hotline as a tool for identifying market issues early. For  example, the officials said that the hotline received several calls from  energy marketers who said that they could be driven out of business by  stricter standards for creditworthiness.

OMOI initiates operational audits for a variety of reasons, including  providing input to policy deliberations, regulations development, and  enforcement cases.", "FERC\u2019s investigations and operational audits relating to energy markets  have increased almost steadily each month since this responsibility was  moved to OMOI. For example, on June 1, 2002\u2014about a month before the  enforcement staff was transferred to OMOI from FERC\u2019s Office of the  General Counsel\u2014FERC was conducting 37 investigations and operational  audits related to the electricity and natural gas industries and other areas  such as hydroelectric projects. This number was 68 as of May 31, 2003.  During this period, OMOI opened a total of 79 investigations and  operational audits and closed 48.", "Of the investigations that OMOI closed, several resulted in entities paying  refunds, civil penalties, or the costs of the investigations, as well as  preparing compliance plans and taking other remediation actions. One  highly visible example is the recently settled case against the  Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) for anticompetitive  practices that included a civil penalty of $20 million\u2014the largest civil  penalty in FERC\u2019s history. However, in other cases, no further action was  taken\u2014beyond working with the parties under investigation to bring them  into compliance with the rules and regulations\u2014because there is no civil  penalty authority associated with the activities. The civil penalty imposed  on Transco stemmed from the company\u2019s violation of rules in one of the  few areas in which FERC had the authority to impose such penalties. While  FERC can order refunds of excessive rates, FERC generally lacks authority  to impose appropriate penalties. No section of the Federal Power Act  allows FERC to levy monetary penalties against market participants who  charge unjust or unreasonable rates for electricity. Although the Natural  Gas Policy Act of 1978 gave FERC some authority to levy civil penalties,  this authority applies to a limited number of natural gas transactions in  interstate commerce. Given this situation, legislation was recently  introduced in the Congress that would give FERC additional penalty  authority. On April 11, 2003, the House passed H.R. 6, which would expand  FERC\u2019s penalty authority under the Federal Power Act and increase the  maximum civil penalty for certain violations from $10,000 to $1 million per  violation per day. The bill is currently awaiting action by the Senate, which  is considering similar legislation.", "While investigations are almost always opened in response to specific  complaints or concerns about a potential violation, operational audits  provide the opportunity to review compliance with regulations and market  rules on a broader basis. However, OMOI has limited resources devoted to  these audits. At the end of June 2003, the Division of Operational  Investigations was conducting audits of 16 entities under FERC\u2019s  jurisdiction\u201411 in the Pacific Northwest, 1 in the Midwest, 2 in the mid- Atlantic, and 2 in the Southwest\u2014with respect to certain aspects of FERC\u2019s  regulations. According to the Director of the Division of Operational  Investigations, most of the work by the division\u2019s staff is in supporting  ongoing enforcement investigations rather than performing audits. He said  that his staff provides technical support to these investigations by  reviewing regulations and accounting and trading issues. The Director said  that he would like to develop, but has not yet developed, a strategy for  systematically auditing compliance with FERC\u2019s regulations and market  rules on a cyclical basis. Absent this type of more comprehensive review,  OMOI has to rely on the limited coverage provided by hotline calls and  enforcement investigations.

For example, the head of the New York ISO\u2019s market  monitoring unit said that FERC should monitor market outcomes, maintain  close contact with the individual units, and operate a hotline that market  participants can use to register concerns about the units. Similarly, the  head of the New England ISO\u2019s monitoring unit said that OMOI should  develop additional expertise for each market and, more importantly, should  synthesize comments from stakeholders in each market regarding the  units\u2019 performance.", "While the market monitoring units are highly important to OMOI\u2019s efforts to  oversee electricity markets, the units\u2019 coverage of the nation\u2019s electricity  markets is limited. The monitoring units of the PJM Interconnection RTO,  ISO New England, and New York ISO cover the Northeastern markets,  while the California ISO\u2019s monitoring unit covers the markets in that state.

Furthermore, the office has contracted with knowledgeable vendors to  provide employees with information on key aspects of energy markets.  Since its inception in fiscal year 2002, OMOI has spent a total of about  $501,000 on contract services. The office is requesting an increase in  funding for these services from $500,000 for fiscal year 2003 to $1 million  for fiscal year 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMOI Faces Several Additional Staffing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although OMOI has made progress in hiring staff, OMOI continues to face  challenges in filling some of its leadership and technical positions. As of  June 17, 2003, OMOI had not permanently staffed three of OMOI\u2019s seven  division director positions. According to a senior OMOI official, finding  qualified applicants for the division director positions has been particularly  difficult because not many applicants have both technical skills and  leadership experience coupled with a public-service mentality. For  example, OMOI has advertised a \u201cDivision Director\u201d position at the senior  executive service level for the Division of Energy Market Oversight on  several occasions, but FERC hiring officials did not find any applicants  suitable to meet OMOI\u2019s needs. The position has been relisted. OMOI\u2019s  difficulty in filling its leadership positions is particularly important because  sustained, committed leadership is indispensable to successful  organizational transformations. By its very nature, the transformation  process entails fundamental change. Consistent leadership helps the  process stay the course and helps ensure changes are thoroughly  implemented and sustained over time. Senior OMOI officials also told us  that OMOI continues to face challenges hiring people with certain skills  such as engineers with market experience, people with technical skills for  performing sophisticated analysis, and people with forensic auditing  experience.", "In addition, in responding to our survey, OMOI employees indicated a  relatively high level of concern about the office\u2019s staffing levels and skill  mix. About 49 percent of OMOI employees did not believe that the office\u2019s  staffing levels were satisfactory. In comparison, 22 percent thought that the  levels were satisfactory. The remaining 30 percent neither agreed nor  disagreed that the staffing levels were satisfactory or stated that they had  no basis to judge. In addition, while about 45 percent of the employees  believed that the office\u2019s skill mix was adequate, 35 percent did not. The  remaining 21 percent neither agreed nor disagreed or had no basis to judge.", "In providing written comments for our survey, the employees often  commented on staffing levels and skill mix. For example, one respondent  wrote \u201cthe resources in the office are clearly inadequate to perform  comprehensive oversight of industries as large as wholesale electricity and  natural gas.\u201d Another wrote \u201cstaffing levels are not sufficient to regularly,  systematically evaluate all energy markets in the United States to look for  aberrant behavior.\u201d The written comments on skill mix varied. For  example, some staff wrote that OMOI had too many employees with  natural gas experience and too few with electricity experience. Others  commented that the office had too few engineers, especially electrical  engineers, or needed more investigations staff, economists, attorneys, or  technical staff.", "To some extent, these concerns about staffing levels and skill mix likely  reflect the staff\u2019s individual views about what this new office should do to  oversee the markets, particularly the level of detail at which it should  review market transactions. It is difficult to judge the validity of the staff\u2019s  concerns until OMOI has clearly defined its role. Of course, the FERC  commissioners and the Congress would be involved in defining the role and  committing the resources to carry it out.", "Many of OMOI\u2019s employees also indicated that they would benefit from  additional training. For example, in responding to our survey, over 70  percent of OMOI employees expressed a need for more training in areas  such as market functions, market structures, and the interaction of  financial markets and energy markets. In addition, more than half of the  staff indicated that additional training in economic theory and models  would be useful. (See table 3.)", "Furthermore, our survey of OMOI staff uncovered a potential issue  regarding the office\u2019s morale. In responding to the survey, about 49 percent  of OMOI managers and staff characterized the office\u2019s morale as generally  high or very high, compared to about 31 percent that said morale was  generally low or very low. (The remaining 20 percent characterized morale  as neither high nor low or said they had no basis to judge.) However, there  was a disparity of opinion between new hires and internal transfers. Among  staff that had been with FERC for more than a year or before OMOI was  established (internal transfers), about 40 percent said the office\u2019s morale  was low, slightly higher than the 38 percent that said it was high. In  comparison, 14 percent of staff that had been with FERC for less than 1  year (new hires) said the office\u2019s morale was low, while 68 percent said it  was high. Additionally, several internal transfers expressed concern that  OMOI\u2019s top managers do not value them as highly as those hired from  outside FERC. In their written comments to our survey, several staff  expressed their sense that a \u201cdouble standard\u201d exists in that (1) the work of  the \u201cnew FERC\u201d employees (outside hires) is valued by top managers more  than that of the \u201cold FERC\u201d employees (transfers) and (2) the new FERC  employees receive higher pay and more than their share of the bonuses and  other rewards. Several employees also commented that there is not much  promotion potential for internal transfers. Furthermore, several employees  that left OMOI to go to other parts of FERC told us that they had left for a  promotion, but the sense that they were not valued was also a factor in  leaving."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "FERC Is Taking Important Steps to Improve Its Human Capital Management", "paragraphs": ["Since we issued our June 2002 report, FERC has developed a human capital  plan that lays the foundation for the agency to strategically manage its  workforce. As our previous work has found, strategic human capital  planning must be the centerpiece of any serious change management  initiative, yet a key challenge for many federal agencies is to strategically  manage their human capital. Given that many federal agencies have not  yet begun any comprehensive human capital planning, FERC\u2019s human  capital plan is commendable and a promising first step. Nonetheless, the  plan is in the formative stages and lacks key elements. The plan does not  yet fully (1) identify specific activities, resources, and time frames needed  to implement the agency\u2019s human capital initiatives and (2) provide results  oriented or outcome measures to track the agency\u2019s progress in  implementing the plan\u2019s initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness. By  including these key elements in its human capital plan, FERC could better  ensure that its workforce is able to effectively oversee and monitor energy  markets. In addition to human capital planning, the agency is taking other  steps to help transform its workforce, including assessing additional  human capital flexibilities that could improve recruitment and retention  efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FERC\u2019s Human Capital Management Plan Is an Important First Step but Lacks Key Elements", "paragraphs": ["In February 2003, the Chairman of FERC approved the agency\u2019s first human  capital management plan, a step forward in fostering a more strategic  approach to human capital management. In our June 2002 report, we  pointed out that FERC was one of many federal agencies that had not given  adequate attention to human capital management. Specifically, we found  that FERC had not conducted systematic strategic human capital planning  to guide its efforts to recruit, develop, train, and retain the type of  workforce that can effectively oversee competitive energy markets.  Properly done, human capital planning provides managers with a strategic  basis for making human resources decisions and allows agencies to  systematically address issues driving workforce change, such as those  affecting OMOI. One tool that agencies can use to improve their human  capital management is a human capital plan that systematically identifies  the workforce needed for the future and identifies strategies for shaping  this workforce. Accordingly, we recommended that FERC develop a  comprehensive strategic human capital management plan to include the  following:  a skills assessment program that would identify gaps in skills currently  held by the workforce that are necessary to carry out the agency\u2019s  evolving regulatory and oversight responsibilities;  a recruitment and retention initiative, based on priorities for meeting  future regulatory and oversight staffing needs, which addresses filling  skill gaps in the current workforce;  a training effort targeted at increasing staff knowledge in the areas of  market functions and market structures so that FERC staff will be better  prepared to regulate and oversee competitive energy markets; and  a comprehensive succession plan for solving challenges posed by the  large number of impending retirements within the agency, including  reliable projections of the number of eligible staff who may actually  retire.", "The plan, which covers a period of from 2 to 5 years, is essentially broken  up into two major sections. The first section addresses issues facing the  agency as a whole. For example, the plan\u2019s first section describes FERC\u2019s  current human capital situation, including data on overall workforce  demographics such as size and composition of the workforce, employee  pay grade distribution, attrition rates, projected retirement eligibility, and  retirement rates. The plan then uses these data to frame five broad  workforce challenges and identifies five human resource goals and 19  objectives to achieve these goals. (See table 4.) The plan\u2019s second section  provides information specific to each major FERC office. This section  identifies each office\u2019s specific human capital challenges based on their  particular workforce demographics and current and future work  requirements and includes a short-term hiring plan and longer-term human  capital initiatives.", "The plan, to varying degrees, discusses the four major components that we  previously recommended be included\u2014skills assessment, recruitment and  retention, training, and succession planning. Regarding skills assessment,  the second section of the plan identifies for each office the current and  future skills they need to achieve FERC\u2019s strategic goals. Where gaps  existed between current and future skill needs, the offices have developed  human capital initiatives to close the gaps. According to a senior FERC  human resource official, the plan will improve as this skills assessment  process improves. The official said that the FERC offices are still learning  how to determine their skill needs and, as a result, when someone retires or  otherwise leaves, FERC managers tend to seek a replacement with the  same skills, rather than thinking about future skill needs.", "Concerning recruitment and retention, the plan establishes attracting and  retaining talented, diverse employees capable of maintaining excellence as  a human resource goal. To accomplish this goal, FERC identifies various  objectives, including institutionalizing an agencywide workforce planning  process and implementing recruiting and retention strategies based on the  results of this workforce planning process and the offices\u2019 hiring plans.  Another of the objectives is to develop a demonstration project to increase  hiring and retention success and improve accountability for hiring and  retention decisions. FERC\u2019s plan also identifies a number of initiatives to  improve recruitment and retention. For example, FERC plans to implement  an exit interview process to track and document why employees leave.  According to the plan, the information gained from exit interviews will be  used to support or modify agency personnel practices in order to improve  employee retention.", "With respect to training, the plan establishes development opportunities to  expand individual and organizational capabilities as a goal. An objective  under this goal is to upgrade the effectiveness of the central and individual  office training programs. The plan recognizes that FERC needs to  implement a revamped energy markets curriculum to ensure that staff,  such as those in OMOI, have current market-oriented skills and expertise.  One of the next steps in the plan is that the human resources staff will  coordinate the offices\u2019 efforts to design and offer training for managers and  to develop a markets-oriented curriculum to build organizational and staff  capabilities. Human resources officials told us that FERC is already using  an agencywide team to develop such a curriculum. According to senior  human resources officials, the curriculum will likely be offered to all FERC  offices to develop a common foundation across the agency. Although OMOI  is the FERC office primarily responsible for monitoring competitive energy  markets, FERC officials indicated that a number of offices in addition to  OMOI are seeking markets training to do their jobs better. As FERC  develops this new curriculum, the current central program has been  temporarily suspended, and each office is responsible for providing  informal training to its own staff. For example, OMOI has offered a variety  of training to increase staff knowledge on competitive energy markets.  According to a senior FERC official, the new agencywide training program  should be implemented by the beginning of fiscal year 2004.", "FERC\u2019s plan identifies succession planning as a challenge and points out  that over half of FERC\u2019s workforce will be eligible to retire by 2007. It also  sets out the establishment of a leadership succession planning program as  an objective under its building leadership goal. To address this challenge,  many of FERC\u2019s offices intend to develop their own succession planning  strategies. For example, the section of the plan for the Office of Markets,  Tariffs, and Rates states that because of its \u201cgraying\u201d leadership ranks, the  office must develop a succession plan for its key leadership positions. The  section also states that because of its overall graying workforce, the office  must develop a larger entry-level/career ladder pipeline to maintain  adequate numbers of employees, both in total numbers and at the top level  of career-ladder positions. The section of the plan for OMOI also addresses  succession planning. In the plan, OMOI states that it will develop a  succession plan to address the loss of leadership and skills due to  retirements and the return of employees to the private sector. However, the  human capital plan does not provide any additional information on how  these succession plans will be developed, what resources are needed, how  they will be implemented, and when they will be completed. Leading  organizations use their succession planning initiatives not only to identify  individual replacements for current leaders but also as a strategic tool to  build current and future organizational capacity by identifying and  developing the right people, with the right skills, at the right time for  leadership, managerial, and other critical positions.", "FERC\u2019s plan also addresses other related human capital issues. For  example, it notes that the current performance management system may  not be adequate to sustain and build the workforce needed for the future.  As FERC takes steps to transform its workforce, performance management  will be a critical element. Our previous work has found that instituting a  results-oriented culture and creating a modern, credible, and effective  performance management system can be strategic tools to drive change  and achieve desired organizational results. Under the plan\u2019s goal of  fostering a performance culture that rewards achievement are four broad  performance management objectives. For example, the plan indicates that  the agency will strengthen connections among accomplishments, awards,  and performance feedback but does not yet provide details on how this will  be done, what resources are needed, and when it will be completed.  According to senior FERC officials, the agency\u2019s current performance  system does not meaningfully differentiate between high and low  performers, and performance is not directly linked with annual pay  increases. Instead of awarding pay increases based on annual performance  appraisals, performance is rewarded through the use of bonuses  throughout the year. As a result, employees are rewarded for specific  events rather than their overall contribution to agency results. According to  FERC officials, this system was put in place to avoid the problem of too  many outstanding ratings.", "Given that FERC is one of only a small number of agencies that have begun  efforts to address their human capital challenges by developing human  capital plans, FERC\u2019s efforts are commendable. However, work remains to  be done to ensure FERC\u2019s plan is successful. Varying senior FERC human  resources officials described the plan as having a \u201cways to go\u201d or as a \u201cbaby  step.\u201d As we previously discussed, the plan, at this point, provides limited  information how the agency\u2019s goals and objectives will be achieved. While  the plan includes strategies, it generally does not yet identify specific  activities, resources, and time frames. This type of information helps  provide more clarity of direction and organizational commitment as the  plan is being implemented. The plan also does not provide results-oriented  performance measures to help FERC gauge its progress in achieving the  plan\u2019s goals and objectives. Our previous work has shown that high- performing organizations recognize the fundamental importance of  developing and using indicators to measure both the outcomes of human  capital strategies and how these outcomes have helped the organizations  accomplish their missions and programmatic goals. For example, a human  capital plan can include measures that indicate whether the agency  executed its human capital initiatives\u2014such as hiring, retention, training,  or performance management strategies\u2014as intended, whether it achieved  the goals for these strategies, and how these initiatives helped improve  programmatic results. Although FERC intends to review and update the  plan on a quarterly basis and revise it annually, it may be difficult to review  the plan\u2019s progress in a meaningful way without this type of specificity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FERC Continues to Use a Wide Range of Human Capital Flexibilities, and Is Exploring Opportunities for Additional Flexibilities", "paragraphs": ["In our June 2002 report, we noted that although FERC had taken steps to  acquire and develop the staff knowledge and skills it needed to effectively  regulate and oversee energy markets, it had not fully explored all the  human capital flexibilities that are available to federal agencies for  responding to workforce challenges. All federal agencies, including FERC,  have personnel flexibilities and tools available to them to help overcome  workforce recruitment and retention issues. Many of these flexibilities and  tools can be initiated by federal agencies on their own, while others require  approval from the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of  Management and Budget, or the Congress. In our prior report, we found  that FERC was using a number of available flexibilities such as recruitment  bonuses, retention allowances, tuition reimbursement, and alternative  work schedules but had not requested other flexibilities that could help  improve recruitment and retention. Accordingly, we recommended that  FERC (1) identify the personnel tools, flexibilities, and strategies, other  than those already in use by FERC, available to federal agencies to recruit  and retain employees; (2) conduct an internal assessment of the  effectiveness and applicability of these to FERC; and (3) develop an action  plan to use the appropriate tools, flexibilities, and strategies to recruit and  hire needed expertise.", "Since our prior report, FERC has expanded its use of some existing human  capital flexibilities to improve its ability to recruit and retain employees.  One example is FERC\u2019s student loan repayment program. As one of the first  federal agencies to employ this flexibility, FERC has used a total of  $331,499 to help 41 employees repay their student loans. Participants in the  program commit to staying at FERC for a minimum of 3 years. According to  FERC officials, this program has been particularly successful in retaining  attorneys, who often have high student loan debt. In addition, FERC has  expanded its use of recruitment and retention bonuses. For example, FERC  offered 10 retention bonuses in 2002 compared with 2 in 2001. FERC has  also given 75 recruitment bonuses of around $3,000 to $4,000 each to  attract qualified employees. As noted earlier, OMOI has typically offered  larger recruitment bonuses than other FERC offices because of the  specialized skills required to effectively monitor competitive energy  markets.", "In addition, according to FERC\u2019s human resources manager, the agency\u2019s  senior human resources officials have identified additional human capital  flexibilities that could prove useful in attracting and retaining quality  employees and have assessed their applicability to FERC. However, the  Chairman of FERC has not yet decided which, if any, of these additional  flexibilities FERC will seek approval for from the Office of Personnel  Management, the Office of Management and Budget, or the Congress. As  part of their assessment, FERC officials examined the flexibilities in use at  agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Aviation  Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the  Transportation Security Agency to identify lessons learned and strategies  for acquiring additional flexibilities. Senior FERC human resources  officials said that they may look to acquire many of the same flexibilities  currently available to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a similar  regulatory agency. However, these officials also noted that FERC may have  more difficulty obtaining approval for the additional flexibilities because of  its relatively low attrition rate, an average of 7 percent since 1995. In  contrast, the Security and Exchange Commission, which has a turnover  rate of around 30 percent, uses compensation-based programs, such as  special pay rates, more actively than other government agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OMOI has made a credible start toward establishing an oversight and  enforcement capability for competitive energy markets. Significantly, the  office recognizes that additional efforts are needed and has under way or is  planning a number of initiatives, including expanding its activities, further  identifying its information needs, and improving its working relationships  with the market monitoring units. While these initiatives are important to  OMOI\u2019s success, the activities that the office needs to engage in, the  information and other resources it needs to carry out these activities, and  the working relationships it needs to establish with others depend on the  role that it has defined for itself to achieve its mission. At this point, OMOI\u2019s  role lacks clarity in several respects. For example, OMOI has not explicitly  and directly related its role and activities to the agency\u2019s responsibility for  ensuring just and reasonable prices nor decided at what level of detail it  will review the markets. In addition, OMOI has not clearly defined market  power, although market power is a major oversight concern and an issue  that OMOI has to make sure is adequately addressed. Moreover, OMOI has  not explicitly defined how it will work with others inside and outside of  FERC that either share energy market oversight responsibilities or have  related responsibilities.", "OMOI is a new office with unique and broad responsibilities for overseeing  the nation\u2019s energy markets. As such, its first months have been a learning  experience as it hired its staff and began to carry out its activities. Thus, we  do not disagree with the office\u2019s decision to begin its work with few formal  processes and written procedures as it, in effect, was developing and  testing them. However, after almost a year, OMOI has added more staff, and  its oversight activities are becoming more complex. Establishing formal  processes and developing written procedures are important to help ensure  that they are systematic, understood, and implemented effectively. Formal  processes and written procedures also help provide assurances to OMOI\u2019s  stakeholders that the office has fully thought through and is systematically  monitoring today\u2019s energy markets.", "Although FERC\u2019s recently completed human capital plan begins to lay the  foundation for the agency to strategically manage its human capital, it does  not yet contain key elements that could increase the likelihood that the  plan will be effective. It generally does not identify specific activities,  resources, and milestones to implement the human capital objectives. It  also does not contain results oriented performance measures that can help  FERC measure progress toward achieving these objectives. Setting out  specific activities, resources, and milestones provide a clearer road map for  achieving the plan\u2019s objectives and more clearly defines the organizational  commitment needed for the plan\u2019s implementation.
