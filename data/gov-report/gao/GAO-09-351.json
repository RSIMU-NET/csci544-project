This report examines the extent (1) that DOD and State have developed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure that the backgrounds of PSC employees have been screened and (2) that DOD has developed guidance to implement the provisions of the NDAA and (3) that DOD and State have addressed measures on other issues related to PSC employees in Iraq. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD and State guidance, policies, and contract oversight documentation and interviewed agency and private security industry officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State and DOD have developed policies and procedures to conduct background screenings of PSC personnel working in Iraq who are U.S. citizens, but only State has done so for foreign nationals. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) directs U.S. government agencies to establish minimum background screening requirements in order to issue access credentials. But DOD has not developed departmentwide procedures for conducting background screenings of its foreign national PSC personnel. Disagreements among the various DOD offices responsible for developing and implementing these policies and procedures hindered timely execution of the HSPD-12 requirements, and the completion of this development and implementation has been hampered by the lack of a focal point to resolve these disagreements. For example, officials at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence interpret HSPD-12 as requiring a government screening process for foreign national contractor personnel that is equivalent to the National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) currently used for U.S. citizen contractor personnel. But officials at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics maintain that a NACI-equivalent screening for foreign nationals would not be feasible, given the inherent difficulty of screening foreign nationals and the inconsistent quality of criminal and employment records from one country to another, and further, such an approach would will severely limit the numbers of foreign national contractor personnel DOD could use. The offices also differ as to who should approve background screenings, known as adjudication. The Commander of Multi-National Forces-Iraq has established a screening process for PSCs, but GAO has identified several shortcomings that limit the effectiveness of this process. For example, the process directs contractors to obtain background screening for entities that will not provide data to contractors. While DOD has acknowledged the inherent force protection risk it assumes when using contractor employees, without the timely development of standardized policies and procedures, DOD lacks full assurance that all its PSCs are properly screened. While DOD is developing guidance to meet the requirements of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the draft guidance does not meet all of the requirements of that act. For example, the draft guidance does not address the requirement for establishing minimum standards for background screening of PSCs. Instead it directs the combatant commanders to establish standards for their respective areas of responsibility, though it does not establish time frames within which they should do so. Without addressing these concerns, DOD's draft guidance only partially meets the requirements of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. DOD and State have taken actions on other issues related to PSCs in Iraq. For example, they have implemented similar processes to ensure that PSC personnel are trained, and to account for PSC weapons. Both agencies have also developed policies related to alcohol use by PSCs"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In Iraq, security concerns have led both the Department of Defense (DOD)  and Department of State (State) to rely upon armed private security  contractors to perform a variety of important security functions. These  functions include providing static security for the United States\u2014\u2014that is,  controlling buildings and facilities, providing security for high-ranking U.S.  officials, and escorting supply convoys. According to a June 2009 report by  the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD  and State estimate that more than 16,263 armed private security personnel  (12,942 with DOD, 3,321 with State) are working in Iraq under contracts  with the U.S. government.  According to these estimates 77 percent of  private security contractor personnel are foreign nationals, 11 percent are  Iraq nationals, and 12 percent are U.S. citizens or citizens of coalition  countries, such as those from the United Kingdom and Australia.", "DOD and State private security contractors subject prospective employees  to background screenings that typically include searches of past criminal  activity and a credit check. However, our past work and the work of  others have raised concerns about the approaches taken by the U.S.  government to ensure that background screenings are complete and  thorough. For example, in 2006 we reported that DOD and private security  contractors had difficulty conducting comprehensive background  screening for U.S. and foreign nationals because of inaccurate, missing, or  inaccessible data. Additionally, we reported that military commanders  and other military officials were concerned about the risks that contractor  personnel, particularly foreign and local nationals, posed to U.S. forces  due to limitations in the background screening process. Furthermore,  there have been congressional concerns about the selection, training,  equipping, and conduct of personnel performing private security functions  in Iraq. These concerns are reflected in Section 862 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 which directs the Secretary  of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to prescribe  regulations by May 2008 for the use of private security contractors in an  area of combat operations.", "In July 2008, we reported that DOD and State had improved oversight and  coordination over private security contractors in Iraq but we also raised  concerns about the ability to sustain the oversight needed and indicated  that we would issue a follow-on report on other private security contractor  issues related to selection, training, and weapons accountability as well as  DOD\u2019s implementation of provisions of Section 862 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008.  This report addresses  those issues and expands upon the extent to which DOD and State have  taken measures to ensure that private security contractor personnel have  been screened. Due to broad congressional interest, we have conducted  this engagement under the authority of the Comptroller General to  conduct evaluations at his own initiative. Specifically, our objectives were  to determine (1) the extent to which DOD and State have developed and  implemented policies and procedures to ensure that the backgrounds of  private security contractor personnel have been screened, (2) the extent to  which DOD has developed guidance to address the elements of Section  862 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008, and (3)  the measures the two agencies have taken to ensure that private security  contractor personnel are trained, the steps taken to account for private  security contractor weapons, and the development of policies to govern  alcohol use among private security contractor personnel in Iraq.", "To address these objectives we reviewed DOD and State documentation,  including contract materials, government policies, and records of  government reviews and inspections. We interviewed officials from  various DOD and State offices, including the offices of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisitions, Technology, and Logistics, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence, and State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

To obtain the industry\u2019s  perspective on these issues, we interviewed officials from two private  security industry associations and officials from 11 private security firms  who currently provide or have recently provided private security services  in Iraq. To corroborate statements about training by DOD and State  officials and private security firms, we reviewed 215 compliance audit  checklists from DOD inspections that were conducted from March 2008 to  January 2009.

These contractors provide  security services for a variety of U.S. government agencies in Iraq;  however, they are principally hired by DOD and State. DOD private  security services contracts include a contract to provide security for  DOD\u2014 controlled facilities in Iraq, known as the Theater Wide Internal  Security Services contract. According to DOD officials, four contractors  employing more than 8,000 guards, supervisors, and operations personnel  are performing task orders issued under their contracts. The State  Department\u2019s private security services contracts include a contract to  provide security and support, known as the Worldwide Personal  Protective Services contract, a contract to provide security for the U.S.  Embassy Baghdad, and a security contract managed by State\u2019s Bureau of  International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.", "In August 2004, the President issued HSPD-12 to require that United States  government agencies (including DOD and State) collaborate to develop a  federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for all U.S.  government employees and contractors needing regular physical access to  federal facilities. In February 2005, to comply with HSPD-12, the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and  Technology issued implementing guidance; the Federal Information  Processing Standards 201-1, which define a governmentwide personal  identification verification system. HSPD-12 requires that all U.S.  government agencies mandate the use of the standard identification  credential for all employees and contractors\u2014U.S. citizens and foreign  nationals alike\u2014who need regular physical access to federal facilities,  including U.S. military installations abroad. As part of this process, all U.S.  government employees and contractors who are issued an approved  credential are to undergo a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries  (NACI), or, at minimum, an FBI National Criminal History Check (a  fingerprint check against a FBI database). We have previously reported on  the challenges associated with applying a similar process to foreign  nationals, including the limited applicability of U.S.-based databases of the  names of criminals to foreign nationals. Federal Information Processing  Standard 201-1 applies to foreign nationals working for the U.S.  government overseas and requires a process for registration and approval  using a State Bureau of Diplomatic Security approved method, except in  the case of employees under the command of a U.S. area military  commander. However, the standards do not offer any guidance as to what  process should be used overseas. In addition to the HSPD-12 requirements,  DOD and State have been instructed to comply with other requirements  intended to protect the safety of property and personnel. For example,  DOD policy makes military commanders responsible for enforcing security  measures intended to ensure that property and personnel are protected.  Likewise, the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986  requires the Secretary of State to develop and implement policies and  programs, including funding levels and standards, to provide for the  security of U.S. government diplomatic operations abroad.", "Section 862 of the FY2008 NDAA requires that the Secretary of Defense,  in coordination with the Secretary of State, prescribe regulations on the  selection, training, equipping, and conduct of personnel performing private  security functions under a covered contract in an area of combat  operations. Section 862 of the FY2008 NDAA states that the regulations  shall, at a minimum, establish processes to be used in an area of combat  operations for the following:  registering, processing, accounting for, and keeping appropriate  records of personnel performing private security functions;    authorizing and accounting for weapons to be carried by, or available  to be used by, personnel performing private security; and  registration and identification of armored vehicles, helicopters, and  other military vehicles operated by contractors performing private  security functions.", "In addition, the regulations shall establish requirements for qualification,  training, screening (including, if practicable, through background checks),  and security for personnel performing private security functions in an area  of combat operations.", "Section 862 of the FY2008 NDAA also states that the regulations must  establish a process by which to report the following incidents: (1) a  weapon is discharged by personnel performing private security functions  in an area of combat operations; (2) personnel performing private security  functions in an area of combat operations are killed or injured; (3) persons  are killed or injured, or property is destroyed, as a result of conduct by  contractor personnel; (4) a weapon is discharged against personnel  performing private security functions in an area of combat operations; or  (5) active, non-lethal countermeasures are employed by the personnel  performing private security functions in an area of combat operations in  response to a perceived immediate threat to these personnel. In addition,  the regulations must establish a process for the independent review and, if  practicable, investigation of these incidents and incidents of alleged  misconduct by personnel performing private security functions in an area  of combat operations.

Initially, private security contractors submit the resumes of all  prospective employees to be reviewed by a State Department contracting  officer representative. After this prescreening, the Worldwide Personal  Protective Services contract requires firms to screen employees using a  screening process approved by State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. The  process includes examining a prospective employee\u2019s past work history,  police records, prior military service, and a credit check. The contractor is  responsible for reviewing the results of the initial screening and, based on  the results, forwards a list of the candidates to the contracting officer  representative. Then, State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security conducts and  adjudicates its own background investigation of prospective employees.  All personnel performing work on the contract must possess a security  clearance, a determination of eligibility for moderate or high-risk public  trust positions, or have had an investigative check conducted by regional  security officers of local or foreign nationals equivalent to the public trust  determination required for the position. According to State Department  officials, the department requires that foreign national private security  contractor personnel have a Moderate Risk Public Trust determination,  which is equivalent to a Secret clearance, but it does not grant access to  classified information. The Moderate Risk Public Trust determination  includes checking a prospective contractor employee\u2019s name against both  local and national data sources. These data sources include the consular  name-check database that is used by U.S. embassies to access information  used to approve or deny visa applications. The system contains records  provided by numerous U.S. agencies and includes information on persons  with visa refusals, immigration violations, criminal histories, and terrorism  concerns. In addition, prospective employees are screened by Regional  Security Officers in the U.S. embassy in their home countries and if  necessary, the Regional Security Officers may interview prospective  employees. For example, when State Department officials in Uganda  uncovered prospective employees using false documentation, the  certificates were not granted to Ugandans until the Regional Security  Officer had completed a personal interview. Moreover, in Iraq, prospective  Iraqi employees sometimes undergo polygraph examinations. State  Department officials told us that this process was HSPD-12-compliant  based on their interpretation of an Office of Management and Budget  memorandum that states that investigations related to making a public  trust determination can be sufficient to meet HSPD-12 requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Developed Procedures to Conduct Background Screenings of Private Security Contractor Personnel Who Are U.S. Citizens but Has Not Developed Procedures to Screen Foreign and Local Nationals", "paragraphs": ["Federal Information Processing Standards 201-1 require that contractor  personnel, including private security contractors in Iraq, undergo a  National Agency Check with Written Inquiries investigation or its  equivalent prior to being issued an access credential. While DOD has  established procedures to apply this requirement to private security  contractor personnel who are U.S. citizens, it has not, as of June 2009,  developed a process and procedures to apply this requirement to foreign  and local nationals. According to DOD Instruction 3020.41, the  comprehensive policy document on the management of contractors  authorized to accompany the Armed Forces, USD-I is responsible for  developing and implementing procedures for conducting background  screenings of contractor personnel authorized to accompany the U.S.  Armed Forces. The instruction, which was issued in October 2005 by the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  (AT&L), also directs USD-I to coordinate with AT&L, to develop these  procedures, and to draft appropriate contract clauses. In November 2008,  DOD issued a Directive-Type Memorandum to begin the process of  bringing DOD policy into alignment with HSPD-12.  However, while the  memorandum directs USD-I to coordinate with AT&L and the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (P&R) to develop  the department\u2019s policy for conducting background screenings of  contractor personnel, it does not provide specifics on what the policy  should contain. P&R, the office responsible for DOD\u2019s HSPD-12  compliance, is currently drafting a DOD Instruction that includes  standards for conducting background screenings of U.S. citizens, but does  not yet include standards for screening foreign nationals because  according to officials from P&R, they have not received input from USD-I.  As of May 2009, USD-I officials were unable to provide an estimate of  when the foreign national screening standards would be complete.", "The lack of a focal point to resolve disagreements among the offices  responsible for developing and implementing DOD\u2019s background  screening policies and procedures has hindered timely execution of the  HSPD-12 requirements. For example, officials from USD-I have interpreted  HSPD-12 as requiring a government screening and adjudication process for  foreign nationals that would be equivalent to the National Agency Check  with Written Inquiries investigation used for U.S. citizens. Officials within  AT&L maintain that this approach is unrealistic and would severely limit  the numbers of foreign national contractor personnel the department  could use to support U.S. forces in contingency operations. According to  AT&L officials a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries equivalent  screening for foreign nationals would not be feasible, given the difficulty  of screening foreign nationals and the inconsistent quality of criminal and  employment records from one country to another. As previously noted,  private security contractors currently conduct their own background  screenings of prospective employees. Based on these results, firms make  final hiring decisions. AT&L officials believe that contractor-led  background screenings, in conjunction with processes established by  combatant commanders to screen contractors, such as those in place in  Iraq, provides reasonable assurance that the security risk posed by foreign  national contractor personnel is minimal. As we reported in 2006,  commanders are responsible for the safety and security of their  installations.", "Additionally, AT&L officials maintain that U.S. government employees  serving as contracting officer representatives are the final adjudicators of  background screening results. However, USD(I) officials disagree and  have stated that DOD policy prohibits contracting officer representatives  from being final adjudicators, and note that they lack the necessary  training and time to do so. As early as 2004 we noted that DOD had a lack  of personnel available to provide oversight. Most recently we noted in  our 2008 report that DOD was strained to provide a sufficient number of  contract oversight personnel and military personnel needed better training  on their responsibilities to provide contract oversight over private security  contractors. An April 2009 report by the Special Inspector General for  Iraq Reconstruction found similar concerns, noting that contracting officer  representatives received limited training and had insufficient available  time to devote to their oversight responsibilities. As a result of these  disagreements, DOD has not developed minimum background screening  standards as required by DOD Instruction 3020.41 and HSPD-12. While  DOD has acknowledged the inherent force protection risk it assumes  when using contractor personnel, without the development and  implementation of departmentwide background screening procedures that  apply to all private security contractor personnel, including foreign  nationals, DOD does not have full assurance that all of its private security  contractor personnel have been properly screened."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Iraq, MNF-I Has Established a Background Screening Process for DOD Private Security Contractors, but the Existing Process Has Several Shortcomings", "paragraphs": ["By direction of the MNF-I commander, MNF-I, the U.S.-led military  organization responsible for conducting the war in Iraq, has established a  process in Iraq aimed at ensuring that all private security contractors, U.S.  citizens, Iraqi nationals, and other foreign nationals providing security  services to DOD have been screened. According to MNF-I guidance, which  shall be incorporated into all contracts and solicitations where arming of  contracted employees is contemplated in Iraq, private security contractors  and subcontractors in Iraq are required to    conduct background screenings of employees;    verify with the MNC-I Provost Marshal that no employee has been  barred by any commander within Iraq; and    certify after completing all checks that all persons armed under the  contract are not prohibited under U.S. law from possessing a weapon  or ammunition.", "In addition, in Iraq DOD has developed background screening measures  that are intended to act as an additional safeguard after contractor- conducted screening procedures. For example, MNC-I officials told us that  every private security contractor employee serving in Iraq also must  receive a badge issued by MNF-I. According to officials, as part of the  badge process, host and foreign national personnel are subjected to a  background screening using several U.S. government automated systems  and undergo an interview conducted by MNF-I intelligence officials. In  addition, MNF-I guidance establishing minimum requirements for access  to MNF-I installations throughout the Iraq Theater of Operations states  that all host and foreign national private security contractor personnel are  subjected to screening using an automated system unique to Iraq that  collects biometric information such as photographs, fingerprints, and iris  scans.", "While force protection officials we spoke with in Iraq were generally  satisfied with the current background screening process and felt that it  sufficiently accounted for the security of U.S. installations, our work  identifies several shortcomings that limit the effectiveness of this process.  For example, we found that some of the current background screening  requirements established by MNF-I were unrealistic because they directed  contractors to use data sources that were not readily available to private  firms. According to MNF-I guidance, which shall be incorporated into all  contracts and solicitations where arming of contracted employees is  contemplated in Iraq, private security contractors should, to the extent  possible, use FBI, Country of Origin Criminal Records, Country of Origin  US Embassy Information Request, CIA records and/or any other equivalent  records systems as sources. However, as we noted in our past work,  contractors may not have access to certain data sources, such as FBI  databases. Moreover, these data sources provide only limited data on  foreign national contractor personnel who may have spent minimal if any  time in the United States. While private companies may have access to  other sources of background screening information, these data sources  have similar limitations when applied to prospective foreign national  personnel. As a result, contractors have adopted their own methods, such  as obtaining Interpol-issued Certificates of Good Conduct, which one  private security contractor official told us his company requires as a  prerequisite to an interview. We reviewed a copy of one such certificate  and observed that the certificate signifies that the bearer has never been  the subject of a police inquiry. However, according to the official these  certificates are not available in every country. Further, only the individual,  and not the company, may obtain this certificate. Therefore, there may be  incentives for prospective employees to forge or alter the certificates in  order to gain employment.", "In addition, MNF-I officials we spoke to who were responsible for  contractor oversight did not have a full understanding of the screening  process, the process\u2019 limitations, or of how contractors conducted their  background screenings. For example, MNF-I officials told us that the  office responsible for approving civilian arming requests\u2014known as the  arming authority\u2014reviewed background screening results prior to  approving arming requests. However, officials from the arming authority  stated that they did not see the results of the background screenings and  did not interpret or adjudicate based on the results. Officials were also  unaware of what the background screening entailed, and stated  background screening was the private security contractor\u2019s responsibility.", "According to MNF-I officials, contracting officer representatives are  responsible for ensuring that private security personnel files contain all of  the necessary information, including background screening results.  However, officials responsible for providing contract oversight in Iraq  stated that contracting officers and contracting officer representatives  only check to ensure that the correct documentation is maintained; they  do not try to interpret or adjudicate the background screening results.  Officials added that they are not trained to interpret or adjudicate the  results.", "Moreover, while some of the name-checks and biometric data collection  associated with issuing badges and requests for arming authority use data  collected in Iraq, such as information collected from suspected insurgents,  the current screenings rely primarily upon U.S.-based databases of  criminal and terrorist information. As we have previously reported,  background checks that are reliant upon U.S.-based databases, such as the  automated process, described above, may not be effective in screening  foreign nationals who have not lived or traveled to the United States.   Without training to ensure that military commanders and contracting  officials understand the department\u2019s policies and procedures for  background screening as well as their roles and responsibilities, DOD will  not have reasonable assurance that contractor personnel have been  screened.", "The existing MNF-I process also does not provide contractors with  standards on what the background screening should entail and how the  results should be interpreted, particularly for foreign national personnel.  According to MNF-I guidance, which shall be incorporated into all  contracts and solicitations where arming of contracted employees is  contemplated in Iraq, DOD private security contractors are required to  develop a background screening plan and submit the results of the  background screening to their contract\u2019s contracting officer representative  upon completion. The Theater Wide Internal Security Services contract  also requires that private security contractors conduct the appropriate  criminal and financial background screenings identified in chapters 2 and  3 of Army Regulation 190-56. For example, the regulation requires that  the contractor conduct a security screening check of applicants for  security guard positions, to include a check of arrest and criminal history  records of the state in which the prospective employee has resided during  the most recent 5 years. It also requires that prospective security  contractor employees be subjected to a National Agency Check with  Written Inquiries. However, the regulation does not provide instructions  on how to apply these screenings to non-U.S. citizens.  Our review of the  background screening plans submitted by the four Theater Wide Internal  Security Services contractors found that the processes the plans described  were not consistent in their approach to screen personnel, particularly for  foreign national personnel. Our review of the plans found that they did not  provide specific details as to how the company would go about screening  foreign nationals. For example, while one plan states that all prospective  foreign national employees are subjected to a criminal record check, it  does not explain what records will be checked, the time period examined,  or how the company intends to evaluate derogatory information.  Furthermore, one of the plans we reviewed failed to address screening  foreign national personnel at all. The plans were generally more specific in  their descriptions of how they intended to screen U.S. national personnel.  However, as we have previously reported, contractors have access to a  limited range of criminal records data, and particularly in foreign countries  these data can be of questionable quality. Furthermore, while DOD  officials in Iraq stated that they were comfortable that the screening  process was sound because contractors\u2019 screening processes were part of  the evaluation criteria used to award the contracts, as previously noted  officials responsible for evaluating these plans have not been trained to do  so. Without minimum standards screening firms will use varying  techniques to screen personnel and DOD will not have reasonable  assurance that a minimum level of safety and protection has been met."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Draft DOD Regulation Does Not Fully Meet the Legislative Requirements of Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008", "paragraphs": ["Section 862 of the FY2008 NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense, in  coordination with the Secretary of State, to develop regulations on the  selection, training, equipping, and conduct of private security contractor  personnel under a covered contract in an area of combat operations. The  public law lists a number of minimum processes and requirements, which  the regulations are to establish. While DOD has drafted an interim final  rule,which is intended to meet the requirements of the public law, our  analysis of a May 2009 version of the draft regulation indicates that it does  not address all of the requirements of the law.", "The draft delegates the responsibility of developing specific private  security contractor guidance and procedures to the geographic combatant  commanders without fully establishing all of the minimum processes as  required under Section 862. For example, the law directs DOD to develop  requirements for the screening and security of private security contractor  personnel. The draft instructs geographic combatant commanders to  develop procedures consistent with principles established in existing DOD  instructions and directives. However, while the draft makes reference to  existing DOD regulations regarding these areas, neither the draft nor the  referenced documents articulate a process or requirements that  geographic combatant commanders can use to ensure that all private  security contractor personnel meet screening and security requirements.  The draft regulation also establishes that all incidents listed in Section 862  (a)(2)(D) shall be reported, documented, and independently reviewed or  investigated. However, the regulation does not specify who should report  or document incidents, what information should be recorded, how the  incident should be investigated, or to whom the incident report should be  sent. Furthermore, it leaves the implementation of procedures for  reporting, reviewing, and investigating incidents to the combatant  commanders. In addition, while the law instructs that DOD develop  minimum processes and requirements for private security contractor  personnel operating in an area of combat operations,the draft regulation  only points to an agreement between DOD and State that is specific to Iraq  and directs it be used as a framework for the development of guidance and  procedures regardless of location. Specifically, the draft references a  December 2007 Memorandum of Agreement between DOD and State,  which provides that private security contractor personnel who wish to  possess and carry firearms in Iraq, must fulfill the core standards of  background checks, security clearances, training with annual refreshers  on topics such as the rules for the use of force, weapons qualification  consistent with U.S. Army standards, and use of weapon types authorized  by DOD and State. As noted in our discussion on background screenings,  absent minimum departmentwide processes, combatant commanders may  develop less comprehensive guidance and procedures and the guidance  and procedures developed may widely vary from theater-to-theater.  Moreover, the draft regulation does not establish a time frame for  combatant commanders to develop and issue the implementing guidance  and procedures. Without developing minimum departmentwide processes  in a timely manner to assist commanders in developing theaterwide  standards and a timeline for completion, DOD will not be able to ensure  that its policies related to private security contractors are consistent  across the geographic combatant commands and available at the onset of  a combat operation.", "Our review of a May 2009 version of the draft regulation found that it does  establish some processes. For example, the draft regulation establishes a  process for requesting permission to arm private security contractor  personnel. This process includes written acknowledgment by the security  contractor and its individual personnel that such personnel are not  prohibited under U.S. law to possess firearms and requires documentation  of individual training that includes weapons qualification and training on  the rules of the use of force. The draft also states that individual training  and qualification standards must meet, at a minimum, one of the military  department\u2019s established standards. With regard to the registration,  processing, and accounting of private security contractor personnel, the  draft regulation references a draft update to DOD Instruction 3020.41,  which designates the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational  Tracker (SPOT) as the joint Web-based database to maintain contractor  accountability and visibility of DOD-funded contracts supporting  contingency operations. The draft regulation also identifies SPOT as the  repository for registering and identifying military vehicles operated by  private security contractor personnel. DOD officials stated that they  interpreted Section 862\u2019s vehicle identification requirements as the need to  register vehicles in a database using a unique identifier as opposed to  identifying vehicles with a visual identifier such as a placard. Officials  stated identifying vehicles using a visual identifier would expose private  security contractors to enemy attacks. However, during our trip to Iraq in  2008, we observed that many DOD private security contractors affixed  readable numbers on their vehicles.", "While DOD was required to develop this guidance by July 2008, as of June  2009 the guidance has not been finalized. According to DOD officials,  promulgation of the guidance has taken considerable time due to  coordination efforts with State and the federal rule-making process, which  requires a draft rule be published for public comment in the Federal  Register when it has an impact beyond the agency's internal operations.   Because of this delay, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) has not  been revised to require that covered contracts and task orders contain a  contract clause to address the selection, training, equipping and conduct  of personnel performing private security functions. According to DOD  officials, the FAR will not be revised to implement the regulation until the  regulation has been finalized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and DOD Have Developed Policies and Processes on Other Private Security Issues Including Training, Weapons Accountability, and Alcohol", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Has Developed Detailed Private Security Contractor Training Requirements and an Inspection Process", "paragraphs": ["According to officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, contractors  performing under State\u2019s Worldwide Personal Protective Services contract  are required to provide 164 hours of personal protective security training.  The training curriculum includes topics such as the organization of a  protective detail, firearms proficiency, driver training, and defensive  tactics. According to officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, this  training curriculum was reviewed and approved by State\u2019s Diplomatic  Security Training Center. In addition, officials in the Bureau of Diplomatic  Security approve the course instructors after reviewing the instructors\u2019  resumes and other qualifications. Our review of State\u2019s Worldwide  Personal Protective Services contract found that it contained detailed  training requirements for private security contractor personnel. For  example, the contract identified very detailed weapons qualification  training requirements. These requirements include establishing a minimum  number of hours of weapons training, the acceptable venues for  conducting the training, and the materials the contractor must furnish. The  contract also determines the specific topics to be covered in the weapons  training including procedures on safe weapon handling, proper  marksmanship techniques, and firing positions. The requirements also  establish the minimum number of rounds that must be fired per each  weapon being used for training.", "To determine if private security contractor personnel are trained, officials  from State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Training Center and the Office of  Protective Operations periodically visit contractor training facilities to  monitor training. According to State officials, during these inspections  officials review the certifications of training instructors, observe individual  training modules, and review individual student training records.  According to State officials, the department is also in the process of  conducting a comprehensive review of all three Worldwide Personal  Protective Services contractor training programs. Officials stated that this  is the first comprehensive review under the Worldwide Personal  Protective Services contract and as part of this review officials are  reviewing a full training curriculum at each contractor\u2019s training location.  Officials stated that these reviews will result in recommendations for  immediate improvements to each company\u2019s training program and may  result in changes to the overall high-threat curriculum. To confirm that  State conducted training inspections, we reviewed the two most recent  inspection reports of each of the three private security contractors  providing services under State\u2019s largest security contract, Worldwide  Personal Protective Services. Our review of the records confirmed that  State had inspected each contractor and that the reviews were conducted  by State subject matter experts. For example, one inspection report we  reviewed included a State firearms expert observing the firearms  proficiency portion of the training. In each inspection report we reviewed,  State concluded that the contractors met training requirements. We also  observed that each inspection included suggestions for improvement even  when training requirements were met. Officials also stated that in Iraq,  Regional Security Officers provide daily oversight and as part of this  oversight they are responsible for ensuring that the training standards are  met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Established Broad Training Requirements for Private Security Contractor Personnel and Employs a Two-Step Process to Determine If Private Security Contractor Personnel Have Been Trained", "paragraphs": ["Much like State, DOD has established contractual training requirements  for private security contractor personnel. However, DOD\u2019s training  requirements are generally broader than State\u2019s. For example, while  State\u2019s training requirements establish a detailed training curriculum that  includes a minimum number of hours of training, DOD private security  training requirements are more broadly defined. For example, Annex A of  Fragmentary Order 09-109 which identifies requirements that must be  included in DOD contracts where private security contractors will be  armed, establishes that documentation should be maintained to attest that  each armed private security contractor employee has been successfully  familiarized with and met qualification requirements established by any  DOD or other U.S. government agency for each weapon they are  authorized to possess.  Similarly, the order requires that employees be  trained on the law of armed conflict and the rules for the use of force but  does not provide specifics to be included in the training. Contracts also  contain provisions to ensure that training does not lapse. For example,  DOD contracts performed in Iraq or Afghanistan must provide that if the  contractor fails to retrain an armed employee within 12 months of the last  training date the employee will lose authorization to possess and carry a  weapon in Iraq. Individual task orders may reiterate employee training  requirements.", "Fragmentary Order 09-109 makes contracting officer representatives  responsible for monitoring the contractor\u2019s performance and compliance  with contractual requirements, including compliance with all applicable  laws, regulations, orders, and directives. These representatives are co- located on the contractor site to facilitate day-to-day contract oversight.  According to DOD officials, contracting officer representatives  periodically review individual private security contractor personnel  training records to ensure that the training requirements have been met.  Additionally, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) conducts  reviews to ensure that contracting officer representatives are providing  proper oversight. In February 2008, DCMA began to use a series of  checklists developed by DCMA to guide inspections of contracting officer  representatives and confirm that these representatives are maintaining the  appropriate documentation and providing sufficient contractor oversight.  According to DCMA officials, these checklists were developed by taking  contract requirements and other DOD guidance and translating them into a  tool that could be used for an objective evaluation. These checklists may  vary by contract and have been tailored for specific areas of contract  performance. For example, while aspects of training may be found on  multiple checklists, DCMA has developed a specific training checklist.  Among the items checked are that contractors determined that personnel  had been trained on the required subjects, that a training plan had been  submitted for approval, and that training remained current. To confirm  that these inspections covered training, we reviewed 215 completed  checklists. While each checklist varied in length and scope, our review of  the checklists found that they contained 7 to 54 total items and among  those items were several training-related items. For example, one  checklist asked if the contractor ensured that all guard force personnel  were trained and authorized to be armed before beginning their duties.  Another checklist we reviewed asked if the contractor\u2019s training records  validated training, certifications, and recertification. Of the checklists we  reviewed, the checklists generally documented no concerns about  training. However, 7 of the checklists contained observations that raised  concerns about the training of personnel. Four checklists contained  observations that indicated that personnel were qualified with a different  weapon than the one they were assigned. Another checklist indicated that  personnel deployed with little to no training noting that personnel learned  everything about their posts once they were deployed. Two checklists  observed that personnel were not trained in all of the required training  subjects.", "Additionally, according to DOD officials, the department conducts  periodic site visits of private security contractors\u2019 Iraq-based training  facilities. However, because DOD personnel responsible for providing  oversight of DOD\u2019s private security contracts in Iraq are based in Iraq and  not elsewhere, such as the United States, these inspections do not  regularly include facilities located outside of Iraq, such as contractors\u2019 U.S.  training facilities. For example, an official at one private security firm we  visited indicated that noone from DOD had ever inspected the firm\u2019s U.S.- based training facility. Unlike State, which maintains personnel in Iraq and  in the U.S. to provide contract oversight, DOD\u2019s contracts are  administered by the Joint Contracting Command for Iraq and Afghanistan  and its personnel responsible for private security contract oversight are all  located in Iraq."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and DOD Have Developed a Process to Account for Weapons Held by Private Security Contractors", "paragraphs": ["According to State officials, the Worldwide Personal Protective Services  contract requires a quarterly inventory of all U.S. government- and  contractor- furnished property, including weapons.

The  regional security officer conducts an annual sight inventory, which is  corroborated with the contractors\u2019 quarterly inventories and records from  the State Department branch that acquired the weapons. In addition,  officials stated that the quarterly inventories are tracked by officials in  State\u2019s high-threat protection office and verifies this during periodic  program management reviews.", "In Iraq, DOD has established a process that includes granting arming  authority to private security contractor personnel, and conducting reviews  of weapons inventories and inspections of private security contractor  armories. DCMA also conducts reviews to ensure that private security  contractor personnel are properly authorized to carry weapons. In  addition, DOD antiterrorism/force protection officials conduct yearly  assessments of every MNF-I installation or forward operating base with  over 300 personnel, known as vulnerability assessments. During these  assessments officials check physical security measures and verify that  armed contractors, including private security contractor personnel, are  carrying the required arming authorization letter and meeting the  requirements to be compliant with the arming authority requirements.  Officials stated that ultimately contracting officer representatives are  responsible for ensuring that DOD\u2019s private security contractors adhere to  the arming regulations. Officials felt that while there were many good  contracting officer representatives, there were some that would benefit  from additional training on their responsibilities, instead of learning these  things on the job.", "Recent audits by State\u2019s Office of the Inspector General and the Special  Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that weapons were  properly accounted for. In April 2009, State\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General published results of a performance audit of security contractor  Triple Canopy and concluded that the firm established sound inventory  controls at the two facilities State inspected in Iraq. To reach this  conclusion, the office conducted an inventory of weapons and reviewed  inventory documents maintained by the contractor and by the Regional  Security Officer. In June 2009, a joint audit of security firm Blackwater, by  State\u2019s Office of Inspector General and the Special Inspector General for  Iraq Reconstruction, reached similar conclusions.  The audit team was  able to verify all weapons randomly selected from weapons assigned to  Blackwater personnel. The report attributed their ability to verify the  weapons to the level of State oversight through quarterly physical  inventories and other periodic reconciliations by State personnel.  Additionally, a January 2009 audit of security firm Aegis (a private security  contractor) by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction  observed weapons inventory tests at four locations in Iraq and determined  that all items were accounted for."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and DOD have Developed and Implemented Alcohol Policies for Private Security Contractor Personnel in Iraq", "paragraphs": ["State, DOD, and private security contractors have developed and  implemented policies related to the use of alcohol by private security  contractor personnel.

For example, State\u2019s  Worldwide Personal Protective Services contract prohibits private security  contractor personnel from consuming alcohol while on duty and within 6  hours prior to going on duty. Although State does not prohibit alcohol  consumption by private security contractor personnel, private security  contractors with State told us that they have established policies to govern  employee alcohol consumption. Private security contractors with DOD  contracts told us that their employees were subject to General Order #1  and thus were prohibited from possessing or consuming alcohol while in  Iraq. General Order #1, which was established by the Commanding  General of MNC-I, prohibits military personnel or contractors employed by  or accompanying U.S. forces from the introduction, purchase, possession,  sale, transfer, manufacture or consumption of any alcoholic beverage  within MNC-I\u2019s area of responsibility. However, General Order #1 does not  apply to private security contractors who support the State Department.  Private security contractors we spoke with told us that personnel who  violate the established alcohol policies are subject to disciplinary actions  and depending on the severity of the use may have their employment  terminated. When asked how often individuals have been let go due to  alcohol, the contractors indicated that it is not very often. For example,  one firm stated that out of an average staffing level of more than 650 non- Iraqi personnel, it has only terminated 7 employees due to violations of the  alcohol policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 and its implementing  guidance intend to create a consistent, federalwide approach to ensure  that federal employees and contractors with regular access to federal  facilities and installations are sufficiently screened for security risk. As we  reported in 2006, military commanders and other officials are aware of the  risks that contractors pose to U.S. forces in part because of the difficulties  in screening employees, particularly foreign and host country nationals.  While State and DOD have developed policies and procedures to ensure  that U.S. citizen personnel and contractors are screened, only the State  Department has developed departmentwide procedures to screen foreign  national personnel. Efforts within DOD have been stalled by disagreement  over how to develop and implement policies and procedures that comply  with HSPD-12 while fulfilling DOD\u2019s need to provide private security  contractor personnel to fulfill security requirements in Iraq. While we  acknowledge the difficulties of conducting background screenings of  foreign national personnel, the armed nature of private security contractor  personnel presents the need for assurance that all reasonable steps have  been taken to provide for their thorough vetting and minimize the risk they  present. Without a coordinated DOD-wide effort to develop and implement  standardized policies and procedures to ensure that contractor personnel,  particularly foreign national private security contractor personnel, have  been screened, DOD cannot provide this assurance. Even with established  policies and procedures in place, there are inherent risks involved with  employing foreign national personnel, making it critical that military  commanders and contracting officials understand the risks and limitations  associated with background screenings of foreign national personnel.  Additionally, until DOD expands and finalizes guidance related to private  security contractors, including the development of timelines for  combatant commanders, it will not have fully responded to the  congressional concerns which led to the development of Section 862 of the  National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend the five following actions to help ensure that DOD  develops a departmentwide approach to properly screening private  security contractor personnel, including non-United States citizens.

More specifically the focal point should    direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, in  consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics, to develop departmentwide procedures for  conducting and adjudicating background screenings of foreign national  contractor personnel and establish a time frame for implementation;    develop an effective means to communicate to MNF-I the new  procedures so that MNF-I officials can adjust their existing background  screening policies and procedures, if necessary, to comport with the  procedures; and    develop a training program to ensure that military commanders and  contracting officials, including contracting officers and contracting  officers\u2019 representatives, understand the department\u2019s policies and  procedures for background screening as well as their roles and  responsibilities.", "To ensure that DOD fully meets the requirements of Section 862 of the  2008 National Defense Authorization Act we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to:    establish minimum processes and requirements for the selection,  accountability, training, equipping, and conduct of personnel  performing private security functions under a covered contract during  a combat operation;    direct the geographic combatant commanders, through the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to develop and publish the regulations,  orders, directives, instructions, and procedures for private security  contractors operating during a contingency operation within their area  of responsibility;    provide a report to Congress with the timelines for completing the  minimum processes discussed in the recommendation above; and  revise the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require the insertion into  each covered contract a clause addressing the selection, training,  equipping, and conduct of personnel performing private security  functions under such, contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with two of the  five recommendations and partially concurred with three.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense appoint a focal point at a sufficiently senior level and with the  necessary authority to ensure that the appropriate DOD offices coordinate,  develop and implement policies and procedures to conduct and adjudicate  background screenings in a timely manner. In DOD\u2019s response, the  department noted that the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  for Program Support has been designated to be responsible for monitoring  the registration, processing, and accounting of private security contractor  personnel in an area of contingency operations. As we noted in this report,  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD-I) is  responsible for developing DOD\u2019s background screening policy in  conjunction with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) and the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (P&R). While we don\u2019t  dispute the role that the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Program Support has to monitor the registration, processing, and  accounting of private security contractor personnel, we do not believe that  this office is the correct office to resolve disagreements among the offices  responsible for developing DOD\u2019s background screening policy. DOD also  noted that it is in the process of institutionalizing the Operational Contract  Support Functional Capabilities Integrations Board. According to DOD,  the board will provide the senior level oversight to provide cross- component alternatives and recommendations on current and future  capability needs, policies, and investments. Since the board has not yet  been established, we were unable to determine if the board would have  sufficient authority to implement our recommendation or if USD-I will be  included on the board. Unless the board is given the authority to resolve  the policy differences between the USD-I and AT&L and direct the  development of background screening polices, the disagreements that  have hampered the development of screening policies and procedures will  continue.", "In addition, DOD stated that it does not conduct its own background  investigations on foreign nationals and lacks the infrastructure to do so.  The department stated that it depends on the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) to conduct its background investigations. While this  may be true for background investigations that lead to the granting of  security clearances, our report was focused on background screenings  that do not lead to the granting of security clearances. As we noted in this  report, contractors are responsible for conducting background screenings  for their foreign national employees using standards, processes, and  procedures developed by the contractors themselves or as in Iraq,  developed by the military. In addition, in Iraq, MNF-I has developed their  own background screening process to supplement contractor-led  screening of private security contractor personnel. However, as we noted,  the process used in Iraq has several shortcomings. We believe that in order  to meet the intent of this recommendation, the department needs to  develop departmentwide standards and procedures for conducting and  adjudicating background screenings to assure itself that screenings are  providing as much background information as possible and that the  department has a common understanding of what information is or is not  included in a contractor-conducted background screening. Without this  information, military commanders may be unaware of the risks foreign  national private security contractor personnel may pose. Regarding the  department's comment that it will ensure that the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation is modified, it is unclear how the clause can be  modified until standards are developed to include in the clause.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics to establish minimum processes and  requirements for the selection, accountability, training, equipping, and  conduct of personnel performing private security functions under a  covered contract during a combat operation.  As we noted, Section 862 of  the fiscal year 2008 NDAA directed the Secretary of Defense, in  coordination with the Secretary of State, to develop regulations on the  selection, training, equipping, and conduct of private security contractor  personnel under a covered contract in an area of combat operations. DOD  responded that the Interim Final Rule published in the July 17, 2009, issue  of the Federal Register meets the requirements of Section 862 of the fiscal  year 2008 NDAA and that the department was also soliciting input from the  geographical combatant commanders on this subject. While the Interim  Final Rule published in the Federal Register on July 17th contains some  minor variations from the May 2009 draft Interim Final Rule we reviewed  for the purposes of this report, our criticisms of the draft Interim Final  Rule continue to be applicable to the Interim Final Rule published in the  Federal Register. As we noted in our report, the Interim Final Rule directs  geographic combatant commanders to develop procedures consistent with  principles established in existing DOD instructions and directives and  makes reference to existing DOD regulations regarding these areas.  However, neither the draft nor the referenced documents articulate a  process or requirements that geographic combatant commanders can use  to ensure that all private security contractor personnel meet screening and  security requirements. The Interim Final Rule published in the Federal  Register on July 17th contains these same shortcomings. We continue to  believe that DOD should establish minimum processes and requirements  for the selection, accountability, training, equipping, and conduct of  private security contractor personnel to meet the intent of our  recommendation. These processes and requirements could be  strengthened, if necessary, by the geographic combatant commanders. As  we noted, without these minimum standards DOD will not have  reasonable assurance that a minimum level of safety and protection has  been met. In the past, DOD has taken a similar approach. In December  2006, DOD updated the department\u2019s antiterrorism instruction.   The  instruction established minimum DOD antiterrorism measures, while  providing military commanders and civilians with the flexibility and  adaptability to develop measures that are more stringent if conditions  warrant.", "In addition, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to direct the geographic combatant  commanders to develop and publish the regulations, orders, directives,  instructions, and procedures for private security contractors operating  during a contingency operation within their area of responsibility. DOD  stated that this had already been accomplished in large part through the  issuance of Multi-National Forces-Iraq Operations Order 09-01in Iraq and  OPORD 09-03 in Afghanistan. However, the orders cited by DOD are  specific to Iraq and Afghanistan and are not applicable to other geographic  commands.
