For enrollees in HRAs compared with those in traditional plans such as preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, GAO assessed (1) differences in health status, and (2) changes in spending and utilization of health care services. GAO analyzed data from two large employers--one public and one private--that introduced an HRA option in 2003. GAO compared changes in health spending and utilization before and after 2003 for enrollees who switched from a PPO into an HRA (the HRA group) with those who stayed in a PPO (the PPO group). At the time GAO made its data requests to each employer, 2007 data from the public employer and 2005 data from the private employer were the most current and complete data available. GAO also reviewed published studies that included an assessment of the health status, spending, or utilization of HRA and other CDHP enrollees compared with traditional plan enrollees.

Average annual spending per enrollee for the public employer's HRA group was $1,505 lower than the PPO group for the 2-year period prior to switching. (Spending for the public employer was based on analysis of both medical and pharmacy claims.) Likewise, the private employer's HRA group spent $566 less per enrollee for the 2-year period prior to switching than the PPO group (we were not able to examine pharmacy claims for the private employer). Similarly, of the 21 studies GAO reviewed that assessed the health status of HRA and other CDHP enrollees, 18 found they were healthier than traditional plan enrollees based on utilization of health care services, self-reported health status, or the prevalence of certain diseases or disease indicators. Other demographic differences may also explain spending and utilization differences including that policyholders in the HRA group were younger than those in the PPO group. Spending and utilization for enrollees in HRAs generally increased by a smaller amount or decreased compared with those in traditional plans that GAO reviewed. (1) Public employer. From the 2-year period before switching--2001 to 2002--to the 5-year period after switching--2003 to 2007--average annual spending for the HRA group increased by $478 per enrollee compared with $879 for the PPO group. This smaller increase for the HRA group was partially driven by decreases in spending for prescription drugs. Additionally, average annual utilization of services per enrollee increased by a smaller amount or decreased for the HRA group compared with the PPO group for six out of eight services GAO reviewed. (2) Private employer. From the 2-year period before switching--2001 to 2002--to the 3-year period after switching--2003 to 2005--average annual spending for the HRA group increased by $152 per enrollee compared with $206 for the PPO group. This smaller increase for the HRA group was partially driven by smaller increases in spending for physician office visits and decreases in spending for emergency room services. Additionally, average annual utilization of services per enrollee increased by a smaller amount or decreased for the HRA group compared with the PPO group for four out of seven services GAO reviewed. Similarly, GAO's review of published studies found that seven out of eight students that examined spending and controlled for differences in health status or other characteristics reported lower spending among HRAs and other CDHP enrollees relative to traditional plans.

CDHPs combine a high-deductible health plan with a tax- advantaged account that enrollees can use to pay for health care  expenses. One type of CDHP is based on a health reimbursement  arrangement (HRA), a tax-advantaged account that reimburses enrollees  for health care expenses. HRA-based plans typically have higher  deductibles and lower premiums than do traditional health insurance  plans\u2014such as preferred provider organization (PPO) plans\u2014and unused  account balances may carry over from year to year. HRAs are owned by  the employer, and only the employer may make contributions to them.  HRAs are typically not portable and may not be taken by the enrollees if  they leave their employer. Employers began offering CDHPs based on  HRAs in 2001.", "Debate surrounding CDHPs has grown as more employers offer them to  their employees. Proponents contend that the plans can help restrain  health care spending, arguing that the high deductibles and ability to carry  over balances give enrollees an incentive to seek lower-cost health care  services and to obtain services only when necessary. Critics are concerned  that these plans may attract healthier enrollees who use fewer health care  services or may discourage enrollees from obtaining necessary care.", "Many employers, including the federal government, now have several  years\u2019 experience offering CDHPs, particularly the HRAs that were  introduced first.

For enrollees  who switched into an HRA compared with enrollees who stayed in a  traditional plan, we assessed (1) differences in health status and   (2) changes in spending and utilization of health care services. To do this,  we conducted an analysis of an HRA and a traditional health plan for two  large employers and supplemented our work with the results of several  published studies.", "Two large employers. We obtained HRA and PPO plan enrollment and  claims data for plan years 2001 through 2007 for a large public employer  and for plan years 2001 through 2005 for a large private employer.

For each employer, we defined a  group of HRA enrollees and a group of PPO enrollees by analyzing  enrollment data. The HRA group included policyholders who were  continuously enrolled in the PPO in the 2001 and 2002 plan years, switched  into the HRA in the 2003 plan year, and stayed in the HRA for the  remainder of our study periods.

We compared spending and utilization for health care services between  the HRA and PPO groups for each employer before introduction of the  HRA in 2003. This design enabled us to observe the potential effect of  selection bias due to differences in health status or other characteristics  which we did not separately control for between the two groups.

CDHP insurance carriers may also offer online tools to help enrollees  evaluate the cost and quality of health care services and providers. The  two most common types of CDHPs offered are those based on an HRA  beginning in 2001 and those that are eligible to be coupled with a health  savings account (HSA), which were offered beginning in 2004.", "Several studies and surveys have attempted to quantify the individuals  enrolled in CDHPs and the employers that offer them. For example, one  study using national survey data estimates that about 5.5 million  employees were enrolled in CDHPs of which 2.2 million were enrolled in  HRAs and 3.2 million were enrolled in HSA-eligible plans as of 2008.  Furthermore, based on data from the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM)\u2014the agency that administers the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program (FEHBP)\u2014about 57,000 of the nearly 8 million enrollees  in the FEHBP were enrolled in CDHPs in 2009. About 42,000 of these  FEHBP enrollees were in HRAs and about 15,000 were in HSA-eligible  plans. Another study using national survey data found that HRAs were  offered by 8 percent and HSA-eligible plans were offered by   14 percent of employers with 500 or more employees in 2008. CDHPs are  offered by employers as one of a number of plan options, such as PPOs,  health maintenance organizations, or other traditional plans.", "Enrollees in HRAs pay premiums to access covered services. Coverage of  most services is subject to the deductible while other services, such as  preventive care services, may be exempted from the deductible.  Enrollees use their HRA account to pay for qualified medical expenses.  While account balances may accrue from year to year, the accounts are  typically not portable\u2014that is, employees do not own the accounts and  cannot keep unspent funds if they change jobs. HRA accounts are  administered by the employer or an insurance carrier and only employers  may contribute to the accounts. Table 1 describes the key features of  HRAs.", "HRA enrollees must keep track of funds in their accounts. If the funds are  exhausted before the deductible is met in a given year, enrollees are  responsible for paying for the difference out of pocket. After an enrollee  meets the deductible, the plan operates much like a traditional PPO plan.  That is, the plan generally pays for most of the cost of covered services  and the enrollee contributes a cost-sharing amount\u2014which varies by  plan\u2014until meeting the maximum out-of-pocket spending limit, at which  point the plan pays 100 percent of the cost of covered services.
