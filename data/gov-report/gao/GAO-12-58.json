Officials are concerned that disparities in pay and retirement benefits have caused federal police forces to experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining officers. In 2010, the USCP Labor Committee proposed six changes to enhance the USCP benefit structure. GAO was asked to review USCP\u0092s pay and retirement benefits and compare them to other federal police forces in the DC metro area. GAO (1) compared USCP to other forces with respect to retirement benefits, minimum entry-level salary, duties, and employment requirements; (2) compared attrition at USCP to other forces, and determined how, if at all, USCP and other forces used human capital flexibilities (e.g., retention bonus); and (3) determined what level of retirement income USCP benefits provide and the costs associated with the proposed benefit enhancements. GAO chose nine other federal police forces to review based on prior work, inclusion in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) police occupational series, and officer presence in the DC metro area. GAO analyzed laws, regulations, OPM data from fiscal years 2005 through 2010, and human capital data from the 10 police forces. GAO also surveyed the 10 forces.", "USCP and the Office of Personnel Management generally agreed with our findings and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USCP generally has enhanced retirement benefits, a higher minimum starting salary, and a wider variety of protective duties than other federal police forces in the DC metro area that GAO reviewed, but has similar employment requirements. Even though USCP, Park Police, Supreme Court Police, and Secret Service Uniformed Division are federal police forces, they provide enhanced retirement benefits similar to those offered by federal law enforcement agencies that have additional investigative duties. These enhanced benefits allow their officers to retire early and accrue retirement pensions faster than other federal police forces. USCP and these three forces also offered among the highest minimum entry-level salaries\u0097ranging from $52,020 to $55,653\u0097than the other six forces GAO reviewed, which had minimum entry-level salaries ranging from $38,609 to $52,018. USCP reported routinely having a wider variety of duties than most other forces. These duties ranged from routinely protecting members of Congress to protecting buildings. USCP and most of the forces generally have similar employment requirements, such as being in good physical condition.", "USCP\u0092s attrition rate is generally lower than the majority of the federal police forces in our review; and USCP and seven of the other nine police forces considered human capital flexibilities to be at least of some importance to recruiting and retaining qualified officers, but use of these flexibilities generally depends on recruiting needs, among other factors. From fiscal years 2005 through 2010, USCP had the fourth lowest attrition rate (6.5 percent) among the 10 police forces GAO reviewed; the attrition rates for the nine other forces ranged from 3.5 percent to just under 14 percent. Officials from USCP and four other forces GAO reviewed stated that, currently, attrition is not a problem because of the challenging economy. For example, officials from USCP and Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police stated that their officers want to retain their jobs in the challenging economy. In addition, USCP and other forces said that when their officers do leave the force, they generally do so either because of personal reasons or for better career advancement opportunities, and officers generally stay for reasons such as good working environment or appreciation for the agency\u0092s mission. The extent to which retirement benefits, pay, and use of human capital flexibilities affect attrition can vary among forces given other factors\u0097such as family issues\u0097that could influence an employee\u0092s decision to leave or remain with his or her employer.", "If fully utilized, benefits for USCP officers who retire at the age of 57 under existing provisions generally would be within the range of retirement income targets suggested by some retirement experts. However, the level of benefits depends significantly on the level of employee retirement contributions. In 2010, the USCP Labor Committee presented six proposals that would enhance the current USCP benefit structure. GAO\u0092s analysis shows that five of the six would increase existing costs, GAO\u0092s review found the other proposal, which urges the USCP Board to exercise its current authority to allow officers to voluntarily remain employed until age 60 rather than retire at age 57, as mandated, would have only a minimal impact on USCP costs and could increase officers\u0092 retirement income."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the epicenter for federal government operations, the Washington D.C.,  metropolitan area is home to many federal police forces\u2014including the  United States Capitol Police (USCP)\u2014which play a key role in  maintaining the safety and security of federal property, employees, and  the general public. Since 2003, officials at some of these police forces  have raised concerns that disparities in pay and retirement benefits have  caused their police forces to experience difficulties in recruiting and  retaining officers. For example, after the expansion of the Federal Air  Marshal Program in 2003, concerns about disparities in pay and  retirement benefits increased as the expansion created relatively high- paying job opportunities for existing federal police officers and reportedly  lured many experienced officers from their police forces. In 2010, the  USCP Labor Committee\u2014the bargaining unit for USCP officers\u2014raised  concerns about whether retirement benefits offered by the USCP are  adequate to attract and retain enough qualified officers, and it proposed  six changes related to the USCP retirement benefit structure intended to  improve retention. The USCP Labor Committee stated that a major factor  in officers\u2019 decisions to leave the agency is insufficient retirement  benefits. We reported in July 2009 on the importance of considering a  variety of organizational, personal, and economic factors, as well as  compensation and human capital flexibilities, when assessing the need to  increase retirement benefits.

CSRS is a defined benefit plan\u2014 meaning that the employer promises a specified monthly benefit during  retirement that is predetermined by a formula; in the case of CSRS, the  benefit amount and eligibility depend on the employee\u2019s earnings history,  tenure of service, and age. The defined benefit plan is funded by both  employee and agency contributions as well as additional contributions  from the U.S. Treasury. CSRS covered employment is generally not  considered covered employment for the purposes of Social Security;  hence, CSRS covered employees do not also receive Social Security  benefits. FERS is a retirement plan that provides benefits from three  different sources: a defined benefit plan, Social Security, and TSP.

For example,  under statutory and regulatory retirement provisions, federal employees  who meet the retirement-related definitions of an LEO receive more  generous retirement benefits under CSRS and FERS than non-LEO  employees. Coverage under CSRS and FERS LEO definitional criteria  generally include those personnel whose duties have been determined by  the employing agency through an administrative process to be primarily  the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or  convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States. The  FERS definition of a LEO is more restrictive than the CSRS LEO  definition in that it expressly includes a rigorous duty standard, which  provides that LEO positions must be sufficiently rigorous such that  \u201cemployment opportunities should be limited to young and physically  vigorous individuals.\u201d In general, neither LEO definitions under CSRS or  FERS have been interpreted by OPM to cover federal police officers.  Implementing OPM regulations for CSRS and FERS provide that the  respective LEO regulatory definitions, in general, do not include an  employee whose primary duties involve maintaining order, protecting life  and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or  investigating persons other than those who are suspected or convicted of  offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, which are akin to  the responsibilities of federal police officers. Federal police officers might  also be treated, for retirement purposes, as \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d  (that is, granted LEO-like status) under two additional scenarios. First,  over the years, certain other federal police forces whose duties have not  been determined by their employing agency to meet the LEO definitional  criteria under the administrative process have been explicitly added to the  CSRS or FERS statutory definitions so that they are considered LEOs for  retirement purposes. Second, certain other federal police forces whose  duties have not been determined by their employing agency to be within  the scope of the definitional criteria of a LEO or explicitly added by  amending statutory LEO definitions, have been provided retirement  benefits similar to that of LEOs directly through legislation.", "Generally, federal LEOs (and officers with LEO-like status) have a higher  benefit accrual rate than most other federal employees, albeit over a  shorter period of time due to the mandatory retirement age for LEOs.

For example, LEOs receive FERS cost-of-living  adjustments beginning at retirement, even if retirement is earlier than age  62, instead of at age 62 when most other FERS retirees become eligible  for these adjustments. Under FERS, LEOs also qualify for an unreduced  early retirement benefit and may retire at age 50 with a minimum of 20  years of qualifying service, or at any age with at least 25 years of  qualifying service, which are also more generous than the corresponding  provisions for most other FERS participants. LEOs are also subject to  mandatory retirement at age 57 with 20 years of service. They are also  eligible to receive the special FERS supplement upon retirement that  mimics the Social Security retirement benefits earned during federal  government service. FERS retirees continue to receive the supplement  until they reach age 62 and become eligible to collect Social Security.

At the same  time, five other police forces\u2014Supreme Court Police, FBI Police, FEMA  Police, Pentagon Police, and Postal Security Force\u2014cited career  advancement as the reason for officer attrition. Specifically, career  advancement, as stated by the agencies, was either the acceptance of a  higher level position at another agency or a transfer to an agency that has  greater potential for future promotion. For example, our analysis shows  that the majority of FBI\u2019s voluntarily-separated officers transferred to  different positions within the agency, such as an agent or intelligence  analyst position. FBI Police officials said that applicants often view the  police officer position as a stepping stone to advance to these positions.", "For example, USCP and three  Furthermore, USCP and three other police forces reported that quality-of- life was one of the main reasons police officers stay with their forces,  citing such underlying factors as the work environment and work-life  balance. USCP said that pay and job security were two other main  reasons that police officers remain employed by the force. Also, 6 of the  10 forces stated that agency mission was a key reason that officers stay  with their agencies. Figure 9 summarizes the primary reasons that federal  police force officials offered for why their officers leave or stay.", "While the USCP Labor Committee asserted that inadequate retirement  benefits have contributed to attrition among USCP officers, USCP did not  report retirement benefits as a reason why its officers left, as shown in  figure 9. On the other hand, there were other police forces that identified  inadequate retirement benefits as a reason for officer attrition\u2014BEP  Police, FBI Police, and Pentagon Police\u2014which were among the police  forces that offer standard, as opposed to enhanced, retirement benefits.  However, our analysis suggests that the fact that a police force offers  enhanced retirement benefits does not necessarily mean that it will have  lower attrition compared to others police forces, and vice versa. For  example, the Secret Service Uniformed Division offers enhanced  retirement benefits, yet it had the second highest attrition rate among the  federal police forces, whereas NIH Police offers standard retirement  benefits and has one of the lowest attrition rates.  Further, none of the  police forces that offered enhanced retirement benefits cited those  benefits as a reason why officers stayed at their police force.", "Although the difference in retirement benefits may not fully indicate why  officers leave a police force, it may influence the timing of when officers  leave. For all of the police forces with enhanced retirement benefits, a  greater percentage of the officers who left\u201473 percent\u2014did so within the  first 5 years of service or after 20 years of service, compared to those  forces with standard retirement benefits, where 54 percent of separating  officers left either within the first 5 years of service or after 20 years of  service. The Director of USCP Human Resources stated that if an officer  stays with USCP beyond 5 years, that officer is likely to stay at least until  the individual reaches early retirement, generally after 20 or 25 years of  service. Figure 10 compares the timing of separation of police officers at  police forces with enhanced retirement benefits to those with standard  retirement benefits from fiscal years 2005 through 2010.", "As with greater retirement benefits, desire for a better salary was not cited  by a majority of police forces as a reason why officers leave from or stay  with their forces. As shown in figure 9, only 2 of the 10 forces\u2014FBI Police  and Postal Security Force\u2014said that officers leave for better salaries, and  3 of the 10 forces\u2014USCP, Park Police, and Pentagon Police\u2014said that  officers stay for better salaries. Also, federal police forces with higher  minimum entry-level salaries did not always have lower attrition. For  example, USCP and Secret Service Uniformed Division were among the  highest paid federal police forces. USCP had among the lowest attrition,  and Secret Service Uniformed Division had among the highest. Further,  NIH Police, which offered one of the lowest minimum entry-level salaries,  maintained the second lowest attrition from fiscal years 2005 through  2010, as displayed in table 3.", "Most of the police forces in our review stated that the use of human  capital flexibilities was of at least some importance for recruiting and  retaining officers. Five of the 10 federal police forces in our study,  including USCP, reported that human capital flexibilities were important or  very important to recruiting and retaining police officers, while two police  forces\u2014Postal Security Force and FEMA Police\u2014stated that they were  not important. The other forces\u2014FBI Police, Park Police, and Supreme  Court Police\u2014reported that human capital flexibilities are somewhat or  moderately important. Further, NIH Police was the sole police force that  reported a human capital flexibility as one of the primary reasons that  officers remained employed by their police force. Figure 11 identifies the  federal police forces\u2019 views on the importance of human capital  flexibilities.", "USCP and the other police forces offered a variety of human capital  flexibilities related to work-life balance, relocation and position  classification, and recruitment and retention, among others. For example,  all of the police forces, except the USCP, reported offering cash  performance bonuses to their officers. USCP officials noted that they did  not offer this particular flexibility because it was not necessary to recruit  and retain officers. Conversely, in some cases, flexibilities that were  available to police forces to use were not offered to police officers. For  example, three police forces\u2014USCP, Park Police and FEMA Police\u2014 reported that they did not use all of the recruitment and retention  flexibilities available to them because they were not needed since they  have a sufficient number of applicants. USCP and Park Police officials  further stated that they did not offer these flexibilities due to budget  constraints. Other human capital flexibilities were not offered because  they were not available to police forces. Police forces generally reported  not having some flexibilities available to their agencies because they had  not requested that such flexibilities be made available, explaining that  they did not need them as they were able to attract qualified applicants  without offering more flexibilities. For example, the transportation subsidy  was not available to Postal Security Force because, according to Postal  Security Force officials, they did not need this flexibility to be made  available to their force as they did not have difficulty in attracting  applicants. Figure 12 provides information on federal police forces\u2019  human capital flexibilities.", "Even though human capital flexibilities are intended to be a tool to recruit  and retain employees, and most of the police forces considered them at  least somewhat important, the police forces that offered a wider variety of  human capital flexibilities did not always have lower attrition rates. For  example, NIH Police and Secret Service Uniformed Division were the two  forces that offered the widest variety of flexibilities. Yet, NIH Police had  the second lowest attrition rate, and Secret Service Uniformed Division  had the second highest attrition rate.", "While retirement benefits, pay, and use of human capital flexibilities could  affect attrition, the extent to which they do so can vary for a given agency,  and other factors\u2014such as family issues and promotion opportunities, as  previously discussed\u2014could influence an employee\u2019s decision to leave or  remain with his or her employer.

However, the level of benefits depends significantly on the level of  employee TSP contributions. In 2010, the USCP Labor Committee  presented six proposals that would enhance the current USCP benefit  structure. Five of the six would increase existing costs; our review found  that the other proposal, which urges the USCP Board to exercise its  current authority by allowing officers to voluntarily remain on the job until  age 60 rather than retire at 57, as mandated, would have a minimal  impact on costs to the federal government and could improve officers\u2019  retirement benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Existing FERS Benefits Vary Depending on Level of TSP Contributions", "paragraphs": ["In June 2011 we reported that there was little consensus among experts  about how much income constitutes adequate retirement income. The  replacement rate is one measure some economists and financial advisors  use as a guide for retirement planning; it is the percentage of pre- retirement income that is received annually in retirement. Our review  showed that some economists and financial advisors considered  retirement income adequate if the ratio of retirement income to  preretirement income\u2014the replacement rate\u2014is from 65 to 85 percent.", "To illustrate the effect of current FERS provisions on retirement income,  we analyzed retirement benefits for illustrative USCP workers hired at  ages 22, 27, and 37, retiring at age 57, and making three different levels   Overall, we found the  of TSP contributions, as described in appendix I.total replacement rates for retirement at age 57 ranged from a low of  about 54 percent for a worker hired at age 37 making no TSP  contributions to 91 percent for a worker hired at age 22 making 10  percent TSP contributions, as shown in figure 13. A worker hired at age  27, which is the average age at which individuals are hired by USCP,  retiring at age 57, and contributing 5 percent to TSP (and thereby getting  the maximum employer match) would have a replacement rate of 75  percent, which would be in the middle of recommended replacement rate  targets. Among our illustrative examples, only workers hired at age 37 or  those who made no contributions to their TSP accounts would have  replacement rates below 75 percent. Workers hired at age 37 may also  have retirement income through prior employment. These are examples  of individual workers, not households, since we had no basis for  simulating the income and retirement benefits of spouses. Any benefits  spouses received would add to household retirement income. These  examples also assume there is no leakage from the TSP accounts in the  form of TSP loans that are not repaid or lump-sum distributions that are  not used as retirement income.", "Our analysis also shows that employee TSP contribution levels over the  course of a career can make a significant difference to total retirement  income. For workers hired at age 27, for example, increasing the  contribution rate from 0 to 5 percent over the entire career would increase  replacement rates at age 57 by 11 percentage points, bringing them from  just below the recommended target range to the middle of it. In general,  the longer a worker\u2019s career, the more years they make contributions and  earn investment returns, and the greater a difference the contribution rate  makes. According to USCP data, in 2010, 12 percent of officers made no  contributions to TSP, and another 10 percent contributed less than 5  percent of pay, thereby forgoing some portion of the full employer  matching contribution, as shown in figure 14. However, the data suggest  that workers typically do increase their contributions over time, and 54  percent of officers contribute more than 5 percent of pay.", "In 2010, the USCP Labor Committee provided selected members of  Congress with six proposed changes to further enhance the current  USCP benefit structure. None of the proposals included cost estimates,  nor have CBO or OPM estimated the costs of any of the proposed  changes. Based on our review, we found that five of the six proposals, if  adopted, would increase costs and increase current pay and benefit  disparities between USCP and other federal LEO and non-LEO groups.  One proposal, which suggests that the USCP Board further exercise its  current discretionary authority to allow officers to voluntarily remain on the  job until age 60, would have a minimal effect on costs. Table 4  discusses each proposal and its potential effect on costs to the federal  government and officers\u2019 benefits.", "The sixth and final proposal suggests that the USCP Board exercise its  authority to allow officers to remain employed until age 60. The Board  currently has the discretionary authority to exempt officers with 20 years  of service from the mandatory retirement age of 57 if an officer\u2019s  continued service is deemed to be in the public interest. According to  USCP, the Board has approved 17 such exemptions since Sept. 30,  2006: 16 in 2008 and 1 in 2010. It is unclear how many current officers  would be affected by this proposal. According to USCP data, the average  age at which officers retired from 2005 through 2010 retired was 54\u20143  years before the mandatory retirement age of 57.", "The actual costs associated with this proposal would be contingent on the  number of officers who chose to work longer. However, if the USCP  Board deemed it to be in the public interest to allow more officers to  voluntarily work past age 57, projections show a slight reduction in  pension costs and a slight increase in payroll costs, largely offsetting  each other and resulting in a minimal overall long-term cost impact.  However, according to OPM, the savings actually realized by USCP  directly due to reduced pension costs would be further minimized  because the costs and savings would be distributed across the entire  LEO population, under the cost allocation methodology used for FERS. In  terms of USCP payroll costs, the later retirements would result in a less  than 1 percent increase in total payroll throughout the projection period.  This increase in payroll costs would largely offset the savings in pension  costs, so that the overall net long-term cost effect to USCP of this  proposal could be a very small or minimal increase, depending on the  amount of pension costs allocated to USCP directly when distributed  across the LEO population. In addition, the costs associated with paying  agency matching contributions to officers\u2019 TSP accounts would also be  minimal since the total increase could not exceed 5 percent of the less  than 1 percent increase in payroll costs.", "According to our analysis, retiring at age 60 instead of 57 could  significantly increase retirement incomes\u2014more through TSP  contributions than through the FERS annuity. The effect of later  retirement on the FERS basic annuity is fairly predictable; under the  FERS LEO provisions, the benefit formula provides 1 percent of final  average pay for each year of additional service after 20 years. The effect  on Social Security benefits would be relatively small, but could vary  somewhat depending on whether USCP officers continued to work in  Social Security covered employment after retiring from USCP. Retiring  later has the greatest effect on the TSP component of retirement income  for those who contribute to TSP. USCP officers would increase the  number of years they make TSP contributions, receive the agency match  and earn investment returns and reduce the number of years that they  would draw down their TSP accounts in retirement. Still the size of that  effect depends on the level of lifetime TSP contributions. As shown in  figure 15, taking all three FERS components into account, retiring at age  60 instead of 57 would increase total replacement rates by as little at  4 percentage points for workers making no TSP contributions and by as  much as 10 percentage points for workers contributing 10 percent of pay  to TSP.", "Moreover, taking all three FERS components into account, employee  TSP contribution levels over the course of a career can make more of a  difference to retirement income than 3 additional years of service. In the  case of workers hired at age 22 and contributing a constant 5 percent of  wages to TSP, retiring at age 60 instead of 57 increases total  replacement rates by 8 percentage points from 83 percent to 91 percent.  In contrast, increasing the employee contribution rate from 0 to 5 percent  over the entire career would increase replacement rates by 14  percentage points if retiring at age 57."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to USCP and  the nine other federal police forces included in this review; the USCP  Labor Committee; and OPM.

OPM stated that the cost savings actually realized by  USCP from raising the mandatory retirement age for USCP personnel  would be small because the estimated reductions in annual pension costs  would be spread across all LEO-employing agencies under the cost  allocation methodology used for FERS. We revised our report to clarify  this point. OPM also states that increasing the mandatory retirement age  is unnecessary since LEO retirement benefits provide a higher annuity  rate in order to make early retirement at age 57 economically feasible and  inconsistent with other retirement provisions that provide enhanced  accrual rates for USCP in comparison to other, non-LEO federal  employees. We are not taking a position on whether or not to raise the  mandatory retirement age for USCP personnel in this report. Rather, the  report provides information on some of the possible effects of doing so,  namely that it could increase retirement security at a minimal cost. This  report also shows that, generally, the effect of greater employee  participation in TSP can provide a larger boost in post-retirement income  than the effect of working 3 additional years on the defined benefit portion  of retirement income.
