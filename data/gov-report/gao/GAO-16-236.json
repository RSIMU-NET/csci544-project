To effectively identify and mitigate this risk, DOD began requiring its agencies in 2013 and its contractors in 2014, to report data on suspect counterfeit parts. A Senate report included a provision for GAO to review DOD's efforts to secure its supply chain from counterfeit parts.

Defense agencies and contractor officials explained that congressional attention to counterfeit parts in 2011 and 2012 led to increased reporting, and that the lower number of reports in more recent years is partly the result of better practices to prevent the purchase of counterfeit parts.", "Number of Suspect Counterfeit Reports for Fiscal Years 2011\u20132015", "Several aspects of DOD's implementation of its mandatory GIDEP reporting for suspect counterfeit parts have limited GIDEP's effectiveness as an early warning system.", "First, DOD is not conducting oversight to ensure that defense agencies are reporting as required. As a result, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), for example, may be underreporting suspect counterfeit parts in GIDEP.", "Second, there is no standardized process for establishing how much evidence is needed before reporting suspect counterfeit parts in GIDEP and DLA applies a significantly more stringent standard than, for example, the Navy. Consequently, reports may not be submitted in a timely manner.", "Third, defense agencies typically limit access of suspect counterfeit GIDEP reports to government agencies, so industry is not aware of the potential counterfeiting issues identified. DOD policy does not include guidance about when access to these reports should be limited.", "All seven contractors GAO spoke with have established systems to detect and avoid counterfeit electronic parts; however, DOD has not finalized how these systems will be assessed. Contractors are seeking additional clarification on how to meet some of DOD's requirements.

GAO continues to believe clarifying criteria is important, which is different than specific implementation details."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) draws from a large network of global  suppliers and, in fiscal year 2014, managed over 4.7 million parts that are  used in, for example, communication and weapon systems, at a cost of  over $96 billion. The existence of counterfeit parts in the DOD supply  chain can, for example, delay missions, affect the integrity of systems,  and ultimately endanger the lives of service members. Almost anything is  at risk of being counterfeited, including microelectronics used in fighter  jets and missile guidance systems, fasteners used in aircraft, and  materials used in engine mounts. In response to this risk, in 2013, DOD  created a Counterfeit Prevention Policy for department-wide action to  mitigate the risk of counterfeit parts, which included steps to prevent the  introduction of counterfeit materials into the supply chain, as well as  testing and other means by which to detect materials that may have  already entered it. DOD also issued regulations, as required by the  2012 National Defense Authorization Act, requiring that its personnel and  contractors report suspected counterfeit electronic parts to a cooperative  activity between government and industry for sharing technical  information called the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program  (GIDEP)\u2014a program that allows government and industry participants to  share information on nonconforming parts, including suspect counterfeit  parts, via a web-based database\u2014and that contractors develop and  maintain systems to detect and avoid counterfeit electronic parts.", "Congress has raised questions about DOD\u2019s ability to secure the supply  chain and report on counterfeit or suspect counterfeit parts. The Senate  Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for  GAO to review DOD\u2019s efforts to address vulnerabilities to counterfeit parts  in its supply chain. This report determines (1) the use of GIDEP to report  suspect counterfeit parts, from fiscal years 2011 through 2015; (2) the  effectiveness of GIDEP reporting as an early warning system for  counterfeit parts; (3) the extent to which DOD has assessed defense  contractors\u2019 systems for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts; and (4)  key ongoing efforts by selected government and industry organizations to  improve the detection and reporting of counterfeit or suspect counterfeit  parts.", "To do this work, we examined laws and regulations regarding counterfeit  parts, including section 818 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization  Act, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), as well as reviewed DOD  counterfeit prevention policies and guidance relating to detecting and  avoiding counterfeit parts. We reviewed the guidance on reporting  counterfeit parts from the military services (the Departments of the Army,  Air Force, and Navy) as well as from the Defense Contract Management  Agency (DCMA), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and Missile Defense  Agency (MDA) and interviewed officials about relevant policies and  practices. We also analyzed data from GIDEP and the Product Data  Reporting and Evaluation Program (PDREP) to determine the extent and  limitations in reporting suspect and confirmed counterfeit parts for fiscal  years 2011 through 2015. After interviewing GIDEP program officials and  reviewing the entire GIDEP database and related documents, we  determined that the data was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We selected seven contractors by identifying the top five prime  contractors based on dollar value from contracts containing the 2014  DFARS clause for counterfeit detection and avoidance, as well as two  additional major prime contractors. From each, we reviewed one sample  contract as well as selected contractor procedures and systems for  detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts; and identified and evaluated  DOD\u2019s systems for monitoring contractor compliance with related  regulations. We reviewed documents and met with officials from other  selected federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security  and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); as well  as organizations including SAE International, Aerospace Industries  Association, and the Independent Distributors of Electronics Association  to obtain information about efforts to detect and avoid counterfeit parts.  We visited DLA\u2019s Land and Maritime Division in Columbus, Ohio; where  the agency maintains an electronic testing facility and an authentication  program for microcircuits, and the product testing facilities at the Naval  Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana. We assessed DOD\u2019s policies,  procedures and practices against criteria in Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government. Appendix I provides a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD draws from a large number of suppliers in a global supply chain\u2014in  both the acquisition phase and throughout a system\u2019s operational and  sustainment phases\u2014providing multiple opportunities for the risk of  counterfeit parts into these systems. DOD contractors rely on thousands  of subcontractors and suppliers, including the original component  manufacturers that assemble microcircuits and the mid-level  manufacturers subcontracted to develop the individual subsystems that  make up a complete system or supply. Once contractors deliver a system  to the military services, DLA can play a critical role in its sustainment. For  example, DLA is primarily responsible for logistical support for more than  2,400 weapon systems across the military services. As part of its  sustainment functions, DLA provides approximately 90 percent of the  military\u2019s repair parts. Also, as systems age, products required to support  them may no longer be available from original component manufacturers,  original equipment manufacturers or their authorized distributors. These  products could be available from independent distributors, brokers, or  aftermarket manufacturers; but these suppliers often have less  traceability to the original source. DOD has adopted industry standards  and continues to participate in government and industry groups that  develop international standards for the aerospace and automotive  industry, such as the SAE International\u2019s G-19 Committee. Specifically, in  2009 DOD adopted SAE International\u2019s Aerospace Standard 5553  Counterfeit Electronic Parts: Avoidance, Detection, Mitigation and  Disposition (AS5553) that includes definitions of the sources of supply for  parts, and associated risk, which was updated in 2013 (as shown in  figure 1).", "According to DLA officials, DLA does not use AS5553 because it is  generally applied to system integrators, but uses other aerospace  standards to govern its procurement of microelectronic parts from  individual suppliers. These standards emphasize the importance of  purchasing parts from original component manufacturers or authorized  suppliers\u2014when available\u2014as the most effective method to avoid  counterfeit parts. If purchasing a part from an independent distributor is  necessary, the buyer should consider applying additional counterfeit  mitigation methods, such as testing for product verification, based on the  risk of the supplier and criticality of the part.", "Over the past 6 years, GAO, Congress, and the Department of  Commerce have issued reports on the existence of counterfeit parts in  the DOD supply chain. In three reports since 2010, we have identified  risks and challenges associated with counterfeit parts and counterfeit  prevention at both DOD and NASA, including inconsistent definitions of  counterfeit parts and poorly targeted quality control practices, as well as  potential barriers to improvements to these practices. In 2012, we  created a fictitious company, and through it were able to report on the  availability of suspect counterfeit electronic parts available for purchase  from companies selling military-grade parts on the Internet. In our prior  reports, we made a total of five recommendations for improvements. DOD  has taken action to implement three of these recommendations, but  neither DOD nor NASA have yet implemented the remaining two  recommendations: on tracking the frequency with which parts with quality  issues, including counterfeit parts, make their way into the supply chain;  and on making that information available to Congress. In 2012, Senate  investigators reported that approximately 1,800 instances of suspect  counterfeit parts were identified by DLA, defense contractors and testers  in the 2-year period from 2009 to 2010\u2014before reporting suspect  counterfeit parts in GIDEP became mandatory\u2014and that the vast majority  of those cases appeared to have gone unreported to DOD or criminal  authorities.", "To enhance DOD\u2019s efforts to detect and avoid counterfeit electronic parts,  Section 818 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act directed DOD  to define suspect and confirmed counterfeit electronic parts, implement a  risk-based approach to mitigate the risk of counterfeit electronic parts,  and use GIDEP to report counterfeit incidents. It also included specific  sections pertaining to DOD\u2019s supply chain\u2014requiring certain DOD  contractors to enhance their systems to detect and avoid counterfeit  electronic parts, and to report all counterfeit and suspect counterfeit  electronic parts in GIDEP within 60 days. Finally, Section 818 required  DOD to revise DFARS so that costs of rework or corrective action  associated with a counterfeit electronic part supplied by certain  contractors are not allowable under DOD contracts. Figure 2 shows the  timeline of congressional and DOD actions relating to counterfeit parts  from 2011 to 2014.", "DOD issued its Counterfeit Prevention Policy in April 2013. The policy  aims to 1) prevent the introduction of counterfeit materiel at any level of  the DOD supply chain, including electronic parts; and 2) provide direction  for anti-counterfeit measures for DOD weapon and information systems  acquisition and sustainment to prevent the introduction of counterfeit  materiel. While the instructions in Section 818 to DOD are specifically  applied to counterfeit electronic parts, the policy applies to all counterfeit  materiel, not just electronic parts. DOD\u2019s Counterfeit Prevention Policy  provides the following definitions for counterfeit items:", "Counterfeit materiel: an item that is an unauthorized copy or substitute  that has been identified, marked, or altered by a source other than the  item\u2019s legally authorized source and has been misrepresented to be  an authorized item of the legally authorized source.", "Suspect counterfeit: materiel, items, or products in which there is an  indication by visual inspection, testing, or other information that it may  meet the definition of counterfeit materiel.", "The Counterfeit Prevention Policy established roles and responsibilities  for implementing DOD\u2019s anti-counterfeiting strategy as well as GIDEP  reporting for counterfeit parts. Three offices within the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD AT&L) have  primary responsibility for counterfeit parts. First, the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness is designated as the  primary point of contact office with the primary responsibility to  implement, monitor, and continually develop DOD\u2019s anti-counterfeit  strategy. Second, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and  Engineering, among other responsibilities, acts as the principal point of  contact for GIDEP and is to determine and implement enhancements to  GIDEP to expand its usefulness and robustness in anti-counterfeiting  efforts in the DOD supply chain. Finally, the Director of Defense  Procurement, Acquisition Policy, and Strategic Sourcing develops and  modifies procurement policies, procedures, regulations, and guidance to  support DOD\u2019s Counterfeit Prevention Policy.", "DOD\u2019s Counterfeit Prevention Policy requires DOD component heads to  report all occurrences of suspect and confirmed counterfeit parts in  GIDEP, DOD\u2019s central reporting repository for suspect or confirmed  counterfeit parts. Managed by DOD\u2019s Defense Standardization Program  Office, GIDEP manages a web-based program that allows government  and industry participants to share information on nonconforming parts,  including but not limited to counterfeit parts (confirmed and suspected).  Other types of information reported by GIDEP includes notices for when  production of a part is about to be discontinued or when the attributes of  parts, components, or materials have been changed by a manufacturer. A  part that is found to be nonconforming is not necessarily counterfeit as  counterfeit parts involve the intent to misrepresent the identity or pedigree  of a part. DOD also uses the term \u201cdeficient\u201d to have the same meaning  as \u201cnonconforming.\u201d The Policy requires the reporting of all occurrences  of suspect and confirmed counterfeit materiel to (1) appropriate  authorities, nonconformance reporting systems, and GIDEP within  60 calendar days; and (2) DOD criminal investigative organizations and  other DOD law enforcement authorities at the earliest opportunity. It  further states that when critical materiel is identified as suspect  counterfeit, to expeditiously disseminate a notification to other DOD  components to maintain weapon systems operational performance and  preserve life or safety of operating personnel. According to several DOD  officials we spoke with, GIDEP is intended to be an early warning system.  DOD military services and components also use two other systems to  report nonconforming parts\u2014the Product Data Reporting and Evaluation  Program (PDREP) and the Joint Deficiency Reporting System. In both  systems, users can specifically categorize reported nonconforming parts  as suspect counterfeit. As DOD\u2019s Counterfeit Prevention Policy mandates  documenting all occurrences of suspect counterfeit parts in GIDEP,  entries into these other systems do not fulfill the DOD reporting  requirement. In May 2014, DOD revised the DFARS to require that  contractors subject to cost accounting standards, when delivering  electronic parts or supplies containing electronic parts, 1) report suspect  and confirmed counterfeit electronic parts in GIDEP; and 2) have systems  in place to detect and avoid counterfeit electronic parts. Additionally, the  DFARS requires that prime contractors subject to the cost accounting  standards flow down these requirements to their subcontractors,  regardless of whether those subcontractors are subject to the cost  accounting standards. Prime contractors not subject to the cost  accounting standards are not required to apply or flow down these  requirements. The new counterfeit prevention policies supplement  long-standing FAR contract quality requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defense Agencies and Contractors Are Submitting Fewer Counterfeit Parts Reports in GIDEP", "paragraphs": ["Defense contractors and agencies are submitting counterfeit parts  reports, but fewer reports have been submitted to GIDEP since DOD  implemented its Counterfeit Prevention Policy and reporting requirements  in 2013. For fiscal years 2011 through 2015, we found that 526 reports of  suspect counterfeit parts were entered in GIDEP, over 90 percent of  which were submitted by contractors. Figure 3 shows the number of  reports submitted by contractors and government agencies in each fiscal  year.", "Most of these reports were submitted in 2011 and 2012, when some DOD  and contractor officials we spoke with said that congressional attention to  counterfeit parts prompted contractors to examine their inventory and  identify previously undetected counterfeit parts. In addition, there was an  amnesty period in early fiscal year 2011 when suspect counterfeit parts  reports could be submitted without naming a supplier, which DOD officials  said led to temporarily increased reporting, mostly from distributors who  have submitted few reports since. In more recent years, defense  agencies and contractors we met with stated that they have encountered  counterfeit parts less frequently in the DOD supply chain, in part, because  they are applying more stringent standards about which independent  distributors they rely on for parts that cannot be acquired directly from the  original manufacturer.", "While the names of the suppliers can be identified in GIDEP reports,  almost half of 526 GIDEP reports in our analysis did not include the name  of the supplier for the parts in question. Further, the reports do not always  indicate the original source from whom the supplier purchased the  counterfeit part, which could be further down the supply chain and may or  may not be known by the entity submitting the report. At our request,  GIDEP staff categorized the suppliers identified in counterfeit parts  reports issued in fiscal years 2011 through 2015 by their role in the supply  chain, based on their personal knowledge and industry expertise, and we  conducted analysis based on these classifications. In the 296 reports  that contained supplier information, 319 unique suppliers were named.  Of these, 88 percent were classified by GIDEP staff as independent  distributors and 10 percent were classified as midlevel manufacturers.  One independent distributor was named in 30 different GIDEP reports, all  of which were submitted by one original equipment manufacturer within a  7-month period.", "GIDEP staff also provided classifications for the entities that submitted  GIDEP reports by their role in the supply chain, upon which we based our  analysis. From fiscal years 2011 through 2015, we found that nearly  40 percent of suspect counterfeit parts reports\u2014207 of 526\u2014were  submitted by independent distributors, with three companies submitting  103 reports. In addition, one-third of all suspect counterfeit GIDEP  reports\u2014178 of 526\u2014were submitted by original equipment  manufacturers, with 122 of these 178 reports submitted by two  manufacturers, while government agencies submitted only 43 reports.  DOD submitted 40 of 43 government reports, with the Navy submitting  more than half of these. See appendix II for additional details of reports  by role of reporting entity in the supply chain.", "The Army, the Air Force and MDA did not submit any suspect counterfeit  GIDEP reports in this period. Air Force officials explained that they have  relied on their contractors to submit reports because they have the best  knowledge of how and where the counterfeit part was procured. Similarly,  officials from the Army and MDA also said that their contractors have  submitted suspect counterfeit GIDEP reports related to parts procured for  Army and MDA products. Specifically, MDA officials said that their  contractors submitted five of the GIDEP reports we reviewed, some of  which involved parts detected due to concerns raised by MDA. DLA  officials also noted that they encourage contractors and subcontractors to  submit reports when counterfeit parts are encountered. However,  according to DOD officials, most of DLA\u2019s contractors are not large  enough to follow cost accounting standards and therefore are not bound  by the GIDEP reporting requirement in the DFARS. To address this,  defense officials stated that DLA requires any company participating in  one of its qualified supplier programs to report in GIDEP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aspects of Implementation Have Limited GIDEP\u2019s Effectiveness as an Early Warning System for Counterfeit Parts", "paragraphs": ["Several aspects of DOD\u2019s implementation of its mandatory reporting  requirement for suspect counterfeit parts in GIDEP have limited GIDEP\u2019s  effectiveness as an early warning system to prevent counterfeit parts from  entering the defense supply chain. First, DOD has not established an  oversight function to ensure that defense agencies are reporting suspect  counterfeit parts as required. As a result, for example, reporting practices  at DLA do not conform to either DOD- or DLA-level reporting policies and  it is likely that DLA is not reporting all of the suspect counterfeit parts  detected in GIDEP as suspect counterfeit parts. Second, there is not a  standardized process for establishing how much evidence is needed  before reporting suspect counterfeit parts in GIDEP. We found that  defense agencies and contractors have used different practices for  determining when to report a part as suspect counterfeit and DLA applies  a significantly more stringent standard than other defense agencies and  contractors we reviewed. As a result, reports may not be submitted in a  timely manner. Third, defense agencies typically limit access of suspect  counterfeit GIDEP reports to government agencies, so industry is not  aware of the potential counterfeiting issues identified. DOD\u2019s Counterfeit  Prevention Policy does not include guidance about when limiting access  to suspect counterfeit parts GIDEP reports is appropriate. Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government call for information to be  recorded and communicated to others, such as stakeholders who need it,  to help the agency achieve its goals. These standards also state that  control activities should be in place to help ensure that management\u2019s  directives are carried out, such as ensuring completeness and accuracy  of information processing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limited Department-Level Oversight Leads to Uncertainty about Completeness of GIDEP Reporting", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not provided adequate department-level oversight to ensure  that all defense agencies are reporting in GIDEP as required and, as a  result, it is likely that defense agencies\u2014particularly DLA\u2014are not  reporting all of the suspect counterfeit parts they detect in GIDEP as  suspect counterfeit. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government call for reviews by management at the functional or activity  level to compare actual performance to planned or expected performance  and analyze significant differences. Completeness and timeliness of  GIDEP reporting relies on DOD ensuring that reporting practices align  with established Counterfeit Prevention Policy. According to a senior USD  AT&L official, GIDEP staff do not play a role in overseeing and monitoring  whether defense agencies and contractors are meeting reporting  requirements. DOD policy does not provide for an oversight role to ensure  that reporting of counterfeit parts is tracked. The senior USD AT&L official  explained that the department has taken a decentralized approach to  implementing GIDEP reporting requirements, depending on the  components to provide additional guidance and oversight. While defense  agencies generally each have a central point person overseeing use of  GIDEP, DOD does not oversee GIDEP reporting at a department-wide  level. According to DOD\u2019s Counterfeit Prevention Policy, three entities  within USD AT&L share responsibilities for DOD\u2019s anti-counterfeiting  efforts. The senior USD AT&L official stated that certain GIDEP oversight  functions, such as oversight of reporting by DOD agencies, may fall  between the responsibilities of these organizations.", "Moreover, defense officials have not analyzed or provided oversight of  defense agencies\u2019 compliance with GIDEP reporting requirements,  monitoring only whether agencies have established their own policies. A  senior USD AT&L official responsible for counterfeit prevention policy we  spoke with was not aware of DLA\u2019s low level of reporting and has not  analyzed the reasons for it in light of DLA\u2019s central role in procuring parts  for DOD. Specifically, this official said that USD AT&L has not conducted  analysis that shows that DLA submitted very few reports in recent years.  As a result of DOD\u2019s decentralized approach and lack of department-level  oversight, the department cannot ensure that GIDEP data accurately  reflect the extent to which suspect counterfeit parts have been identified  by defense agencies.", "DLA plays a central role in procuring parts to sustain existing weapon  systems. Navy and Air Force officials we spoke with noted that they do  not typically purchase parts directly from suppliers, so they would expect  counterfeit parts to be reported by their defense contractors or DLA.  However, DLA submitted only nine suspect counterfeit GIDEP reports in  fiscal years 2011 through 2015, with none submitted in 2014 and just one  in 2015. DLA officials described instances where parts were identified as  potentially suspect counterfeit, but these were reported in GIDEP as  nonconforming parts, not suspect counterfeit. While this step provides  GIDEP users with notice that parts did not meet contract specifications  and may present safety problems, it does not inform users about potential  counterfeiting concerns.", "In another example, in 2012, the Air Force did not report a debarred  subcontractor in GIDEP for supplying counterfeit electronics components,  even after the investigation was made public. Although Air Force  officials stated that its prime contractor submitted related suspect  counterfeit GIDEP reports about some parts, these reports did not include  the name of the debarred subcontractor; rather they listed only the  independent distributor that the parts were sold through. Without a GIDEP  report that included critical information about the original source of  suspect counterfeit parts, other defense agencies and contractors may  not have the information necessary to raise their awareness of the  problem or to check whether other distributors also sold parts from that  same source.", "Further, DOD officials told us that not all suspect counterfeit parts that are  reported to other data sources are reported in GIDEP as suspect  counterfeit. Specifically, PDREP\u2014the Navy\u2019s system for reporting  supplier performance and quality information used across several  defense agencies\u2014allows the entity that submits a report about a  nonconforming part to identify the part as suspect counterfeit. According  to DOD policy, it is then the responsibility of a specific agency identified in  PDREP to determine whether to report in GIDEP, which is possible  through an automated function within PDREP. We found 268 PDREP  reports labeled as suspect counterfeit parts by various DOD entities  between October 2010 and August 2015. However, only 10\u2014or  4 percent\u2014are clearly documented as having been reported in GIDEP.  While defense agency and contractor officials explained that there are  instances where an initial suspicion of counterfeiting is quickly proven  incorrect, defense officials also stated that at least some parts identified in  PDREP as potentially counterfeit should be reported in GIDEP but are  not. Navy officials noted that this is particularly common when DLA is  responsible for resolving the claims. For example, DLA created a parts  quality report in PDREP, coded the parts report as suspect counterfeit,  and tested the parts at its product testing and evaluation program. The  parts failed visual and dimensional test requirements, but were not  reported in GIDEP as suspect counterfeit. DLA was the agency  responsible for determining whether to report in GIDEP for 148 of the  268 PDREP reports we reviewed that were labeled as suspect  counterfeit. However, DLA submitted only one of the related GIDEP  reports we identified.", "In our review, we found that another source of information about suspect  counterfeit parts and their suppliers, ERAI, had significantly more suspect  counterfeit reports than GIDEP, further calling into question GIDEP\u2019s  completeness. ERAI\u2014a company that monitors, investigates and reports  issues affecting the global electronics supply chain\u2014provides paying  members from government and industry with access to a database with  reports of nonconforming parts and their suppliers. According to ERAI,  most of its members are independent brokers, but also includes original  equipment manufacturers and government users. According to ERAI\u2019s  data its users report more suspect counterfeit parts than are reported in  GIDEP. For example, from 2011 through 2015, over 4,000 reports of  suspect counterfeit electrical, electronic, and electromechanical parts  were submitted to ERAI, over 7 times the amount of suspect counterfeit  reports for all types of parts submitted in GIDEP during the same period.  ERAI and agency officials largely attribute this high number to the fact  that reports in ERAI are submitted anonymously. While ERAI includes  reports about commercial and defense industry suppliers, an ERAI official  noted that both sectors often rely on the same pool of suppliers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks a Standardized Process for Determining When to Report Suspect Counterfeit Parts in GIDEP", "paragraphs": ["There is no standardized process for establishing how much evidence is  needed before reporting suspect counterfeit parts in GIDEP, and DLA  applies a more stringent standard than other defense agencies and  contractors we reviewed. When suspect counterfeit parts are discovered,  we found that defense agencies and contractors generally take additional  steps to establish reasonable certainty that parts are counterfeit before  submitting suspect counterfeit GIDEP reports, although practices for  making this determination differ and therefore take varying amounts of  time. We found that some of the defense agencies and contractors we  reviewed have practices for reporting parts as suspect counterfeit in  GIDEP within the 60-day reporting period, but that DLA\u2019s practices can  take significantly longer to complete.", "According to the GIDEP operations manual, reports should be submitted  no more than 60 days from the time of discovery to preclude further loss  to government and industry users. In addition, the objective of GIDEP  reports, including suspect counterfeit parts reports, is to preclude the  integration of these items into government and industry systems and  inventory. Moreover, DOD\u2019s 2013 Counterfeit Prevention Policy states  that it is DOD\u2019s policy to make information about counterfeiting accessible  at all levels of the DOD supply chain as a method to prevent further  counterfeiting. DOD and industry officials noted that timely reporting of  suspect counterfeit parts to GIDEP is critical to using the system as an  early warning system. For example, one USD AT&L official stated that  DOD\u2019s goal for GIDEP reporting is to get information about suspect  counterfeit parts out as early and as far down the supply chain as  possible. However, DOD and industry officials told us they were  concerned that GIDEP could not be relied upon to meet this goal if  suspect counterfeit parts reports were not made available to industry in a  timely and comprehensive manner.", "Defense agencies and contractors have varying practices for establishing  reasonable certainty after a suspect counterfeit part is discovered. Some  DOD officials stated that confirming whether a part is indeed counterfeit  requires 1) verification by the manufacturer of that part, 2) completion of a  criminal investigation, or 3) comprehensive testing that uncovers multiple  strong physical counterfeit indicators. Figure 4 illustrates varying practices  for determining whether to submit a GIDEP report.", "Some defense agencies and contractors have established practices that  allow them to meet GIDEP\u2019s 60-day reporting requirements. For example,  one defense contractor told us it issues a GIDEP report as soon as it has  any indication that a part may be counterfeit and another defense  contractor told us it conducts routine laboratory tests on any suspect  counterfeit parts, which it said can usually be completed within GIDEP\u2019s  60-day reporting requirement. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane  has established a standardized process for evaluating parts suspected of  being counterfeit. Specifically, it conducts preliminary engineering  investigations to confirm that a part is suspect counterfeit, conducts  detailed analysis to calculate scores that measure how certain they are of  their suspicions, and then submits GIDEP reports if appropriate. Navy  officials explained that they use a scoring system that weights different  types of tests and other information differently, depending on their  reliability in determining whether a part is counterfeit. The scoring system  totals up an overall point-value for an assessment, and officials said they  report to GIDEP once the assessment reaches a certain threshold. Navy  officials stated that, in general, this process can take from a week to a  month, but they can generally meet GIDEP\u2019s 60-day reporting  requirement.", "In contrast, DLA officials said that when DLA first identifies a part as  suspect counterfeit, it initially submits a GIDEP report identifying it simply  as nonconforming\u2014rather than suspect counterfeit\u2014and with access  limited to government use only.

Some defense agency officials said that early GIDEP reporting could  interfere with criminal investigations and that reporting needs to wait until  indictments are completed so as not to jeopardize the investigation.  Officials from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service described  certain instances when law enforcement activities may delay releasing  suspect counterfeit GIDEP reports, including cases where a covert  investigation is underway or there are activities related to a grand jury.

Some contractors stated that they believe reporting a suspect  counterfeit part in GIDEP may leave the contractor open to legal action if  the part is determined to be genuine. To address similar concerns, DOD  officials said GIDEP established an amnesty period in late 2010 when  suspect counterfeit parts reports did not need to include the name of the  supplier. Although this temporarily increased reporting, some contractor  officials told us that reports without supplier information are difficult to act  upon because this information is often necessary for identifying parts in  their inventories.

In written comments, DOD concurred with our three  recommendations directed at providing greater compliance with the  GIDEP reporting requirement among the DOD components and their  defense supplier-base. Specifically, DOD plans to issue a new Instruction  on GIDEP in fiscal year 2017, covering the identification of roles and  responsibilities for submitting GIDEP reports and oversight; the level of  evidence needed to report a part as suspect counterfeit in GIDEP; and  the use of GIDEP, including guidance for when access to GIDEP reports  should be restricted to government only. DOD partially concurred with our  recommendation aimed at helping DOD and its contractors to have a  greater degree of certainty and consistency to adhere to the requirements  for contractor counterfeit detection and avoidance systems. Specifically,  DOD stated that it agrees with informing contractors on how their  counterfeit detection and avoidance systems will be assessed; however, it  does not agree with prescribing specific counterfeit detection and  avoidance system implementation details. We continue to believe it is  important that DOD strengthen its communication with the contractors  and as our recommendation indicated, for DOD to clarify the criteria by  which it will assess contractor\u2019s counterfeit detection and avoidance  systems \u2014which is different than providing specific implementation  details. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state  that for an entity to run and control its operations, it must have relevant,  reliable and timely communication related to internal and external events,  which includes providing relevant and reliable criteria to contractors so  that they can appropriately develop or improve their systems to detect  and avoid counterfeit parts in order for them to be determined sufficient  by DOD.  Providing these criteria allows contractors greater visibility into  DOD\u2019s expectations. DOD also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.

Specifically, our objectives were to determine (1) the use of  the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) to report  suspect counterfeit parts, from fiscal years 2011 through 2015; (2) the  effectiveness of GIDEP reporting as an early warning system for  counterfeit parts; (3) the extent to which DOD has assessed defense  contractors\u2019 systems for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts; and  (4) key ongoing efforts by selected government and industry  organizations to improve the detection and reporting of counterfeit or  suspect counterfeit parts.", "We met with DOD officials and reviewed counterfeit mitigation policies  and procedures from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD AT&L) Logistic and Materiel  Readiness, Supply Chain Integration and USD AT&L Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy, as well as the military services and  other DOD components including the Departments of the Army, Navy,  and Air Force, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Logistics  Agency (DLA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and the  Defense Criminal Investigative Service. We then assessed DOD\u2019s  policies, procedures and practices against criteria in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To determine use of GIDEP to report suspect counterfeit parts over the  last 5 fiscal years, we obtained the complete GIDEP database for reports  entered between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2015. We analyzed  the data to identify GIDEP reports that were categorized as suspect  counterfeit and determine trends in reporting by fiscal year and across  entities who submitted the reports. We assessed GIDEP by reviewing  documentation and meeting with GIDEP officials, and determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To understand the trends  in GIDEP reporting, we interviewed Air Force, Army, DCMA, DLA, MDA,  and Navy officials as well as representatives from selected defense  contractors and industry associations.", "To assess the effectiveness of GIDEP reporting as an early warning  system for counterfeit parts, we interviewed Air Force, Army, USD AT&L,  DCMA, DLA, MDA, and Navy officials as well as representatives from  selected defense contractors and industry associations. In addition, we  analyzed data in DOD\u2019s Product Data Reporting and Evaluation Program  (PDREP) submitted between October 2010 and August 2015, the most  complete data available when we conducted this analysis, to identify  product quality reports coded as suspect counterfeit and assess the  extent to which these reports overlapped with GIDEP suspect counterfeit  reports. We assessed the PDREP data by reviewing documentation and  meeting with PDREP officials, and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Further, we met with officials from  the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Department of Justice  to discuss how ongoing criminal cases may impact timely GIDEP  reporting.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has assessed defense contractors\u2019  systems for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts, we reviewed Section  818 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement (DFARS) related to detecting, reporting, and  mitigating counterfeit electronic parts in the DOD supply chain by defense  contractors. We reviewed documents and spoke with officials at DCMA  regarding DCMA\u2019s process and criteria for determining the sufficiency of  contractors\u2019 systems to detect and avoid counterfeit electronic parts. We  interviewed seven major defense contractors with awards containing  DFARS counterfeit electronic parts language to discuss and examine  their policies to detect and avoid counterfeit parts\u2014BAE Systems,  Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman,  Raytheon, and Sikorsky Aircraft. To select these contractors, we obtained  data from Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy identifying all 2014  DOD awards and contract actions containing the DFARS counterfeit  electronic parts language and selected the five contractors with the  largest dollar value of such actions, as well as two other contractors with  smaller, but still significant, total volume. Additionally, for each of these  contractors, we non-judgmentally selected one contract from the 2014  dataset, covering a range of award values and products and services, to  examine how DOD counterfeit parts requirements for contractors are  applied in a variety of situations. In addition, we met with industry  associations representing companies from various levels of the defense  industry supply chain, including the Aerospace Industry Association,  Semiconductor Industry Association, and the Independent Distributors of  Electronics Association to determine how and to what extent they worked  with DOD to implement to federal regulations for counterfeit mitigation  and the impact of regulations related to the detection and avoidance of  counterfeit electronic parts  To identify key ongoing efforts by selected government and industry  organizations to improve the detection and reporting of counterfeit or  suspect counterfeit parts, we reviewed documents and data and  contacted officials from Defense agencies, including Defense Advanced  Research Products Agency, DLA Headquarters, and DLA Land and  Maritime, as well as other government agencies, such as the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy,  Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Transportation.  We also obtained documents and met with representatives from SAE  International and the G-19 Counterfeit Electronic Parts Committee to gain  an understanding of the standards and practices being developed to  detect and avoid counterfeit parts. We also met with selected defense  contractors to discuss actions taken to improve their practices to detect  and avoid counterfeit parts, as well as reviewed data and interviewed a  representative from ERAI, related to the reporting of potential counterfeit  parts. In addition, we visited the product testing facilities at DLA Land and  Maritime in Columbus, Ohio and the Naval Surface Warfare Center in  Crane, Indiana.
