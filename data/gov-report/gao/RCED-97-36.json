Its activities are designed to implement a broad range of statutory mandates, from making housing affordable, to helping revitalize communities, to supporting homeownership. Since 1965, HUD has grown to include some 240 programs and activities and hundreds of billions of dollars in financial commitments. Its annual outlays for fiscal year 1995 were about $29 billion. Studies performed by HUD\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), GAO, and others have documented inefficiencies in organization and deficiencies in management that impede the effectiveness of HUD\u2019s programs. Leaders in the administration and the Congress agree that HUD must, at a minimum, be restructured to better meet the nation\u2019s housing and community development needs. Some policymakers believe that HUD\u2019s problems are so great that they can be cured only by dismantling the agency and transferring or eliminating its functions. This report focuses on the two most recent proposals to dismantle HUD\u2014S. 1145 and H.R. 2198. For convenience, we refer to both bills, which are identical, as S. 1145."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Missions Have Evolved", "paragraphs": ["As a new cabinet-level department, HUD took over most, though not all, of the federal housing and community development functions that had been located in independent agencies. Its focus, as defined in the legislation that created it, was primarily urban\u2014\u201d. . . the sound development of the Nation\u2019s communities and metropolitan areas.\u201d HUD took over the rental assistance and low-income housing production functions of the Public Housing Administration and the Housing and Home Finance Agency, the mortgage insurance functions of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the secondary market functions for government-insured and guaranteed loans. HUD did not, however, take over the housing programs administered by the Veterans Administration (VA) and the Rural Housing Service or the economic development programs operated by the Department of Commerce. In addition, HUD does not control the tax policies that affect housing, such as the homeowner\u2019s deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes, and it does not oversee all of the financial institutions, such as banks, savings and loans, and mortgage companies, that participate in the nation\u2019s mortgage markets.", "Even though HUD has not assumed all of the nation\u2019s housing functions, it has primary responsibilities for programs in four areas\u2014housing assistance, community development, housing finance, and regulatory issues. \u2022 Housing Assistance: HUD provides (1) public housing assistance through allocations to public housing authorities and (2) private-market housing assistance through rental subsidies for properties, referred to as project-based assistance, or for tenants, known as tenant-based assistance. In contrast to entitlement programs, which provide benefits to all who qualify, the benefits of HUD\u2019s housing assistance programs are limited by budgetary constraints to only about one-fourth of those who are eligible. \u2022 Community Development: Primarily through grants to states, large metropolitan areas called entitlement areas, small cities, towns, and counties, HUD provides funds for local economic development, housing development, and assistance to the homeless. The funding for some programs, such as those for the homeless, may also be distributed directly to nonprofit groups and organizations. \u2022 Housing Finance: FHA insures lenders\u2014including mortgage banks, commercial banks, savings banks, and savings and loan associations\u2014against losses on mortgages for single-family properties, multifamily projects, and other facilities. The Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), a government-owned corporation within HUD, guarantees investors the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by lenders of FHA-insured and VA- and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed loans. \u2022 Regulatory Issues: HUD is responsible for regulating interstate land sales, home mortgage settlement services, manufactured housing, lead-based paint abatement, and home mortgage disclosures. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, an independent office within HUD, is responsible for regulating the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. HUD also supports fair housing programs and is partially responsible for enforcing federal fair housing laws.", "To carry out its many responsibilities, HUD was staffed by about 10,500 employees at the end of fiscal year 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Accomplishments, Problems Impede Efficiency and Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Through its programs, HUD makes housing affordable for about 4.5 million lower-income tenants, helps to revitalize over 4,000 communities, and has insured mortgages for about 23 million homeowners. In addition, as a cabinet-level department, HUD has given visibility and priority to housing and community development issues and has built up networks for implementing its programs. In some instances, HUD\u2019s offices have pioneered the development of services. For example, FHA initiated home mortgages with very small down payments and reverse mortgages.", "Despite these accomplishments, HUD has, over the years, developed both administrative and programmatic problems. In 1994, GAO designated HUD as a high-risk agency because of four long-standing management deficiencies\u2014weak internal controls; poorly integrated, ineffective, and generally unreliable information and financial management systems; an ineffective organization; and an insufficient mix of staff with the proper skills. Internal control weaknesses, such as not having the necessary data and management processes, contributed to the HUD scandals of 1989. Deficient information and financial management systems have not supported program managers\u2019 needs or provided adequate control over housing and community development programs. Organizational problems have included overlapping and ill-defined responsibilities and authorities between the Department\u2019s headquarters and field organizations and a fundamental lack of management accountability and responsibility. Not having enough staff with the proper skills has hampered the monitoring and oversight of programs and delayed the updating of procedures. While HUD has formulated approaches and initiated actions to address its departmentwide deficiencies, its efforts are far from reaching fruition and problems continue.", "In response to legislation and other initiatives, programs were created with missions that overlap or are linked only tangentially to primary missions within HUD. In December 1994, HUD\u2019s Inspector General recommended eliminating, consolidating, or restructuring many of HUD\u2019s 240 programs and activities, 91 of which, the Inspector General said, were questionably related to the Department\u2019s primary mission. We reported that several of the larger programs on this list seemed to contribute directly to meeting the housing needs of low-income people. However, we estimated that 27 programs listed by the Inspector General could be reassessed to determine the need for them and their relative value in achieving HUD\u2019s mission. Other problems cited by the Inspector General included disproportionately high administrative costs, inflexible program requirements, and a multiplicity of programs with similar objectives that promote separate federal and local bureaucracies. Until the problems that we and the Inspector General identified are resolved, HUD\u2019s programs are likely to remain vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse.", "Further exacerbating these concerns is the need to reduce discretionary spending governmentwide over the next several years to balance the budget by early in the next century. Most balanced budget plans include a freeze in discretionary spending at current nominal levels, meaning that by the year 2002, spending will be nearly 20 percent lower than it would be if it were allowed to increase with inflation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Administration, the Congress, and Others Have Proposed Changes", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s problems have led to studies and proposals for change, including the administration\u2019s reinvention plans, the National Academy of Public Administration\u2019s (NAPA) study, and several bills to reorganize or dismantle HUD. These proposals uniformly recognize the need to revise the delivery of housing and community development services. They also recognize that budgetary constraints dictate changes. However, the proposals differ in the role they envision for the federal government.", "The administration\u2019s initial reinvention plans, introduced in December 1994, assume the need for a cabinet-level housing and community development agency and focus on restructuring and consolidating programs. Initially, the plans proposed to (1) remove public housing authorities from HUD\u2019s subsidy programs and make them compete in the private market; (2) consolidate 60 major categorical programs into three flexible, performance-based funds; and (3) transform FHA into a results-oriented, financially accountable credit-enhancement operation. In 1996, the administration updated its plans, retaining most of the provisions but revising the proposal for public housing. Under the current plans, HUD would continue to subsidize public housing but would consolidate and streamline programs to improve its delivery of services to low-income residents.", "The NAPA study, issued in July 1994, recommended that the Congress and HUD restructure the agency to consolidate its programs and reform its management. The study suggested that if HUD did not operate under a clear mandate and in an effective manner in 5 years, its existence should be reevaluated. In addition, the study recommended that HUD modify its operations and work from the bottom up rather than from the top down, supporting local initiatives consistent with its mission instead of imposing its own strategies on localities. For most programs, the study proposed a shift in decision-making authority from headquarters to the field and from the federal government to the state or local level. Finally, the study recommended that the Congress give HUD broad waiver and demonstration authority to allow the states to experiment with changes in their housing and community development programs.", "Between February 1995 and August 1995, the 104th Congress introduced five bills in the House and Senate to dismantle HUD. These bills would move farther than the NAPA study in shifting power from the federal government to the states, and they would transfer some governmental responsibilities to the private sector. Furthermore, they would transfer the remaining federal responsibilities to other federal agencies and terminate HUD\u2019s existence. The two most recent bills\u2014S. 1145 and H.R. 2198\u2014are the subject of this report.

To reduce the federal government\u2019s spending for housing and community development, the bill would shift many of HUD\u2019s operations to other federal agencies, provide block grants to the states, and rely more on the private sector. The bill seeks to give the recipients of housing assistance more choice in deciding where to live and communities more choice in deciding how to spend their community development funds; however, it would also reduce the federal funding for community development. In addition, it would increase the influence of the private market in federal housing assistance and housing finance. As the NAPA study and the administration\u2019s proposals recommended, the bill would increase decision-making at the state and local levels, bringing the administration of programs\u2014and accountability for their results\u2014closer to the persons affected by the decisions. Overall, the bill seeks to reduce federal spending for housing and community development activities by consolidating and eliminating programs.", "To accomplish its goals for housing assistance, S. 1145 would phase out HUD\u2019s public housing and rental housing assistance programs and replace them with a flexible, tenant-based voucher system, to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Public housing properties and properties that formerly received section 8 project-based rental assistance would have to compete for tenants with other rental properties in the marketplace. Tenants could use their vouchers to either rent or purchase any unit they could afford, but a household\u2019s receipt of vouchers would generally be limited to a lifetime maximum of 5 years.The states could choose to receive a block grant allocation and administer vouchers on behalf of HHS or develop their own housing assistance program.", "S. 1145 would consolidate HUD\u2019s community development programs, including many categorical ones, into a block grant for housing and community development, of which $1 billion would be set aside for Indian housing, the elderly, people with disabilities, and people with AIDS. The grant would be administered by a new, independent agency, the Housing and Community Opportunities Agency. This change would give communities more choice in spending federal funds, but both large and small communities would have less money to spend. Under the housing and community development grant, entitlement areas would receive 80 percent of the total funding provided, while small cities would receive 20 percent. However, the total funding would be cut by about 40 percent as soon as the bill\u2019s provisions went into effect and would then be reduced even further over time.", "S. 1145 would restrict the federal government\u2019s role in housing finance to covering losses on single-family mortgages, at a substantially reduced rate\u2014down from 100 percent to a maximum of 35 percent. It would transfer the responsibility for operating the single-family mortgage insurance program to the Department of the Treasury, which would negotiate agreements for sharing the risk of insuring single-family mortgages with other mortgage insurers\u2014the states and/or the private sector. Additionally, it would eliminate federal loan insurance for multifamily and certain other properties and terminate Ginnie Mae, leaving these areas for the states and private sector to cover.", "Finally, S. 1145 would transfer HUD\u2019s regulatory functions to other federal agencies, designated in this report as receiving agencies. These agencies include the departments of the Treasury and Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other independent agencies. To manage these changes, the bill would redesignate HUD as the Housing and Urban Development Programs Resolution Agency and make this agency responsible for administering and concluding HUD\u2019s affairs within 5 years.Among other things, the resolution agency would have to resolve, or provide for resolving, hundreds of billions of dollars in financial commitments and manage HUD\u2019s shutdown.

The findings resulting from our visits are not projectable to all 50 states. Because S. 1145 would not directly expand the role of local governments, we focused specifically on states\u2019 capacity to take on expanded responsibilities.

Specifically, we interviewed officials from OMB, the General Services Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management to gather the current guidance on reorganizing federal agencies.

The private-market housing programs provide \u201cproject-based\u201d and \u201ctenant-based\u201d rental assistance to owners of private rental housing. For project-based assistance, eligible lower-income households must live in designated housing. HUD has contracted with the owners of this housing to provide rental payments for units in those properties for a certain time period. For tenant-based assistance (the section 8 certificate and housing voucher programs), assisted households may live in rental units of their choice as long as the units meet HUD\u2019s standards for rent and quality. Generally, HUD administers its private-market rental housing programs through housing owners or PHAs, depending on the program.", "HUD spent about $25 billion in fiscal year 1995 to provide rental housing assistance for about 4.5 million units. HUD targets rental assistance primarily toward households classified by law as having very low incomes. For households with four people, very low incomes are those that do not exceed 50 percent of the local area\u2019s median income. Because of its high costs, the public housing program was sharply curtailed in 1983, and section 8 project-based rental assistance was discontinued for new construction or substantial rehabilitation. Nevertheless, because of the pattern of past funding, most people who receive federal rental aid today receive project-based subsidies. As shown in figure 2.1, of the 4.5 million units assisted by HUD, about 29 percent are in public housing, about 40 percent receive project-based assistance, and about 31 percent receive tenant-based assistance, according to HUD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "S. 1145 Would Replace Current Assistance With a Voucher System", "paragraphs": ["Under the bill, all existing public housing and project-based rental housing assistance would be phased out and replaced with a tenant-based voucher system administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The grants would also fund the demolition of units that could not be made competitive. During the phaseout, tenants would start to receive vouchers that they could use to stay in their current apartment, move to another apartment, or purchase a home. Any section 8 assistance or public housing commitments still in effect at the termination of the resolution agency would be transferred to the voucher administrator in HHS. The bill limits the amount of assistance available during the 5-year transition period and then permanently limits the assistance to the amount necessary to (1) provide housing assistance to the same number of families as received assistance under any section 8 or public housing program during fiscal year 1997 and (2) cover administrative fees.

For about three-fourths of its properties with project-based section 8 subsidies, HUD estimates that the rental subsidies exceed the market rents for comparable properties. As the contracts for the assisted projects expire and the tenants receive vouchers, the rents charged by landlords could rise or fall, depending on the local rental market. In general, the tenants could decide whether to move elsewhere or to stay in their units.", "Over time, affordable housing units may be lost as owners who cannot operate at market rates default or as owners in tight housing markets raise their rents to levels that certificate holders cannot afford. In either case, tenants could be displaced. As a further complication, almost half of all the properties with section 8 project-based subsidies have mortgages insured by FHA, which would have to pay lenders\u2019 claims if the owners defaulted. Recognizing these possibilities, S. 1145 contains \u201cmark-to-market\u201d provisions that would, for contracts expiring during the 5-year transition period, give the resolution agency broad authority to take actions such as adjusting the FHA-insured mortgages to bring the properties\u2019 rental income and operating expenses into line and to decrease the likelihood of defaults on FHA-insured mortgages. These goals are similar to those proposed by HUD. The remaining section 8 properties, whose mortgages are not insured by FHA, also present complications, particularly for the states. Specifically, as the Republican Governors\u2019 Housing Task Force cautioned, if the federal government were to unilaterally not renew expiring section 8 contracts, it would jeopardize the ability of the states to meet their financing obligations. Such an action could have serious consequences for the states\u2019 future financing capacity. Consequently, the states believe they must be held harmless from the effects of any mark-to-market action on uninsured section 8 projects. According to HUD\u2019s data, just over half of all section 8 projects are not insured by FHA. Furthermore, over half of the units in uninsured section 8 projects are in projects whose contracts will expire after the year 2000.

While the bill requires the planning to determine which projects would likely be viable, many PHAs might have difficulty developing plans because public housing was not built to the private market\u2019s standards and its operation has not been guided by the market\u2019s forces, according to a recent HUD study. Thus, many PHAs might find that they lacked the information to analyze their housing stock, management practices, and local housing markets to determine the viability of their housing, and they might need to have contractors perform these studies. Since the bill does not provide funding specifically for the studies, it would have to come from the operating funds or modernization grants provided under the bill, potentially putting a further strain on PHAs\u2019 budgets.", "In addition, the physical condition of public housing has deteriorated over time because operating subsidies and modernization funds have not kept pace with needs. For example, for fiscal year 1996, about 90 percent of public housing\u2019s operating needs were covered by the appropriation, leaving about 10 percent of the expenses unfunded by either subsidy or rent. Because of such shortfalls, routine maintenance is typically deferred. Since 1981, almost $29 billion has been provided for modernizing public housing. However, a backlog estimated at between $10 billion and $20 billion still exists, and, despite recent progress in reducing the backlog, needs continue to accrue. As shown in figure 2.3, the bill provides total funding for operating subsidies and capital grants (modernization funds) of $5.3 billion for fiscal year 1998, $3.3 billion for fiscal year 1999, $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2000, and $56 million for fiscal year 2001. In comparison, for fiscal year 1997, a total of about $6 billion was appropriated for public housing. Given this funding gap, the General Counsel for the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities and the President of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials said that they do not believe that the appropriations in the bill\u2014even when considered in light of the proposed deregulation\u2014would be sufficient for the bulk of public housing to become competitive. As we reported previously, the condition of the existing stock and its per-unit operating costs vary tremendously.

Where the supply of affordable housing was sufficient, the vouchers could provide housing choice.

CBO observed that \u201crecipients of tenant-based housing assistance\u2014except the elderly\u2014were less likely than recipients of project-based aid to report dissatisfaction with their neighborhood or housing unit.\u201d Additionally, HUD\u2019s Inspector General recommended that actions be taken to decouple project-based subsidies from insured projects because they insulate the owners of projects from normal market forces and result in inferior projects and services for tenants. With tenant-based subsidies, landlords would know that tenants could move and would have more incentive to maintain their projects, according to CBO. However, both housing and community development officials in the six states we visited and HUD officials told us that substituting vouchers for all project-based assistance and public housing could reduce the supply of affordable housing and hamper households\u2019 ability to find affordable housing in some localities. Officials from five states mentioned that discontinuing project-based assistance would exacerbate the shortage of affordable housing. HUD agrees that housing markets nationwide are uneven, making an across-the-board approach to housing assistance unworkable. In areas such as New York, San Francisco, and areas of expanding growth where housing markets are tight, rebuilding units is the only practical way to retain affordable units and avoid displacing households, according to HUD.", "However, CBO and HUD agree that the primary causes of severe housing problems across the country are not shortages of housing but lagging incomes and high housing costs. In fact, in 1993, about 6 million unsubsidized households had \u201cworst-case\u201d needs, according to HUD, meaning that they had incomes of less than 50 percent of their area\u2019s median income and paid more than 50 percent of their incomes for housing or lived in substandard housing. For most of these households, affordability was their only housing problem. HUD and others have argued that certificates give low-income households the purchasing power they need to afford the housing that is available in the private market. A 1994 study by Abt Associates, Inc., performed for HUD, found that nearly 9 out of 10 households (excluding New York City) in HUD\u2019s mainstream section 8 voucher and certificate programs were able to find rental housing by using their vouchers and certificates. As we reported previously, actual housing choice depends on many factors, including the characteristics of the current tenants and their inclination to move, the availability of affordable housing, the willingness of private landlords to accept tenants with housing certificates, and the extent to which laws prohibiting housing discrimination are followed and enforced. In a case study of the Baltimore housing authority, HUD found that massive movement out of public housing following a change to tenant-based vouchers would be unlikely. The president of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, who is also the executive director of the Richmond housing authority, said he fears that 20 to 30 percent of the tenants in public housing would move. He said that he and other PHA directors are concerned that PHAs would be faced with partially occupied buildings and dwindling resources. Another factor that would influence choice is the level of subsidy to be provided through the certificate. The states that operated their own program could determine the amount of the subsidy for their state. In theory, if a state wanted to serve more clients, it could provide smaller payments for each client. If it wanted to serve fewer people or stimulate other movements, it could provide larger payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Block Grants Would Give Some Communities More Choice but Could Decrease Aid for Vulnerable Populations", "paragraphs": ["Combining the funding for HUD\u2019s community development programs into a single block grant, distributing it to the states and large metropolitan areas, and allowing these entities to decide how they would spend the funds\u2014within federal guidelines\u2014would give these entities more choice.

HUD\u2019s primary community development program is the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, for which $4.6 billion was appropriated in fiscal year 1997 for grants to aid in the development of viable communities through activities such as housing rehabilitation, public works, public services, and economic development.

However, the entitlement areas would receive 80 percent of the funding and the states 20 percent. Currently, the split is 70 percent to the entitlement areas and 30 percent to the states under CDBG and 60 percent to participating jurisdictions and 40 percent to the states under the HOME program.

However, HUD, the organizations representing state and local governments, and housing officials generally favored two or three block grants covering housing, community development, and assistance for the homeless. For example, in its reinvention plans, HUD has proposed to consolidate these programs into three block grants. The Deputy Director of the Office of Executive Services in the Community Planning and Development Division, who was otherwise critical of S. 1145\u2019s provisions, noted that a single block grant would be less costly to administer than separate programs.

According to an official from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, local governments face a great deal of political pressure to fund their police departments and environmental mandates, rather than housing, which has traditionally been a federal responsibility. Some Maryland state officials thought that few funds would be allocated for the homeless under a consolidated block grant, particularly in entitlement areas. These officials were concerned that without HUD\u2019s emphasis on providing a continuum of care, some areas would use their funds for emergency shelter rather than address the multiple needs of the homeless. However, the stakeholders representing state and local governments and housing officials expressed concern that additional set-asides or other restrictions would be added to the block grants, limiting state or local flexibility.", "Several studies support the concern of some stakeholders that under a consolidated block grant, states and localities would reduce the funding targeted to very poor households. An analysis of the activities funded through HUD\u2019s HOME and CDBG programs in fiscal year 1992 by a sample of cities indicated that the cities used their grants for purposes that were more closely aligned with their nonfederal spending than they did with other federal funding sources. According to the study, distributing more funds through block grants would likely lead to greater expenditures to benefit moderate- and middle-income households. Similarly, an analysis of the transfer of the CDBG Small Cities program from HUD to the states found that, overall, the states spent less money than the federal government on housing and community development activities for low- and moderate-income households and more on economic development and public works projects.

In our survey of community development officials, 98 percent (43 of the 44 state officials responding) believed the funding decreases would significantly affect their residents. In addition, because of the funding cuts and the increase in the proportion of funds for entitlement communities, the 3,000 nonmetropolitan areas would either receive smaller grants or fewer communities would receive grants. According to HUD, the grants could become too small to have much impact. In addition, HUD said that nonprofit organizations that rely on the CDBG and HOME programs for partial funding might have to terminate or sharply curtail their services.

According to representatives from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association for County Community and Economic Development, and the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, urban areas often suffer when the states are involved in administering programs. In Maryland, a panel of local officials from municipalities near Washington, D.C., explained that the CDBG nonentitlement program was better run by HUD than by the state, which took over the program\u2019s administration in 1987. Similarly, a representative of public housing authorities in Illinois told us that he would prefer to work directly with the federal government in operating housing assistance programs, rather than with the state government. Reasons cited by these local officials for preferring to work with the federal rather than the state government include (1) the influence of state politics on programs\u2019 administration and (2) the imposition of burdensome bureaucratic requirements by the state.

As mentioned above, on the basis of our analysis of home purchasers who received FHA loans in 1995, up to two-thirds of the borrowers with FHA-insured loans would not meet these standards, and would, therefore, need to delay their purchase of a home, purchase a home of lesser value, or make a greater initial investment in their home.According to officials of Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, private mortgage insurers might be able to offer more flexible underwriting for loans in which they shared the risks as envisioned in the bill. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would, however, first need to better understand the risks associated with any changes to their underwriting and the price they would need to charge for purchasing such loans. For some borrowers, the provision of vouchers might increase the affordability of the home they currently owned or wished to purchase.", "The loss of Ginnie Mae could also affect the availability of mortgages for veterans and rural home buyers. Currently, lenders of loans guaranteed by VA and the Rural Housing Service may retain 44 basis points (0.44 percent of the loan amount) for servicing loans when they are pooled into securities that are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. But when these loans are securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the lenders might retain fewer basis points. This difference in servicing fees creates an incentive for lenders that originate government-insured and government-guaranteed loans to utilize Ginnie Mae\u2019s services and explains why nearly all such loans are held in securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. Consequently, some veterans and moderate-income rural home buyers might find a home mortgage more difficult to obtain. Ultimately, the terms of the mortgages made under the risk-sharing provisions of the bill would need to be established before the secondary market agencies could determine the risk and pricing for purchasing and securitizing such loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financing for Multifamily Projects Would Be More Difficult to Obtain", "paragraphs": ["FHA\u2019s role in facilitating the financing of multifamily projects is more limited than it once was, but it is still significant for multifamily projects for lower-income renters, as well as for hospitals and nursing homes in certain locations.

The dollar amount of the mortgages for purchasing or refinancing existing rental units has fluctuated during the last few years but has exceeded the amount for 1992. While the extent to which FHA\u2019s share of the entire market has changed in recent years is unclear, FHA\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing Programs wrote in its Business Strategic Plan of October 1994 that FHA\u2019s share of the multifamily mortgage lending market had fallen from over 30 percent during the early 1980s to 2.2 percent in 1992.

Some of FHA\u2019s multifamily mortgage programs have been profitable. Specifically, according to a May 1995 analysis prepared by Abt Associates, Inc., FHA\u2019s insurance on loans for hospitals and for refinancing multifamily loans had a positive net cash flow for those loans endorsed between 1987 and 1994.

According to the Center for the Study of the States, the states are unlikely to raise their own taxes much to offset federal cutbacks, and the revenue from the existing taxes of most states will not grow enough to enable the states to make up for large reductions in federal aid.

According to 1996 testimony by a senior fellow at the Urban Institute before the House Budget Committee, if cutbacks in federal aid cause fiscal stress for states, programs that received a small share of the states\u2019 funds in the early 1990s would continue to lose out to spending for other activities, such as prisons. Federal spending cuts in areas such as welfare, job training, and education were cited by almost half of the survey respondents as moderately or greatly influencing their state\u2019s decision not to provide additional funds for community development. For example, officials in Massachusetts said they would have to wait and see how their state fared with welfare reform before determining how much more they could spend for housing and community development. However, this state differed from others we visited because officials believed that strong pressure from housing advocacy groups within the state could result in increased funding.", "Although the state government officials responding to our survey generally indicated that their state would not be likely to supplement the federal block grant, the actual fiscal capacity of state governments appears to be more varied than the responses would suggest. Several recent studies indicate that while some states are weak in terms of their fiscal capacity, others are fairly strong. We reported in 1993, for instance, that the widespread disparities among the levels of public services that the states could afford reflected differences in their fiscal capacity. The six states we visited had varied levels of fiscal capacity, according to the 1993 report\u2019s ranking of states.

About half of the states enacted tax cuts in part because of moderate economic growth. In addition, experience with block grants in the early 1980s showed that the states used a variety of approaches to help offset federal funding reductions. For example, after nine block grants were created in the early 1980s, the states used carry-over funds from categorical programs, added state revenues, and transferred funds among programs to help make up for much of the reductions in federal funding. An April 1995 study on block grants concluded that \u201c. . . critics who had predicted that states would be unable and/or unwilling to use their own funds to offset federal cuts were proven wrong.\u201d The study noted that spending for social services, which had seemed especially vulnerable, received surprisingly strong support.", "\u201c. . . the anti-tax mood reflected currently in Washington is also prevalent in the states.

For more detailed explanations of HUD\u2019s functions that involve financial commitments for the resolution agency, see appendix II.", "The resolution agency would face certain legal constraints on how it could settle HUD\u2019s commitments. For example, the bill recognizes that selling FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance interests or terminating Ginnie Mae would not relieve the federal government of commitments backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Generally, the bill provides that all grants, loans, contracts, agreements, and other obligations that have been issued before the transfer of functions shall continue in effect according to their terms until modified, terminated, superseded, set aside, or revoked in accordance with law. Consequently, because of the nature of some commitments, the federal government might continue to have a contingent liability regardless of how these commitments were resolved. For example, if the purchaser of an FHA mortgage insurance interest were required to pay claims but was ultimately unable to do so, the federal government would be responsible for meeting its original commitment to the holders of the affected FHA-insured mortgages.", "In addition to the constraints described above, the federal government could be subject to unexpected losses, depending on how its commitments were resolved. For example, selling only the most profitable of FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance interests might have the net result of lowering the overall value of FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance interests. That is, even the most profitable insurance interest would likely be sold at a discount because private purchaser\u2019s\u2014unlike FHA\u2014need a return on their investment sufficient to cover any risk of default as well as tax expenses and a return to shareholders. The federal government might be left with only the unprofitable part of the insurance portfolio, supported by capital that\u2014because of the discount at which insurance interests might be sold\u2014would likely be valued at something less than its value before such a sale. For example, we estimate that for the single-family portfolio, loans originated before 1984 would have net positive cash flows for 1998 and the remaining years of the mortgage; therefore, only these loans would have value for potential investors unless the government gave these investors a portion of the up-front premium. The remaining single-family portfolio\u2014which we estimate to have net negative cash flows for 1998 and later years\u2014would likely remain with the federal government. Even if the sale of FHA\u2019s single-family mortgage insurance interests included provisions that ensured that the federal government had no responsibility for covering lenders\u2019 losses, to the extent that these lenders experienced dramatic losses affecting their ability to pay investors in their Ginnie Mae-guaranteed securities, some or all of the loan losses could fall to the federal government as it honored its full-faith-and-credit commitments on Ginnie Mae-guaranteed securities. Finally, while the section 108 loan guarantees are covered by future CDBG grants, the decline in funding for grantees specified in the bill would limit the ability of these grantees to repay lenders, potentially resulting in greater claims against the resolution agency or the agency designated to assume HUD\u2019s responsibility for guaranteeing these loans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "S. 1145 Does Not Address Some Programs", "paragraphs": ["While S. 1145 generally addresses the major responsibilities within HUD\u2014housing assistance, community development, and housing finance\u2014certain programs within these areas would be terminated because the bill does not provide for their transformation or continuation. For example, within the community development area, because the bill does not address the Urban Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities program, HUD\u2019s involvement with the program would be terminated, leaving the resolution agency to close out technical assistance contracts and determine who would oversee the remainder of the urban part of this program. This program benefits communities by providing local governments and private nonprofit organizations with increased flexibility in meeting federal laws and regulations that might otherwise hinder their ability to implement comprehensive local plans for addressing the housing and economic problems of distressed neighborhoods. The loss of HUD\u2019s oversight of the urban portion of this program would diminish the federal role in helping localities initiate and maintain a comprehensive approach to revitalizing distressed neighborhoods. Other agencies involved in administering this program could continue it. Within the area of housing assistance, the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987) is not included as one of similar housing assistance functions to be transferred to the Department of Justice. This program funds public and private organizations for activities such as education outreach, enforcement activities, and the legal expenses incurred in prosecuting fair housing cases. Unlike the programs discussed above, these programs do not contain commitments that would need to be addressed by the resolution agency.", "In the housing finance area, the bill does not address all of HUD\u2019s responsibilities under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. Specifically, while S. 1145 does provide for transferring the responsibilities for regulating the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now performed by HUD\u2019s Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, it does not specify the disposition of HUD\u2019s responsibilities for ensuring that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fulfill their public purposes and serve the housing needs of the country. Among these responsibilities are establishing, monitoring, and enforcing goals for Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s purchase of mortgages financing housing for low-and moderate-income families; housing located in central cities, rural areas, and other underserved areas; and affordable housing for specially targeted families. According to HUD, assigning these responsibilities to the resolution agency would reduce their importance for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and signal the probable elimination of these agencies\u2019 public purpose goals. Ultimately, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would devote fewer resources and innovative products to these activities, according to HUD. Furthermore, if S. 1145 were implemented, HUD officials believe that this function should continue and be transferred to a cabinet-level agency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned From Prior Efforts to Abolish, Reorganize, or Transfer Federal Programs Could Ease Transition", "paragraphs": ["The proposed resolution agency could benefit from certain lessons learned from past efforts to abolish or reorganize federal agencies, transfer their programs, or dispose of their assets.

For example, we previously stressed the importance of creating an interagency transition task force to provide overall guidance on the transfer of assets, personnel, and operations to receiving agencies. We also highlighted the importance of establishing internal controls and developing an asset disposition plan when resolving financial commitments. Applying these lessons in consolidating, eliminating, and transferring federal housing and community development programs might help not only to reduce the risk of mismanagement, waste, fraud, and abuse within the programs but also to save money for the federal government by increasing the efficiency of the transition. Additionally, a number of officials we interviewed noted some special considerations in abolishing HUD, including the possible elimination of staff positions and the wide dispersal of programs in the field with established support networks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resolution Agency Could Use Interagency Transition Task Force in Transferring Functions Between Agencies", "paragraphs": ["A number of lessons learned from previous reorganizations would be applicable to the resolution agency\u2019s mandates to transfer some of HUD\u2019s personnel and programs and dispose of HUD\u2019s outstanding obligations. For example, as noted in our prior work, on the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act, the Congress required the establishment of an interagency transition task force to help transfer the Resolution Trust Corporation\u2019s (RTC) assets, personnel, and operations to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The act assigned the task force\u2014which included representatives of RTC and FDIC\u2014specific duties, including examining both corporations\u2019 operations, evaluating their differences, recommending which of RTC\u2019s systems should be preserved for FDIC\u2019s use, and reporting its findings to the Congress. Some key elements for planning the transition included (1) \u201cbest practice reviews\u201d conducted jointly by RTC and FDIC to identify differences in their respective operations and recommend practices for adoption by FDIC after RTC\u2019s dissolution, (2) information system reviews to assist the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending which of RTC\u2019s systems should be adopted by FDIC, and (3) implementation plans to identify the appropriate staffing and organizational structure for RTC\u2019s functions after their absorption by FDIC.The corporations also reviewed the legal and policy issues involved in transferring RTC\u2019s responsibilities and operations to FDIC and reviewed internal controls to ensure that vulnerabilities to waste, fraud, and abuse were minimized during and after the transition. Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management officials we interviewed emphasized the importance of incorporating some of these elements in the transfer of HUD\u2019s functions. They suggested that an interagency group should be established, that the receiving agencies would need to revise their organizational structures before the new programs were transferred, and that the entities should schedule at least 6 months for planning the transfers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishing Internal Controls and an Asset Disposition Plan Could Provide for the Orderly Resolution of Financial Commitments", "paragraphs": ["Additional lessons can be gathered from the shutdown of RTC, which was tasked with disposing of about $443 billion in financial assets, real estate, and other assets after the failure of numerous saving and loan institutions. Most importantly, internal controls were in place to monitor the disposition of assets. We previously testified that a successful transition between entities would include ensuring that sufficient controls were in place over the assets that would be sold during the remaining life of RTC, as well as over the assets transferred from RTC to FDIC. Since the resolution agency would also need to dispose of the assets received in the course of abolishing a program within HUD, it would need to develop an asset disposition plan with specific strategies. Currently, although S. 1145 specifies that the resolution agency should develop plans for disposing of some of HUD\u2019s assets\u2014such as a plan for marketing and selling FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance interests\u2014it does not recommend that the agency develop an overall strategy for inventorying, assessing, and disposing of all of HUD\u2019s assets. In our previous testimony on a proposal to dismantle the Department of Commerce, we noted a similar concern\u2014that although the proposal contained a planning requirement, it did not specify a strategy for disposing of assets.", "We also previously reported on the importance of developing and managing credible information systems to maximize revenues from the sale of assets. We reported on a number of problems with RTC\u2019s information systems, including inaccurate and incomplete data, which contributed to our prior designation of RTC as a high-risk area. As discussed in chapter 1, HUD also has generally unreliable information and financial management systems. Dismantling and transferring HUD\u2019s programs without\u2014at a minimum\u2014reviewing and addressing, where possible, the current inadequacies within these systems and developing asset disposition plans could increase the risks of fraud, waste, and abuse in the management, transfer, and sale of HUD\u2019s assets.", "Finally, lessons learned about closing out contracts following the transfer of agencies\u2019 functions could be applicable. We previously stressed the importance of ensuring the adequate management and oversight of asset management contracts continuing at FDIC after RTC\u2019s shutdown. We suggested that FDIC might benefit by evaluating its own contracts in conjunction with RTC\u2019s contracts to explore opportunities for combining, canceling, or extending them.
