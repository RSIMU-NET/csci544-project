Because adequate plans are necessary for mitigating the impact of any Year 2000-related system failure, we followed up on our June 1998 report by reviewing two plans that address critical IRS business processes. We recognize that these plans are being revised to incorporate the results of testing that was done in July 1999. At the time we prepared this report, however, the testing reports were not completed. Because of the time-critical nature of Year 2000 business continuity and contingency planning, we are reporting the results of our work at this time, rather than waiting to review testing reports and any revisions that may be made to the plans as a result of that testing.", "Our objective was to evaluate two IRS business continuity and contingency plans for their consistency and completeness on the basis of IRS\u2019 guidance for such plans. We focused on 2 of the 18 plans that IRS developed for its submission processing core business process. These two plans address processing paper tax returns that result in a refund and receiving paper submissions (which include tax returns). We reviewed these plans because they are designed to address failure scenarios that, if they occur and are prolonged, could require IRS to revert to manual operations for issuing refunds\u2014something that could potentially affect the majority of taxpayers that file individual tax returns. For example, in calendar year 1998, IRS processed about 91 million paper individual tax returns and issued more than 82 million refunds totaling about $112 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Business continuity and contingency plans should describe the steps an organization would take to ensure the continuity of its core business processes in the event of a system failure. In a June 1998 report, we made a series of recommendations aimed at broadening IRS\u2019 Year 2000 contingency planning approach to encompass a core business system focus as called for in our business continuity and contingency plan guide.IRS agreed with our recommendations and in July 1998 began to take action to develop a more comprehensive, business-based approach to contingency planning.", "IRS\u2019 Century Date Change Project Office hired a contractor to provide business continuity and contingency planning expertise and training and assist the business areas in developing and testing their plans. IRS established a working group comprised of representatives from IRS\u2019 business areas to identify IRS\u2019 core processes and associated subprocesses. For each core business process, IRS established a working group to (1) identify possible failure scenarios for subprocesses; (2) determine the business impact of these failures; (3) determine which failure scenarios should be addressed by business contingency plans, based on a scoring system that included business impact and risk; and (4) develop plans for those scenarios. IRS determined that business continuity and contingency plans should be prepared for all of the failure scenarios for its five submission processing subprocesses (receive paper submissions; receive electronic submissions; control and track tax and submissions; process, correct, and forward payment data; and process, correct, and forward tax information return data), several of which involve issuing refunds.", "In November 1998, IRS\u2019 Century Date Change Project Office issued its business continuity and contingency plan guidance that describes the (1) methodology to be used to develop business contingency plans (the term IRS uses for plans prepared in accordance with this guidance) and (2) types of information that should be included in the plans. IRS\u2019 guidance states that IRS used our guide to help develop its methodology for preparing business contingency plans.", "IRS\u2019 Chief Operations Officer designated a Year 2000 business executive to help coordinate the efforts of the working groups and oversee the development of the plans. According to IRS officials, the groups used IRS\u2019 guidance to develop the plans. These groups also received technical guidance from the contractor. Each business contingency plan was assigned to an executive-level official who was responsible for approving the plan. In the event of a Year 2000 system-related failure, this executive is also to decide if and when the trigger conditions have been met for implementing the business contingency plan. The plans were to be tested to identify any needed changes. The two plans that we reviewed were tested on July 8 and 9, 1999, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plans Were Inconsistent and Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["The refund plan and the paper submissions plan were inconsistent and incomplete in two key areas of IRS\u2019 guidance. These areas were performance goals and mitigating actions. These weaknesses raise questions about whether these two plans provide sufficient assurance that IRS has taken all the necessary steps to reduce the impact of a potential Year 2000 failure. IRS officials agreed to make changes to these two plans to improve their consistency and completeness in these areas. In addition, IRS officials said they have taken steps to help ensure the consistency and completeness of other business contingency plans and make changes to those plans if necessary."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Refund Plan", "paragraphs": ["IRS does not have viable, alternative backup systems for the various information systems used for processing tax returns. Further, IRS\u2019 refund plan acknowledges that in the event that one or more of these systems fail, IRS may experience \u201ca major work stoppage,\u201d depending on how long the failure continues. Given the lack of automated alternatives, the refund plan calls for (1) notifying the public and (2) reverting to manual issuance of refunds\u2014a process that IRS currently uses for certain types of taxpayers (e.g., those receiving a refund of more than $1 million or those with a specific hardship).", "Although this business contingency plan includes a specific performance goal as required by IRS\u2019 guidance, that goal is inconsistent with the recommended contingency actions. Specifically, the plan\u2019s performance goal calls for issuing 20 percent of the normal refund volume, using a $5,000 minimum as the threshold for manual issuance. However, the plan\u2019s contingency procedures call for instituting a manual operation that would give priority to processing refunds for 1040EZ returns. These returns are filed by taxpayers with taxable incomes of less than $50,000. Consequently, these returns may not generate a significant number of $5,000 refunds.", "The inconsistency between the performance goal and the business contingency plan procedures raises questions about the goal that IRS is trying to achieve with its contingency plan. For example, if IRS is trying to reduce the potential for incurring increased interest costs on late refunds, high-dollar refunds should be targeted regardless of the type of return.However, if IRS is trying to expedite tax refunds for those taxpayers who may have the greatest financial need, a performance goal that focuses on issuing refunds of $5,000 or more may not be appropriate.", "In our June 1999 meeting with IRS officials, we pointed out this inconsistency, and they agreed that they needed to change the plan\u2019s performance goal. In our meeting, the executive that was responsible for this plan said the plan\u2019s performance goal should focus on issuing refunds to certain \u201chardship\u201d taxpayers. According to IRS, hardship taxpayers would be those that filed a return with (1) a Form 911, Application for Taxpayer Assistance Order; (2) an earned income tax credit, which is a refundable tax credit available to low-income, working taxpayers; or (3) an adjusted gross income within a certain dollar range that is to be determined if a Year 2000 failure actually occurs.", "With respect to mitigating actions, this plan did not include dates for completing them before a potential Year 2000 failure. Examples of the plan\u2019s mitigating actions include (1) preparing a letter to the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service outlining the process for transferring refund documents and files, (2) planning for one additional week of training on the manual refund issuance process, (3) identifying additional secure storage space in each service center, and (4) coordinating press release information with IRS\u2019 Office of Public Affairs. Moreover, the plan did not specify which individuals were to be responsible for completing the mitigating actions. Although IRS\u2019 guidance does not require that the plan identify specific individuals, without identifying responsible individuals and dates for completing the mitigating actions, IRS has little assurance that these actions will be completed before a potential Year 2000 failure. In our June 1999 meeting, the executive responsible for this plan acknowledged this omission and agreed that the mitigating actions should identify responsible individuals and completion dates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Paper Submissions Plan", "paragraphs": ["IRS receives paper submissions, including tax returns, at each service center loading dock. From the loading dock, the returns are taken to the mailroom for sorting. IRS\u2019 Service Center Automated Mail Processing System (SCAMPS) is a new automated system that IRS uses to sort the mail. SCAMPS is to (1) open the envelopes to expedite the extraction process, in which employees remove the tax return information from the envelopes; (2) identify those tax returns with checks; (3) read the bar- coded tax return envelopes and sort them into one of 40 different categories; and (4) sort outgoing mail. The paper submissions plan focuses on the contingency actions to be implemented in the event that SCAMPS experiences a Year 2000 system failure.", "Although IRS\u2019 guidance calls for plans to contain a performance goal, the paper submissions plan did not include one. According to the plan, \u201cspecific performance measures for manual mail handling operations are not yet available.\u201d However, without a performance goal, it is unclear how IRS determined that it would be sufficient to \u201cuse available service center personnel to handle incoming mail\u201d as specified in the plan.", "While we recognize that IRS is developing new performance measures that may not yet be available for this business function, in our June 1999 meeting with IRS officials, we identified information that could be used to develop a performance goal for the plan. For example, the SCAMPS processing rate could be used as a guide for developing an acceptable (albeit reduced) level of service for a manual mail sorting process. IRS could also use its productivity data on employees that manually extract tax return information from envelopes as a basis for developing a performance goal. The IRS executive that was responsible for this plan agreed that a goal should be included and that these two data sources could be used to develop that goal.", "The plan\u2019s mitigating actions were also incomplete. Like the refund plan, this plan did not include the dates and the responsible individuals for completing the plan\u2019s two mitigating actions. Also, we told IRS officials that we had questions about the viability of one of the plan\u2019s mitigating actions. That action calls for reverting back to a mail sorting system that is currently not Year 2000 compliant. Even if IRS could develop a workaround solution to make the older mail sorting system Year 2000 compliant, IRS officials said that they had planned to remove the equipment for the older system by the 2000 filing season. IRS officials told us that as a result of testing this plan, this mitigating action would be deleted in the revised plan. The executive responsible for this plan also agreed to add responsible individuals and the dates for completing the other mitigating action, which pertains to sorting outgoing mail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions Are Under Way to Help Ensure Consistency and Completeness of All Plans", "paragraphs": ["In addition to agreeing to make changes to the two plans, IRS officials said that actions are under way to help ensure that other business contingency plans are consistent and complete. According to officials in IRS\u2019 Business Systems Requirements Office (BSRO), a staff member has been designated to review all of the business contingency plans for consistency and completeness and for crosscutting issues among the plans. Heretofore, BSRO did not view this as its function, in part because according to BSRO officials, it had a limited number of staff. IRS also has issued a work request for one of its Year 2000 contractors to develop a database that BSRO staff could use to track the implementation of key elements of the business contingency plan (e.g., triggers, mitigating actions, contingency team actions). According to IRS, information from the business contingency plans is to be added to the database by late September 1999, and reports are to be generated shortly thereafter.", "If properly implemented in a timely fashion, these actions should provide IRS with a higher level of assurance that its business contingency plans will help reduce the impact in the event of a Year 2000\u2013related system failure.

In lieu of including the testing procedures in the plan, IRS developed separate test plans for each contingency plan. To provide timely feedback to IRS so that they could begin corrective actions promptly, we focused our efforts on the business contingency plans themselves rather than the test plans. We did not analyze the post-event wrap-up information or the contingency actions log sheet because these sections are to be completed after the business contingency plan has been implemented. Both plans included little information about information recovery (i.e., regaining or retrieving data that may be lost or damaged as a result of a system failure).", "We also did not review any existing business resumption plans that IRS developed for other than Year 2000-induced failures, and we did not examine the relationship between individual Year 2000 business contingency plans and IRS\u2019 \u201cEnd Game\u201d activities, which IRS is currently developing.", "We conducted our review from May 1999 to July 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On August 27, 1999, we obtained written comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

Furthermore, IRS said that the plans were to be tested by subject matter experts, including field staff, to ensure their viability, which would result in modifications to the plans. We agree that the plans were to be living documents and designed our methodology accordingly. Recognizing that the plans were subject to change based on the results of business contingency plan testing (as stated on p. 1 of our draft report), we met with IRS in June 1999 to discuss our initial findings. We scheduled this meeting, in part, so that IRS would have the benefit of our feedback while the plans were still subject to change, and possibly before they were to be tested.
