According to Treasury\u2019s Strategic Plan, the  primary objective of its debt management strategy is to finance the  government\u2019s borrowing needs at the lowest cost over time. Treasury  reports that it achieves this objective by  issuing marketable debt with a regular and predictable framework\u2014  meaning Treasury debt managers provide the market clear and  transparent information about planned issuance, and set a standard  calendar of auctions of each security type. managing its debt portfolio to mitigate \u201crollover risk\u201d\u2014the risk that it  may have to refinance its debt at higher interest rates;  fostering a healthy and liquid secondary market\u2014the marketplace in  which Treasury securities are traded; and promoting a broad and diverse investor base.", "To this end, Treasury issues securities in a wide range of maturities to  appeal to a broad range of investors, and in sufficient amounts to promote  liquid markets so investors can easily buy and sell Treasury securities.

A nominal security  returns the face value of the security at maturity; an inflation-indexed  security repays the principal adjusted for inflation. Floating rate notes pay  interest quarterly at a rate that varies with changes in the indexed rate,  such as the discount rate on the 13-week Treasury bill.", "The interest rates associated with the range of maturities of the nominal  securities issued by Treasury creates a \u201cyield curve\u201d which represents the  relationship between the maturity of an asset and its yield (the interest  rate paid by Treasury or cost of borrowing). Each security has different  cost and risk features for Treasury. Generally, Treasury must pay a  higher interest rate for longer-dated securities to compensate buyers for  waiting longer for principal to be repaid and accepting increased risk due  to uncertainty about future market conditions. But longer-dated  securities offer more certainty for budget planning because they lock in  interest rates for the duration of the security. Similarly, as Treasury offers  more of any given security, it may have to pay more interest to attract  investors. However, if Treasury offers too little of a specific security given  changing market demand, it could reduce the security\u2019s liquidity in the  secondary market, which would increase the interest cost Treasury must  pay to compensate investors for less liquidity.", "The mix of securities changes regularly as Treasury issues new debt and  funding needs change. Figure 1 shows the outstanding marketable debt  held by the public by security type between 2005 and 2019.", "Treasury typically responds to long-term increases in borrowing needs by  taking the following steps:  Increasing the amount of securities offered at scheduled  auctions. In 2018, Treasury increased auction sizes for securities at  all maturities as borrowing needs increased. For example, Treasury  increased the average size of auctions for floating rate notes by 15  percent (from about $16.2 billion in 2017 to $18.6 billion in 2018) and  3-year notes by 32 percent (from about $25.9 to $34.1 billion).", "Increasing the frequency of scheduled auctions.

As shown in figure 3, 63 of 67  market participants we surveyed from across 10 domestic sectors  reported that liquidity is one of the most important characteristics,  followed by depth and safety. Moreover, 55 of the 67 survey  respondents cited at least two of these characteristics as the most  important.", "Liquidity, depth, and safety are interrelated characteristics of Treasury  securities (see fig. 4). For example, liquidity and depth are both related to  the size of the market and the willingness of market participants to buy  and sell securities at low cost. In addition, liquidity is enhanced by safety,  for example by minimizing the risk that trading could be disrupted by  default. Treasury securities are considered one of the safest assets in the  world because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.  government.", "The importance of these characteristics was consistent across sectors, as  liquidity, depth, and safety support a variety of business practices and  needs. For example, Treasury securities serve as a close substitute to  cash for financial institutions and corporate treasurers, are one of the  cheapest and one of the most widely used forms of collateral for financial  transactions, and are a benchmark for pricing many other financial  products, such as corporate bonds, derivatives, and mortgages.", "In addition, international investors and experts we interviewed said that  both foreign official sector and foreign private sector investors value the  liquidity, depth, and safety of the Treasury market. For example, foreign  central banks value the ability to buy and sell large quantities of securities  to assist in managing their exchange rates and, in times of economic  stress, provide foreign currency credit to their country\u2019s businesses that  borrow or trade in U.S. dollars. Officials from a foreign central bank we  spoke with told us that Treasury securities are well suited for their  investment needs because of the combination of the large and deep  market\u2014which accommodates high-volume transactions\u2014and their  safety and liquidity.", "The combination of liquidity, depth, and safety supports reliable demand  for Treasury securities through changing market conditions.

Therefore, in 2014,  the Federal Reserve outlined a new framework it intended to adopt for  implementing monetary policy when it began to increase interest rates for  the first time since the financial crisis. The new operating framework  entails setting two short-term interest rates to manage the federal funds  rate (see sidebar).

In  January 2019, however, the Federal Reserve announced that it intended  to continue to operate with its post-crisis framework and would therefore  evaluate the appropriate time to stop shrinking its balance sheet. In  October 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that it would expand its  balance sheet, through purchases of Treasury bills, to satisfy increases in  the market\u2019s demand for cash and keep the federal funds rate in its target  range. As a result of these announcements, the Federal Reserve will  continue to hold a much larger portfolio of Treasury securities and will  therefore continue to purchase much larger quantities of Treasury  securities on an ongoing basis.", "If economic and financial conditions warrant, the Federal Reserve has  stated that it may again buy specific maturities of Treasury securities in  significant amounts to influence prevailing long-term interest rates to  improve economic conditions and thereby aid in achieving its monetary  policy objectives.
