Leading commercial companies employ practices to capture design and manufacturing knowledge in time to make key decisions during product development. First, the companies kept the degree of the design challenge manageable before starting a new product development program by using an evolutionary approach. Second, the companies captured design and manufacturing knowledge before the two critical decision points in product development: when the design was demonstrated to be stable--the second knowledge point--and when the product was demonstrated to be producible at an affordable cost--the third knowledge point. DOD has made changes to its acquisition policy in an attempt to improve its framework for developing weapons systems, but the policy does not require the capture of design or manufacturing knowledge or sufficient criteria to enter the system demonstration and production phases.

Collectively, these  practices ensure that a high level of knowledge exists about critical facets  of the product at key junctures during development. Such a knowledge- based process enables decision makers to be reasonably certain about  critical facets of the product under development when they need this  knowledge.", "To ensure the right level of knowledge at each key decision point in  product development, leading commercial companies separate technology  from product development and take steps to ensure the product design is  stabilized early so product performance and producibility can be  demonstrated before production. The process followed by leading  companies, illustrated in figure 2, can be broken down into the following  three knowledge points.", "Knowledge point 1 occurs when a match is made between the  customer\u2019s needs and the available resources\u2014technology, design, time,  and funding. To achieve this match, technologies needed to meet  essential product requirements must be demonstrated to work in their  intended environment.

DOD\u2019s  common practice for managing this environment has been to create  aggressive risk reduction efforts in its programs. Cost reduction initiatives  that typically arise after a program is experiencing problems are common  tools used to manage these risks.

Because these changes occurred in 2000  and 2001, it is too early to determine how effectively they will be put into  practice.

On the basis of our literature searches and discussions  with experts, we identified a number of commercial companies as having  innovative development processes and practices that resulted in successful  product development. We visited the following commercial companies:  Caterpillar designs and manufactures construction and mining  equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines.

As such, they are not intended to describe all practices or  suggest that commercial companies are without flaws. Representatives  from the commercial companies visited told us that the development of  their best practices has evolved over many years and that the practices  continue to be improved based on lessons learned and new ideas and  information. They admit that the application and use of these have not  always been consistent or without error. However, they strongly suggested  that the probability of success in developing new products is greatly  enhanced by the use of these practices. Further, because of the sensitivity  to how data that would show the actual outcomes of new product  development efforts might affect their competitive standing, we did not  obtain specific cost, schedule, and performance data. Most examples  provided by these companies were anecdotal. However, the continued  success of these companies over time in a competitive marketplace  indicated that their practices were important and key to their operations.  Furthermore, based on our observations during meetings at these  companies, it was apparent that because of the level of detailed process  tools developed for their managers and executive leadership these best  practices were a centerpiece of their operations.", "Next, we compared and contrasted the best practices with product  development practices used in five DOD major acquisition programs.  Below is a brief description of each program we examined:  The F-22 fighter aircraft program. This aircraft is designed with  advanced features to allow it to be less detectable to adversaries,  capable of high speeds for long ranges, and able to provide the pilot with  improved awareness of the surrounding situation through the use of  integrated avionics.

PAC-3 is designed to enhance the Patriot radar\u2019s ability to detect  and identify targets, increase system computer capabilities, improve  communications, increase the number of missiles in each launcher, and  incorporate a new \u201chit-to-kill\u201d missile. The \u201chit-to-kill\u201d missile  capabilities represent a major part of the development program, as these  are not capabilities included in prior versions of the Patriot system.

The Army plans to buy 1,159 missiles at a total acquisition cost  estimated at $8.5 billion.", "The Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures/Common Missile  Warning System (ATIRCM/CMWS) program. ATIRCM/CMWS is a  defensive countermeasure system for protection against infrared guided  missiles. The common missile warning system detects missiles in flight,  and the advanced threat infrared countermeasure defeats the missile  with the use of a laser. The combined system is designed for helicopter  aircraft. The common missile warning system is also designed for  tactical aircraft such as fighters. The program began in 1995 and is  expected to start limited production in 2002.

AIM-9X is an infrared, short range, air-to- air missile carried by Navy and Air Force fighter aircraft. The AIM-9X is  an extensive upgrade of the AIM-9M. The AIM-9X is planned to have  increased resistance to countermeasures and improved target  acquisition capability. A key feature is that it will have the ability to  acquire, track, and fire on targets over a wider area than the AIM-9M.  The AIM-9X program began in 1994 and entered limited production in  2000.

We also selected these programs because we considered them to  be in two basic categories\u2014successful and unsuccessful cost and schedule  performance outcomes. This basis for selection was to compare and  contrast the development practices used on each with best practices used  by the commercial companies. For each program, we interviewed key  managers and design and manufacturing engineering representatives. In  some cases, we discussed design and manufacturing issues with  representatives of the primary contractor for the specific program to obtain  information on the practices and procedures used by the program to ready  the product design for initial manufacturing and testing as well as for  production. We also discussed the use and potential application of best  practices that we identified. In addition to discussions, we analyzed  significant amounts of data on engineering drawings, design changes, labor  efficiencies, manufacturing processes, quality indicators, testing, and  schedules.

Specifically, knowledge that a product\u2019s design is stable early in  the program facilitates informed decisions about whether to significantly  increase investments and reduces the risk of costly design changes that can  result from unknowns after initial manufacturing begins. This knowledge  comes in the form of completed engineering drawings before transitioning  from the system integration phase to the system demonstration phase of  product development. Best practices suggest that at least 90 percent of the  drawings for a product\u2019s design be completed before a decision to commit  additional resources is made. Likewise, later knowledge that the design can  be manufactured affordably and with consistent high quality prior to  making a production decision ensures that cost and schedule targets will  be met.

The system integration phase is used to  stabilize the overall system design by integrating components and  subsystems into a product and by showing that the design can meet  product requirements. When this knowledge is captured, knowledge point  2 has been achieved. It should be demonstrated by the completion of at  least 90 percent of engineering drawings, which both DOD and leading  commercial companies consider to be the point when a product\u2019s design is  essentially complete. In the DOD process, this knowledge point should  happen by the critical design review, before system demonstration and the  initial manufacturing of production representative products begins. The  system demonstration phase is then used to demonstrate that the product  will work as required and can be manufactured within targets. When this  knowledge is captured, knowledge point 3 has been achieved. Critical  manufacturing processes are in control and consistently producing items  within quality standards and tolerances for the overall product. Also,  product reliability has been demonstrated. In the DOD process, like with  the commercial process, this knowledge point should happen by the  production commitment milestone.

They had most of the detailed design complete, supported  by the completion of a large percentage of engineering drawings to  manufacturing. Again, engineering drawings are critical because they  include details on the parts and work instructions needed to make the  product and reflect the results of testing. These drawings allowed  manufacturing personnel to effectively plan the fabrication process and  efficiently build production representative prototypes in the factory so  manufacturing processes and the product\u2019s performance could be validated  before committing to production. The most successful DOD programs also  captured the knowledge that manufacturing processes needed to build the  product would consistently produce a reliable product by the end of system  demonstration, before making a production decision. On these programs,  the initial phase of production\u2014sometimes known as low-rate initial  production\u2014was able to focus on building operational test articles and  improving the production processes, instead of continuing the product\u2019s  design and development.", "Problematic programs moved forward into system demonstration without  the same knowledge from engineering drawings that successful cases had  captured. They increased investments in tooling, people, and materials  before the design was stable. In these programs, only a small percentage of  the drawings needed to make the products had been completed at the time  the designs were released to manufacturing organizations for building  production representative prototypes. In doing so, these programs  undertook the difficult challenge of stabilizing the designs at the same time  they were trying to build and test the products. This design immaturity  caused costly design changes and parts shortages that, in turn, caused  labor inefficiencies, schedule delays, and quality problems. Consequently,  these programs required significant increases in resources\u2013\u2013time and  money\u2014over what was estimated at the point each program began the  system demonstration phase.", "The most problematic programs also started production before design and  manufacturing development work was concluded. In these cases, programs  were producing items for the customers while making major product  design and tooling changes, still establishing manufacturing processes, and  conducting development testing. These programs encountered significant  cost increases, schedule delays, and performance problems during  production.", "Table 2 shows the relationship between design stability and manufacturing  knowledge at key junctures and the outcomes for the DOD programs we  reviewed. To measure design stability at the start of the system  demonstration phase, knowledge point 2, we determined the percentage of  the product\u2019s engineering drawings that had been completed by the critical  design review. In DOD programs, after the critical design review, the  system design is released to manufacturing to begin building the  production representative prototypes for the system demonstration phase.  To measure producibility at the production decision, knowledge point 3, we  determined whether the critical manufacturing processes were in  statistical control at that time. We compared this information with best  practices.

Despite having only about  a quarter of the eventual design drawings completed for the system, the  program declared the design to be stable and ready to begin initial  manufacturing. At that time, the program office had estimated the cost to  complete the development program at $19.5 billion. However, the program  did not complete 90 percent of its drawings for the aircraft until 1998,  3 years into the system demonstration phase.

Large sections were  delivered incomplete to final assembly and had to be built out of the  planned assembly sequence.", "In 1997, an independent review team examined the program and  determined the product development effort was underestimated. The team  found that building the first three aircraft was taking substantially more  labor hours than planned. Between 1995 and 1998, the development  estimate for the F-22 increased by over $3.3 billion and the schedule  slipped by a year.

The independent  review team evaluated the cost impact on the production aircraft that  would likely occur because of cost and schedule problems in development  and found that production aircraft would have to begin later, at a slower  pace, and cost more than expected. The team estimated that production  costs could increase by as much as $13 billion if savings were not found.  The Air Force subsequently increased the estimate to more than $19 billion  in cost savings required to avoid cost increases. In 2001, when the F-22  limited production decision was made, the program had less knowledge  about the aircraft\u2019s reliability and manufacturing processes than more  successful cases. For example, at its limited production decision, it had  only 44 percent of its critical manufacturing processes in control.

This framework limited the design  challenge for any one new product development by requiring risky  technology, design, or manufacturing requirements to be deferred until a  future generation of the product. Second, each company (1) employed a  disciplined product development process that brought together and  integrated all of the technologies, components, and subsystems required  for the product to ensure the design was stable before entering product  demonstration and (2) demonstrated the product was reliable and  producible using proven manufacturing processes before entering  production.", "The product development process includes tools that both capture  knowledge and tie this knowledge to decisions about the product\u2019s design  and manufacturing processes before making commitments that would  significantly affect company resources. For example, during system  integration, each leading commercial company used various forms of  prototypes and information from predecessor products to stabilize the  product\u2019s design and identify critical processes, then used a decision  review that required agreements from key stakeholders that the requisite  design knowledge was captured in making a decision to move into system  demonstration.

In effect, these companies evolve products,  continuously improving their performance as new technologies and  methods allow. These evolutionary improvements to products eventually  result in the full desired capability, but in multiple steps, delivering a series  of enhanced interim capabilities to the customer more quickly.", "Historically, DOD\u2019s approach has been to develop new weapon systems  that often attempt to satisfy the full requirement in a single step, regardless  of the design challenge or the maturity of technologies necessary to  achieve the full capability.

General  Electric considers the introduction of immature technologies into fielded  products or new engine development programs as a significant cost and  schedule risk. Its new product development process is primarily focused  on reducing and managing risk for design changes and product  introductions. Cummins and Hewlett Packard managers indicated that, in  the past, their companies learned the hard way by trying to make quantum  leaps in product performance and by including immature technologies.  Now, both companies have new product development processes that  actively manage the amount of new content that can be placed on a new  product development effort. Caterpillar also limits new content on its new  products as a way to more successfully and cost-effectively develop new,  but evolutionary, products. Even during the development of its 797 mining  truck, which it considered a major design challenge, it did not require the  truck to achieve capabilities\u2014such as prognostics for better  maintenance\u2014that it could not demonstrate or validate in the design in a  timely manner.", "Of the five DOD programs we reviewed, two\u2014the F/A-18-E/F and the  AIM-9X\u2014were variations of existing products\u2014the F/A-18-C/D and the  AIM-9M\u2014and the programs made a commitment to use existing  technologies and processes as much as possible.

Bringing processes under statistical control reduces variations in  parts manufactured, thus reducing the potential for defects. Product  variation has been called the \u201csilent killer\u201d on the manufacturing floor  because it can result in defects that require additional resources to either  rework or scrap the product. Products fielded with defects may have  degraded performance, lower reliability, or increased support costs.  Experience has taught commercial companies that it is less costly\u2014in  terms of time and money\u2014to eliminate product variation by controlling  manufacturing processes than to perform extensive inspection after a  product is built. Because thousands of manufacturing processes can be  required to build a product, companies focus on the critical processes\u2014 those that build parts that influence the product\u2019s performance, service life,  or manufacturability.

Key product characteristics and critical manufacturing  processes are noted on the engineering drawings and work instructions  that are released to manufacturing.", "Once critical processes are identified, companies perform capability  studies to ensure that a process will produce parts that meet specifications.  These studies yield a process capability index (Cpk), a measure of the  process\u2019s ability to build a part within specified limits. The index can be  translated into an expected product defect rate. The industry standard is to  have a Cpk of 1.33 or higher, which equates to a probability that 99.99  percent of the parts built on that process will be within the specified limits.  Four of the five companies we visited wanted their critical processes at a  minimum of a 1.33 Cpk and many had goals of achieving higher Cpks. Table  6 shows various Cpk values and the defect rate associated with each value.  The table also shows the higher the Cpk, the lower the defect rate.", "Cpk values also have an additive effect on various individual parts when  each part is integrated into the final product. For example, a product  composed of 25 parts, where each part is produced on a manufacturing  process with a Cpk of 0.67, has a 95.5 percent probability that each part will  be defect free. However, when all 25 parts are assembled into the final  product, the probability that the final product will be defect free is only  32 percent. In comparison, if the same parts are produced with  manufacturing processes at a Cpk of 1.33, the probability of each part being  defect free is 99.99 percent. When these same 25 parts are assembled into  the final product, the probability that the final product will be defect free is 99.8 percent.

Cummins built production representative prototypes of  its engines to demonstrate that the design and the engine hardware would  perform to requirements. These prototypes represented the first attempt to  build the product solely using manufacturing personnel, production  tooling, and production processes.

This information marks the starting point for the  product\u2019s reliability growth plan and is the basis for assessing whether the  plan is achievable by production. If Caterpillar believes the risks are too  high and the goal cannot be achieved on time, decision makers assess  trade-offs between new and existing components to reduce the risks to a  more manageable level. Trade-offs might be made if the product\u2019s  performance still fails to meet requirements. If trade-offs are not possible,  decision makers may decide not to go forward with the development.

According to program officials,  there was little emphasis during development or initial production on using  statistical control on critical manufacturing processes. Most of the  development missiles were built in specialty shops rather than in a  manufacturing environment. The result was a lack of knowledge about  whether the critical manufacturing processes could produce the product to  established cost, schedule, and quality targets. This uncertainty is reflected  in contractor estimates that more than 50 percent of the time charged to  build the initial production missiles will be for engineering activities.  Actual production labor is expected to account for about 30 percent of the  charged time.", "To further understand the problems on the PAC-3 program, we focused on  its seeker subsystem, which is key to acquiring and tracking targets and  represents a large percentage of the missile\u2019s cost. Currently, despite being  in production, it is unclear whether the supplier of the seeker can produce  it within cost, schedule, and quality targets. During development, the  supplier had difficulty in designing and manufacturing this subsystem. It  was not uncommon for seekers to be built, tested, and reworked seven or  eight times before they were acceptable. The program entered production,  despite these producibility issues. Now, even with 2 years of production  experience, the supplier continues to have difficulty producing the seeker  with acceptable quality. Data provided by the supplier in October 2001  showed that less than 25 percent of the seekers were being manufactured  properly the first time and the rest had to be reworked, on average, four  times."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATIRCM/CMWS Program", "paragraphs": ["According to program officials, ATIRCM/CMWS did not have a stable  design until about 2 years after the critical design review.

Its goal was to develop higher quality  systems in less time and for less cost. However, DOD\u2019s acquisition policy  lacks detailed criteria for capturing and using design and manufacturing  knowledge to facilitate better decisions and more successful acquisition  program outcomes.

In DOD, current incentives  are geared toward delaying knowledge so as not to jeopardize program  funding. These incentives undermine a knowledge-based process for  making product development decisions. Instead, program managers and  contractors push the capture of design and manufacturing knowledge to  later in the development program to avoid the identification of problems  that might stop or limit its funding. They focus more on meeting schedules  than capturing and having the knowledge necessary to make the right  decisions at those milestones. Such an approach invariably leads to added  costs because programs are forced to fix problems late in development.", "By contrast, commercial companies must develop high-quality products  quickly or they may not survive in the marketplace. Because of this, they  encourage their managers to capture product design and manufacturing  knowledge to identify and resolve problems early in development, before  making significant increases in their investment. Instead of a schedule- driven process, their process is driven by events that bring them  knowledge: critical design reviews that are supported by completed  engineering drawings and production decisions that are supported by  reliability testing and statistical process control data.

In three of the five DOD  program examples in chapter 3, managers decided to move forward in  development, even when developers had failed to capture design and  manufacturing knowledge to support increased investments. As a result,  these programs encountered significant increases in acquisition costs as  well as delays in delivering capabilities to the war fighter.", "Table 7 illustrates key criteria used by commercial companies that are  currently lacking in DOD\u2019s policy.

The policy states that, during this phase, a system\u2019s configuration  should be documented and the system should be demonstrated using  prototypes in a relevant environment. While these are noteworthy activities  and resemble best practices, the policy does not provide criteria for what  constitutes the level of knowledge required for completing this stage, nor  does it require a decision\u2014based on those criteria\u2014as to whether a  significant, additional investment should be made. Commercial companies  demand knowledge from virtual or engineering prototypes, 90 percent of  required engineering drawings for the product supported by test results,  demonstration that the product meets customer requirements, a series of  disciplined design reviews, and stakeholder agreement that the design is  stable and ready for product demonstration before a commitment is made  to move forward and invest in product demonstration. Under DOD\u2019s  revised policy, it is still difficult to determine if a product should enter  product demonstration with a stable design.", "DOD\u2019s current acquisition policy also states that the system demonstration  phase begins after prototypes have been built and demonstrated in a  relevant environment during system integration. According to the policy, a  system must be demonstrated before the department will commit to  production. The low-rate initial production decision occurs after this phase  of product development. Like the end of system integration, the policy fails  to provide specific criteria for what constitutes the knowledge required to  support the decision to move into production. For example, the policy  states there should be \u201cno significant manufacturing risks\u201d but does not  define what this means or how it is measured. Without criteria for building  knowledge during the demonstration phase, the production decision is  often based on insufficient knowledge, creating a higher probability of  inconsistent results and cost and schedule problems. On the other hand,  commercial companies demand proof that manufacturing processes are in  control and product reliability goals are attained before committing to  production. With more specific knowledge in hand at the end of  development, decision makers can make a more informed decision to move  into production with assurances that the product will achieve its cost,  schedule, and quality outcomes.", "Finally, while DOD\u2019s policy separates product development into a two-stage  process\u2014integration and demonstration\u2014it does not require a decision  milestone to move from one stage to the next. The policy states that an  interim progress review should be held between the two stages, but the  review has no established agenda and no required outputs of information  unless specifically requested by the decision maker. Its purpose is to  confirm that the program is progressing as planned. On the other hand,  commercial companies consider this review a critical decision point in  their product development process because it precedes a commitment to  significantly increase their investment. Therefore, they use specific,  knowledge-based standards and criteria to determine if the product is  ready to enter the next phase and they hold decision makers accountable  for their actions. These decision reviews are mandatory and are typically  held at the executive level of the commercial firm.", "Figure 9 illustrates the commercial model for knowledge to be captured  and delivered during product integration and product demonstration and  the possible application of that model to DOD\u2019s acquisition process.  Without a similar decision review to bring accountability to the DOD  process, acquisition programs can\u2014and do\u2014continue to advance into  system demonstration without a stable design.

In DOD, incentives are centered on  obtaining scarce funding on an annual basis in a competitive environment  to meet predetermined and typically optimistic program schedules. These  incentives actually work against the timely capture of knowledge, pushing  it off until late in the process to avoid problems that might keep a program  from being funded. Because design and manufacturing knowledge is not  captured, key decision points intended to measure and ensure that a  weapon system has sufficiently matured to move forward in the process  risk becoming unsupported by critical knowledge. In leading commercial  companies, the opposite is true. Because companies know they have to  deliver high-quality products quickly and affordably, they limit the  challenge for their program managers and provide strong incentives to  capture design and manufacturing knowledge early in the process.  Program managers are empowered to make informed decisions before big  investments in manufacturing capability are required.", "DOD\u2019s current acquisition environment is driven by incentives to make  decisions while significant unknowns about the system\u2019s design and  manufacturability persist. This environment results in higher risks and a  greater reliance on cost-reimbursement contracts for longer periods of  time during product development. Because events that should drive key  decisions, such as critical design reviews, interim progress reviews, and  production decision reviews, are based on inadequate design and  manufacturing knowledge, they do not support decisions to invest more  and move to the next phase of the acquisition process. Nevertheless, this  approach has proven effective in securing funds year to year. For example,  the F-22, PAC-3, and ATIRCMS/CMWS programs had less than one-third of  their engineering drawings completed at their critical design review, but  each obtained the funding necessary to move onto the initial manufacturing  of production representative prototypes. That funding allowed a significant  increase in investment to develop a manufacturing capability before critical  knowledge had been captured. The incentive to capture funding for the  program was greater than the incentive to wait, capture knowledge, and  reduce the risk of moving forward. Each of these programs encountered  significant cost increases and schedule delays.", "The incentives are quite different for leading commercial companies. For  them, the business case centers on the ability to produce a product that the  customer will buy and that will provide an acceptable return on  investment. If the firm has not made a sound business case, or has been  unable to deliver on one or more of the business case factors, it faces a very  real prospect of failure\u2014the customer may walk away. Also, if one product  development takes more time and money to complete than expected, it  denies the firm opportunities to invest those resources in other products.  For these reasons, commercial companies have strong incentives to  capture product knowledge early in the process to assess the chances of  making the business case and the need for further investments.", "Production is a dominant concern in commercial companies throughout  the product development process and forces discipline and trade-offs in the  design process. This environment encourages realistic assessments of risks  and costs since doing otherwise would threaten the business case and  invite failure. For the same reasons, the environment places a high value on  knowledge for making decisions. Program managers have good reasons to  identify risks early, be intolerant of unknowns, and not rely on testing late  in the process as the main vehicle for discovering the performance  characteristics of the product. By adhering to the business case as the key  to success, program managers in leading commercial companies are  conservative in their estimates and aggressive in risk reduction. Ultimately,  adherence to the business case strengthens the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to  pressures to accept high risks and unknowns. Practices such as  prototyping, early manufacturing and supplier involvement, completing 90  percent of engineering drawings by critical design review, demonstrating  product reliability, and achieving statistical control of critical  manufacturing processes by production are adopted because they help  ensure success.", "In DOD\u2019s current acquisition environment, the customer is willing to trade  time and money for the highest performing weapon system possible. That  willingness drives the business case. This creates strong incentives for the  program office to take significant risks with technologies and designs to  ensure it can offer the customer a weapon system that is a quantum leap  above the competition. In addition, because funding is secured on an  annual basis in DOD, strong incentives exist for the program office to make  optimistic assumptions about development cost and schedule. Because the  customer is willing to wait and funding is never certain, an environment  exists where program managers have good reasons to avoid the capture of  knowledge and delay testing. Since the business case in DOD places very  little premium on meeting cost and schedule targets, but a very high  premium on performance, programs succeed at the point where sunk costs  make it difficult\u2014if not prohibitive\u2014for decision makers to cancel them.", "The practices commercial companies use to capture knowledge are not  currently used in this environment because the business case does not  favor them. Instead, DOD\u2019s product development environment relies on  cost-type contracting throughout the entire product development process.

This approach means  adopting and implementing an evolutionary approach to developing new  weapon systems, improving policy to more closely approximate a  knowledge-based product development process, and creating incentives  for capturing and using knowledge for decision making. Without an  evolutionary approach as its foundation, the ability to capture design and  manufacturing knowledge early in the development process is significantly  reduced. Programs, in turn, take on too much new unproven content to  meet their objectives and risks invariably increase. DOD has made  improvements in its acquisition policy by incorporating guidance for  evolutionary acquisition, creating guidelines for the development of a basic  product that can be upgraded with additional capabilities as technologies  present themselves. However, evolutionary acquisition has yet to be  consistently implemented with success on individual weapon system  acquisitions.", "Regardless of whether DOD emphasized greater use of evolutionary  acquisition, acquisition programs are not capturing sufficient design and  manufacturing knowledge to make good decisions at key investment  points. The current policy establishes a good framework to develop a  product, but the policy still lacks specific criteria required to move a  program forward and does not tie knowledge to decisions for increasing  investments in the program as it moves from system integration to system  demonstration. As a result, programs often pass through each development  phase and into production with an unstable design and insufficient  knowledge about critical manufacturing processes and product reliability.  This results in greater likelihood for inconsistent and poor results and cost  and schedule problems later in the program.", "Additionally, DOD does not provide the proper incentives to encourage the  use of best practices in capturing knowledge early in its development  programs. Currently, managers are focused more on the annual exercise of  obtaining funding needed to keep their programs viable and alive. The  importance of capturing design and manufacturing knowledge early gives  way to the pressures of maintaining funding, often resulting in the  acceptance of greater risks. Raising problems on a program early because  design and manufacturing knowledge is discovered can cause extra  oversight and questions that threaten a system\u2019s survival. The prevailing  culture is to accept greater risks upfront and then fix problems later in the  development program.", "We found that leading commercial companies over the years had found  ways to overcome these problems and had identified best practices that  resulted in the early capture of and use of design and manufacturing  knowledge. This was done by a combination of four key elements. First,  they established and used an evolutionary approach to develop products  that made the capture of design and manufacturing knowledge a more  manageable task. This framework limited the design challenge for any one  new product development by allowing risky technology, design, or  manufacturing requirements to be deferred until a future generation of the  product. DOD\u2019s current policy addresses this; however, it has not had  sufficient time to show how this will be implemented.", "Second, each company we visited used the same basic product  development process and criteria for bringing together and integrating all  of the technologies, components, and subsystems required for the product  to ensure the design was stable and then demonstrating that the product  was producible and reliable using proven manufacturing processes. DOD\u2019s  policy lacks the criteria to measure design stability and process controls.  Third, successful companies used tools to capture design and  manufacturing knowledge about the product and decide about whether to  invest further based on that knowledge. Their new product development  process included key, high-level decision points before moving into product  demonstration, and again before making the production decision that  required specific, knowledge-based exit criteria. DOD\u2019s policy does not  require a decision to move from system integration to system  demonstration. Finally, leading companies created an environment for their  managers that emphasized capturing design and manufacturing knowledge  early, before committing substantial investments in a product development  that made cancellation a more difficult decision to make.

This is a reasonable approach when processes are new or unique.   However, not all critical processes will be new or unique to a specific  weapon system. Some will have been used to manufacture parts or  components for other systems or products.  At a minimum, it should be  possible to demonstrate these by Milestone C.
