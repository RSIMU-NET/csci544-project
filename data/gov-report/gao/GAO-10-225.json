IRS's efforts to ensure compliance begin during the filing season. GAO was asked to assess IRS's 2009 filing season performance, identify ways to reduce taxpayers' use of short-term, high-interest refund anticipation loans (RAL) offered by paid preparers or banks, and identify ways to enhance compliance during processing. GAO analyzed IRS performance data, reviewed IRS operations, interviewed IRS officials, and reviewed its compliance programs and relevant statutes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS processed 139 million returns and issued $298 billion in refunds as of October 2, 2009. Electronic filing, which provides IRS with significant cost savings and taxpayers with faster refunds, increased to 68 percent of all returns filed. While taxpayers' access to telephone assistors was better than last year, it remained lower than in 2007 in part because of calls about tax law changes. Compared to 2005 through 2007, IRS reduced its goal for assistor answered calls in 2009 and set its 2010 goal at 71 percent. Despite heavy call volume, the accuracy of IRS responses to taxpayers' questions remained above 90 percent. IRS started a major data collection effort on why taxpayers call, but lacks a plan to analyze the data and improve telephone service. According to IRS, issuing refunds faster reduces taxpayers' use of RALs, high-interest loans made by paid tax preparers or banks in anticipation of a refund. Issuing refunds is a joint effort by IRS, Treasury's Financial Management Service, which checks for non-tax debt owed to the federal government, and the Automated Clearing House, which distributes funds. However, IRS has not coordinated extensively with them to expedite refunds. Further, IRS has not studied the use of debit cards for unbanked taxpayers, which could also reduce taxpayers' use of RALs by providing faster and more secure refunds. IRS automatically identifies and corrects select types of errors while processing tax returns. It could also correct tax returns that claim the Hope credit, a tax credit to help offset qualified education expenses, for longer than the number of years allowed. However, IRS lacks the authority to use prior years' tax return information for this purpose. Also, information reported by education institutions to taxpayers and IRS about qualifying educational expenses on the Form 1098-T is confusing for taxpayers and not useful for IRS. Many institutions report the total amount billed to students, but not what is actually paid after taking into account scholarships and grants. This results in some taxpayers under-claiming benefits, while others over-claim. Finally, because Form 1098-T can show the amount billed, which may not be the amount paid, IRS is unable to use the information to automatically verify taxpayers' claims for the credit through its computerized matching program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) 2009 filing season is an enormous  and critical undertaking.

IRS also answered tens of millions of taxpayer questions through  telephone, Web site, and face-to-face assistance. During each of the last  two filing seasons, IRS has been called upon to quickly implement  complex tax law changes, including economic stimulus policies that have  resulted in unexpected increases in call volume and created new taxpayer  compliance challenges and workload.", "IRS\u2019s filing season performance also has indirect effects on taxpayers. For  example, timely issuance of refunds can reduce taxpayer demand for  refund anticipation loans (RAL), which are short-term, often high-interest  loans offered by tax preparers or banks that allow taxpayers to receive  their refund cash quickly, sometimes within the same day. The filing  season is also the time IRS begins its enforcement efforts with its math  error program, in which IRS uses its computers to identify errors during  processing, such as calculation mistakes or omitted or inconsistent  entries.

TAB also provided estimates of the cost- per-service contact for different types of taxpayer services and conducted  preliminary research about the effect of taxpayer service on compliance.  IRS delivered an update of TAB to Congress in October  2009.", "Millions of taxpayers who do not want to wait for their tax refunds from  IRS choose to obtain RALs, which are offered by paid preparers or banks  to taxpayers in connection with federal and/or state tax refunds.", "RALs are short-term, high interest rate bank loans. We found that the  annual percentage rate on RALs can be over 500 percent, RALs offer  taxpayers the benefit of receiving cash quickly based on an expected  refund. Combined with tax preparation fees, RALs may considerably  reduce a taxpayer\u2019s refund. However, RALs remain popular, especially  among low-income taxpayers.", "RAL providers might also offer RACs, which are not loans, but instead  are a refund delivery option where IRS direct deposits a refund into a  temporary account set up by a financial institution, which withdraws  the tax return preparation fee, and then makes the remaining funds  available to the taxpayer. RALs and RACs allow taxpayers to pay return  preparation and fees out of their refunds.", "IRS uses its many tools to identify and correct noncompliance, whether  intentional or unintentional.", "Over the years, Congress granted IRS statutory authority to cover  specific areas so that the agency could correct tax return errors during  processing, including calculation errors and entries that are  inconsistent or exceed statutory limits, without having to issue the  taxpayer a statutory notice of deficiency (see app. II for details). Math  error checks are automated and low-cost relative to audits. Prompt  compliance checks, such as math error checks, increase the likelihood  of IRS collecting all or part of the amount owed. However, IRS must  be granted MEA from Congress by statute for specific purposes, and as  noted above, we recently suggested areas where IRS could benefit from  new authorities.  IRS gets most of the information returns during the filing season. These  returns are provided by third parties, such as employers, banks, or  educational institutions, file returns with IRS and taxpayers that  provide information on a variety of taxpayer transactions. IRS tries to  match information from the information returns filed by third parties  against taxpayers\u2019 income tax returns to see if taxpayers have filed  returns and reported their income and expenses.

Electronic filing  provides IRS with significant cost savings\u2014IRS estimates the cost savings  of electronic filing to be $2.71 per return over the costs in 2008. It helps  taxpayers to receive their refunds faster and aids IRS in achieving the  electronic filing goal of having 80 percent of all federal tax and  information returns filed electronically by 2012. IRS issued approximately  109 million refunds, up 4 million from last year, for $298 billion.  Approximately 66 percent of all refunds were directly deposited, 9 percent  more than last year. This increase is important, because direct deposit is  faster, more convenient for taxpayers, and less expensive for IRS than  mailing paper checks.", "IRS attributes the increase in electronic filing, in part, to a 19 percent  increase in people filing from home computers, which may be related to  the elimination of separate fees for electronic filing. According to IRS, the  elimination of fees by some paid preparers also contributed to the decline  in the Free File program\u2014as of September 20, 2009, the number of  taxpayers who filed through Free File decreased to 3 million, down 37  percent from last year. IRS also attributed part of the decrease to the  migration of taxpayers to other free offers in the marketplace. The Free  File program offered a new option this year, fillable forms, that allow   taxpayers to download forms from IRS and fill them in on a home  computer without using tax preparation software. About 270,000  taxpayers used this option.", "Finally, IRS met or exceeded its goals for six out of eight of the processing  measures (see app. II for details). For example, IRS exceeded its goals for  refund timeliness, and deposit timeliness and accuracy. The one measure  where performance was significantly below IRS\u2019s goal and last year\u2019s level  was the correspondence error rate, which is the percentage of incorrect  notices and letters issued to taxpayers. According to IRS officials, this  resulted from a high number of erroneous notices sent to taxpayers during  the filing season related to the recovery rebate credit. In our interim  report, we noted that millions of tax returns had these types of errors,  which resulted in a delay in refund timeliness from 1 day to a week.

In  addition, each successive release of the system was expected to process  more complex returns and several technical challenges had not been  addressed. Given this, IRS estimated that full implementation of CADE  would not be achieved until at least 2018 or possibly as late as 2028. As a  consequence, IRS decided to stop development of new CADE functionality  and rethink its strategy for modernizing individual taxpayer accounts to  determine whether an alternative approach could deliver improvements  sooner. IRS also stopped its plans for adding new functionality to a CADE- related system that allows its telephone assistors to access and work with  taxpayer accounts. According to IRS officials, the need to enhance  computer security and the availability of new technologies also influenced  the decision to rethink the CADE strategy.", "Stopping CADE development has trade-offs in that IRS will not be able to  materially increase the number of returns processed on CADE during the  2010 filing season, which, in turn, means that the number of taxpayers  benefiting from faster refund processing will not increase.", "On the other hand, IRS\u2019s new strategy for modernizing individual taxpayer  accounts is intended to address the risks and challenges of the initial  approach. Importantly, IRS officials responsible for implementing this new  strategy told us that they expect to provide all taxpayers with faster refund  processing by the 2012 filing season. IRS plans to do this by continuing  daily processing of the roughly 40 million taxpayer accounts currently on  CADE while converting the legacy Individual Master File system from  weekly to daily processing for the roughly 100 million remaining accounts.  IRS also plans to develop a new database that would be the single  authoritative source of taxpayer account information and use the new  database for daily processing by 2014.", "IRS established a program management office to guide the implementation  of the new strategy and developed a preliminary road map and high-level  cost estimates for the effort.

IRS initially set the fiscal year 2009  goal for the percentage of taxpayers seeking assistor service who actually  received it at 77 percent. Perhaps more importantly, IRS reduced the goal  for 2010 to 71 percent. According to IRS officials, the goals were reduced  because of resource trade-offs related to call volume increases starting in  2008.", "As shown in table 4, IRS\u2019s call volume in 2008 and 2009 was substantially  higher than in prior years. Although IRS received 40 million fewer calls in  2009 than in 2008, the volume was still well above earlier years. While  IRS\u2019s automated call systems answered an increasing number of calls, the  number of calls abandoned by taxpayers, busy signals, and calls  disconnected by IRS also went up substantially. This may have limited  many taxpayers from reaching IRS assistors with questions.", "IRS attributed the heavier-than-anticipated call volume in part due to  stimulus-related questions and taxpayers needing authentication  information. Taxpayers had to provide their last year\u2019s adjusted gross  income (AGI) or personal identification number (PIN) to authenticate  their identity in order to electronically file. Taxpayers who did not know  their AGI or PIN and tried to get it from IRS had to call an assistor or visit  an IRS walk-in site. While IRS took actions to minimize the effect of these  calls, heavy volume continued through the filing season. According to IRS,  its assistors answered 3 million calls from taxpayers needing their AGI,  nearly 10 percent of all assistor calls, at a cost of $36 million through June  2009.", "We recently reported that IRS is developing an automated Web and phone  application to provide taxpayers with authentication information for  electronic filing in the 2010 filing season. In that report, we also made  recommendations to improve telephone service by reducing the volume of  telephone calls, which could improve taxpayer access to IRS assistors. For  example, in addition to recommending ways to reduce the number of  rejected returns, which often lead to taxpayers calling IRS, we  recommended that IRS develop a low-cost automated method to respond  to taxpayer questions about volunteer site locations and hours of  operation. IRS is in the process of addressing those recommendations.", "Despite the heavy call volume, the accuracy of the telephone assistors\u2019  responses to tax law and account questions was higher by a statistically  significant amount compared to the same period last year and exceeded  IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2009 goals (see table 5). Since 2005, IRS has maintained a  level of accuracy of about 90 percent or more. According to IRS officials,  the high accuracy is due to training and the introduction of new tools,  particularly the Interactive Tax Law Assistant (ITLA), which is a Web- based probe and response guide to help assistors provide more accurate  and consistent responses to specific tax law questions.", "IRS has limited information on why taxpayers call to speak IRS assistors.  To help obtain better information on why taxpayers call, IRS recently  implemented a major data collection effort called Contact Analytics at all  its 26 call sites. According to IRS, Contact Analytics is a significant  investment that will allow IRS to search recorded telephone interactions  between taxpayers and IRS assistors for key words or phrases. It is  intended to improve service by providing IRS with a research tool to better  understand why taxpayers are calling and take corrective action if  necessary as well as identify areas to reduce costs, such as identifying  calls that can be moved to self-service.", "However, the agency does not have a comprehensive and detailed analysis  plan for effectively using Contact Analytics data to determine how to  improve taxpayer service or reduce costs. According to IRS officials,  because Contact Analytics is a new program and data is only beginning to  be collected, IRS has not yet considered a plan to analyze the data  produced by the program. IRS officials recently indicated that now that  Contact Analytics has been implemented, they intend to eventually  develop an analysis plan. However, a standard approach for major data  collection efforts is to develop a research plan before data collection  begins. Such a plan helps ensure that necessary data is collected and that  resources are not wasted collecting information that will not be needed.  Now that IRS is actually collecting the data, the lack of a research plan  delays the time when improvements to taxpayer service, based on the  results of the research, could be implemented. Having a comprehensive  and detailed analysis plan that includes, for example, a research design,  dissemination of results, and involvement of relevant stakeholders,  provides a number of benefits, perhaps most importantly, increasing the  likelihood that the analysis will yield methodologically sound results,  thereby supporting effective policy decisions.", "While many taxpayers require service from live assistors, diverting calls to  automated services is also important because of the costs involved\u2014IRS  assistors answered about 26 million calls between January 1, 2009 and  June 30, 2009 at a cost of $25.75 per call, for a total of $670 million.

In contrast, IRS\u2019s mystery  shopping reviews resulted in a 68 percent accuracy rate. However, IRS  officials stated that the QSS reviews are statistically valid and, therefore,  provide a better overall assessment of return accuracy than mystery  shopping. Consequently, IRS officials reported they will not conduct  mystery shopping in 2010.", "While we acknowledge that the QSS reviews represent an important  advancement in IRS\u2019s assessment of the accuracy of return assistance at  volunteer sites, it is important to consider how the data are collected and  how the results will be used. The results of the QSS return reviews could  be biased because of volunteers\u2019 awareness of the presence of IRS  officials. According to IRS officials, since site visits were unannounced,  volunteer staff may have been unaware of IRS\u2019s presence while observing  the first return, but were likely to have noticed IRS\u2019s presence by the  second and third return. As a result, volunteers could be more quality  conscious while preparing the later returns, adhering to the quality  process encouraged by IRS more than they might have been otherwise.  IRS officials stated that they understand the limitations of how the results  were obtained.", "In contrast to a slight increase at volunteer sites, as of April 30, 2009, the  total number of taxpayers\u2019 contacts at IRS\u2019s 401 walk-in sites was 2.7  million, down 12 percent compared to previous year.

For example, FMS\u2019s Direct Express debit cards  allow beneficiaries to receive their benefits as quickly as direct deposit  while avoiding transaction fees associated with receiving check payments.

According to a recent survey  conducted by TIGTA, 63 percent of RAL applicants indicated a preference  for receiving a debit card from IRS instead of purchasing a RAL.

Conversely, if institutions are not providing  information on other eligible items, such as books or equipment, taxpayers  might be understating their claims.", "In addition to confusing taxpayers, the existing Form 1098-T is not very  useful to IRS in its enforcement efforts. According to IRS officials, because  the amount billed may not be the amount taxpayers are eligible to claim as  a credit, IRS does not compare tuition statement information to the  information reported on a tax return. IRS officials stated that a change in  legislation, which TIGTA recommended in a recent report, would be  needed to require institutions to report only the amount paid. However,  IRS does not currently use some of the more basic information from the  tuition statement to verify eligibility for the credit. For example, a tuition  statement includes the student\u2019s SSN that could be matched to tax return  information. Additionally, IRS does not use the location of the institution  to determine whether it is located in a federal disaster area, which  substantially increases the amount of the eligible credit.
