Most persons with developmental disabilities have mental retardation, but others have severe, chronic disability resulting from cerebral palsy, epilepsy, or other life-long conditions, except mental illness, that began before they were 22 years old. The population with developmental disabilities receives more than $13 billion annually in public funding for long-term care, second only to the elderly. More than 300,000 adults with developmental disabilities receive government long-term services financed primarily through Medicaid and to a lesser extent through state and local programs. Long-term care services can include supervision and assistance with everyday activities such as help in dressing, going to the bathroom, managing money, and keeping out of danger. Persons with developmental disabilities have traditionally received their long-term care in institutional settings.", "Recently, states have begun to significantly expand the use of the Medicaid 1915(c) home and community-based waiver, enacted by the Congress in 1981, to provide alternatives to institutional care for persons with developmental disabilities. The waiver program has two advantages. First, it gives states a tool to control costs by allowing them to limit the number of recipients served. In contrast, states must serve all eligible individuals in the regular Medicaid program. Second, it permits states to meet the needs of many persons with developmental disabilities by offering them a broader range of services in less restrictive settings such as group or family home, rather than in a Medicaid intermediate care facility for mental retardation (ICF/MR), the setting where most of the institutional care for this population is provided.", "At your request, we examined states\u2019 experiences in utilizing the flexibility offered by the Medicaid waiver program to provide care for adults with developmental disabilities in alternative settings. To understand changes in services, cost, and quality assurance, we reviewed national data and conducted three case studies on issues and choices states faced in using the waiver program. Specifically, we examined (1) expanded state use of the waiver program, (2) the growth in long-term care costs for individuals with developmental disabilities, (3) how costs are controlled, and (4) strengths and limitations in states\u2019 approaches to assuring quality in community settings.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed the literature, interviewed Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) officials responsible for waiver programs and national experts, and analyzed national data on Medicaid expenditures and recipients. We also performed case studies in three states: Florida, Michigan, and Rhode Island. We chose these states because they have large waiver programs, provide a range in state size and geographic representation, and have different strategies for using the waiver program. In visits to these states, we interviewed program officials, providers, recipients, families, and advocates. We also reviewed data on costs and program participation for these states. We conducted our review between May 1995 and May 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. For a complete description of our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid funds most publicly supported long-term care services for persons with developmental disabilities. In 1995, Medicaid provided more than $13.2 billion to support over 275,000 individuals with these services. To be eligible for Medicaid, individuals must generally meet federal and state income and asset thresholds. To be considered developmentally disabled, individuals must also have a mental or physical impairment, with onset before they are 22 years old, that is likely to continue indefinitely and they must be unable to carry out some everyday activities, such as making basic decisions, communicating, taking transportation, keeping track of money, keeping out of danger, eating, and going to the bathroom, without substantial assistance from others.", "Until recently, states provided the bulk of services for this population through the Medicaid ICF/MR program. The ICF/MR program funds large institutions and smaller settings of 4 to 15 beds, and both sizes of settings are subject to the same regulatory standards. ICF/MR program services are available and provided as needed on a 24-hour basis. These services include medical and nursing services, physical and occupational therapy, psychological services, recreational and social services, and speech and audiology services. ICF/MR program services also include room and board. Providers of ICF/MR program services must adhere to an extensive set of regulations and are subject to annual on-site inspections as mandated by Medicaid.", "In 1981, the Congress enacted the 1915(c) waiver allowing states to apply to HCFA for a waiver of certain Medicaid rules to offer home and community-based services. By 1995, 49 states had 1915(c) home and community-based waiver programs for persons with developmental disabilities. Waiver program services vary by state, but include primarily nonmedical services such as chore services, respite care, and habilitation services, which are all intended to help people live more independently and learn to take care of themselves. (See apps. II and III for a list of waiver program services and definitions in the three states we visited). Unlike ICF/MR program services, waiver program services do not include room and board and are often provided on less than a 24-hour basis.", "HCFA carries out its waiver program oversight responsibilities through review of applications and renewals and monitoring of implementation through on-site compliance reviews. In approving waivers, HCFA reviews applications to ensure that (1) services are offered to individuals who, \u201cbut for the provision of such services . . . would require the level of care provided\u201d in an institutional setting such as an ICF/MR; (2) total Medicaid per capita costs for waiver program recipients are not greater than total Medicaid per capita costs for persons receiving institutional care; and (3) states properly assure quality.", "The waiver program enables states to control utilization and costs in ways not permitted under the regular Medicaid program. The waiver program has a cap for the number of persons served at HCFA-approved levels. It also allows states, with HCFA permission, to target services to distinct geographic areas or populations, such as persons with developmental disabilities or the elderly; offer a broader range of services; and serve persons with incomes somewhat higher than normal eligibility thresholds. In contrast, the regular Medicaid program generally requires that each state provide eligible beneficiaries with all federally mandated services and any optional services it chooses to offer.", "States, however, provide some community-based services to developmentally disabled individuals through the regular Medicaid program. These services include federally mandated services, such as home health care, and other services that states may elect to provide, which are called optional services. Some of the more important optional services for the population with developmental disabilities are rehabilitative services, case management, and personal care.

First, states have significantly expanded the number of individuals being served. Second, states have shifted the program balance from serving most people through the ICF/MR program to serving most through the waiver program. Generally the shift to the waiver program has been part of an evolution of services away from large and more restrictive settings to providing services in small and less restrictive settings, which are preferred by recipients and their families. Some state waiver programs are continuing to evolve from their earlier approach of providing services primarily in group home settings to one of serving people at home."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Serve More People and Shift Balance by Serving More in Waiver Than in ICF/MR Program", "paragraphs": ["From 1990 to 1995 the number of persons served by the waiver and ICF/MR programs combined rose at an average annual rate of 8 percent (see table 1). The number served by the waiver program more than tripled to over 142,000 persons during this period and accounted for the entire increase in the number of persons served by both programs. States dramatically increased the number of people who received waiver program services using a variety of strategies, including substituting waiver program for ICF/MR program services, services provided under state-only programs, and services to persons who were not being served before.", "More people are now served through the waiver program than the ICF/MR program. Although the percentage of persons served through the waiver program varies by state, 30 states provide services to more people through the waiver program than the ICF/MR program (see fig. 1).", "With the support of recipients and their families, state officials have made changes to serve more people through the waiver program. All three groups have come to believe that the alternatives possible through the waiver can better serve persons with developmental disabilities. They believe that in many cases individuals can have a higher quality of life through greater community participation, including relationships with neighbors, activities in social organizations, attendance at public events, and shopping for food and other items. This can result in expanded social networks, enhanced family involvement, more living space and privacy, and improvements in communication, self-care, and other skills of daily living.", "States believed that they could use the waiver program to expand services while simultaneously reducing or limiting access to ICF/MR program care as a means to control growth in expenditures. As a result, many states have closed large institutions or held steady ICF/MR capacity even as the population in need has grown. Some states have also reduced smaller ICF/MR settings by converting them to waiver programs. The number of people in ICF/MR settings has dropped 7 percent from 1990 to 1995. These actions have been part of an overall strategy to change the way services are provided and financed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Flexibility of the Waiver Program Has Allowed States to Pursue Distinct Strategies", "paragraphs": ["States have used the flexibility of the waiver program to pursue distinct strategies and achieve different program results as shown in the three states we visited (see table 2). These states used the waiver program to substitute for ICFs/MR that were being closed, expand the number of persons being served, or both.", "Rhode Island targeted waiver program services as a substitute for ICF/MR program care with little change in the number of persons served. The state began the 1990s with short waiting lists for services and a goal of closing all large institutions of 16 or more beds. Providing waiver program services to many of its former residents, the state closed the Ladd Center, its last large institution, in 1994 to become one of only two states along with the District of Columbia to close all its large institutions. Rhode Island also substantially reduced the number of recipients of services in smaller ICFs/MR by converting the ICFs/MR to the waiver program. As a result, a substantial number of persons who had been supported through the state\u2019s ICF/MR program are now supported by its waiver program. The number of developmentally disabled persons served through the waiver and ICF/MR programs in Rhode Island, however, did not expand significantly.", "In contrast, Florida\u2019s strategy for the waiver program was to expand services to a much broader population rather than using the waiver program to close ICF/MR settings. Florida began the 1990s with substantial waiting lists for services and fewer ICF/MR beds than most of the country relative to the size of the population with developmental disabilities. Florida chose to greatly expand the number of persons with developmental disabilities served to include people who had not been served or who needed more services. The overwhelming source of growth has been from the large increase in waiver program recipients, although Florida has also experienced modest growth in the number of ICF/MR recipients. The state\u2019s increase in waiver program recipients includes persons who were receiving services from state-only programs and persons who were not previously served.", "Michigan used the waiver program in the 1990s to continue pursuing its goals of closing large institutions, offering placements for persons leaving small ICFs/MR, and expanding services to those with unmet needs. Michigan, like Florida, began the 1990s with many persons who needed but had not received services. Michigan, however, had more ICF/MR capacity than Florida. Most of Michigan\u2019s ICF/MR capacity was in smaller settings, many of which had been developed to help the state close some of its large institutions. As a result, Michigan has closed all but about 400 beds in large institutions and significantly increased the number of persons served.

Recently, state officials have come to believe that for many persons, services are best provided on a more individualized basis in a recipient\u2019s home\u2014his or her family\u2019s home or own home or an adult foster care home\u2014rather than in group home settings. The three states we visited became convinced that this was possible even for persons with severe disabilities, in part, because of their success in using this approach in the recently concluded Community Supported Living Arrangements (CSLA) program.", "Slightly more than one-half of all waiver program recipients nationally are estimated to have been living in settings other than group homes in 1995.In each of the three states we visited, many 1915(c) waiver recipients now live in their family\u2019s home or their own home. In Florida, more than one-half of all waiver recipients live in settings other than group homes, including nearly 50 percent who live in their family\u2019s homes. The majority of Michigan\u2019s waiver program recipients live in small settings other than licensed group homes. Just under one-half of Rhode Island\u2019s recipients live in settings other than group homes. Each state expects the percentage of waiver program recipients living in nongroup home settings to increase.", "Officials in the states we visited and other experts told us that serving individuals with developmental disabilities who live in their own or their family\u2019s home and receive less than 24-hour support often requires changes in the service delivery model. For example, these settings may need environmental changes and supports to make them suitable for persons with developmental disabilities. Such changes could include the installation of ramps for persons with physical disabilities or emergency communication technology and other equipment for persons with communication or cognitive impairments or a history of seizures who may need quick assistance. Paid assistance may also be needed to provide a variety of other services, such as supervision of or assistance in toileting, dressing, bathing, carrying out routine chores, managing money, or accessing public transportation and other community services. Assistance for such services is often provided on an individual basis rather than for several persons in a group home. Respite care may also be provided for family caregivers.", "Although the three states we visited have made major commitments to convert their waiver programs to individualized supports at home, these changes will require significant change on the part of everyone involved and could take years to fully implement. For example, some public agencies own or have long-term contracts for the use of group homes or have encouraged the development of private group homes. In addition, state officials told us that public agencies and other service providers may find it difficult to adapt to designing services for each individual living at home rather than offering services in the more familiar group home program setting. In addition, some family members and advocates have expressed concern that the level of funding available for and the range of services offered under the waiver program may not be sufficient for individuals who require constant supervision and care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Costs Rose During Planned Expansion in Persons Served", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, Medicaid costs for long-term care services for persons with developmental disability rose at an average annual rate of 9 percent between 1990 and 1995 as states implemented their planned increases in the number of persons served.

Most of the increase reflected increased costs for waiver program services, but increased ICF/MR program costs also were a factor. Waiver program costs grew primarily because more people were served as per capita waiver costs increased slightly less than inflation. ICF/MR program cost increases resulted solely from growth in per capita ICF/MR program costs, which rose somewhat faster than inflation, as the number of residents declined.

According to state officials, limited resources were stretched to cover as many people as possible by providing each individual with the level of services required to prevent institutionalization rather than providing all the services from which an individual might benefit.", "By contrast, from 1990 to 1994 Rhode Island\u2019s per capita costs under the waiver and ICF/MR programs were much higher than the national average.The large increase in per capita waiver program costs resulted because unlike Florida and Michigan, Rhode Island substituted waiver program services for persons receiving high-cost ICF/MR care and closed its last large institution. As a result, Rhode Island was serving a substantial number of persons through the waiver program who had previously received expensive ICF/MR care. At the same time, ICF/MR per capita costs were also higher, in part, because as the number of people in ICF/MR settings declined, the fixed costs were spread over a smaller population.

HCFA approves each state\u2019s cap, and states are allowed to deny admission for services to otherwise qualified individuals when the cap is reached. By contrast, under the regular Medicaid program, all eligible recipients must be served and no limits exist on the number of recipients. As a result, waiver caps have given states a greater ability to control access and thereby cost growth than would have been possible if they had expanded services through the regular Medicaid program.", "States have also used several management practices to help contain costs.

Upon agency approval, the case manager oversees the implementation of the care plan and monitors it on an ongoing basis.

When paid services are needed, states try to take advantage of services funded for broader populations, such as recreation or socialization in senior citizen centers or the use of public transportation.

HCFA now accepts a state\u2019s assurance that absent the waiver the people served in the waiver program would receive appropriate Medicaid-funded institutional services. As HCFA recognized when it eliminated the cold bed rule, this change could result in higher waiver costs if states elect to increase the number of waiver recipients more rapidly than before. HCFA, however, recognized that the state budget constraints could play a restrictive role in waiver growth.", "State officials told us that elimination of the cold bed rule allows them to expand waiver services more rapidly than in the past, both to persons not currently receiving services and to others receiving services from state-only programs. State officials told us that converting state program recipients to the waiver was particularly advantageous given the federal Medicaid match. Officials in Florida and Michigan told us that they are planning to expand the number of people served in the waiver program more rapidly than they could have under the cold bed rule.

Each state, as required by HCFA guidelines, adopts or develops standards for each waiver service. Waiver standards are specified in state and local laws, regulations, or operating guidelines and are enforced by specific agencies. As a result, waiver standards reflect specific state processes and choices in how states assure quality, and are not uniform across the nation as are ICF/MR standards. (For example, see app. IV for a summary of how Florida meets HCFA requirements for specifying waiver standards.) Waiver standards may include professional licensing standards, minimum training requirements for staff, and criminal background checks for providers. The standards may also include requirements for certification of group home or other facilities and compliance with local building codes and fire and safety requirements.", "States review providers and services on an ongoing basis and have abuse and neglect reporting procedures in place. Florida, Michigan, and Rhode Island, for example, conduct routine and unannounced reviews of providers. As a result of these reviews, providers can be required to provide plans of correction for identified problems and implement improvements. In some cases, providers have lost their certification to participate in the program. These states also have formal grievance procedures and a grievance unit, such as a state agency or human rights committee, to investigate complaints on a statewide, regional, or agency basis. Through these processes, the states have also identified problems in quality and taken steps to ensure corrective action.", "In addition to state quality assurance efforts, HCFA regional staff conduct a compliance review of each state\u2019s waiver program before its renewal. HCFA uses a compliance review document for this process. HCFA reviews involve random selections of recipients for interviews and visits to their homes.

Advocates, family members, and recipients have been generally positive about this shift to support individuals in more integrated community settings.", "Person-centered planning is a key element of providing better quality in waiver services, according to officials in the three states we visited and national experts. The planning process and the resulting plans are individualized to incorporate substantial recipient and family input on how the individual will live and what assistance the individual will need. The case manager, called support coordinator in some states, has primary responsibility in person-centered planning, which includes working with the recipient to develop the plan, arranging for needed services, monitoring service delivery and quality, and revising the plan as necessary. A budget for the individual is established to provide the services identified as appropriate and cost-effective. Recipients and case managers choose providers on the basis of their satisfaction with services. State officials told us that this approach not only gives recipients more say in how they are served but that the resulting competition motivates providers to increase service quality.", "Linking persons living in the community with volunteers who can provide assistance and serve as advocates is seen as another important mechanism for promoting quality. For example, some states, including the three we visited, have a circle of friends or similar process for individual recipients. A circle of friends is a group of volunteers, which can include family, friends, community members, and others, who meet regularly to help persons with disabilities reach their goals. These volunteers help plan how to obtain needed supports; help persons participate in community, work, or leisure activities they choose; and try to help find solutions to problems. By integrating recipients in the community, recipients have more choice and can get better quality services, according to national experts and state officials we interviewed. This community integration increases the number of persons who can observe and identify problems in service quality and notify appropriate officials when there are deficiencies.", "Because program quality depends on the active participation of recipients, families, and service providers, states are also providing substantial training to these groups to encourage and strengthen their participation. Training can include informing recipients and families of available service providers, procedures for providing feedback about services, and steps to take if quality is not improved. Training for service providers may focus on reinforcing the fact that the recipient and family have the right to make choices about services and that staff must be responsive to those choices unless they are inappropriate for safety concerns or for other compelling reasons, such as available financial resources.", "States are also modifying how they monitor quality. Traditionally, they emphasized compliance with certain criteria, such as maintaining a minimum level of staff resources and implementing standard care processes. Some states are focusing their quality monitoring more on outcome measures for each individual while still assessing providers\u2019 compliance with program standards. For example, states, including the three we visited, are trying to determine whether the recipients are living where and with whom they chose, whether they are safe in this environment, and whether they are satisfied with their environment and the services they receive.", "States are also attempting to make their oversight less intrusive for the recipients. For example, some states use trained volunteers to interview recipients at their homes on a periodic basis to check the quality of services received. In other instances, although case managers are required to meet recipients on a regular basis, meetings can be arranged at the recipient\u2019s convenience, including in the evening or on weekends or at a place the recipient likes to meet at, such as at his or her home or local park or library.

To promote quality and ensure that minimum standards are met requires a broad range of approaches.", "Although states continue to develop quality assurance mechanisms, state officials acknowledge that these are not yet comprehensive enough to assure recipient satisfaction and safety. In the three states we visited, state officials and provider agencies told us that they are still developing guidance and oversight in a number of key areas. Michigan, for example, is revising its case management standards and statewide quality assurance approaches. Rhode Island is developing a more systematic monitoring approach statewide, and Florida is continuing to implement and evaluate its independent service coordinator approach.", "One of the greatest difficulties in developing quality mechanisms for services in alternative settings is balancing individual choice and risks.Where greater choice is encouraged and risks are higher, more frequent monitoring and contingency planning need to be built into the process. Yet some professional staff and agency providers in the states we visited believe that they do not have sufficient guidance on where to draw the line between their assessment of what is appropriate for the disabled person and the individual\u2019s choice. For example, some persons with mental retardation cannot speak clearly enough to be understood by people who do not know them; cannot manage household chores, such as cooking in a safe manner; or have no family member to perform overall supervision to keep them from danger. Yet these people express a desire to live independently, without 24-hour staff supervision.", "Florida, Michigan, and Rhode Island each attempt to customize supports to reduce risks for individuals who live in these situations. They may arrange for roommates, encourage frequent visits and telephone contact by neighbors and friends, enroll individuals in supervised day activities, install in-home electronic access to emergency help, and provide paid meal preparation and chore services. As this new process evolves, states and providers seek to develop a better understanding of how to manage risks and reduce them where possible. This should lead to improved guidance for balancing risks and choices for each recipient\u2019s unique circumstances.", "Determining what recipients\u2019 choices are can be difficult for a number of reasons. First, many of these individuals have had little experience in making decisions and may also have difficulty in communicating. In addition, some recipients have complained that they are not being provided the range of choices to which they should have access and that quality monitoring is too frequent or intrusive despite the changes states have introduced. However, concern has been expressed that quality assurance is not rigorous enough to reduce all health or safety risks and that the range of choices is too great for some individuals.", "State officials and other experts we interviewed have emphasized the need for vigilance to protect recipients and ensure their rights.

National experts interviewed included officials at HCFA; the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the Department of Health and Human Services; the Administration on Developmental Disabilities; the President\u2019s Committee on Mental Retardation; the National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils; the Administration on Aging; the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services, Inc.

We also interviewed researchers at University Affiliated Programs (UAP) on developmental disabilities at the Universities of Illinois and Minnesota and Wayne State University.", "We conducted our case studies in Florida, Michigan, and Rhode Island. We chose these states for several reasons. The three states provide a range of state size and geographic representation. Each state has a substantial developmental disability waiver program that serves more people than its ICF/MR program. Experts told us that these states would provide examples of different state strategies for utilizing the Medicaid waiver. This included their policies regarding large and small institutions as well as the design and implementation of their waiver programs. The three states also have important differences in the administrative structure of their developmental disability programs. Rhode Island administers its waiver program statewide through the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals. Florida places statewide administration and oversight responsibility for its waiver program in Developmental Services, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, but operational responsibility rests with its 15 district offices of Developmental Services. Michigan places statewide administration and oversight responsibility for its waiver programs in the state Department of Mental Health, but operating responsibilities rest with 52 Community Mental Health Boards (CMHB), which are local government entities covering one or more counties and three state-operated agencies each responsible for serving a local area. Florida district offices and Michigan CMHBs have discretion in the design and implementation of waiver program and other services within the broad outlines of state policy.", "We visited each state to conduct interviews with state and local officials, researchers, service providers, advocates, families, and recipients. These interviews included state Medicaid officials and developmental services officials and officials in agencies on aging and developmental disability councils. In Florida, we also visited state district offices in Pensacola and Tallahassee to conduct interviews with district government and nongovernment representatives. In Michigan, we visited the Detroit-Wayne and Midland/Gladwin CMHBs to conduct interviews with government and nongovernment representatives. We followed up with state agencies to collect additional information.", "The national waiver and ICF/MR program expenditure and recipient data used in this report are from the UAP on developmental disabilities at the Research and Training Center on Community Living, Institute on Community Integration, at the University of Minnesota. The Institute collects these data, with the exception of ICF/MR expenditures, directly from state agencies. The Institute uses ICF/MR expenditure data, compiled by the Medstat Group under contract to HCFA. National data from the Institute were available through 1995. The expenditure and recipient data we report for Florida, Michigan, and Rhode Island were provided to us by the state agencies responsible for developmental services and the Medicaid agencies. The latest complete data available from these three states were for 1994. We therefore used 1994 national data for comparison purposes.", "Some differences occur in the recipient counts among the national data we used from the Institute and data we collected from agencies in Florida, Michigan, and Rhode Island. These differences could affect some aspects of our comparisons of national trends and trends in the three states. Institute data on recipients show the total number of persons receiving services on a given date\u2014June 30 of each year\u2014whereas data for the three states show the cumulative number of persons receiving services over a 12-month period. Therefore, data supplied by the states could result in a larger count of program recipients than the methodology used by the Institute. This could have the impact of making per capita expenditure calculations smaller for the state data than for the national data. Our comparisons of data from the two sources, however, showed few substantial differences in the data for the three states.", "We excluded children from our analysis because (1) their needs are different in many respects from those of adults, (2) family responsibilities for the care of children are more comprehensive than for adults, and (3) the educational system has the lead public responsibility for services for children. Recipient and expenditure data in this report, however, include some children because it was not possible to systematically exclude them. However, the percentage of children in these services is small.
