For all three reports, GAO reviewed relevant requirements and visited a total of 14 VA facilities.

Through this program, care is provided to veterans by non-VA providers in non-VA facilities. As GAO reported in May 2013, VA did not collect data on wait times veterans face in obtaining care from non-VA providers. Having data on wait times for veterans referred to non-VA providers would help VA better determine if veterans are receiving comparable access to non-VA providers and VA-based providers. In addition, GAO found that VA was unable to analyze non-VA medical care data on all services and charges for an episode of care, which is the combined total of all care provided to a veteran during a single office visit or inpatient stay. As a result, VA cannot ensure that non-VA providers are billing VA appropriately for care or determine whether delivering care through non-VA providers is more cost-effective than augmenting its own capacity in areas of high utilization of non-VA medical care. Moreover, in March 2014 GAO reported that crucial limitations existed in VA's monitoring and oversight of non-VA medical care claims processing. Specifically, VA lacked automated processes for (1) determining whether claims met VA's criteria for payment and (2) notifying veterans when their claims were denied. Instead, these processes relied largely on the judgment and diligence of VA facility-based claims processing staff. For example, GAO found several non-VA medical care claims that were inappropriately denied because VA facility-based claims processing staff processed the claims under the wrong payment authority. Moreover, GAO found that VA's oversight was lacking in key aspects of the claims review process, a factor that allowed inappropriate denials and notification issues to persist.", "GAO's recent work has also found significant limitations in VA's monitoring and oversight of clinical contracts and contractors\u2014a method VA uses to bring non-VA providers into VA facilities. As GAO reported in October 2013, contracting officer's representatives' (COR) heavy workloads and inadequate training compromised VA's monitoring of contractor performance. CORs are responsible for monitoring the work of non-VA providers working in VA facilities under a contract once the contract is in place. CORs for 8 of the 12 contracts GAO reviewed in depth reported that the demands of their primary positions at the VA facility have at times prevented them from fully monitoring contract providers' performance. Six of these CORs stated that they could not complete certain elements of their COR responsibilities\u2014such as adequately monitoring contract costs\u2014due to limited time and resources. Robust VA oversight would better ensure that the contract providers deliver high quality care to veterans and fulfill the responsibilities of their contracts. In addition, CORs from the four VA facilities GAO visited noted weaknesses in VA's COR training and GAO's analysis confirmed these limitations. Specifically, GAO found this training focused on teaching CORs to develop contracts that purchase goods and not clinical services. The primary examples in this course included discussions of the contracting process for replacing carpet and making a large computer purchase. In addition, COR training included little information on how CORs should engage in post-award monitoring of clinical contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made 22 recommendations to VA in its prior three reports related to improving (1) data on wait times and cost-effectiveness of non-VA medical care; (2) VA's oversight and monitoring of claims processing; and (3) VA's monitoring of clinical contractors. VA agreed with these recommendations, and has taken action on some, but has yet to fully implement many of them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the Department of  Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) delivery of care through both its Non-VA Medical  Care Program and clinical contracts. The majority of veterans enrolled in  the VA health care system receive care in VA-operated medical facilities,  such as VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics.  However, in order to meet the needs of the veterans it serves, VA is  authorized to obtain health care services from non-VA providers through  both the Non-VA Medical Care Program and clinical contracts. These  two mechanisms for accessing non-VA providers help to augment VA\u2019s  delivery of services to veterans in different ways. The Non-VA Medical  Care Program allows VA to deliver care to veterans in non-VA facilities,  such as physicians\u2019 offices and hospitals in the community, and pay for  this care using a fee-for-service arrangement. Clinical contracts are used  by VA to bring non-VA providers\u2014such as physicians, pharmacists, and  nurses\u2014into VA facilities to provide services to veterans. These contracts  can be used to fill vacancies for clinicians in specialties that are difficult to  recruit, supplement existing VA capacity by providing additional clinicians  in high-volume areas, or fill critical staffing vacancies on a long- or short- term basis. According to VA, every VA facility has at least one clinical  contract in place to help supplement the number of providers working in  VA medical facilities.", "VA\u2019s spending on the Non-VA Medical Care Program and the number of  veterans receiving care from non-VA providers have both risen  significantly in recent years. From fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2013, VA  spending on non-VA medical care rose from about $3 billion to about   $4.8 billion. Since 2013, VA has added two new components to its Non- VA Medical Care Program\u2014the Choice Program and Patient-Centered  Community Care (PC3). With the addition of these new components, it is  anticipated that the number of veterans seeking care through the Non-VA  Medical Care Program will continue to grow. As such, it is increasingly  important for VA to incorporate robust oversight and accountability into  the administration of the program to address inefficiencies in non-VA  medical care delivery highlighted in recent reports by GAO and others.", "VA\u2019s oversight of clinical contracts used throughout the VA health care  system has also been shown to be limited. Previous studies highlighted  challenges VA has faced developing and administering its clinical  contracts. In recent years, for example, the VA Office of the Inspector  General highlighted challenges VA faces in developing its clinical  contracts and found systemic weaknesses in the process VA uses to  award contracts. These weaknesses were attributed to VA\u2019s decentralized oversight of the initial stages of the contracting process  before a contract is awarded to a contractor. In an October 2013 report,  we found that VA\u2019s oversight of clinical contractors is inadequate once a  contract is awarded and contract providers begin caring for veterans in  VA facilities.", "Today, I will summarize the results of recent GAO work examining  weaknesses in the oversight of VA\u2019s Non-VA Medical Care Program and  clinical contracts.

We  also interviewed VA officials and examined the non-VA medical care  operations at six selected VA facilities that varied in size, services offered,  and geographic location.

Preauthorized care accounts for the majority of spending and utilization  (about 60 percent of spending and about 88 percent of utilization) for the  Non-VA Medical Care Program. The second, emergency care, is not  typically approved in advance by VA facility officials and has certain  criteria that must be met in order for VA to approve reimbursement for the  non-VA provider. (See table 1.)", "Preauthorizing non-VA medical care involves a multistep process  conducted by the VA facility that regularly serves a veteran. The  preauthorization process is initiated by a VA provider who submits a  request for non-VA medical care to the VA facility\u2019s non-VA medical care  unit, which is an administrative department within each VA facility that  processes VA providers\u2019 non-VA medical care requests and verifies that  non-VA medical care is necessary. Once approved by the VA facility\u2019s  Chief of Staff or his or her designee, the veteran is notified of the approval  and can choose any non-VA provider willing to accept VA payment at  predetermined rates.

Common tasks of a CO include  developing acquisition planning documents used to begin a clinical  contract, conducting market research to determine pricing and availability  for a clinical contract, and completing the formal competitive or non- competitive solicitation process for contracts.

We previously found that the amount of time veterans  wait for appointments in VA facilities influenced VA\u2019s utilization of non-VA  medical care. For example, in our May 2013 report, VA officials from all  six facilities we reviewed reported that they routinely referred veterans to  non-VA providers to help ensure that veterans receive timely care and  their facilities meet performance goals for wait times for VA facility-based  care. Officials from one of these VA facilities explained that veterans  needing treatment in several specialties\u2014including audiology, cardiology,  and ophthalmology\u2014were referred to non-VA providers for this reason.", "In fiscal year 2012, VA performance goals for wait times for care in VA  facilities called for veterans\u2019 primary care appointments to be completed  within 7 days of their desired appointment date and veterans\u2019 specialty  care appointments to be scheduled within 14 days of their desired  appointment date. However, since VA did not track wait times for non-VA  providers, we found that little was known about how often veterans\u2019 wait  times for non-VA medical care appointments exceeded VA facility-based  appointment wait time goals. Officials from one VA facility we reviewed  explained that non-VA providers in their community also faced capacity  limitations and may not be able to schedule appointments for veterans  any sooner than the VA facility.", "We recommended in May 2013 that VA analyze the amount of time  veterans wait to see non-VA providers and apply the same wait time  goals to non-VA medical care that have been used to assess VA facility- based wait times.

In February  2015, VA reported that this monthly indicator had been developed and  rolled out as a part of the Non-VA medical care coordination initiative.  This monthly indicator tracks the number of veterans whose appointments  with a non-VA provider are scheduled within 90 days\u2014including  generating the veterans\u2019 authorization to receive the care, scheduling the  appointment with the non-VA provider, and receiving the veterans\u2019  medical records from the non-VA provider after the appointment is held.

However, VA\u2019s non-VA medical care data system was not able to link the  charges for these three treatments together.

Similarly,  officials from the second facility reported that they were able to reduce  their reliance on non-VA medical care by hiring additional VA staff and  purchasing additional equipment to perform pulmonary function tests, an  effort that reduced related non-VA medical care costs by about $112,000  between fiscal years 2010 and 2012. We also found that the lack of non- VA medical care data available on an episode of care basis prevents VA  from efficiently assessing the appropriateness of non-VA provider  reimbursement.

We found that there were a  number of steps in the claims review process that were susceptible to  errors that could lead to inappropriate denials of non-VA medical care  claims. For example, we found nine instances where a veteran\u2019s claim  was denied under VA\u2019s emergency care authority for non-service  connected conditions, but should have been paid under VA\u2019s  preauthorized non-VA medical care authority because a VA clinician had   Instead these processes rely largely on the judgment  referred the veteran to the non-VA provider.

However, as we  reported in March 2014, we found that one VA facility we visited could not  produce documentation of veteran notification for any of the 30 denied  claims we reviewed. We concluded that when veterans are not informed  that their claims for non-VA medical care have been denied and VA has  inappropriately denied the claims, veterans could become financially  liable for care that VA should have covered. Under such circumstances,  veterans\u2019 credit ratings may be negatively affected and they may face  personal financial hardships if they are unable to pay the bills they receive  from non-VA providers. Taken together, the absence of systematic  processes for completing these actions significantly reduces the  assurance VA Central Office has that VA facility-based claims processing  staff can consistently make accurate determinations about whether or not  to pay non-VA medical care claims and notify veterans of their appeal  rights in the case of denials.", "In March 2014, we made six recommendations aimed at improving VA\u2019s  processing of non-VA medical care claims, specifically emergency care  claims for conditions not related to veterans\u2019 service-connected  disabilities.

VA concurred with these six  recommendations. Based on updates we have received on VA\u2019s  implementation of these recommendations, we believe VA has fully  implemented two of the six recommendations related to properly dating  incoming claims and verifying that claims are submitted to the correct VA  facility. However, we believe that for the remaining four of these  recommendations, additional steps are needed to revise VA policies on  claims processing roles and responsibilities. These unimplemented  recommendations are related to VA\u2019s non-VA medical care policies and  procedures for processing claims and notifying veterans when claims are  denied.", "One of VA\u2019s primary methods for monitoring its facilities\u2019 compliance with  non-VA medical care claims processing requirements is field assistance  visits. As we reported in March 2014, we found a number of limitations in  their use as an oversight mechanism. First, we found that VA\u2019s criteria for  selecting facilities for field assistance visits may not direct VA to those  facilities most in need of this oversight because VA does not take into  account the accuracy of claims processing activity when selecting  facilities for review. Instead, we found that VA selected the 30 VA facilities  that received a field assistance visit in fiscal year 2013 based on their  claims processing timeliness. With a limited focus on the timeliness of  claims processing and without attention to the accuracy of claims  decisions, we concluded that VA Central Office does not have the  opportunity to assist VA facilities in making accurate decisions that may  impact veterans financial well-being. Second, we found that the checklist  VA uses for its field assistance visits does not examine all practices that  could lead VA facilities to inappropriately deny claims. For example, VA\u2019s  checklist does not examine VA facilities\u2019 practices for determining  whether veterans are enrolled at a different VA facility and whether they  have been seen by providers at another VA facility in the last 24  months\u2014a critical criterion for determining whether veterans are eligible  for emergency care coverage for non-service connected conditions.  Finally, we found that VA does not hold facilities accountable for  correcting deficiencies identified during these visits, and it does not  validate facilities\u2019 self-reported corrections to deficiencies identified during  these visits. Specifically, in our review of fiscal year 2012 and 2013 field  assistance visit data, we found that some VA facilities had unresolved  problems in their fiscal year 2013 field assistance visit that had originated  and were identified during their fiscal year 2012 field assistance visit.", "In March 2014, we made two recommendations aimed at revising the  scope of field assistance visits and ensuring that deficiencies identified  during these visits are corrected. VA concurred with both of these  recommendations. VA has made some progress in implementing these  recommendations as of May 2015 by expanding the topics covered  during field assistance visits and updating their standard operating  procedures. However, we believe that VA needs to undertake additional  actions to sufficiently address them. Specifically, VA needs to ensure field  assistance visits include a review of a sample of processed claims in  order to determine whether staff are complying with claims processing  requirements.", "Our recent work has also found that VA has no systematic process for  auditing claims to ensure that they were appropriately approved or  denied. VA officials stated that they recommend, but do not require, that  managers of VA facility-based non-VA medical care claims processing  units audit samples of processed claims\u2014including both approved and  denied claims\u2014to determine whether staff processed claims  appropriately. However, in March 2014 we found that VA did not know  how many VA facilities conducted such audits and none of the four VA  facilities we visited reported conducting them.", "Therefore, in March 2014, we recommended that VA institute systematic  audits of the appropriateness of claims processing decisions. VA  concurred with this recommendation and has made some progress  implementing it as of May 2015 by instituting audits of some paid claims.  However, we believe that to fully implement this recommendation, VA  needs to undertake additional action.

Specifically, VA\u2019s standard operating  procedure for CORs requires VA facilities to provide CORs with the time  and resources necessary to complete required training and fulfill their  duties as a COR. In addition, to monitor clinical contracts effectively,  CORs are required to perform a number of key functions\u2014including  completing quarterly reports on contract progress, quality assurance, and  invoice audits. However, we found that VA\u2019s guidance related to COR  responsibilities did not include any information on how VA facilities are to  determine the feasibility of whether a COR\u2019s workload\u2014including both  COR and primary position responsibilities\u2014will allow them to carry out  their tasks as CORs for monitoring contract provider performance. The  COR standard operating procedure also did not provide any guidance for  determining when COR duties should be assigned as a collateral duty or  a full-time responsibility. We concluded that without clear guidance on  how to determine a COR\u2019s workload, VA facilities can unintentionally  assign COR duties to a staff member who does not have the time  available to properly monitor clinical contractors. If CORs\u2019 workloads  prevent proper monitoring of clinical contracts, VA risks missing the  opportunity to proactively identify and correct performance issues with  contract providers and to recognize patient safety concerns potentially  resulting from contract providers\u2019 actions. By failing to identify  performance concerns with contract providers, VA could unknowingly be  receiving sub-standard service from these contractors, continue to  receive services from these contract providers that do not meet the needs  of the VA facilities, and risk patient safety problems when these contracts  are extended for additional years.", "In October 2013, we recommended that VA revise its standard operating  procedures for CORs to provide guidance on the number of contracts,  based on size and complexity, each COR should manage to ensure that  all CORs maintain a workload that allows them to fulfill their duties as a  COR and their primary position responsibilities. VA concurred with this  recommendation and detailed plans to revise existing COR standard  operating procedures to include guidance on the number of contracts,  based on size and complexity, that each COR should manage to ensure  that all CORs maintain a workload that allows them to fulfill their duties as  a COR and their primary position responsibilities. However, in April 2015,  VA Central Office officials informed us that the Department no longer  plans to revise these standard operating procedures in this manner, and  plans instead to place language in the COR nomination letter that states  that the COR and their supervisor discussed their workload and  determined they could effectively serve as the COR for the contract. We  believe that to fully implement our recommendation, VA needs to provide  guidance to CORs and their supervisors through a revision to the COR  standard operating procedures that provides guidance on the number and  type of contracts each COR should manage to ensure that VA facilities  and CORs can better make these determinations.", "Relating to training, CORs from the four VA facilities we visited noted  weaknesses in VA\u2019s COR training courses and our own analysis of these  courses confirmed these limitations. Specifically, over half of the 40  CORs from the four VA facilities we visited for our October 2013 review  responded that either their COR training did not prepare them for their  role as a COR or were neutral on whether or not this training was helpful  preparation. In addition, CORs for 8 of the 12 contracts we reviewed in  depth did not find the required COR training helpful or applicable to VA  clinical contracting. For example, one COR stated that the training  covered very broad areas of contracts and did not include specific  information on which kinds of contracts need detailed quality assurance  plans or information on how to manage a clinical contract rather than a  supply contract. In addition, a few CORs stated that the instructors for  their training courses had limited knowledge of clinical contracting.", "We also reviewed the content of VA\u2019s 32-hour COR training course  administered by the VA Acquisition Academy and found that this course  had several limitations in preparing CORs to manage clinical contracts in  VA facilities, including the following:", "Focused on contracts that buy goods, not services. The primary  examples used in the course did not include a discussion of clinical  contracts at VA and instead walked students through the contracting  process using examples such as replacing carpet and making a large  computer equipment purchase. There were no examples focused on  how to evaluate or measure the quality of services provided by a  contract provider in a VA facility\u2019s clinical setting.", "Included little information on monitoring responsibilities. The  course content included limited information for CORs on post-award  monitoring responsibilities for clinical contracts and instead was  heavily weighted to discussing the pre-award development of a  contract.", "To supplement this required course, VA\u2019s Medical Sharing Office in June  2013 developed and implemented an 8-hour training course for CORs  managing clinical contracts. However, VA did not require this course be  completed by all CORs managing clinical contracts.covered primarily pre-award contract development responsibilities of  CORs and did not include any significant information on the post-award  monitoring responsibilities of CORs managing clinical contracts.", "In October 2013, we recommended that VA modify its COR training to  ensure it includes examples and discussion of how to develop and  monitor service contracts\u2014including contracts for the provision of clinical  care in VA facilities. VA concurred with this recommendation. In August  2014, VA provided us with a copy of its revised training modules for  CORs and notified us the Department intends to require this training for  all CORs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Oversight of VA Facility Clinical Contract Monitoring Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Our recent work has also found that VA has not established a robust  method for overseeing the monitoring of clinical contractors by COs and  CORs throughout its health care system. Our October 2013 report found  that VA\u2019s primary oversight entity for health care contracting activities, the  VHA Procurement and Logistics Office, has a limited role in overseeing  the monitoring actions of COs and CORs once a contract has been  approved and initiated at a VA facility. The VHA Procurement and  Logistics Office conducts limited oversight of contracting activities  throughout the VA health care system through its SAOs and Procurement  Operations Office.", "Service Area Offices. According to officials from the three SAOs we  interviewed for our October 2013 report, the role of the three SAOs in  clinical contract monitoring is limited to an audit of the records COs  maintain in VA\u2019s electronic Contract Management System. These  reviews focus only on the completeness of COs\u2019 electronic contracting  files\u2014including documentation that a COR with current training  records was assigned to the contract. SAO electronic Contract  Management System audits did not include any reviews of CORs\u2019  monitoring of clinical contractors.", "Procurement Operations Office. The VHA Procurement and  Logistics Office\u2019s Procurement Operations Office is the only entity  responsible for overseeing the monitoring activities of CORs;  however, the reviews conducted by this office were limited to a remote  electronic documentation review of a small sample of COR files.  Prior to the release of our October 2013 report, officials from the  Procurement Operations Office told us that to select COR files for  these reviews, a Procurement Operations Office staff member aims to  select 25 COR files for active contracts per network contracting  office\u2014about 2.1 percent of clinical contracts in an average VISN if all  25 selected COR files are for clinical contracts. VA officials told us  that, while the Procurement Operations Office sets a goal to review  COR files from two network contracting offices each month, since  implementing the program in March 2013 these reviews had been  completed in only four network contracting offices and none of these  four offices had received feedback on the outcomes of these reviews  as of August 2013. These reviews also had a narrow focus on the  completeness of COR files because the Procurement Operations  Office staff member reviewing the files relies on a checklist to verify  the presence or absence of required documentation of COR  monitoring activities and does not review the quality of information  contained within a COR\u2019s records.", "We concluded that the limited review schedule and narrow focus on file  completeness did not allow the Procurement Operations Office to  comprehensively assess the monitoring activities of COs and CORs  throughout VA\u2019s health care system. Without a robust monitoring system  in place, VA cannot be reasonably assured that all CORs in all VA  facilities are monitoring clinical contractors and maintaining the proper  records of their efforts to monitor the activities of clinical contractors  caring for veterans.", "We recommended in October 2013 that VA increase its oversight of COs  and CORs by ensuring that post-award contracting files are regularly  reviewed for all network contracting offices. VA concurred with this  recommendation and noted that the Department would revise COR  standard operating procedures to ensure that regular reviews of post- award contract files from all network contracting offices are conducted.  While VA has made progress in implementing this recommendation by  completing 45 more reviews of COR files in fiscal year 2014 than in fiscal  year 2013, these reviews were still only conducted in 5 of the 21 network  contracting offices. We believe that to fully implement this  recommendation VA needs to ensure that a sample of COR files are  reviewed from all network contracting offices.", "Chairman Coffman, Ranking Member Kuster, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
