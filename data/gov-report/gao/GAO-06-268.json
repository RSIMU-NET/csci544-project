During this time, after Education introduced some new management controls to its competitive grants procedures, we found it generally adhered to these new policies. For example, GAO did not find evidence that Education reduced any applicant's request without first conducting a budget analysis, as required, or that Education rescored applications after they had been peer reviewed. However, certain procedures were not always followed; for example, Education frequently did not finalize its plans for conducting competitions before starting the competitions--a step that would help ensure transparency in making awards. In addition, many files lacked documentation that the department screened the applicants, as required, to identify incompetent applicants, ineligible grantees, or unallowable expenditures. Since 2003, Education has also taken steps to reform its process for awarding grants based on unsolicited proposals, but it based its screening decisions on proposals that vary greatly and frequently provided extensive technical assistance. Following a departmental reorganization, Education established a centralized process for reviewing unsolicited proposals. However, these proposals, which Education used as a basis to certify that there is a substantial likelihood that the application will meet regulatory requirements, varied greatly in content and detail. GAO also found that Education provided extensive technical assistance to applicants, in some instances, providing applicants with the notes of peer reviewers and allowing applicants to revise and resubmit applications. Specifically, in 2004, 10 of the 27 applicants did not get reviewers' support and were provided a chance to re-apply. Of those 10 applicants, 8 revised their proposals, received favorable recommendations, and were subsequently funded. Prior to 2003, Education made exceptions to some of its policies in awarding three grants, totaling about $12.3 million, where particular allegations were raised. Two of the grants were awarded through a competitive process, but GAO found that Education reduced funding to all of the grantees to expand the number of grantees funded and to accommodate awards to lower rated grantees. In doing so, Education altered its selection methodology after it developed and recommended a list of grantees. In one case, Education rescored and reversed the order of selected grantees after the peer reviewers had completed their assessments. Education awarded the third grant based on an unsolicited proposal and regulations require that the department seek recommendations from peer reviewers prior to funding. In this case, the peer reviewers could not agree on a recommendation. GAO found that Education lacked a process to reconcile disagreements among reviewers and awarded a grant that two of three reviewers did not recommend. Moreover, Education awarded four grants in 2001 for unsolicited proposals that had not been recommended for funding by any one of the three reviewers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, the Department of Education (Education) provided  more than $42 billion in grants to state and local education agencies,  school districts, colleges and universities, and other organizations to  conduct various program and research activities. While Congress directs  the allocation of most of these funds, a small portion of this money\u2014$4.7  billion in 2005\u2014is awarded by the Secretary either through program  competitions or through consideration of unsolicited proposals. In the  case of competitions, selection of awardees is governed by regulations and  policies designed to ensure that federal funds are directed to those  proposals of highest merit. In the case of proposals that are unsolicited,  awards are to be made to grantees that are recommended for funding by  external reviewers based on proposals they deem to be of high quality and  national significance.", "Allegations were made that Education did not follow its policies in making  the grant awards that benefited specific grantees. You asked us to review  two grant awards\u2014a competitive grant awarded in 2002 from the  Voluntary Public School Choice program to the Arkansas Department of  Education to fund its partnership with K12, Inc., and a 2001 award based  on an unsolicited proposal to the National Council on Teacher Quality  (NCTQ). In the course of our review, program officials directed us to  another competitive grant where they noted similar concerns as those  raised in your letter. This third grant was awarded from the Credit  Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Grant program to America\u2019s  Charter School Finance Corporation. The grants in question were awarded  in 2001 and 2002 and Education has subsequently issued new guidance for  making grant awards and has moved the grant programs in question to the  newly created Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII). We assessed  Education\u2019s policies and procedures for both competitive awards and  unsolicited proposals in 2003 and 2004 and determined whether Education  followed them in awarding grants in those years and we reviewed  Education\u2019s grant award decisions for several 2001 and 2002 grants to  determine whether the department followed its own policies.", "To assess the policies and procedures in place for the 2003 and 2004  competitive awards processes, we reviewed departmental guidance issued  in March 2003 that governed the grants awarded in those years. We  reviewed a stratified random sample of 91 of the 521 competitive grants  made by OII in 2003 and 2004, including all 10 grants with over $15 million  in obligations. All percentage estimates from this sample have margins of  error of plus or minus 10 percent or less. To assess Education\u2019s process  for reviewing unsolicited proposals in 2003 and 2004, we reviewed  departmental guidance and all 65 files for unsolicited grants awarded by  OII in 2003 and 2004. We used the department\u2019s Grant Administration and  Payment System (GAPS) to identify all grants awarded in 2003 and 2004.  We assessed the reliability of the data in GAPS and found it to be reliable  for our purposes.  To review Education\u2019s decisions to award the 2001 and  2002 grants, we obtained and reviewed departmental grant-making  guidance in place at the time these grants were awarded. To determine  whether or not departmental guidance was followed, we reviewed the  official grant files for each of these grants, the corresponding files for the  competitions that contain information on all of the applicants\u2019 proposals,  the competition plans, and external reviewers\u2019 rankings and comments. In  2002, 34 applicants competed for grants from the Credit Enhancement for  Charter School Facilities Grant program and Education awarded five  grants, including the grant in question. That year, the department also  considered 21 unsolicited proposals and made awards to 18 grantees,  including the grantee in question. In 2002, 46 applicants participated in the  Voluntary Public School Choice grant competition and the department  awarded 13 grants, including the grant in question.

Education begins the competition process by publishing  a notice in the Federal Register. This announcement serves as a notice  that federal funds are available through a specific program and invites  interested parties to prepare an application for funding. The notice  provides information on the estimated number of awards that will be made  and the estimated size of each award. Importantly, the notice establishes  the rules by which the competition will be conducted; among other things,  this notice provides information on the eligibility criteria, the issues  Education expects the applicants to address in their applications, and the  evaluation criteria for the competition. The notice serves as a blueprint for  applicants to use in developing a successful application.", "In addition, program officials must develop a plan for how they will  administer the competition. The competition plan, known as an  Application Technical Review Plan (ATRP), is a key management control  that helps promote fairness and transparency in the process. The  competition plan includes such information as the schedule for the  competition, the process for identifying and using external peer reviewers,  the composition of the peer reviewer panels, a description of how the  applications will be assigned to these panels, the process for resolving  peer reviewers\u2019 conflicts of interest, and the methodology for selecting  applications for funding. Any deviation from the original plan for  reviewing the applications, selecting applicants, and approving the list of  prospective grantees must be justified in writing, which is designed to  enhance transparency.", "Another key control for ensuring fairness in the award process for grants  is the peer review process. Peer reviewers are typically external experts  who bring an independent assessment of the merits of the applications.  The number of individuals selected to serve as peer reviewers depends on  the number of applications received for a specific competition. These peer  reviewers are usually grouped together in panels of three or more  members to review applications. Each peer reviewer independently reads  and scores a group of applications randomly assigned to the panel,  generally using a numerical scoring system, against program criteria based  on legislative and regulatory requirements. Program officials prepare a  single score for each application\u2014usually by averaging the scores of all  the peer reviewers on the panel that reviewed the application or, less  frequently, using a statistical technique to equalize unusual scoring  variances among reviewers. Program officials then prepare a rank-ordered  list of applications based on the single scores and use this list to prepare  their funding recommendations.", "Education\u2019s regulations stipulate that the rank-order list is one of many  factors the Secretary may use in selecting new grants. The Secretary may  also use information from the application as well as information  concerning the applicants\u2019 performance and use of funds under a previous  award. Ultimately, the peer reviewers\u2019 comments are advisory, and the  Secretary can determine which new grants to fund based on the program  criteria outlined in the statute and the Federal Register notice.", "In addition to developing the ATRP, Education\u2019s policy requires program  officials to screen the applicants for eligibility, typically before  applications are peer reviewed. Before making an award, program officials  must conduct checks to ensure the applicants\u2019 competence to manage  federal funds. A budget analysis is also required to be conducted to ensure  that no grant funds are awarded for unallowable purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Making Awards Based on Unsolicited Proposals", "paragraphs": ["Education\u2019s policy is to award the vast majority of discretionary grant  funds through the competitive process, however it may also fund grants  based on unsolicited proposals. Although Education can fund unsolicited  proposals from any program, the primary source for funding such  proposals is the Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE). This  program was created in 1988 as the Secretary\u2019s Fund for Innovation in  Education. At the time, it provided the Secretary with the authority to  fund proposals that showed promise of identifying and disseminating  innovative educational approaches. The program has been reauthorized  over the years, most recently in 2002 with enactment of the No Child Left  Behind Act and maintains flexibility by providing the Secretary with the  authority to fund \u201cmeritorious\u201d programs to improve the quality of  elementary and secondary education at the state and local levels and help  all children meet challenging state academic content and student  academic achievement standards. The FIE program is also used to fund  congressional earmarks for elementary and secondary education activities.", "The statute does not require Education to compare the relative merits of  all the proposals it receives in any given year; however, it does require that  the Secretary use a peer review process for reviewing applications.  Appropriations for the FIE program remained relatively steady until 1998.  Since 1998 appropriations increased dramatically. (See fig. 2).", "Before funding unsolicited proposals, Education must also make sure that  the regulatory requirements for funding such proposals are met. Education  must first determine whether the unsolicited proposal could be funded  under a competitive grant program; if it could be funded under a  competition, the Secretary refers the proposal to the appropriate  competition. If an appropriate competition does not exist, departmental  regulations require the Secretary to decide if (1) there is a substantial  likelihood that the application is of exceptional quality and national  significance, (2) the application satisfies the requirements of all applicable  statutes and codified regulations that apply to the program, and   (3) selection of the project would not have an adverse impact on the funds  available for other awards planned for the program. If these criteria are  met, Education assembles a panel of experts to evaluate the unsolicited  proposal based on the selection criteria. If the experts highly rate the  application and determine that the application is of such exceptional  quality and national significance that it should be funded as an unsolicited  application, then the Secretary may fund the application."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "In 2001 and 2002, Education Made Exceptions to Its Policies in Awarding the Three Grants", "paragraphs": ["Education made progress since 2003 in improving its policies for awarding  discretionary grants; however, prior to these improvements we found that  Education made exceptions to its policies that benefited the grantees in  question.

The program official responsible for the  competition received assurances from all of the grantees that they could  still achieve the goals of their proposals with decreased funds, and  according to this official, all of the grantees submitted revised budgets  reflecting reduced award amounts.

Specifically, to improve the process for selecting and  awarding grants based on unsolicited proposals, we are recommending  that the Secretary    develop a more systematic format to select unsolicited proposals for  further consideration by peer reviewers.", "In addition, to ensure fairness and improve transparency in the  competitive grants process, we recommend that the Secretary take the  following steps:    Ensure that all competition plans are finalized before competitions  begin and if a plan needs to be amended during a competition, the  Secretary should provide assurances that any such amendment is  justified in writing and has been approved by a senior department  official.  Implement departmental policy to screen all applicants for compliance  with audit requirements before the award, and ensure that outstanding  audit issues\u2014if there are any\u2014are addressed before making an award.", "Take appropriate steps to ensure that program officers better  document required checks such as budget analyses and eligibility  screening."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Education provided us with comments on a draft of this report; these  comments appear in appendix III. Education also provided technical  comments that we incorporated as appropriate. Education agreed with   3 of our recommendations for improving the transparency of its  competitive review process and said it has already taken steps to improve  its guidance and training. Specifically, it agreed to (1) finalize competition  plans before the competitions begin and obtain approvals from senior  department officials for any amendments to the plans, (2) ensure that  program officers better document their analyses of applicants\u2019 budgets  and eligibility, and (3) implement departmental policy to screen all  applicants for compliance with audit requirements before awarding any  new grants.", "Education disagreed with our recommendation that it develop a more  systematic approach\u2014modeled after the approach used by IES\u2014to select  unsolicited proposals for further consideration by peer reviewers.  Education said implementation of our recommendation would not help it  to select high-quality applications because of the broad nature of the FIE  program. We disagree and think that collecting some systematic  information would enhance Education\u2019s ability to more effectively screen  the quality of its applicants and enhance the transparency and consistency  of this process. As we reported, Education officials acknowledge that, due  to the nature of the proposals, it is often difficult to make quality screening  decisions. We acknowledge that FIE awards and IES\u2019 research grants are  fundamentally different, but we point out that the FIE program does not  necessarily need to collect information that is as detailed or that would  place unnecessary burdens on organizations seeking FIE funds. To make it  clear that Education should focus on developing a systematic approach to  selecting unsolicited proposals rather than duplicating the approach used  by IES, we have modified our recommendation and removed reference to  IES.", "As agreed with your staff, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.

These  grants were awarded before Education reorganized in 2003. In 2003,  Education created OII and consolidated a number of grant programs with  it. The grants in question were funded from programs that are now housed  in OII. In addition, in 2003 Education published revised agency guidance  on awarding. This guidance governs the policies and procedures program  staff must follow in holding grant competitions and in awarding grants.  Consequently, we chose 2003 and 2004 as the time period for our  systematic review of both competitive grants and grants based on  unsolicited proposals.", "We used the department\u2019s GAPS to identify all grants awarded in 2003 and  2004. We assessed the reliability of the data in GAPS and found it to be  reliable for our purposes. We reviewed the competition files from all   25 discretionary grant competitions held in 2003 and 2004. During this   2-year period, a total of 521 grants were awarded. Ten of these grants were  for $15 million or more; we selected all of these grants for review. Of the  remaining 511 competitive grants awarded for amounts under $15 million,  we selected a random sample of 81 additional grants to review. The  sample size was calculated to achieve a precision of plus or minus   10 percent for an attribute estimate with an expected proportion of   50 percent and a 95 percent confidence level. With this probability sample,  each grant in the population had a known nonzero probability of being  selected. Each sample grant was subsequently weighted in the analysis to  account statistically for all the members of the population, including those  that were not selected. All percentage estimates from this sample have  margins of error of plus or minus 10 percent or less.", "In addition to 91 competitive awards, we examined all 65 grants based on  unsolicited proposals made by OII during 2003 and 2004.

In addition, for the  competitions, we interviewed relevant managers and program officers  responsible for monitoring the grants, program attorneys, and ethics  officials.

Also, we reviewed competition files and  individual grant files for grants awarded during this 2-year period. In  reviewing the competition files, we recorded information in the Federal  Register notice inviting applications, the competition plan, the funding  memo and slate from the Deputy Under Secretary to the Executive  Secretary and information on the funded grantees from the GAPS. We  used a structured instrument to collect information about each grant. In  reviewing each individual grant file, we recorded information on the   (1) grantee\u2019s funding levels, years in the program, and contact information;  (2) application processing by Education, including funding checklists,  application log screening forms, and budget analysis; (3) peer reviewers\u2019  comments and rankings; and (4) single audit database reports.
