FAA did not factor in the 10-percent premium FAA pays controllers for serving as CICs, which GAO estimates will cost $41.5 million over the five-year life of the agreement, but supervisory attrition has been happening faster than FAA estimated, increasing its net savings by about $18.4 million.

Working in airport towers and radar facilities, these controllers monitor and direct aircraft on the ground, during landings and takeoffs, and en route between airports. In doing so, the controllers ensure that the aircraft maintain a safe distance between one another and that each aircraft is on proper course to its destination. Because the ATC system requires thousands of controllers, each of whom typically manages just a section of airspace or one aspect of an aircraft\u2019s takeoff or landing, FAA depends on supervisors to monitor air traffic operations and controllers\u2019 workload and performance to ensure that the system is operating safely.", "In negotiating its 1998 collective bargaining agreement with its controllers\u2019 union (the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, or NATCA), FAA agreed to a national plan that would reduce by attrition the number of supervisors that oversee air traffic controllers (that is, not replacing those who leave), ultimately bringing the controller-to-supervisor ratio from 7-to- 1 to 10-to-1. To do so without compromising safety, FAA will increasingly have its controllers performing supervisory duties as Controllers-in-Charge (CIC) when supervisors are not present. While some FAA facilities have been using CICs for over 40 years, FAA recently expanded the duties and responsibilities of CICs and made them accountable for the performance and safe operation of the facility while they are in charge. Because of concerns about FAA\u2019s plans to make greater use of CICs, you asked us to review FAA\u2019s implementation of the expanded CIC program. Specifically, as discussed with your office, this report answers four questions: (1) how is FAA implementing the national plan for supervisory reductions and what is the resulting number of CICs it has selected to provide watch supervision?; (2) how adequate is the training FAA provided controllers for their new duties and responsibilities?; (3) how adequate are FAA\u2019s quality assurance procedures for measuring any safety-related effects of the CIC expansion?; and (4) what is the status of FAA\u2019s progress toward meeting its estimates of savings and productivity gains from the CIC expansion?", "To conduct this work, we obtained and analyzed nationwide data from FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Services Division on the implementation of the expanded CIC program. We also visited 12 air traffic control facilities and 6 of FAA\u2019s 9 regional offices to review their implementation of the CIC selection process, training, and quality assurance measures. We selected regional offices to ensure geographic diversity and, within those regions, we chose facilities that handle different levels of traffic (in terms of volume and complexity) and that represented a cross-section of the types of air traffic control facilities FAA operates. We assembled an independent panel of four experts in air traffic control training to assess the adequacy of the CIC training program in addition to reviewing all available student evaluations of the CIC training. Our detailed scope and methodology, including a list of the FAA facilities we visited, are presented at the conclusion of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s mission is to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the United States. To accomplish this, FAA provides uninterrupted air traffic control services throughout the year. A key component of these services is FAA\u2019s air traffic controller workforce, which includes its air traffic controllers and their supervisors. Controllers manage and direct air traffic throughout the country at three primary types of facilities to provide complete airport-to-airport air traffic management:   Airport towers\u2014controllers at these facilities direct the flow of aircraft before landing, on the ground, and after takeoff within 5 nautical miles of the airport and up to 3,000 feet above the airport.", "TRACONs\u2014controllers here provide radar separation to arriving and departing flights. They direct aircraft within the airspace that extends from the point where the tower control ends to about 50 nautical miles from the airport. Some TRACONs are located outside of the airport. However, most are not only collocated with the airport tower, but the controllers there work at both the tower and the TRACON.", "Air Route Traffic Control Centers (called en route centers)\u2014controllers at these facilities manage aircraft in routes outside or above TRACON airspace and over parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Typically, an en route center has responsibility for more than 100,000 square miles of airspace.", "At each facility, controllers manage and direct one area or aspect of air traffic. For example, in a tower, one controller is responsible for directing the ground movement of aircraft until they reach the runways, while others are responsible for air traffic control service to departing aircraft or sequencing aircraft on their final approaches into the airport. Control of an aircraft passes from one controller to another as the plane moves to its destination. For example, the controller directing ground movement of aircraft hands off responsibility for them to the controller directing departures from the airport. As departing aircraft near the end of the tower\u2019s airspace, controllers transfer control of the plane to a controller at a TRACON who, in turn, transfers the aircraft to an en route center as it leaves the TRACON\u2019s airspace.", "FAA\u2019s standards for its facilities require that they maintain \u201cwatch supervision\u201d over air traffic operations at all times. To do this, FAA employs supervisors who have a range of operational, managerial, and administrative responsibilities. Supervisors provide oversight of the control area and ensure operational awareness among the controllers directing air traffic in different areas or positions within the facility. They monitor and manage the flow of air traffic, distribute workload among controllers, and adjust and monitor the equipment (such as radar) on which the controllers depend. Supervisors are also responsible for other duties such as evaluating performance, considering promotions, granting awards, taking disciplinary actions, and coordinating testing for drugs or alcohol. Historically, FAA has also had CICs provide watch supervision when supervisors were not available, but the role of the CIC was limited to overseeing the operations in the control area.", "In July 1998, in negotiating with its air traffic controllers\u2019 union, NATCA, FAA agreed to a national plan to reduce the number of supervisors and increasingly use CICs to provide watch supervision. Specifically, FAA agreed to (1) reduce through attrition about 560 supervisory positions, moving from a controller-to-supervisor ratio of 7-to-1 toward 10-to-1, (2) pay controllers a 10-percent premium for the time each spends as a CIC, and (3) increase the supervisory duties that CICs would perform. In agreeing to these terms, FAA said a 10-to-1 ratio would be consistent with the National Performance Review goal of reducing employee-to-supervisor ratios. After the agreement took effect, FAA estimated that supervisory attrition would partially offset the costs of certain personnel reforms in the 1998 agreement as well as subsequent pay increases for supervisors and air traffic managers. The 10-percent CIC premium took effect in 1998 and the added responsibilities for CICs took effect January 1, 2001. At that time, FAA began to allow for supervisory attrition at facilities that had completed the training and other steps it required in preparation for the CIC expansion.", "After FAA completed the 1998 agreement with the air traffic controllers, members of the Congress, the Federal Managers Association (FMA), and others raised concerns about the potential safety implications of reducing the number of air traffic control supervisors. In response to these concerns, the Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported that the agreement to reduce the number of supervisors will not have an adverse impact on the safety of air traffic operations as long as FAA enhances the program by (1) identifying the duties CICs will assume from supervisors, (2) ensuring that FAA management retains the right to select CICs, (3) developing and providing CIC training courses, and (4) developing quality assurance procedures to measure the impact of supervisory reductions.", "FAA identified the additional supervisory functions that CICs will perform as well as those, such as performance evaluations, which remain with supervisors. As shown in appendix II, CICs must now perform three additional duties that they could not perform before the expansion: preparing initial reports on operational errors and deviations, monitoring the movement of presidential aircraft, and making on-the-spot corrections of controllers\u2019 performance while overseeing facility operations. However, FAA officials emphasize that, more so than the number of additional duties, the most important difference between the pre- and post-expansion CIC program is the increased accountability FAA now places on controllers for their performance of CIC duties. Prior to the 1998 agreement, CIC duties were not a critical job element in the performance standards that FAA uses to evaluate individual controllers\u2019 performance and, according to FAA, it had limited ability to hold controllers accountable for their performance as CICs. As part of the CIC expansion (and in consultation with NATCA), FAA has made those duties a critical job element for the controllers. In doing so, FAA officials believe they have set an expectation that controllers are now accountable for their performance as CICs in the same manner that they are held accountable for controlling air traffic.", "FAA took a number of actions to address the report\u2019s other concerns and to implement the expanded CIC program. Specifically, it (1) determined that each of its ATC facilities would be responsible for selecting controllers to serve as CICs and spelled out a CIC selection process for them to use, (2) developed training for CICs to meet their new responsibilities, and (3) developed safety and efficiency quality assurance metrics for evaluating the CIC program. FAA also determined that it would not allow attrition to begin until each facility had completed all of the steps necessary to prepare its controllers and certified that it had a sufficient number of controllers to serve as CICs and the expansion of CIC duties was working satisfactorily."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Facilities Have Certified Over Half of All Controllers As CICs Because of Shift Coverage Rules, Supervisory Staffing, and Local Operational Needs", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s regional offices are responsible for carrying out the agency\u2019s efforts to meet its national goal of a 10-to-1 ratio of controllers to supervisors. The regional offices did so either by determining appropriate ratios or staffing levels for each of their facilities or by applying the 10-to-1 ratio across the board to all of their facilities. Nationwide, FAA\u2019s facilities selected over 8,250 air traffic controllers to be CICs. Although this represents over 55 percent of FAA\u2019s controllers, it is slightly less than the number of CICs FAA had prior to the 1998 agreement. The percentage of controllers selected varied considerably among different types and sizes of facilities. Over half of FAA\u2019s facilities\u2014primarily small and mid-size towers\u2014 selected all or nearly all of their controllers. However, larger facilities, such as the busiest airports and FAA\u2019s en route centers, typically selected fewer controllers to be CICs. At the 12 facilities we visited, their need for CICs\u2014and, as a result, the number of controllers they selected\u2014was governed by a combination of FAA\u2019s requirement to have watch supervision on all shifts, their level of supervisory staffing, and their operational requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Regional Offices Are Implementing Supervisory Reductions", "paragraphs": ["FAA tasked each of its regional offices with planning for and managing the attrition of supervisors on a facility-by-facility basis so that it could reach its national goal of a 10-to-1 ratio of controllers to supervisors.

The remaining five regions we visited are adjusting supervisory levels on a facility-by-facility basis. They plan to keep supervisory staffing at or close to current levels at the larger facilities such as en route centers, TRACONs, and terminals with high-density traffic (such as O\u2019Hare in Chicago), and will reduce the number of supervisors at smaller facilities that have less traffic. As a result, controller-to-supervisor ratios at facilities in these regions will vary. For example, in one region there will eventually be no supervisors at some of its smaller facilities, such as the North Las Vegas air traffic control tower. FAA plans for North Las Vegas to have no supervisor and, instead, operate with 1 manager and 15 controllers. Similarly, the Billings terminal\u2014once the attrition of the 3 supervisors currently assigned there has occurred\u2014will have 1 manager, no supervisors, and 18 controllers. At this facility, CICs will perform all of the watch supervision duties and the facility manager will perform all of the other duties that CICs may not (such as performance evaluations of the controllers)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Facilities Selected Most Controllers to Be CICs, but Fewer Than Were Used in the Past", "paragraphs": ["By the end of March 2001, managers at FAA\u2019s facilities decided to select and certify most of FAA\u2019s air traffic controllers as CICs.

In September 2000, prior to the selection of controllers for the expanded program, FAA had over 10,600 CICs at its facilities. According to FAA program officials, in assessing their needs for CICs under the expanded program, some facilities determined that they did not currently need as many CICs as in the past. Therefore, some controllers who were CICs under the previous program have been decertified and are not CICs under the expanded program. However, the number of CICs in the expanded program is expected to grow as the number of supervisors is reduced.

At the Los Angeles en route center, for example, managers said that controllers and CICs are certified to work in only one of the six air traffic control areas at the facility and are not interchangeable among areas on a day-to- day basis without undergoing months of recertification training. Consequently, the number of CICs selected\u201469 of the total controller workforce of 294\u2014is necessary to ensure coverage.

For example, the TRACON in Elgin, Illinois, is being allocated a 7.8- to-1 controller-to-supervisor ratio, and the management of this facility selected 30 percent of its controllers to be CICs. The en route center in Atlanta, however, is being allocated only enough supervisors for a 9-to-1 controller-to-supervisor ratio, and its management determined it will need to select 161 of its 399 controllers (40 percent) to provide adequate CIC coverage based on its projected supervisory staffing for 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facility Operational Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Most FAA facilities operate 24 hours per day, and controllers work various shifts, including weekends and overnight (termed midnight shifts).

Although some of these shifts, such as the midnight shift, do not need many controllers, all must be certified as CICs to ensure continual watch supervision. At Dulles airport, for example, all 82 controllers must at times work a 3-person midnight shift to staff both the tower and TRACON at the facility. No supervisors are scheduled for this shift, and because of FAA\u2019s watch supervision requirements, the three controllers on the shift must be CICs in order to monitor both the tower and TRACON and provide required breaks. Managers at the Dulles facility said that they need all 82 controllers to be CICs to satisfy both shift coverage and watch supervision requirements. For the same reasons, 30 or fewer controllers staffed 4 of the towers we visited, and managers there needed to certify all controllers as CICs. Supervisors at these facilities are scheduled to work when air traffic was heaviest, but controllers had to supervise the facilities' operations (as CICs) at all other times.

Development of the training material began shortly after the 1998 agreement was signed. FAA established a CIC Workgroup, consisting of FAA management, supervisors, and controllers, to make recommendations to the CIC Executive Steering Committee on the roles and responsibilities, guidelines for selection, quality assurance measures, and training for the CIC program. As part of this effort, FAA asked several members of the group to develop a CIC training program. Team members worked with FAA\u2019s training academy in Oklahoma City to develop a course based on the task and skill requirements contained in supervisor training courses and in CIC training courses developed by various regions and facilities. Ultimately, the team developed a minimum 2\u00bd-day training course that included a 3 to 5-hour computer-based instruction program and 2 days of classroom training. The training was to end with a minimum of 2 hours of on-the-job training overseen by a supervisor.", "The training materials covered a broad range of subjects and supervisory duties. The computer-based training provided an introduction to CIC duties, and the classroom training materials contained 17 different modules that addressed both national and local CIC requirements and skills. On the national level, the training materials covered areas such as watch supervision requirements, human relations and communications, operations management, and the handling of unusual situations. The local- level training materials emphasized specific guidance needed for the local facility. It included information on the local work environment, operational staffing, leave administration, and labor management relations. FAA's CIC training team recommended that supervisors deliver all aspects of the training, both national and local, and FAA required that the CIC on-the-job training be given by supervisors.", "The FAA officials noted that, as it requires of all of its training courses, the CIC training program was validated in March 2000. Validation is a process through which instructional materials and associated documentation are examined and approved for delivery to the target population. The CIC training program\u2019s validation included a pilot test of the national component of the classroom training with controllers and a critique by subject experts, and in May 2000 the course was approved by FAA\u2019s Training Manager. FAA officials added that this training is more comprehensive than that given to new supervisors and that current supervisors have asked to take the training.", "Controllers and supervisors who participated in the training at the 12 facilities we visited believed that the CIC training was useful. They said that the CIC training was a good overview of watch supervision and was better than that given to new supervisors. However, some supervisors did express concerns about how effectively the training prepared controllers to conduct watch supervision. For example, supervisors at one tower said that the training was the \u201cbare minimum,\u201d and at another facility a supervisor told us that a 3-day course is not enough to provide a controller the necessary skills to handle the tasks associated with watch supervision.", "An independent panel of training experts we assembled concurred with FAA\u2019s assessment of the training materials, but had other concerns about the training\u2019s delivery. The panel\u2014consisting of individuals involved in the development and delivery of air traffic control courses at one U.S. college and two universities\u2014stated that the design of the CIC training materials was among the best of FAA training programs they had seen.

For example, the panel stated that the instructors should spend considerable time instructing CICs on how to provide on-the-spot corrections and on handling the workload and staffing demands at a facility. They said that these are important safety-related skills and duties that are not the responsibility of all controllers, only those who are supervisors or CICs. They pointed out that they did not have the opportunity to observe how the training was delivered at any facility, but given the amount of information covered in the training program, they were concerned that some areas would not be adequately addressed. Furthermore, the panel members said that using local supervisors to provide all the training might not be optimal. FAA often employs teams trained to provide instruction on key matters nationwide. They said these teams are thoroughly familiar with the training material, provide realistic examples, and provide a consistent level of training throughout the country. In the panel\u2019s view, using local supervisors to conduct all of the training\u2014instead of these teams\u2014raises questions about its consistency and quality.", "Concerns about the overall effectiveness of training can be addressed if assessments are used to examine whether deficiencies exist. One potential source of assessment information for an early nationwide view of the training program is student end-of-course evaluations. FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Services Training Orders requires that such evaluations be made available to students. However, nearly 60 percent of those who completed the CIC training program did not turn in a written evaluation. We asked FAA to provide us the student evaluations from all 316 facilities; however, its facilities were only able to provide evaluations from 3,396 students, or about 41 percent of all the students who took the training. FAA officials told us that the evaluation forms were available to students, as FAA\u2019s training order required, but that FAA cannot force students to complete the forms. They told us that students frequently returned blank forms and were more likely to provide feedback orally to the instructors after the class. Moreover, while the majority of the evaluations we did obtain showed a favorable response to the training, the evaluation forms were not standardized nationwide and consequently do not provide a consistent basis for evaluating the training. For example, about 2,200 forms used a format that rated the training on a scale of 1 (the highest evaluation) to 6 (the lowest evaluation) in 9 categories. However, about 1,200 forms used other rating scales and other categories that are not comparable.", "Furthermore, FAA has not conducted an overall evaluation of the training program. FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Services Training Order describes evaluation as one of the phases of its systematic training development process. Such assessment is designed to chart the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the instruction. Decisions to continue or revise the instruction are to be based on the results of this evaluation. However, no such evaluation of the CIC training has been done. According to FAA training officials, they usually conduct such evaluations only if there is some indication of problems that would be visible in performance reviews, for example. Also, FAA officials said that they completed a special assessment at 15 facilities that included training and found that managers, supervisors, and controllers had positive comments about the course and study materials.", "Nevertheless, although they are not aware of any problems with the CIC training, FAA officials told us that they would develop a plan for an overall evaluation of the CIC training. They said that because of the importance of and concerns about the expanded CIC program, they will survey facility managers, CICs, and controllers who are not CICs but who receive direction from them, to determine if the training has been effective.

In one area at the New York en route center about half the controllers spent 4 hours per month or less performing CIC duties. By comparison, FAA requires supervisors to spend at least 8 hours per month controlling air traffic in order to maintain proficiency in the hands-on aspects of air traffic management.", "No such minimum time requirement exists for controllers serving as CICs. According to FAA officials, a minimum number of hours for controllers to spend as CIC each month is not practical because in some cases only a small number of hours are available for CICs. Furthermore, the officials believe that using CIC skills during busier or more difficult periods is most critical, and many of the hours available to CICs are during the midnight shift, which generally do not provide the same conditions. Consequently, controllers meeting minimum hour requirements primarily on midnight shifts would not necessarily be developing and using all needed CIC skills. Our expert training panel also stated that requiring CICs to perform these duties a minimum number of hours each month is not realistic. The panel said that the quality of the time performing CIC duties, and a mechanism to provide additional training to ensure skills are retained, is more important.", "Refresher training might be a more effective means of reinforcing and increasing knowledge and skills of CICs.

For example, under the heading of safety, the metric asks about the effect the CIC expansion has had on a facility\u2019s efforts to reduce operational errors and deviations.

Subsequently, in September 2000, FAA estimated that the reduction in supervisors to a 10- to-1 ratio of controllers to supervisors would, over the 5-year life of the agreement, produce cost savings of about $165 million to offset some of the increased costs FAA will incur from various provisions of the agreement. At the same time, FAA stated that it expected to increase the productive use of controllers\u2019 on-duty time and, through the CIC expansion, improve controllers\u2019 decisionmaking abilities.", "Even though FAA had been using CICs for many years, it only began paying the controllers the 10-percent premium for this duty as a result of the 1998 agreement. Previously, FAA did not have historical payroll or time and attendance data on the number of hours its controllers served as CICs and FAA did not reduce its savings by an estimate of these costs. We estimate that the CIC premium will amount to over $41.5 million over the life of the 1998 agreement (through fiscal year 2003). Later this year, FAA plans to update its status report on the 1998 agreement and, because cost data should be available, it plans to include estimates of the CIC premium costs and show how these payments have reduced the amount it will save through supervisory attrition.", "In contrast to how the CIC premium reduces its net savings, FAA currently expects that it will save $18.4 million more from supervisory reductions because attrition has occurred faster than it first expected. For example, FAA estimated it would lose by attrition about 100 supervisors each fiscal year. As of May 30, 2001, FAA had already lost by attrition 139 supervisors in fiscal year 2001.

Because FAA made this estimate as part of its plan to move toward a controller-to-supervisor ratio of 10-to-1, the basis for the estimate was an assumption that FAA would, by the end of fiscal year 2003, reach its goal of a 10-to-1 ratio. However, according to one official, FAA also has said it would reach that goal only through attrition and, as a result, never guaranteed that it would be at a 10-to-1 ratio at any specific future point in time. As a result, the information we present in table 2 represents a snapshot of where FAA currently stands with respect to its net savings from supervisory attrition. The savings FAA ultimately achieves from the supervisory reductions may differ from its estimate and might be largely out of the agency\u2019s control because the savings depend on attrition, which will be determined by the decisions of hundreds of individual supervisors between now and the end of fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Not Measured Productivity Gains From the Expansion of Controllers\u2019 Duties", "paragraphs": ["FAA has not measured the productivity of its controller workforce to see if expanding the duties for which they are responsible has, as it expected, made them more productive.

FAA is also aware that this can happen.  However, we note that the net savings associated with the expansion that FAA provided us are in the aggregate, reflecting salaries of controllers and supervisors across the country.  On balance, FAA's data appear to indicate that there are more cases in which a CIC temporarily serving in place of a supervisor saves money than there are cases in which it costs more.", "With regard to the recommendations we are making, the FMA officials stated that we should also recommend that FAA halt the CIC expansion until it has ensured that every facility has CIC quality assurance measures in place.

FAA\u2019s nine regional offices play significant roles in staffing to FAA\u2019s facilities and determining the timing and pace at which they will allow attrition to occur among the ranks of operations supervisors (as FAA works on a region-by-region basis to reach a controller-to-supervisor ratio of 10-to-1).", "In addition, to assess the CIC training program developed by FAA, we obtained copies of the training materials and obtained the services of four outside experts to review the materials: Dr. Marvin Smith of the Embry- Riddle Aeronautical Institute, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Mr. Paul Arnholt of the Aviation Sciences Center, Community College of Beaver County, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania; and Dr. Bruce Smith and Mr. Gary Bartelson, University of North Dakota School of Aerospace Sciences, Grand Forks, North Dakota. These experts all train students to become air traffic controllers; they reviewed the scope of the training program as well as the quality of the information contained in each of the various training modules. The experts did not observe the training and therefore offered no opinions on the overall effectiveness of the training in developing controllers to be effective CICs.
