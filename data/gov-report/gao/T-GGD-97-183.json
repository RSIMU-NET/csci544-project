Congress considered, but did not approve, the 1993 and 1995 requests, and is currently considering the 1997 request. In 1991, the Judicial Conference established a process, with policies and weighted workload standards, for assessing the need for additional bankruptcy judges. At the request of the Subcommittee, GAO reviewed the 1993, 1995, and 1997 assessment cycles. GAO found that the Conference\u2019s Bankruptcy Committee and the Judicial Conference generally followed the Conference\u2019s process and policies. The Committee and Conference placed heaviest emphasis on whether the districts requesting additional judgeships had a caseload that exceeded 1,500 weighted filings per authorized judgeship. Neither the Committee nor the Conference approved any requests for additional judgeships from districts whose weighted case filings did not meet this standard.", "The Bankruptcy Committee also asked that districts requesting judgeships provide information on several factors, other than weighted filings, that may affect their need for additional judges, such as case management practices and the district\u2019s demographics and economic conditions. Most of these districts provided information on at least four of these factors.

Limiting judgeship requests to the number necessary is important because each bankruptcy judgeship costs about $721,000 to establish and about $575,000 per year to maintain. At the same time, it is important that there be sufficient bankruptcy judgeships to enable the bankruptcy courts to adjudicate bankruptcy cases fairly and efficiently.", "Specifically, my testimony focuses on three principal issues: (1) the process, policies, and workload standards that the Judicial Conference of the United States used to assess the bankruptcy districts\u2019 requests for additional bankruptcy judgeships; (2) how the Judiciary applied its policies and workload standards across the districts that requested bankruptcy judgeships; and (3) the extent of noncase-related travel in 1995 and 1996 by bankruptcy judges in the 14 districts for which the Judicial Conference of the United States has requested bankruptcy judgeships in 1997.", "In brief, we found that the Bankruptcy Committee and the Judicial Conference generally followed the Judicial Conference\u2019s process and policies and consistently applied the Conference\u2019s statistical workload standards in assessing individual district\u2019s requests for additional judgeships in 1993, 1995, and 1997. For example, the Bankruptcy Committee and Judicial Conference placed heaviest emphasis on whether the districts requesting additional judgeships had a caseload that exceeded 1,500 weighted filings per existing authorized judgeship. Neither the Committee nor the Conference approved any request for additional judgeships from districts that did not meet this minimum standard. According to officials at the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), neither the Committee nor the Judicial Conference keeps written documentation on how other available data, such as case management practices or a district\u2019s geography (travel distances between places of holding court), were used in assessing districts\u2019 judgeship requests. AOUSC officials also stated that the use of data other than weighted case filings in assessing judgeship needs is inherently judgmental.", "The amount of time judges use for noncase-related travel\u2014travel that is not related to adjudicating specific cases\u2014could potentially affect the amount of time judges have to devote to individual cases.

We received information on noncase-related travel from 80 of the 84 authorized judges in the 15 districts that would receive or share 1 of the judgeships requested in 1997. These 80 judges reported a total of 416 noncase-related trips in 1995 and 403 in 1996. On the basis of the information reported, we calculated that overall these judges each used an average of 12.5 work days for noncase-related travel in each of these years. About 98 percent of these trips were made to destinations within the United States. Together, circuit or district meetings and activities; Judicial Conference meetings and activities; and workshops, seminars, and other activities sponsored by AOUSC or the Federal Judicial Center (FJC), accounted for about 66 percent of all noncase-related trips and about 74 percent of all noncase-related travel workdays in 1995. Comparable figures for 1996 were about 67 percent and about 73 percent, respectively. In correspondence to the Subcommittee Chairman on August 8, 1997, we provided more details about these trips for each district.", "Through AOUSC, we also surveyed the 13 authorized judges in the 4 districts with weighted filings of 1,500 or more during the 1997 assessment cycle that did not request judgeships. The 12 judges in these four districts (one position was vacant) reported a total of 177 noncase-related trips\u201475 in calendar year 1995 and 102 in calendar year 1996. Based on these reported data, we calculated that the 12 judges spent a total of 178 workdays in 1995 and 258 workdays in 1996 on noncase-related travel. This is a per judge average of 14.8 workdays in 1995 and 21.5 workdays in 1996. Overall, about 23 percent of all trips in these two years were sponsored and paid for by organizations other than the federal judiciary.", "To develop the information in this statement, we obtained documentation from AOUSC on (1) the process, policies, and workload standards the Judicial Conference has established for assessing the need for bankruptcy judgeships; (2) how the process, policies, and workload standards were used in the 1993, 1995, and 1997 assessment cycles to determine the number of additional bankruptcy judgeships needed and requested; and (3) the temporary assistance requested by and provided to the districts that sought additional judgeships in 1993, 1995, and/or 1997.

The Judicial Conference is statutorily required to periodically submit to Congress recommendations for new federal bankruptcy judgeships. Congress last authorized new bankruptcy judgeships in 1992. Subsequently, the Conference has sent recommendations for additional bankruptcy judgeships to Congress in 1993, 1995, and 1997. Congress considered, but not approve, any new judgeships from the 1993 and 1995 requests and is currently considering the 1997 request. To assist the Conference in advising Congress on the need for additional judgeships, the Conference\u2019s Committee on Administration of the Bankruptcy System (Bankruptcy Committee) is to conduct periodic national judgeship surveys to evaluate requests for additional bankruptcy judgeships. In 1993, 1995, and 1997, the Bankruptcy Committee conducted its surveys and analyses through its Subcommittee on Judgeships.", "In considering each district\u2019s bankruptcy judgeship request, the Bankruptcy Committee may recommend to the Judicial Conference one of seven options: one or more permanent judgeships, a temporary judgeship, a combination of permanent and temporary judgeships, the conversion of a temporary judgeship to a permanent judgeship, the extension of the term of an existing temporary judgeship, a judgeship to be shared by two or more districts; or, no changes to the district\u2019s existing number and type of authorized judgeships.", "A permanent judgeship is a position that is statutorily added to the bankruptcy district\u2019s current authorized total and remains authorized until statutorily rescinded. A temporary judgeship is a position that is statutorily created and authorized for 5 years after a judge is appointed to fill the temporary judgeship. It is important to note that it is the judgeship that is temporary, not the judge appointed to fill the position. The judge appointed to a temporary judgeship serves the same full 14-year term as a colleague appointed to fill a permanent position. When a temporary judgeship\u2019s 5-year authorization expires, the next vacancy to occur in the district cannot be filled. However, between the time that the temporary judgeship expires and a vacancy occurs, it is possible for the district to have more judges than authorized judgeships. Converting a district\u2019s existing temporary judgeship to a permanent judgeship reclassifies an existing judgeship, rather than adding a judgeship to a district\u2019s existing authorized total."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basic Steps in the Formal Assessment Process", "paragraphs": ["In 1991, the Judicial Conference established a process, with policies and weighted workload standards, for reviewing bankruptcy judgeships. The formal process has 8 basic steps (see fig. 1) that, when fully implemented, would take about 9 months to 1 year to complete. As I will discuss later in my testimony, this process was generally followed in developing the Judicial Conference\u2019s 1993, 1995, and 1997 bankruptcy judgeship requests. The eight basic steps in this formal process are as follows: 1. The Bankruptcy Committee requests that the chief judge of each appellate, district, and bankruptcy court assess the need for additional bankruptcy judgeships within their respective jurisdictions based on the Judicial Conference\u2019s policies. At the same time, the Committee provides each bankruptcy court (or district) information on its weighted filings per current authorized judgeship. 2. The bankruptcy and district courts provide their views on the need for additional judges to their respective circuit judicial councils. The bankruptcy court also sends its views to the district court.3. After reviewing the material provided by the bankruptcy and district courts, the circuit judicial council forwards its recommendations, which may differ from those of the bankruptcy and district courts in the circuit, to the Bankruptcy Judges Division of AOUSC, which serves as staff to the Bankruptcy Committee. 4. Under the direction of the Bankruptcy Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Judgeships, written mail surveys are sent to those districts for which judgeships have been requested. The Subcommittee on Judgeships conducts an on-site survey whenever a district initially requests additional judgeships. When a district renews a request previously approved by the Judicial Conference, but which Congress has not approved, the Bankruptcy Committee determines whether to conduct another survey. The on-site survey team is to generally consist of a bankruptcy judge member of the Bankruptcy Committee and staff of AOUSC\u2019s Bankruptcy Judges Division. The team interviews a variety of court officials and local attorneys, and reviews court files, dockets, and reports. The survey team then prepares a written report with a recommendation to the Subcommittee on Judgeships regarding the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgeship request. 5. For each bankruptcy district requesting judgeships, the Subcommittee on Judgeships reviews the district\u2019s judgeship request, the district\u2019s completed mail survey, and the on-site survey report (if done), then prepares a recommendation for the Bankruptcy Committee on the district\u2019s judgeship request. 6. The Subcommittee sends its recommendations, along with the applicable on-site survey reports (where done), to the circuit councils, district courts, and bankruptcy courts in those circuits and bankruptcy districts for which bankruptcy judges were requested. The circuit councils, district courts, and bankruptcy courts may provide any comments they have on the Subcommittee\u2019s recommendations, the survey report, and provide any other additional information they believe is relevant to the judgeship requests in their circuit or bankruptcy district. The Subcommittee on Judgeships reviews these comments, makes its final recommendation for each district, and sends its recommendations and accompanying documentation to the Bankruptcy Committee. 7. The Bankruptcy Committee reviews the mail survey, on-site survey report (if done), any other accompanying documents, and the Subcommittee on Judgeships\u2019 recommendations for each district, votes on each request, and forwards its recommendations to the Judicial Conference. 8. The Judicial Conference considers the Bankruptcy Committee\u2019s recommendations, approves or alters the Committee\u2019s recommendations, and forwards the Conference\u2019s final recommendations to Congress.", "In reviewing judgeship requests, the Bankruptcy Committee is to consider a number of factors adopted by the Judicial Conference in 1991. The first factor is weighted filings. Based on the results of a study of the time bankruptcy judges devoted to individual categories of bankruptcy cases,each case filed is assigned to 1 of 17 categories. Each category is determined on the basis of the bankruptcy chapter under which the case is filed, and within each chapter, the dollar value of the debtor\u2019s assets or liabilities. A case weight is assigned to each of the 17 categories, representing the average amount of judicial time the case would be expected to require. Generally, to be eligible for an additional judgeship, the Judicial Conference expects a bankruptcy district to have a minimum annual average of 1,500 weighted filings for each current authorized judgeship. To be eligible for a permanent judgeship, the Judicial Conference\u2019s standard is that a district\u2019s weighted filings per judgeship must be 1,500 or higher after adding any judgeships to the district\u2019s existing judgeship total. For example, a district with 5 judges could qualify for an additional permanent judgeship if its weighted filings per judgeship would be at least 1,500 with 6 judgeships (its existing 5 plus the requested position). If the weighted filings per judgeship would drop below 1,500 with the additional judgeship, the district could potentially qualify for a temporary, but not permanent, judgeship.", "The Judicial Conference\u2019s policy recognizes that bankruptcy judges\u2019 workloads may be affected by factors not captured in the most recent report of weighted filings and states that the Bankruptcy Committee is to consider a number of factors in addition to weighted filings. These factors include (1) the nature and mix of the court\u2019s caseload; (2) historical caseload data and filing trends (generally, the most recent 5-year period); (3) geographic, economic, and demographic factors in the district; (4) the effectiveness of the requesting court\u2019s case management efforts; (5) the availability of alternative solutions and resources for handling the court\u2019s workload, such as assistance from judges outside the district; (6) the impact that approval of requested additional resources would have on the court\u2019s per judgeship caseload; and (7) any other pertinent factors. The Bankruptcy Committee\u2019s written description of the assessment process also recognized that (1) bankruptcy case filings may fluctuate because they are dependent upon national and local economic conditions, and (2) temporary fluctuations can often be addressed by short-term resources, such as temporary assistance from judges outside the district and the use of temporary law clerks.", "At its September 1996 meeting, the Judicial Conference approved a change in the schedule for completing the biennial surveys for evaluating judgeship needs for district courts, courts of appeals, and bankruptcy courts. Beginning in 1998, the surveys are generally to be done in even-numbered years so that the Conference\u2019s recommendations for additional judgeships can be delivered to Congress in odd-numbered years. This change is intended to permit the judiciary to work with Congress on a judgeship bill over an entire 2-year congressional term."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Judicial Conference Generally Followed Its Process, Policies, and Workload Standards in 1993, 1995, and 1997", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, 1995, and 1997, the Bankruptcy Committee generally followed the Judicial Conference\u2019s established process, policies, and workload standards in assessing bankruptcy judgeship needs.

Under the new guidelines, districts whose previously approved requests were still pending before Congress would be asked to reassess their need for these additional judgeship positions and submit a statement to the Committee on whether or not the positions were still needed. The Committee considered a position still needed, without a new survey, if the district\u2019s weighted filings per authorized judgeship were 1,500 or more.

In five other districts, the Circuit Councils reaffirmed their bankruptcy districts\u2019 requests for a total of six judgeships.

AOUSC suggested that we change our description of the formal judgeship assessment process to state that on-site surveys are always to be done when a district made its initial request for additional judgeships, but are not required when the district renews a previously-approved request and district\u2019s weighted workload remained at or above 1,500 weighted filings. AOUSC provided a formal written support for this change, and we incorporated the new language into our statement.
