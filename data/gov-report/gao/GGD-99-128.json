One factor that experts and officials cited for the increase in complaints was downsizing, which resulted in appeals of job losses and reassignments. A second factor was the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which motivated some employees to file complaints by allowing compensatory damage awards of up to $300,000 in cases involving unlawful, intentional discrimination. A third factor was the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which expanded discrimination protection. EEOC and Postal Service officials also said that the current regulations governing the EEO complaint process, implemented in October 1992, were a factor because they provided improved access to the complaint process.", "In a report we issued in May 1999, however, we said that there were several factors indicating that an increase in the number of complaints did not necessarily signify an equivalent increase in the actual number of individuals filing complaints. First, an undetermined number of federal employees have filed multiple complaints. EEOC officials and representatives of the Council of Federal EEO and Civil Rights Executives said that, while they could not readily provide figures, it has been their experience that a small number of employees\u2014often referred to as \u201crepeat filers\u201d\u2014account for a disproportionate share of complaints. A Postal Service official said that between 60 and 70 employees account for every 100 complaints filed. Additionally, an EEOC workgroup that reviewed the federal employee discrimination complaint process reported that the number of cases in the system was \u201cswollen\u201d by employees filing \u201cspin-off\u201d complaints\u2014new complaints challenging the processing of existing complaints. Further, the work group found that the number of complaints was \u201cunnecessarily multiplied\u201d by agencies fragmenting some claims involving a number of different allegations by the same employee into separate complaints, rather than consolidating these claims into one complaint. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of complaints alleging reprisal, which, for the most part, involve claims of retaliation by employees who have previously participated in the complaint process.", "Further, in past reports and testimonies, we noted, among other things, that the discrimination complaint process was burdened by a number of cases that were not legitimate discrimination complaints; some were frivolous complaints or attempts by employees to get a third party\u2019s assistance in resolving workplace disputes unrelated to discrimination.Similarly, EEOC reported in its 1996 study that a \u201csizable\u201d number of complaints might not involve discrimination issues but instead reflect basic communications problems in the workplace. EEOC said that such issues may be brought into the EEO process because of a perception that there is no other forum to air general workplace concerns. The agency also said that there is little question that these types of issues would be especially conducive to resolution through ADR processes.", "EEOC will be implementing regulatory and procedural changes beginning in November 1999 to deal with some of the factors contributing to the volume of complaints flowing through the process. One change will allow agencies and administrative judges to dismiss spin-off complaints. Another change will allow agencies and administrative judges to dismiss complaints in which employees are abusing the process.

The agency projects that with these additional resources, the hearings and appeals inventories and processing times would initially decline in fiscal year 2000, only to begin rising again in fiscal year 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects of Revisions to Complaint Process Not Known", "paragraphs": ["Neither our analysis nor EEOC\u2019s projections and requested funding increase take into account, however, the possible effects of changes to program regulations and procedures intended to reduce the number of cases flowing into and through the complaint process. Since EEOC\u2019s workload is dependent on the number of cases in the pipeline at agencies, it is important to understand how the program changes are likely to affect caseloads at agencies. The requirement that agencies offer ADR processes to employees, including in the counseling phase before a formal complaint is filed, should resolve some workplace disputes without a complaint being filed and resolve other disputes in the early complaint stages. Other changes allowing dismissal of spin-off complaints and other complaints in which an employee is believed to be abusing the process should halt the processing of these cases early in the process and possibly discourage the filing of such complaints. In addition, policies to prevent agencies from fragmenting cases should also reduce the number of new complaints.", "However, although EEOC designed its changes to program regulations and procedures to reduce the flow of new cases, it has not estimated the likely effect of these changes on the volume of complaints. EEOC officials explained that they had been deferring developing estimates until the regulations had been approved because of how the details of the final regulations could affect caseload estimates. They also said that although one goal of the regulations is to reduce caseloads, another goal is to improve the fairness of the process. The EEOC officials said that one measure to improve fairness is to remove agencies\u2019 ability to reject or modify administrative judges\u2019 decisions in arriving at final decisions. The officials said that complainants could view this change as giving the administrative judges more authority, and they speculated that more complainants might seek a hearing.", "Estimates of the expected changes in complaint levels are important because a decrease in new complaints would affect how quickly EEOC might be able to reduce its inventories, and thus how many, if any, additional staff would be needed and for how long. EEOC\u2019s Compliance and Control Division Director said that it would be appropriate to consider the effects of these changes when the agency prepares its fiscal year 2001 budget request. Because the changes could begin affecting complaint levels in fiscal year 2000 and because any new staff, if not hired on a temporary basis, could be with EEOC a long time, estimates of likely changes in complaint levels also could be important to congressional consideration of EEOC\u2019s future budget requests.", "EEOC also has not completed the development of the measures and indicators that it will use in the future to gauge the actual effect of the changes. In its fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan, EEOC said that it would develop measures and indicators for assessing the effectiveness of these revisions, which, according to the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2000 Annual Performance Plan, would be implemented in fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Rising inventory levels of unresolved EEO complaints and lengthy case processing times to resolve these workplace disputes remain stubborn problems for agencies and EEOC. The struggle of nonpostal agencies was especially evident in that their inventories rose by almost 8 percent in fiscal year 1998 despite a 6 percent decline in new complaints. Similarly, despite increases in its productivity, EEOC\u2019s appeals inventory increased by almost 10 percent in fiscal year 1998, even though the number of appeals filed remained almost unchanged. At the same time, EEOC\u2019s inventory of hearing requests rose by almost 20 percent, about twice the rate of increase in new hearing requests that the agency received.", "How long present conditions will continue, and whether they will improve or deteriorate further, depends on the ability of agencies and EEOC to process cases currently in the complaint pipeline as well as on the volume of new complaints entering the pipeline in the future. Future trends and, therefore, agencies\u2019 and EEOC\u2019s resource needs, are likely to be affected by the revisions to the complaint process. However, EEOC has not developed estimates of the extent to which revisions to complaint process regulations and procedures may affect the flow of cases into and through the process. Among the changes, the requirement that agencies offer ADR to complainants could reduce the number of new cases filed, or resolve disputes in the early stages. In addition, other changes to be implemented dealing with fragmenting of complaints, spin-off complaints, and abuse of process could reduce the number of new complaints or short-circuit them early in the process.", "EEOC\u2019s request for additional funding for attorneys and judges and the implementation of changes to program regulations and procedures in November 1999 lend urgency to gaining an understanding of the likely effects of the proposed changes on the complaint process and complaint inventories. In addition, until the measures and indicators promised in EEOC\u2019s fiscal year 1999 Annual Performance Plan are developed and implemented, the actual effect of the revisions on the EEOC complaint process will be difficult to track. Estimates of the effect of the changes combined with anticipated productivity levels could be used to further estimate the resources needed to reduce EEOC\u2019s inventory of hearing requests to levels that would allow the average case to be processed within the 180-day requirement in regulations.", "In addition, current regulations do not prescribe a processing time standard for appeals, which could be used to establish and develop estimates of the resources needed to reduce the average appeal processing time to an acceptable level of timeliness. In the case of both hearing and appeal processing, the estimates could be useful in determining how many, if any, additional staff are needed to reduce the backlogs and whether the staff should be a permanent or temporary addition to EEOC\u2019s workforce. Given the size of the backlogs, estimates for reducing them to acceptable levels over different time frames could allow EEOC and Congress to weigh the trade-offs between additional cost and the rapidity with which the inventory of cases is resolved. Measures and indicators to assess the actual effect of changes in program regulations should be adopted before the changes are implemented to ensure that consistent data are collected from the start and to ensure that systems are in place to generate valid and reliable data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To provide Congress with a clear picture of future caseload trends and the resources that are needed to deal with current backlogs, as well as the volume of cases expected in the future, we recommend that the EEOC Chairwoman take steps to (1) develop estimates of the effects of the forthcoming changes in program regulations and procedures on agencies\u2019 and EEOC\u2019s caseloads and (2) complete development of measures and indicators to track and assess the impact of these revisions on caseload trends. We also recommend that the Chairwoman use these data to develop estimates, under various time frames, of the resources needed to reduce its average hearings processing time to meet the 180-day requirement in regulations. We further recommend that the Chairwoman establish a policy of an acceptable level of timeliness for processing appeals and develop estimates, under various time frames, of the resources needed to reduce its average appeals processing time to meet this standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received comments on a draft of this report from EEOC and the Postal Service. The EEOC Chairwoman said in her written comments (see app. V) that she shared our concerns that complaint inventories are too high and that federal employees wait far too long for their complaints to be processed by their agencies and EEOC. She said that analyses of the kind in our 1998 report on rising EEO complaint caseloads in the federal sector had persuaded her that bold steps were necessary to bring about improvements. She said that, in addition to the changes in regulations, EEOC is implementing a comprehensive, strategic approach to link the hearings and appeals programs with strong oversight, technical assistance, and educational initiatives. These efforts are to include on-site reviews, which EEOC believes are one of the most important vehicles with which to focus on and correct root causes of persistent problems. Also, the Chairwoman said that with additional resources, EEOC would increase its efforts on conflict prevention and early intervention, since these are the most cost-effective ways to reduce inventories. Further, the Chairwoman pointed out that EEOC, with the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), is cosponsoring the Interagency Federal EEO Task Force that will look into ways to enhance the fairness, efficiency, and effectiveness of the federal employee EEO complaint process.", "EEOC also responded to the first three of our four recommendations that it (1) develop estimates of the effects of changes in regulations on caseloads, (2) complete development of measures and indicators to track and assess the impact of these revisions, and (3) develop estimates of the resources needed under various time frames to reduce hearings and appeals processing times. EEOC said that right now it would be premature and highly speculative for the agency to venture guesses on what the actual experiences under the revised regulations might be. In addition, EEOC said that it was not possible to develop measures and indicators for assessing the effectiveness of the revisions to the federal sector EEO complaint process before the draft regulations were approved. However, with the publication of the final rules in the Federal Register on July 12, 1999, EEOC said that it expects to complete development of the measures and indicators by the end of fiscal year 1999. The Chairwoman added, however, that other complex issues must be resolved, including how baseline data will be collected and what data collection method will be used. Consequently, she said that the first year for which data will be collected on experiences under the revised regulations will be fiscal year 2001. She said that when these data are available at the end of calendar year 2001, it would be possible to estimate resource requirements under various time frames. The Chairwoman further said that these data would be used to prepare EEOC\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget request, which would be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget in September 2002 and to Congress in early 2003.", "We continue to believe that in order for Congress to carry out its oversight and appropriation responsibilities and make informed budget decisions, it needs timely estimates from EEOC of how changes in the complaint process may affect caseloads and resource requirements. Further, we believe congressional decisionmaking would benefit from EEOC\u2019s best estimate of the resources needed under various time frames to reduce hearings and appeals processing times to acceptable levels. With such estimates, Congress could consider options to deal with this serious situation.", "We recognize that early estimates may be inexact. However, without any estimate of the effect the new regulations may have on caseloads and of information on how quickly, if at all, additional staff might be able to reduce the current case backlogs, Congress has no basis to judge whether requested resources to increase staffing are reasonable. Although initial estimates of necessity involve considerable judgment, we believe it would be better to offer estimates than to provide no perspective on the regulations\u2019 anticipated effect. Estimation is an iterative process, and EEOC can improve the precision of its estimates as more and better data become available. The Chairwoman said that EEOC will explore alternative means for obtaining feedback on the kinds of changes that may flow from the revised regulations. In addition to EEOC examining its own caseloads, such alternatives, we believe, could include obtaining data during on-site visits, through the NPR/EEOC Interagency Federal EEO Task Force, or through informal surveys of agencies. As EEOC and agencies scrutinize inventories to see how the new provisions apply to existing cases, such data-gathering initiatives could yield increasingly reliable and timely information on the effects of the new provisions.", "In response to our fourth recommendation that an acceptable level of timeliness be established for the processing of appeals, the Chairwoman said that 180 days is an appropriate goal. She did not say how this goal might be operationalized. We believe that such a goal would carry more significance and accountability if it were articulated in writing as a policy, such as by inclusion in EEOC\u2019s annual performance plan.", "In oral comments on a draft of this report made on July 7, 1999, the Postal Service Manager, EEO Compliance and Appeals, concurred with our observations. He added that the Postal Service will be in compliance with the new EEOC regulation requiring that ADR be available to complainants because of its REDRESS (Resolve Employment Disputes, Reach Equitable Solutions Swiftly) program.", "In a separate discussion, the Postal Service\u2019s National REDRESS Program Manager said that the program, which uses outside mediators in the precomplaint stage, was fully implemented as of July 1999. She provided statistics showing that during the first 10 months of fiscal year 1999\u2014a period during which the program was still being rolled out\u2014there were about 17 percent fewer formal EEO complaints, compared with the same period in fiscal year 1998 (7,050 versus 8,522). She and the EEO Compliance and Appeals Manager said this decline was in \u201clarge measure\u201d due to the REDRESS program. The EEO Compliance and Appeals Manager also said that the Postal Service was expanding ADR to complaints awaiting a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge. He said that pilot programs have shown promise in reducing the inventory of complaints at this stage, with about one-third of the cases reviewed found to be candidates for settlement and another one-third found to be candidates for mediation. The remaining one-third, he said, will probably go to hearing. The official said that agencies have a responsibility to address these cases and can play an important role in reducing not only their own caseloads, but EEOC\u2019s as well.", "The implications of the Postal Service\u2019s experience with ADR, if the reported results are sustained, are significant for several reasons. First, they show that an agencywide ADR program to resolve disputes at an early stage can reduce the number of formal complaints. Second, because postal workers account for about half of the EEO complaints filed by federal employees, a substantial reduction in the number of formal complaints by postal workers could mean a reduction in the number of cases entering EEOC\u2019s hearings and appeals pipeline. Third, the Postal Service\u2019s limited experience, under its pilot programs, of applying ADR to cases awaiting a hearing show that some portion of this inventory can be resolved without using EEOC hearing resources.", "Although the Postal Service has not had broad experience with applying ADR to cases awaiting a hearing, the experiences of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) may be instructive to agencies and EEOC in establishing dispute resolution strategies and allocating resources. MSPB has had a long-established policy of trying to settle cases it does not dismiss on jurisdictional or timeliness grounds. Over the past 10 years, MSPB has avoided hearings by settling about half of employee appeals of personnel actions.", "We are sending copies of this report to Senators Daniel K.

Agencies' complaint data for fiscal year 1998, which EEOC provided and which we used in our analysis, were preliminary.  We selected 1991 as a base year because it preceded intensive government downsizing, the implementation of new laws expanding civil rights protections and remedies, and the implementation of new regulations governing the federal employee EEO complaint process.  Because postal workers accounted for about half the complaints filed since fiscal year 1995, we separately analyzed data reported by the Postal Service in order to compare statistics for the postal workforce with the nonpostal workforce.", "To update and analyze information about (1) the trends in the size and age of complaint inventories and (2) the number of complaints filed by federal employees and the amount of time taken by federal agencies and EEOC to process them, we obtained data reported (1) to EEOC by the Postal Service and other agencies and (2) by EEOC in its annual Federal Sector Report on EEO Complaints Processing and Appeals.

In addition, we reviewed EEOC\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2000 and its annual performance plans for fiscal years 1999 and 2000.  We also reviewed changes to the regulations governing the federal employee complaint process (29 C.F.R. part 1614) that are to be implemented beginning in November 1999.", "We have previously noted limitations to the data presented in our reports because of concerns about the quality of data available for analysis.Although we have no reason to question EEOC\u2019s statistics about its own hearings and appeals activities, we had identified errors and inconsistencies in the data on agencies\u2019 inventory levels and on the age of cases in inventory.  Because EEOC had not verified the data it received from agencies, it is possible that other data problems may have existed. EEOC corrected the errors we identified and, in response to a recommendation we made, said that it would take action to address our concerns about data consistency, completeness, and accuracy.  Before providing the fiscal year 1998 agency data to us, EEOC reviewed agencies\u2019 hard-copy submissions of complaint statistics and compared these data to statistics the agencies provided in an automated format.  EEOC also tested the accuracy of its computer program to aggregate the data submitted by agencies. In response to our recommendation in an earlier report, before it publishes the complaint statistics in the fiscal year 1998 Federal Sector Report on EEO Complaints Processing and Appeals, EEOC said it would visit selected agencies to assess the reliability of the reported data.  On balance, total caseload data currently available, while needing further quality assurance checks, present useful information on the volume of complaints actually being processed in the federal EEO complaint system.", "We performed our work in Washington, D.C., from March through May 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Federal Employee EEO Complaints", "paragraphs": ["Agencies and EEOC process federal employees\u2019 EEO complaints under regulations promulgated by EEOC, which also establish processing time standards.
