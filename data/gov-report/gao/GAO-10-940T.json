U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the United States, securing and facilitating trade, and cargo container security. This testimony discusses DHS and its component agencies' progress, and challenges remaining, regarding (1) strengthening risk management (a strategy to help policymakers make decisions about assessing risks, allocating resources, and acting under conditions of uncertainty), (2) reducing the risk of small-vessel (watercraft less than 300 gross tons used for recreational or commercial purposes) threats, (3) implementing foreign port assessments, and (4) enhancing supply chain security.

In December 2005, GAO reported that while the Coast Guard had made progress in strengthening risk management by conducting risk assessments, those assessments were limited because they could not compare and prioritize relative risks of various infrastructures across ports. Since that time, the Coast Guard developed a risk assessment model designed to capture the security risk facing different types of targets, and allowing comparisons among targets and at the local, regional, and national levels. The Coast Guard uses the model to help plan and implement its programs and focus security activities where it believes the risks are greatest. DHS and the Coast Guard have developed a strategy and programs to reduce the risks associated with small vessels but they face ongoing challenges. GAO reported from 2007 through 2010 that DHS and the Coast Guard have (1) developed a strategy to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with waterside attacks by small vessels; (2) conducted community outreach to encourage boaters to share threat information; (3) initiated actions to track small vessels; (4) tested equipment for detecting nuclear material on small vessels; and (5) conducted security activities, such as vessel escorts. However, the Coast Guard faces challenges with some of these efforts. For example, vessel tracking systems generally cannot track small vessels and resource constraints limit the Coast Guard's ability to meet security activity goals. DHS and the Coast Guard developed the International Port Security Program in April 2004 to assess the security of foreign ports, but challenges remain in implementing the program. GAO reported in October 2007 that Coast Guard officials stated that there is reluctance by certain countries to allow the Coast Guard to visit their ports due to concerns over sovereignty. Also, the Coast Guard lacks the resources to assist poorer countries. Thus the Coast Guard is limited in its ability to help countries enhance their established security requirements. To overcome this, officials have worked with other federal agencies and international organizations to secure funding for training and assistance to countries that need to strengthen port security efforts. DHS and CBP established the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) to test the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers, but face challenges expanding the program. In October 2009, GAO reported that CBP has made progress in working with the SFI ports to scan U.S.-bound cargo containers; but because of challenges implementing scanning operations, such as equipment breakdowns, the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers remains largely unproven. At the time, CBP officials expressed concern that they and the participating ports could not overcome the challenges. GAO recommended that DHS conduct a feasibility analysis. DHS concurred with our recommendation, but has not yet implemented it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations to DHS in prior reports to strengthen port security.

Ports, waterways, and vessels are part of an economic  engine handling more than $700 billion in merchandise annually, according  to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and an attack on this  system could have a widespread impact on global shipping, international  trade, and the global economy. Balancing security concerns with the need  to facilitate the free flow of people and commerce remains an ongoing  challenge for the public and private sectors alike. Within DHS, component  agencies have responsibility for securing the maritime environment. The  U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for protecting the public, the environment,  and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which  those interests may be at risk, including America\u2019s coasts, ports, and  inland waterways. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is  responsible for keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the United  States, securing and facilitating trade, and cargo container security.", "Various laws have been enacted since the September 11, 2001 terrorist  attacks to strengthen port security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002  charges DHS with establishing a risk management framework across the  federal government to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and key  resources. In addition, much of a new port security framework was set in  place by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA).  Enacted in November 2002, MTSA was designed, in part, to help protect  the nation\u2019s ports and waterways from terrorist attacks by requiring a wide  range of security improvements. Among the requirements included in  MTSA were (1) conducting vulnerability assessments for port facilities and  vessels; (2) developing security plans to mitigate identified risks for the  national maritime system, ports, port facilities, and vessels; and (3)  establishing a process to assess foreign ports from which vessels depart  on voyages to the United States. The Security and Accountability For  Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006 later directed the Secretary of Homeland  Security to, among other things, increase the security of container cargo  bound for the United States by requiring CBP to establish a pilot program  to test the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound containers at  foreign ports. Further, in August 2007, the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act were enacted and provide,  among other things, that by July 2012, a container loaded on a vessel in a  foreign port shall not enter the United States unless that container is  scanned before it is loaded onto the vessel.", "My statement today is based on related GAO reports and testimonies  issued from December 2005 through June 2010 addressing risk  management and port security, and also includes selected updates\u2014 conducted in July 2010\u2014to the information provided in these products  and on the actions agencies have taken to address recommendations made  in these products that are also discussed in this statement. These products  include our assessment of the progress that DHS and its component  agencies have made to strengthen port security, the challenges that  remain, and recommendations for improvement. The details on the scope  and methodology for those reviews are available in our published  products. The selected updates include a review of (a) the Coast Guard\u2019s  and CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2011 congressional budget justification and (b)  CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2010 Report to Congress on supply chain security. In  particular, my statement addresses the extent to which DHS and its  component agencies have made progress and face challenges regarding (1)  strengthening risk management, (2) reducing the risk of small-vessel  threats, (3) implementing foreign port assessments, and (4) enhancing  supply chain security. We conducted this work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, DHS and its component agencies\u2014the Coast Guard and  CBP\u2014have taken various actions to implement port security legislation  and enhance port security. These efforts include (1) the Coast Guard\u2019s  development of a risk assessment model to help prioritize limited  resources; (2) DHS and the Coast Guard\u2019s development of a strategy and  programs to reduce the risks associated with small vessels, such as a  community outreach program, vessel tracking systems, and security  operations; (3) the Coast Guard\u2019s implementation of the International Port  Security Program to assess security measures in foreign ports; and (4)  CBP\u2019s efforts to scan U.S.-bound cargo containers. Although these  initiatives have helped to improve port security, challenges remain,  including resource constraints; the lack of technology to track and identify  small vessels; sovereignty concerns over the Coast\u2019s Guard\u2019s visits to  foreign ports; and a variety of political, logistical, and technological  barriers to scanning all cargo containers. We have made recommendations  to DHS in prior reports to help address these challenges, and DHS  generally concurred with our recommendations in these reports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Made Progress in Improving Its Risk Management", "paragraphs": ["In December 2005, we reported that risk management, a strategy for  helping policymakers make decisions about assessing risks, allocating  resources, and taking actions under conditions of uncertainty, had been  endorsed by Congress and the President as a way to strengthen the nation  against possible terrorist attacks against ports and other infrastructure.  Risk management has long been used in such areas as insurance and  finance, but at the time its application to domestic terrorism had no  precedent. We noted that unlike storms and accidents, terrorism involves  an adversary with deliberate intent to destroy, and the probabilities and  consequences of a terrorist act are poorly understood and difficult to  predict. The size and complexity of homeland security activities and the  number of organizations involved\u2014both public and private\u2014add another  degree of difficulty to the task.", "We have examined Coast Guard efforts to implement risk management for  a number of years, noting how the Coast Guard\u2019s risk management  framework developed and evolved. In 2005 we reported that of the three  components GAO reviewed\u2014the Coast Guard, the Office for Domestic  Preparedness (this office\u2019s function is now within the Federal Emergency  Management Agency), and the Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection Directorate (now the National Protection and Programs  Directorate)\u2014the Coast Guard had made the most progress in establishing  a foundation for using a risk management approach. While the Coast  Guard had made progress in all five risk management phases, its greatest  progress had been made in conducting risk assessments\u2014that is,  evaluating individual threats, the degree of vulnerability in maritime  facilities, and the consequences of a successful attack. However, we  reported that those assessments were limited because they could not  compare and prioritize relative risks of various infrastructures across  ports. At the time the Coast Guard had actions under way to address the  challenges it faced in each risk management phase and we did not make  recommendations in those areas where the Coast Guard had actions well  under way. Several of these actions were based, in part, on briefings GAO  held with agency officials. Our recommendations were designed to  spotlight those areas in which additional steps were most needed to  implement a risk management approach to Coast Guard port security  activities. We recommended that the Coast Guard take action to:  establish a stronger linkage between local and national risk  assessment efforts\u2014an action that could involve, for example,  strengthening the ties between local assessment efforts, such as area  maritime security plans, and national risk assessment activities; and ensure that procedures for evaluating alternatives and making  management decisions consider the most efficient use of resources\u2014 actions that could entail, for example, refining the degree to which risk  management information is integrated into the annual cycle of  program and budget review.", "Since we made those recommendations, both DHS and the Coast Guard  have made progress implementing a risk management approach toward  critical infrastructure protection. In 2006, DHS issued the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which is DHS\u2019s base plan that  guides how DHS and other relevant stakeholders should use risk  management principles to prioritize protection activities within and across  each critical infrastructure sector in an integrated and coordinated  fashion. In 2009, DHS updated the NIPP to, among other things, increase  its emphasis on risk management, including an expanded discussion of  risk management methodologies and discussion of a common risk  assessment approach that provided core criteria for these analyses. For  its part, the Coast Guard has made progress assessing risks and integrating  the results of its risk management efforts into resource allocation  decisions. Regarding risk assessments, the Coast Guard transitioned its  risk assessment model from the Port Security Risk Assessment Tool (PS- RAT) to the Maritime Security Risk Assessment Model (MSRAM). In 2005  we reported that the PS-RAT was designed to allow ports to prioritize  resource allocations within, not between, ports to address risk most  efficiently. However, the new MSRAM can assess risk across ports and is  used by every Coast Guard unit and assesses the risk\u2014threats,  vulnerabilities, and consequences\u2014of a terrorist attack based on different  scenarios; that is, it combines potential targets with different means of  attack, as recommended by the NIPP. The Coast Guard uses the model to  help implement its strategy and concentrate maritime security activities  when and where relative risk is believed to be the greatest. According to  the Coast Guard, the model\u2019s underlying methodology is designed to  capture the security risk facing different types of targets, allowing  comparison between different targets and geographic areas at the local,  regional, and national levels. We have also reported that the Federal  Emergency Management Agency has included MSRAM results in its Port  Security Grant Program guidelines as one of the data elements included in  determining grant awards to assist in directing grants to the ports of  greatest concern or at highest risk.", "With regard to the integration of risk management results into the  consideration of risk mitigation alternatives and the management selection  process, Coast Guard officials stated that the Coast Guard uses MSRAM to  inform allocation decisions, such as the deployment of local resources and  grants. We have also reported that at the national level, the Coast Guard  uses MSRAM results for (1) long-term strategic resource planning, (2)  identifying capabilities needed to combat future terrorist threats, and (3)  identifying the highest-risk scenarios and targets in the maritime domain.  For example, Coast Guard officials reported that results are used to refine  the Coast Guard\u2019s requirements for the number of required vessel escorts  and patrols of port facilities. At the local level, the Captain of the Port  can use MSRAM as a tactical planning tool. The model can help identify  the highest risk scenarios, allowing the Captain of the Port to prioritize  needs and better deploy security assets. The 2011 Congressional Budget  Justification showed that the Coast Guard uses risk or relative risk to  direct resources to the mitigation of the highest risk. For example, the use  of risk management in the allocation of resources that is specific to port  security concerns the Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security program.  This program has a performance goal to manage terror-related risk in the  U.S. Maritime Domain to an acceptable level. The Coast Guard uses a  program measure to direct resources to the programs that reduce risk the  most based on the amount invested. Based on the development of the  MSRAM assessment process and the use of risk management analysis  results in its allocation of resources, we believe that the Coast Guard has  addressed the recommendations discussed earlier concerning risk  management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and the Coast Guard Have Taken Several Actions to Address the Small- Vessel Threat but Challenges Remain in Mitigating the Risk", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, we reported that concerns had arisen about the security  risks posed by small vessels. In its April 2008 Small Vessel Security  Strategy, DHS identified the four gravest risk scenarios involving the use  of small vessels for terrorist attacks, which include the use of a small  vessel as (1) a waterborne improvised explosive device, (2) a means of  smuggling weapons into the United States, (3) a means of smuggling  humans into the United States, and (4) a platform for conducting a stand- off attack\u2014an attack that uses a rocket or other weapon launched at a  sufficient distance to allow the attackers to evade defensive fire.  According to the former Commandant of the Coast Guard, small vessels  pose a greater threat than shipping containers for nuclear smuggling.  Some of these risks have been shown to be real through attacks conducted  outside U.S. waters, but\u2014as we reported in December 2009\u2014no small- vessel attacks have taken place in the United States. Many vessels  frequently travel among small vessels that operate with little scrutiny or  notice, and some have suffered waterborne attacks overseas by terrorist  or pirates who operated from small vessels. For example, at least three  cruise ships have been attacked by pirates on small boats while armed  with automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades, although the  three vessels were able to evade the pirates by either maneuvering or  fighting back. Oil tankers have also been attacked. For example, in  October 2002, a small vessel filled with explosives rammed the side of an  oil tanker off the coast of Yemen. The concern about small-vessel attacks  is exacerbated by the fact that some vessels, such as cruise ships, sail  according to precise schedules and preplanned itineraries that could  provide valuable information to terrorists in preparing for and carrying out  an attack against a vessel.", "DHS and the Coast Guard have developed a strategy and programs to  reduce the risks associated with small vessels; however, they face ongoing  challenges related to some of these efforts. The following discusses some  of our key findings with regard to reducing the risks associated with small  vessels.", "Small Vessel Security Strategy. DHS released its Small Vessel Security  Strategy in April 2008 as part of its effort to mitigate the vulnerability of  vessels to waterside attacks from small vessels, and the implementation  plan for the strategy is under review. According to the strategy, its intent is  to reduce potential security and safety risks posed by small vessels  through operations that balance fundamental freedoms, adequate security,  and continued economic stability. After review by DHS, the Coast Guard,  and CBP, the draft implementation plan was forwarded to the Office of  Management and Budget in April 2010, but the release of the plan has not  been approved by the Office of Management and Budget.", "Community Outreach. Consistent with the Small Vessel Security  Strategy\u2019s goal to develop and leverage strong partnerships with the small- vessel community, the Coast Guard, as well as other agencies\u2014such as the  New Jersey State Police, have several outreach efforts to encourage the  boating community to share threat information; however, the Coast Guard  program faces resource limitations. For example, the Coast Guard\u2019s  program to conduct outreach to the boating community for their help in  detecting suspicious activity, America\u2019s Waterway Watch, lost the funding  it received through a Department of Defense readiness training program  for military reservists in fiscal year 2008. Now it must depend on the  activities of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, a voluntary organization, for most  of its outreach efforts. In addition to America\u2019s Waterway Watch, the  Coast Guard piloted a regional initiative\u2014Operation Focused Lens\u2014to  increase public awareness of suspicious activity in and around U.S. ports,  and direct additional resources toward gathering information about the  most likely points of origin for an attack, such as marinas, landings, and  boat ramps. According to Coast Guard officials, the agency views  Operation Focused Lens to be a best practice, and the agency is  considering plans to expand the program or integrate it into other existing  programs.", "Vessel Tracking. In December 2009, we reported that the Coast Guard  was implementing two major unclassified systems to track a broad  spectrum of vessels; however, these systems generally could not track  small vessels. The Coast Guard and other agencies have other technology  systems, though\u2014including cameras and radars\u2014that can track small  vessels within ports, but these systems were not installed at all ports or  did not always work in bad weather or at night. Even with systems in place  to track small vessels, there was widespread agreement among maritime  stakeholders that it is very difficult to detect threatening activity by small  vessels without prior knowledge of a planned attack.", "Nuclear Material Detection Efforts. DHS has developed and tested  equipment for detecting nuclear material on small vessels; however,  efforts to use this equipment in a port area have been limited to pilot  programs. DHS is currently conducting 3-year pilot programs to design,  field test, and evaluate equipment and is working with CBP, the Coast  Guard, state, local, tribal officials, and others as they develop procedures  for screening. These pilot programs are scheduled to end in 2010, when  DHS intends to decide the future path of screening of small vessels for  nuclear and radiological materials. According to DHS officials, initial  feedback from federal, state, and local officials involved in the pilot  programs has been positive. DHS hopes to sustain the capabilities created  through the pilot programs through federal grants to state and local  authorities through the port security grant program.", "Security Activities. The Coast Guard also conducts various activities to  provide waterside security including boarding vessels, escorting vessels  into ports, and enforcing fixed security zones, although they are not  always able to meet standards related to these activities. Through its  Operation Neptune Shield, the Coast Guard sets the standards for local  Coast Guard units to meet for some of these security activities. Although  the Coast Guard units may receive some assistance from other law  enforcement agencies in carrying out these security activities, Coast Guard  data indicates that some units are not able to meet these standards due to  resource constraints. However, the Coast Guard\u2019s guidance allows the  Captain of the Port the latitude to shift resources to other priorities when  deemed necessary, for example when resources are not available to fulfill  all missions simultaneously. The planned decommissioning of five  Maritime Safety and Security Teams\u2014a domestic force for mitigating and  responding to terrorist threats or incidents\u2014may continue to strain Coast  Guard resources in meeting security requirements. Although remaining  teams are to maintain readiness to respond to emerging events and are to  continue performing routine security activities, such as vessel escorts,  their ability to support local units in meeting operational activity goals  may be diminished."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has a Program in Place to Assess the Security of Foreign Ports, but Challenges Remain in Implementing the Program", "paragraphs": ["The security of domestic ports also depends upon security at foreign ports  where cargoes bound for the United States originate. To help secure the  overseas supply chain, MTSA required the Coast Guard to assess security  measures in foreign ports from which vessels depart on voyages to the  United States and, among other things, recommend steps necessary to  improve security measures in those ports. In response, the Coast Guard  established a program, called the International Port Security Program, in  April 2004. Under this program, the Coast Guard and host nations review  the implementation of security measures in the host nations\u2019 ports against  established security standards, such as the International Maritime  Organization\u2019s International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code.  Coast Guard teams have been established to conduct country visits,  discuss security measures implemented, and collect and share best  practices to help ensure a comprehensive and consistent approach to  maritime security in ports worldwide. Subsequently, in October 2006, the  SAFE Port Act required the Coast Guard to reassess security measures at  such foreign ports at least once every 3 years.", "As we reported in October 2007, Coast Guard officials told us that  challenges exist in implementing the International Port Security  Program. Reluctance by some countries to allow the Coast Guard to visit  their ports due to concerns over sovereignty was a challenge cited by program officials in completing their first round of port visits. According  to these officials, before permitting Coast Guard officials to visit their  ports, some countries insisted on visiting and assessing a sample of U.S.  ports. The Coast Guard was able to accommodate their request through  the program\u2019s reciprocal visit feature in which the Coast Guard hosts  foreign delegations to visit U.S. ports and observe ISPS Code  implementation in the United States. This subsequently helped gain the  cooperation of the countries in hosting a Coast Guard visit to their own  ports. However, as Coast Guard program officials stated, sovereignty  concerns may still be an issue, as some countries may be reluctant t a comprehensive country visit on a recurring basis because they believe  the frequency is too high.", "Another challenge program officials cited is having limited ability to help  countries build on or enhance their capacity to implement the ISPS Code  requirements. Program officials stated that while their visits provide  opportunities for them to identify potential areas to improve or help  sustain the security measures put in place, other than sharing best  practices or providing presentations on security practices, the program  does not currently have the resources to directly assist countries,  particularly those that are poor, with more in-depth training or technical  assistance. To overcome this, program officials have worked with other  agencies (e.g., the Departments of Defense and State) and international  organizations (e.g., the Organization of American States) to secure funding  for training and assistance to countries where port security conferences  have been held (e.g., the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Established a Program to Scan U.S.-Bound Cargo Containers, but Challenges to Expanding the Program Remain", "paragraphs": ["Another key concern in maritime security is the effort to secure the supply  chain to prevent terrorists from shipping weapons of mass destruction  (WMD) in one of the millions of cargo containers that arrive at U.S. ports  each year. CBP has developed a layered security strategy to mitigate the  risk of an attack using cargo containers. CBP\u2019s strategy is based on a  layered approach of related programs that attempt to focus resources on  potentially risky cargo shipped in containers while allowing other cargo  containers to proceed without unduly disrupting commerce into the  United States. The strategy is based on obtaining advanced cargo  information to identify high-risk containers, utilizing technology to  examine the content of containers, and partnerships with foreign  governments and the trade industry. One of the programs in this layered  security strategy is the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI). In December 2006,  in response to SAFE Port Act requirements, DHS, and the Department of  Energy (DOE) jointly announced the formation of the SFI pilot program to  test the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound container cargo  at three foreign ports (Puerto Cortes, Honduras; Qasim, Pakistan; and  Southampton, United Kingdom). According to CBP officials, while  initiating the SFI program at these ports satisfied the SAFE Port Act  requirement, CBP also selected the ports of Busan, South Korea; Hong  Kong; Salalah, Oman; and Singapore to more fully demonstrate the  capability of the integrated scanning system at larger, more complex ports.  As of April 2010, SFI has been operational at five of these seven seaports.", "In October 2009, we reported that CBP has made some progress in  working with the SFI ports to scan U.S.-bound cargo containers; but  because of challenges to expanding scanning operations, the feasibility of  scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers at over 600 foreign  seaports remains largely unproven. CBP and DOE have been successful  in integrating images of scanned containers onto a single computer screen  that can be reviewed remotely from the United States. They have also been  able to use these initial ports as a test bed for new applications of existing  technology, such as mobile radiation scanners. However, the SFI ports\u2019  level of participation, in some cases, has been limited in terms of duration  (e.g., the Port of Hong Kong participated in the program for approximately  16 months) or scope (e.g., the Port of Busan, Korea, allowed scanning in  one of its eight terminals). In addition, the Port of Singapore withdrew its  agreement to participate in the SFI program and, as of April 2010, the Port  of Oman had not begun scanning operations. Furthermore, since the  inception of the SFI program in October 2007, no participating port has  been able to achieve 100 percent scanning. While 54 to 86 percent of the  U.S.-bound cargo containers were scanned at three comparatively low- volume ports that are responsible for less than 3 percent of container  shipments to the United States, sustained scanning rates above 5 percent  have not been achieved at two comparatively larger ports\u2014the type of  ports that ship most containers to the United States. Scanning operations  at the SFI ports have encountered a number of challenges\u2014including  safety concerns, logistical problems with containers transferred from rail  or other vessels, scanning equipment breakdowns, and poor-quality scan  images. Both we and CBP had previously identified many of these  challenges, and CBP officials are concerned that they and the participating  ports cannot overcome them. In October 2009, we recommended that  DHS conduct a feasibility analysis of implementing the 100 percent  scanning requirement in light of the challenges faced. DHS concurred  with our recommendation.", "CBP and DOE spent approximately $100 million through June 2009 on  implementing and operating the SFI program, but CBP has not developed  a comprehensive estimate for future U.S. program costs, or conducted a  cost-benefit analysis that compares the costs and benefits of the 100  percent scanning requirement with other alternatives. The SAFE Port Act  requires CBP to report on costs for implementing the SFI program at  foreign ports, but CBP has not yet estimated total U.S. program costs  because of both the lack of a decision by DHS on a clear path forward and  the unique set of challenges that each foreign port presents. While  uncertainties exist regarding a path forward for the program, a credible  cost estimate consistent with cost estimating best practices could better  aid DHS and CBP in determining the most effective way forward for SFI  and communicating the magnitude of the costs to Congress for use in  annual appropriations. To address this, in October 2009, we recommended  that CBP develop comprehensive and credible estimates of total U.S.  program costs. DHS concurred with our recommendation.", "CBP and DOE have paid the majority of SFI costs for operating the SFI  program. The SAFE Port and 9/11 Commission Acts do not address the  issue of who is expected to pay the cost of developing, maintaining, and  using the infrastructure, equipment, and people needed for the 100 percent  scanning requirement, but implementing the requirement would entail  costs beyond U.S. government program costs, including those incurred by  foreign governments and private terminal operators, and could result in  higher prices for American consumers. CBP has not estimated these  additional economic costs, though they are relevant in assessing the  balance between improving security and maintaining trade capacity and  the flow of cargo. To address this, in October 2009, we recommended that  DHS conduct a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the costs and benefits of  achieving 100 percent scanning as well as other alternatives for enhancing  container security. Such an analysis could provide important information  to CBP and to Congress to determine the most effective way forward to  enhance container security. DHS agreed in part with our recommendation  that it develop a cost-benefit analysis of 100 percent scanning,  acknowledging that the recommended analyses would better inform  Congress, but stated the recommendations should be directed to the  Congressional Budget Office. While the Congressional Budget Office does  prepare cost estimates for pending legislation, we think the  recommendation is appropriately directed to CBP. Given its daily  interaction with foreign customs services and its direct knowledge of port  operations, CBP is in a better position to conduct any cost-benefit analysis  and bring results to Congress for consideration.", "Senior DHS and CBP officials acknowledge that most, if not all foreign  ports, will not be able to meet the July 2012 target date for scanning all  U.S.-bound cargo. Recognizing the challenges to meeting the legislative  requirement, DHS expects to grant a blanket extension to all foreign ports  pursuant to the statue, thus extending the target date for compliance with  this requirement by 2 years, to July 2014. In addition, the Secretary of  Homeland Security approved the \u201cstrategic trade corridor strategy,\u201d an  initiative to scan 100 percent of U.S.-bound containers at selected foreign  ports where CBP believes it will mitigate the greatest risk of WMD  entering the United States. According to CBP, the data gathered from SFI  operations will help to inform future deployments to strategic locations.  CBP plans to evaluate the usefulness of these deployments and consider  whether the continuation of scanning operations adds value in each of  these locations, and potential additional locations that would strategically  enhance CBP efforts. While the strategic trade corridor strategy may  improve container security, it does not achieve the legislative requirement  to scan 100 percent of U.S.-bound containers. According to CBP, it does  not have a plan for full-scale implementation of the statutory requirement  by July 2012 because challenges encountered thus far in implementing the  SFI program indicate that implementation of 100 percent scanning  worldwide by the 2012 deadline will be difficult to achieve. However, CBP  has not performed a feasibility analysis of expanding 100 percent  scanning, as required by the SAFE Port Act. To address this, in October  2009, we recommended that CBP conduct a feasibility analysis of  implementing 100 percent scanning and provide the results, as well as  alternatives to Congress, in order to determine the best path forward to  strengthen container security.
