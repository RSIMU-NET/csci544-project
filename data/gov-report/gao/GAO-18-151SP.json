The economic analyses that GAO reviews may  have been performed to meet requirements described in Executive Order  or related statutes, to propose or support an action, or to examine an  action that has already been taken. The purpose of this report is to inform  the public about the methodology that GAO may use to assess these  economic analyses.", "We prepared this report under the authority of the Comptroller General to  answer the question: What are key methodological elements of an  economic analysis that is intended to inform decision-makers and  stakeholders? We answered this question by reviewing economic  elements and concepts that serve as the basis for sound economic  analysis. We considered a wide range of economics documents prepared  by various government agencies and institutions on how economic  analysis should be performed. These documents included, among others,  Circulars released by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and  handbooks for economic analysis from federal and international agencies,  such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department  of Defense, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Organization for  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and HM Treasury  Government of the United Kingdom. In addition, we consulted with  experts on economic analysis of public actions. We synthesized  economic concepts embodied in these documents into the present report  for use by GAO in assessing economic analyses.", "GAO\u2019s commitment to informative and transparent economic analysis is  in line with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidelines on  achieving a high degree of transparency in data and methods in scientific  information.  An important benefit of transparency is that the public can  assess the structure of an analysis and, in particular, how much of an  analytic result hinges on the specific choices made by the authors. This  transparency indicates the solidity of the analytic choices. For example, it  allows the implication of these choices, related risks, and uncertainties to  be readily assessed. This type of sensitivity analysis is regarded as an  essential feature of high-quality analysis, and it cannot be undertaken  without a high degree of transparency.", "The key methodological elements we identify in this report are not  intended to be exhaustive and to supplant or alter relevant federal and  agency requirements for economic analysis. They simply serve to  establish a sound baseline framework for the assessment of an economic  analysis.

Economic effects (hereafter also  called \u201ceffects\u201d) commonly include costs, benefits, and/or economic  transfers (for example, transfer payments). Action is defined to include a  government law, rule, regulation, project, policy, or program. An action  may be examined in the context of legislation, regulation, advocacy,  agency operations, or in response to certain events (such as a natural  disaster, for example). An economic analysis may be prospective,  examining an action that could be taken, or retrospective, examining the  outcome of an action that has already been taken. Examples of economic  analyses include:   1.  An economic analysis of the costs of a government program, project,  2.  An economic analysis of the benefits and costs of a government rule  3.  An economic analysis of the impact of a proposed or existing  regulation on regulated entities and consumers.  4.

That is, an analysis is performed to address an objective; the  analysis is scoped to address that objective; the analysis adopts a  methodology, which is used to analyze the economic effects of interest;  and the analysis is transparent and properly documented. The emphasis  on transparency is consistent with the final implementation guidelines of  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). \u201cThe primary benefit of public transparency is not necessarily that errors in analytic results  will be detected, although error correction is clearly valuable. The more important benefit  of transparency is that the public will be able to assess how much of an agency\u2019s analytic  result hinges on the specific analytic choices made by the agency.\u201d", "Having identified key elements to the structure of an economic analysis  we synthetized for each key element, economic concepts embodied in the  literature that we reviewed. For example, what might we be assessing  under the key element: Objective and Scope? We considered economic  concepts commonly identified across the documents we reviewed, and  incorporated feedback from the experts and agencies with whom  we  consulted. The documents that we reviewed included, among others,  Circulars A-94 and A-4 released by OMB, handbooks for economic  analysis from federal and international agencies, such as the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Defense, the  U.S. Department of Transportation, the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), and the United Kingdom\u2019s HM  Treasury.", "These documents generally outline a methodical structure to an economic  analysis. This methodical structure takes the form of a set of issues or  sequence of steps to address while conducting the analysis. These  issues or steps, in turn, embody economic concepts. For the purpose of  developing our assessment methodology, we synthetized and  categorized these economic concepts with the key elements that we  identified\u2014as listed below. The concepts for each listed key element are  not intended to be exhaustive and do not supplant or alter existing  requirements for economic analysis. Depending on the context in which  an action is examined, GAO\u2019s assessment of a key element could  exclude some concepts, or extend beyond the concepts listed for that  element. In such cases, GAO\u2019s written assessment of the relevant key  element will specify the concepts that were actually considered in the  review process.", "The five key elements and economic concepts in GAO\u2019s assessment  methodology for an economic analysis are:  1.  Key Element: Objective and Scope\u2014the objective and scope of the  analysis.", "The economic analysis explains the action examined and includes a  rationale and justification for the action. The analysis states its  objective. The scope of the analysis is designed to address this  objective. Unless otherwise justified, the analysis focuses on  economic effects that accrue to citizens and residents of the United  States, and its time horizon is long enough to encompass the  important economic effects of the action.  2.  Key Element: Methodology\u2014the methodology used to examine the  economic effects.", "The economic analysis examines the effects of the action by  comparing alternatives, using one of them as the baseline. Unless  otherwise justified, it considers alternatives that represent all relevant  alternatives, including that of no action. The analysis defines an  appropriate baseline. The analysis justifies that the world specified  under each alternative considered (including the baseline) represents  the best assessment of what the world would be like under that  alternative. The analysis identifies the important economic effects for  each alternative considered, their timing, and whether they are direct  or ancillary effects.  3.  Key Element: Analysis of Effects\u2014the analysis of economic effects.", "Where feasible, the economic analysis quantifies the important  economic effects and monetizes them using the concept of  opportunity cost. The analysis applies the criterion of net present  value, or related outcome measures, to compare these effects across  alternatives. It controls for inflation and uses economically justified  discount rates. Where important economic effects cannot be  quantified, the analysis explains how they affect the comparison of  alternatives. Where the equity and distributional impacts are  important, the full range of these impacts is separately detailed and  quantified, where feasible.  4.  Key Element: Transparency\u2014the transparency of the analysis of  economic effects.", "The economic analysis describes and justifies the analytical choices,  assumptions, and data used. The analysis assesses how plausible  adjustments to each important analytical choice and assumption affect  the estimates of the economic effects and the results of the  comparison of alternatives. The analysis explains the implications of  the key limitations in the data used. Where feasible, the analysis  adequately quantifies how the statistical variability of the key data  elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts  these estimates, and the results of the comparison of alternatives.  5.  Key Element: Documentation\u2014the documentation included in the  analysis.", "The economic analysis is clearly written, with a plain language  summary, clearly labeled tables that describe the data used and  results, and a conclusion that is consistent with these results. The  analysis cites all sources used and documents that it is based on the  best available economic information. The analysis documents that it  complies with a robust quality assurance process and, where  applicable, the Information Quality Act.  The analysis discloses the  use and contributions of contractors and outside consultants.", "In summary, GAO identifies five key elements, with associated economic  concepts, to the structure of an economic analysis.

The written assessment details  the extent to which the analysis considered and properly dealt with the  element. To the extent that important limitations are identified in the  review, the written assessment describes these limitations. This written  assessment informs the assessment score, which is one of three mutually  exclusive scores:  1.  fully met\u2014that is, the economic analysis has considered and properly  dealt with the element;  2.  partly met\u2014that is, the economic analysis has only partly considered  and properly dealt with the element;   3.  not met\u2014that is, the economic analysis has not considered or not  properly dealt with the element.", "If the outcome is \u201cpartly met\u201d or \u201cnot met,\u201d the written assessment should  describe the limitations of the analysis.", "Assessments are made from expertise in economics and with  professional judgment.

The analysis informs, with caveats, decision-makers and stakeholders  about the economic effects of the action examined.

The analysis needs additional work to inform decision-makers and  stakeholders about the economic effects of the action examined.

This  determination is neither an endorsement of the specific findings and  conclusions of the analysis, nor is it a determination that these are  correct. For example, a prospective analysis is predictive of a potential  result, but cannot definitively determine the result. It is a determination  that the analysis is adequately and properly designed, and accordingly, it  can inform the public discourse about the economic effects of the action  examined.", "The written statements added to outcomes 2\u20134 should refer to the review  of the individual elements.
