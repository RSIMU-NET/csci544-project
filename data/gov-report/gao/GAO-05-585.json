However, in light of governmentwide fiscal challenges, the agencies have opportunities to enhance some of their succession efforts. While all of the agencies have assigned responsibility for their succession planning and management efforts to councils or boards, VHA has established a subcommittee and high-level positions that are directly responsible for its succession efforts. Also, VHA and the Census Bureau specifically mention succession planning and management as performance expectations in their executives' performance plans. The four agencies have begun to link succession efforts to strategic planning. For example, DOL plans to shift from a historical enforcement role to a compliance assistance and consulting role, requiring stronger skills in communication and analysis. To attract and retain employees with such skills, DOL launched the Masters in Business Administration Fellows program in 2002, which it considers one of its major succession training and development programs. Monitoring mission-critical workforce needs helps make informed planning decisions. DOL, EPA, and VHA have identified gaps in occupations or competencies, have undertaken strategies to address these gaps, and are planning or are taking steps to monitor their progress in closing these gaps. The Census Bureau could strengthen the monitoring of its mission-critical occupations more closely and at a higher level to ensure it is prepared for the 2010 Decennial Census. Effective training and development programs can enhance the federal government's ability to achieve results. All of the agencies' succession efforts include training and development programs at all organizational levels. However, in the current budget environment, there are opportunities to coordinate and share these programs and create synergies through benchmarking with others, achieving economies of scale, limiting duplication of efforts, and enhancing the effectiveness of programs, among other things. Performance measures for these programs can also help agencies evaluate these programs' effects on organizational capacity and justify their value. Finally, agencies have recognized the importance of diversity to a successful workforce and use succession planning and management to enhance their workforce diversity."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Large, escalating, and persistent deficits that are unsustainable over the  long term are among an array of challenges that the federal government  confronts in the 21st century.

More specifically, agencies need to identify,  develop, and select the appropriate leaders, managers, and workforce to  meet 21st century challenges, and one critical step is through effective  succession planning and management. Leading organizations go beyond a  succession planning approach that focuses on simply replacing individuals  and engage in broad, integrated succession planning and management  efforts that focus on strengthening both current and future organizational  capacity.

OPM expects the 14-month program to  help agencies meet their SES succession planning goals and contribute to  the government\u2019s efforts to create a high-quality SES leadership corps.  Participating agencies may select, without further competition, people who  have successfully completed the Fed CDP training program. In addition, we  have testified that approaches to interagency collaboration, such as the  CHCO Council, have emerged as an important central leadership strategy and that agency collaboration can serve to institutionalize many  management policies governmentwide. The Leadership and Succession  Planning Subcommittee of the CHCO Council is charged with reviewing  leadership development, among other things, and is a possible mechanism  to help agencies coordinate succession training and development  programs.", "While some agencies\u2019 human capital officials acknowledged the potential  benefits of coordinating succession training and development programs  with other agencies or departments, they all could do more to seek  coordination and sharing opportunities. Cognizant human capital and  training officials stated that they had not actively sought opportunities to  coordinate core succession training and development programs. Although  EPA plans to select one senior executive through the Fed CDP, human  capital officials stated they had not extensively explored the idea of  coordinating with other agencies for their core succession training and  development. VHA human capital officials said they did not coordinate  further because they have specialized skill needs. DOL and Census Bureau  human capital managers also stated that they had not partnered with other  outside agencies to coordinate their core succession training and  development programs. By not actively seeking to coordinate and share  core succession training and development programs, agencies may miss a  potentially valuable opportunity to gain efficiency, which may be especially  important in the current budget environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures Can Help Agencies Assess Programs\u2019 Effects on Organizational Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Decision makers need credible information to justify training and  development programs\u2019 value.

Moreover, our guide states that such measures  should go beyond input and output data, and can include data on quality,  costs, and time. We also recognize, however, that agencies need to scale  their efforts depending on the program. Factors to consider when deciding  on the appropriate level of evaluation include the estimated costs of  training efforts, size of training audience, and program visibility, among  other things.", "All four agencies are able to report on participation and cost related to their  succession training and development programs. For example, 12 Census  Bureau employees participated in DOC\u2019s Aspiring Leaders Development  Program in FY 2004, with an average cost of $6,267 per participant,  according to the Bureau. In addition, the Census Bureau and DOL have also  identified outcome measures related to the performance of some of their  succession-related training and development programs. For example, the  Census Bureau evaluates, among other things, the extent to which certified  project managers are using the skills they have learned in the Project  Management Masters Certificate Program. Only DOL has identified  measures intended to provide an understanding of core succession training  and development programs\u2019 effects on organizational capacity. Figure 5  illustrates a selection of these measures.", "For example, by considering the retention rate for MBA Fellows, DOL can  make informed planning decisions about the potential availability of  certain skill sets in the department as well as when to initiate a new  program and how many students to include in it. DOL reported that in  FY 2004, it retained 89 percent of its MBA fellows after 2 years and has a  goal of 75 percent after 3 years. DOL also tracks SES \u201cbench strength,\u201d a  ratio of senior executives who are in training or have completed training to  those projected to leave. DOL reported a 96 percent \u201cbench strength\u201d for its  senior executives in FY 2004, exceeding its goal of 70 percent.

All of the selected agencies have recognized the  importance of diversity to a successful workforce and use succession  planning and management efforts to enhance their workforce diversity.", "VA requires all of its administrative staff offices to produce workforce and  succession plans aligned with overall VA strategic planning. VHA states  that although its overall workforce is fairly diverse, women and minorities  are not well represented in leadership positions nor are they well  represented in the pipeline to such positions. We have reported that VHA  has integrated diversity planning into its succession efforts. As part of  their regional succession plans, VISNs submit diversity information to VHA  for national planning. VHA then analyzes the diversity of its top-priority  occupations, highlights underrepresentation of certain demographic  groups in specific mission-critical occupations, and provides guidance to  focus recruiting efforts to enhance diversity. For example, VHA states that  White females and American Indian/Alaskan Native females are  underrepresented in the nurse occupation and advises that recruitment  efforts should focus on them. In addition, VHA tracks applicant diversity  for the Executive Career Field Candidate Development Program, one of VHA\u2019s core succession training and development programs, and reports  that applicants to this program are drawn from a diverse pool.", "EPA has stated in its human capital plan that a diverse workforce makes  the agency a more effective and healthy organization that is better able to  relate to the American people and develop more creative and workable  solutions. EPA credits its Intern Program, one of its core succession  training and development programs, with attracting and retaining a diverse  group of employees based on a 2003 assessment of the program. For  example, the assessment found that EPA interns were more ethnically  diverse than other comparable groups of hires. As part of its diversity  action plan, EPA reports that it is expanding targeted recruitment  initiatives to identify well-qualified candidates for mission-critical  occupations.

In  addition, DOL has reported a higher percentage of women and Hispanics in  its three core succession training and development programs than in its  general workforce.", "The Census Bureau has established a diversity program office to manage  the Bureau\u2019s diversity efforts. Bureau officials stated that because of the  highly specialized nature of the Bureau\u2019s work, such as the use of statistics  and mathematics, and the relatively small pool of people trained in these  areas, it is difficult to enhance diversity in several critical occupation  categories. As part of its combined diversity and recruiting initiative, the  Bureau has established a specific recruiting team for mathematical  statisticians, one of its highlighted mission-critical occupations.

Nevertheless, given the  nation\u2019s large current budget deficit and long-range fiscal imbalance,  Congress is likely to place increasing emphasis on agencies to exercise  fiscal restraint.", "Given this environment, these agencies can look for opportunities to  coordinate and share their succession training and development programs  to achieve economies of scale, limit duplication of efforts, increase  efficiency, and enhance the effectiveness of their programs. For example,  all four agencies emphasize rotational or developmental assignments and  formal training, and they may have opportunities to coordinate and share  these assignments and training with each other or other federal agencies or  departments. Agencies can also work with OPM and the CHCO Council to  determine how they can better leverage other agencies\u2019 succession training  and development programs.", "Furthermore, it is increasingly important for agencies to evaluate their  training and development programs to be able to demonstrate how these  efforts enhance organizational capacity.

By not strengthening the  monitoring of its mission-critical workforce, the Census is at increased risk  that it will not have the skills it needs to be prepared to conduct the 2010  Census as efficiently or effectively as possible. For example, a lesson from  the 2000 Census was that while contracts for various projects supported  decennial census operations, they did so in many instances at a higher cost  than necessary because the Census Bureau did not have sufficient  contracting and program staff with the training and experience to manage  them.
