GAO was asked to assess the progress of federal efforts to harmonize policies and guidance for these two types of systems. To do this, GAO reviewed program plans and schedules, analyzed policies and guidance, assessed program efforts against key practices for cross-agency collaboration, and interviewed officials responsible for this effort."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have made progress in harmonizing information security policies and guidance for national security and non-national security systems. Representatives from civilian, defense, and intelligence agencies established a joint task force in 2009, led by NIST and including senior leadership and subject matter experts from participating agencies, to publish common guidance for information systems security for national security and non-national security systems. The harmonized guidance is to consist of NIST guidance applicable to non-national security systems and authorized by CNSS, with possible modifications, for application to national security systems. This harmonized security guidance is expected to result in less duplication of effort and more effective implementation of controls across multiple interconnected systems. The task force has developed three initial publications. These publications, among other things, provide guidance for applying a risk management framework to federal systems, identify an updated catalog of security controls and guidelines, and update the existing security assessment guidelines for federal systems. CNSS has issued an instruction to begin implementing the newly developed guidance for national security systems. Two additional joint publications are scheduled for release by early 2011, with other publications under consideration. Differences remain between guidance for national security and non-national security systems in such areas as system categorization, selection of security controls, and program management controls. NIST and CNSS officials stated that these differences may be addressed in the future but that some may remain because of the special nature of national security systems. While progress has been made in developing the harmonized guidance, additional work remains to implement it and ensure continued progress. For example, task force members have stated their intent to develop plans for future harmonization activities, but these plans have not yet been finalized. In addition, while much of the harmonized guidance incorporates controls and language previously developed for use for non-national security systems, significant work remains to implement the guidance for national security systems. DOD and the intelligence community are developing agency-specific guidance and transition plans for implementing the harmonized guidance, but, according to officials, actual implementation could take several years to complete. Officials stated that this is primarily due to both the large number and criticality of the systems that must be reauthorized under the new guidance. Further, the agencies have yet to fully establish implementation milestones and lack performance metrics for measuring progress. Finally, the harmonization effort has been managed without full implementation of key collaborative practices, such as documenting identified needs and leveraging resources to address those needs, agreed-to agency roles and responsibilities, and processes to monitor and report results. Task force members stress that their informal, flexible approach has resulted in significant success. Nevertheless, further implementation of key collaborative practices identified by GAO could facilitate further progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Defense, among other things, update plans for future collaboration, establish timelines for implementing revised guidance, and fully implement key practices for interagency collaboration in the harmonization effort.

Enacted into law on  December 17, 2002, as title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, FISMA  requires every federal agency, including agencies with national security  systems,  to develop, document, and implement an agencywide  information security program to secure the information and information  systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including  those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other  source. Specifically, this program is to include    periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could result  from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or  destruction of information or information systems; risk-based policies and procedures that cost-effectively reduce  information security risks to an acceptable level and ensure that  information security is addressed throughout the life cycle of each  information system;   periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices that include testing of management,  operational, and technical controls for every system identified in the  agency\u2019s required inventory of major information systems;    subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for  networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems;   security awareness training for agency personnel, including contractors  and other users of information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency;   a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information security  policies, procedures, and practices of the agency;    procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents;    plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for information  systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.", "FISMA also assigns specific information security responsibilities to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), NIST, agency heads, and agency  chief information officers (CIO). Generally, OMB is responsible for  developing policies and guidance and overseeing agency compliance with  FISMA, NIST is responsible for developing technical standards, and  agency heads and CIOs are responsible for ensuring that each agency  implements the information security program and other requirements of  FISMA.", "These responsibilities do not, however, apply equally to all agency  information systems. FISMA differs in its treatment of national security  and non-national security systems. While FISMA requires each federal  agency to manage its information security risks through its agencywide  information security program, the law recognizes a long-standing division  between requirements for national security and non-national security  systems that limits civilian management and oversight of information  systems supporting military and intelligence activities.", "FISMA recognizes the division between national security systems and non- national security systems in two ways. First, to ensure compliance with  applicable authorities, the law requires agencies using national security  systems to implement information security policies and practices as  required by standards and guidelines for national security systems in  addition to the requirements of FISMA. Second, the responsibilities  assigned by FISMA to OMB and NIST are curtailed. OMB\u2019s responsibilities  are reduced with regard to national security systems to oversight and  reporting to Congress on agency compliance with FISMA. OMB\u2019s annual  review and approval or disapproval of agency information security  programs, for example, does not include national security systems.  Similarly, according to FISMA, NIST-developed standards, which are  mandatory for non-national security systems, do not apply to national  security systems. FISMA limits NIST to developing, in conjunction with  DOD and the National Security Agency (NSA), guidelines for agencies on  identifying an information system as a national security system, and for  ensuring that NIST standards and guidelines are complementary with  standards and guidelines developed for national security systems. FISMA  also requires NIST to consult with other agencies to ensure use of  appropriate information security policies, procedures, and techniques in  order to improve information security and avoid unnecessary and costly  duplication of effort.", "In light of this division between national security and non-national security  systems, NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidance for  non-national security information systems. For example, NIST issues  mandatory Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and special  publications that provide guidance for information systems security for  non-national security systems in federal agencies.", "For national security systems, National Security Directive 42 established  CNSS, an organization chaired by the Department of Defense, to, among  other things, issue policy directives and instructions that provide  mandatory information security requirements for national security  systems.  In addition, the defense and intelligence communities develop  implementing instructions and may add additional requirements where  needed.", "FISMA provides a further exception to compliance with NIST standards. It  permits an agency to use more stringent information security standards if  it certifies that its standards are at least as stringent as the NIST standards  and are otherwise consistent with policies and guidelines issued under  FISMA. It is on the basis of this authority that the Department of Defense  establishes information security standards for all of its systems (national  security and non-national security systems) that are more stringent than  the standards required for protecting non-national security systems under  FISMA. For example, the DOD directive establishing the Department of  Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process  (DIACAP) for authorizing the operation of DOD information systems  requires annual certification that the DIACAP process is current and more  stringent than NIST standards under FISMA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NIST Guidance Provides Basic Framework for Security of Non-National Security Systems", "paragraphs": ["To help implement the provisions of FISMA for non-national security  systems, NIST has developed a risk management framework for agencies  to follow in developing information security programs.

This helps to ensure that appropriate security requirements  and security controls are applied to all non-national security systems.  Next, controls are implemented and information systems are authorized  using NIST SP 800-70.

Different methodologies are used to categorize the  impact level of the information contained in non-national security systems  and national security systems. For non-national security systems, SP 800- 53 applies the concept of a high-water mark for categorizing the impact  level of the system, as defined in FIPS 199. This means that the system is  categorized according to the worst-case potential impact of a loss of  confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information  system. For example, if loss of confidentiality was deemed to be high  impact, but loss of integrity and availability were deemed to be moderate  impact, the system would be considered a high-impact system.

CNSSI-1253 uses a more granular structure in which the potential  impact levels of loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability are  individually used to select categorizations. As a result, while FIPS 199 has  three impact levels (low, moderate, and high), CNSSI-1253 has 27 (all  possible combinations of low, moderate, and high for confidentiality,  integrity, and availability).", "According to an official at NIST, use of the high-water mark is easier for  civilian agencies to implement for non-national security systems, and  provides a more conservative approach by employing stronger controls by  default. According to CNSS, retaining the more granular impact levels  reduces the need for subsequent tailoring of controls. Officials involved in  the harmonization effort stated that while they may attempt to reconcile  the approaches in the future, there are no current plans to do so.", "Security control selection. In our analysis of NIST and CNSS security  control baselines for non-national security systems and national security  systems, we determined that the new national security system baselines  based on SP 800-53 incorporated almost all of the controls found in  comparable non-national security baselines, as well as additional security  controls and enhancements. For example, a high-impact system under  the non-national security system baseline includes 328 controls and  subcontrols. The equivalent baseline for a national security system  includes 397 controls and subcontrols, out of which 326 were shared  between the two baselines.

As a result, national security systems may require more protection  and thus more security controls than non-national security systems. Also,  according to CNSS officials, while security controls for non-national  security systems are often aimed at a broad IT environment, guidance for  national security systems is developed with added specificity and a focus  on vulnerabilities, threats, and countermeasures to protect classified  information.", "However, NIST officials noted some non-national security systems may  require levels of protection that are equal to the levels for national security  systems in order to counter cyber attacks. For example, certain high- impact non-national security systems may be supporting applications that  are part of critical infrastructure. Therefore, the mission criticality of some  non-national security systems may require the same control techniques  used by national security systems to counter cyber attacks.", "Program management controls.

DOD said it plans to address these  controls in upcoming revisions to its information security guidance.", "NIST and CNSS officials acknowledged that differences still exist in the  harmonized guidance, and stated that the harmonization process will take  time, and not all differences will be resolved during the initial  harmonization effort.

Additionally, she  stated that it is difficult to establish milestones and performance measures  because the security of a system cannot easily be quantified. However,  federal guidance and our prior work have emphasized the importance of  tools such as a schedule and means to track progress to the success of IT  efforts.
