Now, as air traffic returns to pre- 9/11 levels, concerns have again arisen as to how prepared FAA may be to meet increasing demands for capacity, safety, and efficiency. FAA's air traffic control (ATC) modernization efforts are designed to enhance the national airspace system through the acquisition of a vast network of radar, navigation, and communication systems. Nine years have passed since Congress provided FAA with personnel and acquisition reforms. However, projects continue to experience cost, schedule and performance problems. FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is its most current reform effort. Expectations are that the ATO will bring a performance management approach to ATC modernization. This statement focuses on three main questions: (1) What are some of the major challenges and demands that confront FAA?

The downturn in travel has affected the Airport and Airways Trust  Fund, from which FAA draws the majority of its budget. Transportation  tax receipts into the Trust Fund fell by a total of $2.0 billion (19.6 percent)  between 1999 and 2003. The overall condition of the Federal budget adds  more pressure on FAA\u2019s budget. Taken together, cost-cutting and cost- control need to be watchwords for FAA from this point forward. To meet  the demands of the aviation industry for safe, secure, and efficient  operations and for additional capacity to meet forecasted growth, FAA will  need to continue to improve its management controls.

FAA has taken steps to implement a number of  reforms in each of the three areas. For example, in the area of labor and  employee relations, FAA implemented initiatives establishing new  partnership forums for union and nonunion employees and a new model  work environment program.

Historically, some of the major factors impeding ATC  acquisitions included an ineffective budget process and an inability to  provide good cost and schedule estimates. A number of cultural problems  including widely diffused responsibility and accountability, inadequate  coordination, and poor contract management/oversight also slowed the  progress of individual projects. Problems within FAA\u2019s acquisition and  procurement processes included an inability to obligate and spend  appropriate funds in a timely manner, a complicated procurement and  acquisition cycle, failure to field systems in a timely fashion, and an  inability to field current technology systems. FAA lacked a means to  strategically analyze and control requirements, and good cost and  schedule estimates were often not effectively developed and integrated  into acquisition plans. To address many of these issues, Congress passed  legislation in 1995 exempting FAA from many of the existing Federal  personnel and procurement laws and regulations and directed the agency  to develop and implement new acquisition and personnel systems.

In response to these concerns, Congress granted FAA broad exemptions  from federal personnel laws and directed the agency to develop and  implement a new personnel management system.", "Human capital reforms: Following the human capital exemptions granted  by Congress in 1995, FAA initiated reforms in three primary areas:  compensation and performance management, workforce management,  and labor and employee relations. In the area of compensation and  performance management, FAA introduced two initiatives\u2014a new, more  flexible pay system in which compensation levels are set within broad  ranges, called pay bands, and a new performance management system  intended to improve employees\u2019 performance through more frequent  feedback with no summary rating. Both new systems required an  exemption from laws governing federal civilian personnel management  found in title 5 of the United States Code. In the area of workforce  management, FAA implemented a number of initiatives in 1996 through  the establishment of agency-wide flexibilities for hiring and training  employees. In the area of labor and employee relations, FAA established  partnership forums for union and nonunion employees and a new model  work environment program. Other human capital initiatives have included  restructuring FAA\u2019s organizational culture and implementing means to  provide sustained leadership.", "Organizational culture: FAA issued an organizational culture framework  in 1997 that attempted to address some of the vertical \u201cstovepipes\u201d that  conflicted with the horizontal structure of ATC acquisition team  operations. A key piece of this framework included the establishment of  integrated product teams in an attempt to improve collaboration among  technical experts and users. Moreover, integrated teams have not worked  as intended. For example, competing priorities between two key  organizations that were part of the Wide Area Augmentation System\u2019s  integrated team ultimately negated its effectiveness and undermined its  ability to meet the agency\u2019s goals for the system.", "Sustained leadership: Until former Administrator Garvey completed her 5- year term in 2002, FAA had been hampered by a lack of sustained  leadership at FAA was also problematic. During the first 10 years of the  ATC modernization effort, the agency had seven different Administrators  and Acting Administrators, whose average tenure was less than 2 years.  Such frequent turnover at the top contributed to an agency culture that  focused on short-term initiatives, avoided accountability, and resisted  fundamental improvements to the acquisition process. .", "Nine years have passed since the agency received broad exemptions from  laws governing federal civilian personnel management. While FAA has  taken a number of steps since personnel reforms were implemented, it is  not clear whether and to what extent these flexibilities have helped FAA  to more effectively manage its workforce and achieve its mission. The  agency did not initially define clear links between reform goals and  program goals, making it difficult to fully assess the impacts of personnel  reform. FAA has not yet fully implemented all of its human capital  initiatives and continues to face a number of key challenges with regard to  personnel issues. In our February 2003 report, we found that the agency  had not fully incorporated elements that are important to effective human  capital management into its overall reform effort, including data collection  and analysis and establishing concrete performance goals and measures.  Currently, the agency is still working to implement tools to keep accurate  cost and workforce data. The new Air Traffic Organization has announced  plans for establishing cost accounting and labor distribution systems, but  they are not yet in place. More comprehensive cost accounting systems  and improved labor distribution systems are necessary to maximize  workforce productivity and to plan for anticipated controller retirements.

Our work has shown  that high-performing organizations have adopted management controls,  processes, practices, and systems that are consistent with prevailing best  practices and contribute to concrete organizational results. Specifically,  the key characteristics and capabilities of high-performing organizations  fall into four themes as follows:    A clear, well-articulated, and compelling mission. High-performing  organizations have a clear, well-articulated, and compelling mission,  strategic goals to achieve it and a performance management system that  aligns with these goals to show employees how their performance can  contribute to overall organizational results. FAA has taken its first steps  toward creating a performance management system by aligning its goals  and budgetary resources through its Flight Plan\u2014blueprint for action for  fiscal year 2004 through 2008\u2014and its fiscal year 2005 budget submission.  In addition, the new ATO has published both its vision and mission  statement.", "Our past work has found that FAA\u2019s ability to acquire new ATC  modernization systems has been hampered by its organizational culture,  including employee behaviors that did not reflect a strong commitment to  mission focus. Given the central role that FAA\u2019s employees will play in  achieving these performance goals and overall agency results, it is critical  for them to both embrace and implement the agency\u2019s mission in the  course of their daily work. In addition, our work has found regularly  communicating a clear and consistent message about the importance of  fulfilling the organization\u2019s mission helps engage employees, clients,  customers, partners, and other stakeholders in achieving higher  performance.", "Strategic use of partnerships. Since the federal government is  increasingly reliant on partners to achieve its outcomes, becoming a high- performing organization requires that federal agencies effectively manage  relationships with other organizations outside of their direct control. FAA  is currently working to forge strategic partnerships with its external  customers in a number of ways. For example, the agency recently  announced a program to create \u201cexpress lanes in the sky\u201d to reduce air  traffic delays this spring and summer and is in the early stages of working  with selected federal partners to develop a long-term plan for the national  aerospace system (2025) and to leverage federal research funds to conduct  mutually beneficial research. In addition, FAA has ongoing partnerships  with the aviation community to assess and address flight safety issues  (e.g., development of technology to prevent fuel tank explosions and to  reduce the potential for aircraft wiring problems through development of a  \u201csmart circuit breaker\u201d).", "However, our past work has shown that forging strategic partnerships  with organizations outside of FAA can be difficult and time-consuming.  For example, FAA\u2019s efforts to establish voluntary data sharing agreements  with airlines\u2014Flight Operational Quality Assurance Program (FOQA)\u2014 spanned more than a decade, due in part, to tremendous resistance from  aviation community stakeholders who formed a rare alliance to oppose  several of FAA\u2019s proposals. In addition, when attempting to increase  airport capacity (e.g., new runways), FAA and airport operators have  frequently faced opposition from the residents of surrounding  communities and environmental groups. Residents are often concerned  about the potential for increases in airport noise, air pollutant emissions,  and traffic congestion.", "Focus on needs of clients and customers. Serving the needs of clients  and customers involves identifying their needs, striving to meet them,  measuring performance, and publicly reporting on progress to help assure  appropriate transparency and accountability. To better serve the needs of  its clients and customers, FAA published Flight Plan, which provides a  vehicle for identifying needs, measuring performance, and publicly  reporting progress. Flight Plan includes performance goals in the areas of  safety, greater capacity, international leadership, and organizational  excellence, which are linked to the agency\u2019s budget and progress  monitored through a Web-based tracking system.", "However, over the years, FAA\u2019s efforts to meet client and customer needs  have not always been successful, and some have had a long lasting  negative impact. FAA has had particular difficulty fielding new ATC  modernization systems within cost, schedule and performance goals to  meet the needs of the aviation community. Agency promises to deliver  new capabilities to airlines via improvements to the ATC system led some  airlines to install expensive equipment in their aircraft to position  themselves to benefit from expected FAA services; however, when the  agency failed to deliver on those promises, participating air carriers were  left with equipment that they could not use\u2014no return on their  investment. In addition, shifting agency priorities have made it difficult for  the aviation industry to anticipate future requirements and plan for them  in a cost-effective manner (e.g., providing air carriers with adequate lead  time to purchase new equipment and airframe manufacturers with lead  time to incorporate changes into new commercial airplane designs).  Furthermore, the absence of a full-functioning cost-accounting system  makes it difficult for FAA to assess the actual cost of providing services to  users of the National Airspace System.", "Strategic management of people. Most high-performing organizations  have strong, charismatic, visionary, and sustained leadership, the  capability to identify what skills and competencies the employees and the  organization need, and other key characteristics including effective  recruiting, comprehensive training and development, retention of high- performing employees, and a streamlined hiring process. Toward this end,  FAA has hired a Chief Operating Officer (COO) to stand up its new ATO.  Our work on high-performing organizations has recommended use of the  COO concept to facilitate transformational change in federal agencies and  to provide long-term attention and focus on management issues.  Furthermore, FAA has placed 78 percent of its workforce under a pay-for- performance system and implemented a training approach for its  acquisition workforce which reflects four of the six elements used by  leading organizations to deliver training effectively. However, it is too  soon to know the extent to which these elements of effective training will  be incorporated into the new ATO. Finally, FAA is currently conducting an  Activity Value Analysis, a bottoms-up effort to establish a baseline of ATO  headquarters activities and their value to stakeholders. The results of this  analysis are intended to help FAA\u2019s leadership target cost-cutting and cost  savings efforts.", "Despite FAA\u2019s efforts to date, our past work has found the agency\u2019s  strategic management of human capital lacking. For example,  organizational culture issues at FAA (e.g., its vertical, stovepiped  structure) have discouraged collaboration among technical experts and  users of the ATC system and contributed to the agency\u2019s inability to  deliver new ATC systems within cost, schedule and performance goals.  One of the most significant early challenges facing the ATO will be  negotiating a new contract with air traffic controllers, which is due to  expire in September 2005. The DOT IG has repeatedly noted that despite  the importance of controllers\u2019 jobs, that FAA simply cannot sustain the  continued salary cost growth for this workforce, which rose from an  average salary of $72,000 in 1998 to $106,000 in 2003. Given the  inextricable link between FAA\u2019s operating costs and its controller  workforce, striking an acceptable balance between controllers\u2019 contract  demands and controlling spiraling operating costs will be a strong  determinant of the ATO\u2019s credibility both within FAA and across the  aviation industry.", "While FAA has taken some promising steps through its new ATO to  restructure itself in a manner consistent with high-performing  organizations, the agency still faces significant and longstanding systemic  management challenges. These challenges must be overcome if FAA is to  keep pace with ongoing changes in the aviation industry and transform  itself into a world-class organization. Our work for more than two decades  has shown that even modest organizational, operational, and technological  changes at FAA can be difficult and time consuming, all of which  underscores the difficult road ahead for FAA and its new ATO.", "This concludes my statement.
