GAO said at the time that the pending biodefense strategy may address this.", "Situational awareness and data integration. GAO reported in 2009 and 2015 that the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC)\u2014created to integrate data across the federal government to enhance detection and situational awareness of biological events\u2014has suffered from longstanding challenges related to its clarity of purpose and collaboration with other agencies. DHS implemented GAO's 2009 recommendation to develop a strategy, but in 2015 GAO found NBIC continued to face challenges, such as limited partner participation in the center's activities.", "Biodetection technologies. DHS has faced challenges in clearly justifying the need for and establishing the capabilities of the BioWatch program\u2014a system designed to detect an aerosolized biological terrorist attack. In October 2015, GAO recommended that DHS not pursue upgrades until it takes steps to establish BioWatch's technical capabilites. While DHS agreed and described a series of tests to establish capabilities, it continued to pursue upgrades.", "Biological laboratory safety and security. Since 2008, GAO has identified challenges and areas for improvement related to the safety, security, and oversight of high-containment laboratories, which, among other things, conduct research on hazardous pathogens\u2014such as the Ebola virus. GAO recommended that agencies take actions to avoid safety and security lapses at laboratories, such as better assessing risks, coordinating inspections, and reporting inspection results. Many recommendations have been addressed, but others remain open, such as finalizing guidance on documenting the shipment of dangerous biological material.", "In September 2018, the White House issued the National Biodefense Strategy and associated plans, which could help to address some of the ongoing challenges GAO has previously identified.

Catastrophic biological events have the potential  to cause loss of life and sustained damage to the economy, societal  stability, and global security. Among those biological threats is the  unpredictable nature of naturally-occurring disease, which could affect  human and animal health and agricultural security. Further, while the  revolution in biotechnology presents opportunities to advance the life  sciences, that same technology in the wrong hands could be used to  create crippling biological weapons. For example, according to the Blue  Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, nonstate actors such as terrorist  organizations, domestic militia groups, and \u201clone wolves\u201d have both the  interest and capacity to develop biological weapons. Thus, the scientific  community must safeguard the biological agents it uses to assess threats  and must protect laboratory workers and the population at large from the  intentional or accidental release of dangerous pathogens during the  pursuit of more knowledge about them.", "The biological threat landscape is vast and requires a multidisciplinary  approach. The biodefense enterprise is the whole combination of systems  at every level of government and the private sector that contribute to  protecting the nation and its citizens from potentially catastrophic effects  of a biological event. It is composed of a complex collection of federal,  state, local, tribal, territorial, and private resources, programs, and  initiatives designed for different purposes and dedicated to mitigating  various risks, both natural and intentional. We have reported that complex  interagency and intergovernmental efforts can benefit from developing a  national strategy. In addition, we reported that interagency and  intergovernmental activities can benefit from the leadership of a single  entity with sufficient time, responsibility, authority, and resources needed  to provide assurance that the federal programs are well coordinated, and  that gaps and duplication in capabilities are avoided. Recognizing the  fragmentation and the need for an integrated strategy to address  biodefense challenges, in March 2011 we reported that reducing  fragmentation in the biodefense enterprise could provide confidence that  the nation is prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to biological  attacks with potentially devastating consequences in terms of loss of life,  economic damage, and decreased national security. At that time, we  reported that while some high-level biodefense strategies have been  developed, there was no broad, integrated national strategy that  encompassed all stakeholders with biodefense responsibilities to guide  the systematic identification of risk; assess resources needed to address  those risks; and prioritize and allocate investment across the biodefense  enterprise. Since that time, others, including the Congress, have also  called for the development of a national biodefense strategy.", "In September 2018, in response to a statutory requirement in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, the White House  released the National Biodefense Strategy and National Security  Presidential Memorandum-14 (NSPM-14), which establishes a  governance structure to guide the strategy\u2019s implementation. Part of the  governance structure includes the creation of a Biodefense Steering  Committee chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The  other members of the Committee include the Attorney General, the  Secretaries from the Departments of State, Defense (DOD), Agriculture  (USDA), Veterans Affairs (VA), and Homeland Security (DHS), and the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The  steering committee is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the  implementation of the Strategy. The National Defense Authorization Act  also included a provision for us to review the strategy, and we have  ongoing work in this area.", "We reported on a wide range of biodefense-related issues in which we  have examined the threat of biological terrorism and specific surveillance  programs and activities aimed to identify emerging infectious diseases  carried out by multiple federal departments and agencies. Since 2009, we  have identified broad, cross-cutting issues in leadership, coordination,  and collaboration that arise from working across the complex interagency,  intergovernmental, and intersectoral biodefense enterprise.", "As such, this statement describes a range of ongoing challenges to  building and maintaining the nation\u2019s biodefense, as well as the new  National Biodefense Strategy which is intended to help address them.  These include challenges related to (1) threat determination, (2)  situational awareness and data integration, (3) biodetection technologies,  (4) biological laboratory safety and security, and (5) emerging infectious  disease surveillance. The statement is based on our prior work issued  from December 2009 through March 2019 on various biological threats  and biodefense efforts, and selected updates related to our 2015 work on  DHS\u2019s BioWatch Program.", "To conduct our prior work, we reviewed reports from the bipartisan  Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction  Proliferation and Terrorism (WMD Center), relevant presidential  directives, laws, regulations, policies, strategic plans, and other reports;  surveyed states; and interviewed federal, state, and industry officials,  among others. Selected updates were obtained in the course of follow-up  on prior recommendations from 2015.

The complexity and  fragmentation of roles and responsibilities across numerous federal and  nonfederal entities presents challenges to ensuring efficiency and  effectiveness across the entire biodefense enterprise. In September  2018, the White House issued the National Biodefense Strategy and  through NSPM-14 established a governance structure to guide its  implementation. The activities and responsibilities assigned to the  interagency governance body by the strategy and NSPM-14 may create  new opportunities to make progress on these longstanding and complex  issues.

These  activities are often conducted to support the agencies\u2019 mission or to  understand a specific threat.", "Additionally, to facilitate collaboration among government partners,  federal agencies with key roles in biodefense share biological threat  information through many different mechanisms including interagency  bodies, working groups at the agency and executive level, formalized  agreements, colocation, joint projects and funding efforts, and shared  expertise (see figure 2).", "The collaborative mechanisms in which the key agencies in our October  2017 review participated may facilitate information sharing in support of  specific federal activities and in individual programs, or in response to  specific biological events after they begin to unfold. However, as we  reported in October 2017, there was no existing mechanism that could  leverage threat awareness information to direct resources and set  budgetary priorities across all agencies for biodefense. The nation faces  many biological threats, including naturally occurring diseases that affect  human, animal, and plant health, and biological weapons used by state or  nonstate actors. Without a mechanism that is able to assess the relative  risk from biological threats across all sources and domains, the nation  may be limited in its ability to prioritize resources, defenses, and  countermeasures against the most pressing threats.", "The Strategy and NSPM-14 outline requirements for participating  agencies that lay the ground work for a more systematic, cross- government examination of existing programs. The effort offers the  potential for the nation to progress toward more integrated and  enterprise-wide threat awareness and to use that information to identify  opportunities to leverage resources, but this will take time and entails a  change in the way participating agencies have traditionally operated.

In 2009, we reported that some of NBIC\u2019s  partners were not convinced of the value that working with NBIC provided  because NBIC\u2019s mission was not clearly articulated. We also reported  that NBIC was not fully equipped to carry out its mission because it  lacked key resources\u2014data and personnel\u2014from its partner agencies,  which may have been at least partially the result of collaboration  challenges it faced. In the 2009 report, we recommended that NBIC  develop a strategy for addressing barriers to collaboration and develop  accountability mechanisms to monitor these efforts. DHS agreed, and in  August 2012 NBIC issued the NBIC Strategic Plan, to provide its strategic  vision, clarify the center\u2019s mission and purpose, and articulate the value  that NBIC seeks to provide to its partners, among other things. In  September 2015, we reported that despite NBIC\u2019s efforts to collaborate  with interagency partners to create and issue a strategic plan that would  clarify its mission and efforts, a variety of challenges remained. We  identified options for policy or structural changes that could help a federal  data integrator like NBIC better fulfill its mission, given the complexity and  difficulty inherent in achieving truly integrated situational awareness that  makes new meaning out of disparate data, but we did not make specific  recommendations.", "The National Biodefense Strategy identified biosurveillance data  integration among several information sharing activities that need to be  enhanced. Interagency attention to the goals, opportunities, and  challenges of enterprise-wide data integration offers the potential for the  nation to better define what kind of integrated situational awareness is  possible, what it will take to effectively and efficiently achieve it, and what  value it has.

We recommended that before continuing the  acquisition, DHS reevaluate the mission need and possible alternatives  based on cost-benefit and risk information. DHS concurred and in April  2014, canceled the acquisition because an alternatives analysis did not  confirm an overwhelming benefit to justify the cost. DHS continues to rely  on the currently-deployed BioWatch system for early detection of an  aerosolized biological attack, but in 2015 we found that DHS lacked  reliable information about the current system\u2019s technical capabilities to  detect a biological attack, in part because DHS had not developed  technical performance requirements for the system. We reported in  September 2015 that DHS commissioned tests of the current system\u2019s  technical performance characteristics, but without performance  requirements, DHS could not interpret the test results and draw  conclusions about the system\u2019s ability to detect attacks.", "At the time of our report in October 2015, DHS was considering upgrades  to the Gen-2 system, but we recommended that DHS not pursue  upgrades until it establishes technical performance requirements to meet  a clearly defined operational objective and assesses the system against  these performance requirements.

These laboratories conduct research on hazardous pathogens\u2014such as  the Ebola virus and the bacteria that causes anthrax\u2014and toxins that  may pose a serious threat to humans, animals, or plants. In 2008 and  2009, we found a proliferation of high-containment laboratories across the  United States, with the number of such laboratories in the government,  academic, and private sectors increasing since 2001. We recommended  that the National Security Advisor name an entity charged with  government-wide strategic evaluation of high-containment laboratories.  National Security Staff disagreed with this recommendation. After  reporting on these issues again in 2013, the Office of Science and  Technology Policy implemented this recommendation. In January 2013,  we also found that, for the subset of these laboratories subject to federal  oversight, the oversight was duplicative, fragmented, and dependent on  self-policing. We recommended that HHS\u2019s Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention and USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  work with DHS and DOD to coordinate inspections and ensure consistent  application of inspection standards; the departments generally agreed  with our recommendations and noted various actions they had already  taken, or planned to take, to coordinate inspection efforts, such as  conducting joint inspections.", "More recently, in response to reported lapses in laboratory safety at HHS  and DOD in 2014 and 2015, we examined how federal departments  oversee their high-containment laboratories. In March 2016, we found  that most of the 8 departments and 15 agencies that we reviewed had  policies that were not comprehensive or were not up to date. Also, while  the departments and agencies we reviewed primarily used inspections to  oversee their high-containment laboratories, some of them were not  routinely reporting inspection results, laboratory incidents, and other  oversight activities to senior officials. We made 33 recommendations in  total, including that departments develop and update policies to include  missing elements and ensure that oversight activity results are reported to  senior officials.

Additionally, we  found that federal officials did not know how many incomplete inactivation  incidents have occurred because laboratories do not have to identify them  in incident reports, and are only required to report incidents involving  certain pathogens. We made 11 recommendations to HHS and USDA  that they improve the oversight of inactivation by revising reporting forms,  improving guidance for development and validation of inactivation  protocols, and developing consistent criteria for enforcement of incidents  involving incomplete inactivation.

For example, in May 2017, we reported that because  Zika virus disease was a newly emerging disease threat in the United  States and relatively little was known about the virus prior to 2016, HHS  and state and local public health agencies were not fully equipped with  information and resources needed for a rapid response at the outset of  the recent outbreaks. They faced challenges establishing and  implementing surveillance systems for Zika virus disease and infection  and its associated health outcomes. Additionally, in March 2019, we  reported that USDA would likely face surveillance challenges that could  delay detection of the first cases in a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in  livestock, which could have a devastating impact on our economy and  trade agreements. For example, foot-and-mouth disease can spread  without detection as signs can be difficult to notice in some species, take  up to 4 days to manifest after an animal is infected, and infection in wild  animals could go undetected and continue to spread the virus.", "In 2011, while reporting on nonfederal biosurveillance efforts, we found  state and local agriculture, public health, and wildlife departments were  completely or largely dependent on federal funding for biosurveillance- related activities.

In May 2018, we reported that officials from HHS  told us that their grant awards funded by annual appropriations are  intended to establish and strengthen emergency preparedness and  capacity building, but may not fully support the need for surge capacity  that states and other jurisdictions require in order to respond to an  infectious disease threat. We reported that during recent infectious  disease threats, HHS received supplemental appropriations to respond to  Zika in 2016, Ebola in 2014, and H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009.  However, as mentioned above, officials also said that the timing of these  awards can result in challenges to carrying out preparedness and  response activities during infectious disease threats.", "HHS officials, as well as all 10 selected non-federal stakeholders, also  noted in May 2018 that a funding mechanism to fund rapid response  activities when additional support is needed would be beneficial and could  help address timing challenges. However, we reported that concerns  were also raised about (1) when such a mechanism for funding infectious  disease threats should be used, and (2) that any type of emergency fund  should not be used to make up for a lack in investments at all levels of  government for current preparedness and capacity-building activities. We  did not make recommendation as part of this work. However, part of our  May 2018 reporting included perspectives from various stakeholders on  such a fund. Stakeholders cited six factors that may be considered for a  new emergency response fund: (1) who determines when to use an  emergency fund, (2) what factors would trigger the use of an emergency  fund, (3) methods to determine the amount of available funding, (4)  activities to fund with an emergency fund, (5), accountability for use of an  emergency fund, and (6) whether an emergency fund would be specific to  infectious disease threats.", "The National Biodefense Strategy and its interagency governance  structure offer the opportunity to design new approaches to identifying  and building a core set of surveillance and response capabilities for  emerging infectious diseases.
