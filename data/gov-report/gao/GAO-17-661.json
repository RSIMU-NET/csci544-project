This limit could be adjusted upward if an employer's workforce\u2014based on its age and gender characteristics\u2014was likely to have higher health costs than the national workforce, on average. This adjustment, known as the age and gender adjustment, is based on the premise that older individuals and younger females tend to have higher health care costs than other individuals. It is designed to lower the tax burden so that taxes are owed based on the plan design and not based on the health care costs of its members. PPACA stated that this adjustment would be made based on the premium costs of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Standard plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).", "The BCBS Standard plan has benefits and limitations for use as the basis of the adjustment. The benefits include that it is a large, national, decades-old, convenient data source, in that it is already known by, and available to, the federal government. However, there are some specific limitations to its use.", "The BCBS Standard plan has selection bias within FEHBP because members have a choice among many plans, and, compared to other options available to federal employees, it is a relatively expensive plan that covers members with higher health care costs. GAO's analysis of OPM data found that these higher costs are particularly true for younger members.", "The plan's enrollment has declined in recent years. Furthermore, officials noted that any one plan offering could be discontinued.", "The selection bias in the BCBS Standard plan may result in an age and gender adjustment that is not adequate. For example, because the BCBS Standard plan covers young members with higher health care costs, the ratio between the average claims costs of the younger and older members in that plan is smaller than it would be in a plan that did not have that particular selection bias issue. Therefore, the age and gender adjustment could be too small. While experts GAO spoke with identified several potential alternative sources of cost data for use as the basis of the adjustment, those alternatives also had limitations, such as not being convenient sources of data and potentially not being representative of the national workforce.", "To mitigate limitations of the BCBS Standard plan, these data could be supplemented with data from other FEHBP plans, such as the BCBS Basic plan, which is known to have younger members with lower health care costs and increasing enrollment. GAO found that using combined data from these two sources could result in a different adjustment for some employers\u2014in particular, for those with older employees.

It is also a mature plan that  has been in existence since 1959. Finally, it is convenient in that it is  already available and familiar to the federal government, and BCBSA  already provides summary cost and enrollment data to OPM on an annual  basis.", "However, experts and stakeholders identified two important limitations to  using BCBS Standard plan cost data as the basis of an age and gender  adjustment: 1) not being representative of the national workforce due to  selection bias and 2) declining enrollment.", "Selection bias. Enrollment in the BCBS Standard plan is affected by  selection bias among the FEHBP options that may result in it not being  representative of the national workforce. Within the FEHBP, federal  employees can choose among many different health plan options. The  BCBS Standard plan is a relatively expensive plan within the FEHBP and  covers older and sicker members compared to other, less expensive  plans, such as the other nationwide BCBS FEHBP option, BCBS Basic.  Actuarial experts also noted that the BCBS Standard plan may be less  attractive to healthier individuals and younger families who may be more  attracted to the FEHBP health maintenance organization options,  including high-deductible and consumer-driven plans, or the BCBS Basic  plan. Officials from OPM noted, and our review of two years of cost data  confirm, that members in the BCBS Standard plan generally have higher  health care costs than their counterparts in BCBS Basic and that this is  particularly true for younger members. While other employers may offer  more than one plan, most employers do not provide the number of  options that the federal government provides, so selection bias among  plans offered by other employers may be less extreme.", "Experts and stakeholders noted that the selection bias within the FEHBP  of more young members with higher health care costs in the BCBS  Standard plan may result in an age and gender adjustment that is not  adequate. For example, in part because the BCBS Standard plan  disproportionately covers young members with higher health care costs,  the ratio of the average claims costs of the older age groups to the  average claims costs of the younger age groups is smaller than it would  be in a plan that did not have that particular selection bias issue. As such,  the ratios of costs for older age groups to costs for younger age groups  would be understated compared to the ratios calculated based on data of  a more representative population. If the claims cost data used for the  adjustment had ratios that were understated in this way, then the  adjustment based on these data might also be too small, for example, for  employers with older demographics.", "Some experts and stakeholders also noted selection bias in the FEHBP  more broadly, in that its members, who include employees as well as  retired former employees and their dependents, are not representative of  the national workforce. For example, they noted that the federal workforce  is skewed to a higher proportion of older workers than the national  workforce. However, some experts we spoke with asserted that this may  not be a limitation that would generally affect the use of FEHBP data for  the age and gender adjustment because relative costs between older and  younger employees in the federal workforce are likely similar to those of  the national workforce.", "Declining enrollment. In addition, while the BCBS Standard plan is  large, it has experienced declining enrollment in recent years.  Specifically, from 2010 through 2015, enrollment in the BCBS Standard  plan decreased by over 10 percent. In contrast, enrollment in the BCBS  Basic plan increased significantly from 2010 through 2015\u2014a 46 percent  increase in contract holders. (See table 1.) Notably, the cumulative  enrollment for the two BCBS FEHBP plans has been relatively stable over  time. OPM officials noted that over time, this shift in enrollment from the  Standard to the Basic plan may further exaggerate the demographic  differences between Standard plan members and other populations,  including the Basic plan and the general employed population. They also  noted that it was possible that the BCBS Standard plan could continue to  experience an enrollment decline, becoming more disproportionately  skewed to older and higher-cost members. Finally, OPM, IRS, and  Treasury officials all noted that any one plan offering could be  discontinued.

Several experts and stakeholders who commented on  IRS\u2019s notices suggested this approach. They noted that combining data  from multiple FEHBP plans, such as data from the BCBS Standard and  Basic plans, could mitigate concerns. They specifically said that an  adjustment based on data from the BCBS Standard plan alone may not  be adequate due to the plan\u2019s selection bias within the FEHBP, as  previously discussed. The BCBS Standard plan is a relatively expensive  plan within the FEHBP and covers members with higher health care costs  compared to other less expensive plans, including the BCBS Basic plan.  We found that combining the data from these two plans could mitigate  this selection bias. Specifically, we found that the adjustment may be  particularly affected by selection bias among young Standard plan  contract holders with higher health care costs. In particular, combining  2015 data from these two plans increased the percentage of young  contract holders, and also increased the ratio of the average claims costs  of older contract holders to the average claims costs of younger contract  holders.

Our analysis of OPM data shows that  increases in BCBS Basic plan enrollment exceeded declines in BCBS  Standard plan enrollment, resulting in a net increase in combined  enrollment. Specifically, the number of contract holders enrolled in BCBS  Standard and BCBS Basic plans combined increased 3.2 percent from  2010 through 2015. (See table 3.) In addition, combined contract  holders accounted for 65 percent of all FEHBP contract holders. Some  experts and stakeholders also suggested that combining data from more  FEHBP plans could further improve the data, by capturing individuals who  select other types of plans, such as health maintenance organizations or  high-deductible health plans. However, we note that combining data from  different plans would require appropriate actuarial adjustments to account  for cost differences that result from benefit design and other differences  among the plans.", "Using combined FEHBP data as the basis for the age and gender  adjustment to include a broader selection of younger members could  result in a different adjustment that could increase the adjustment amount  for some employers.

We did this for a hypothetical employer with a workforce that is, on  average, older than the national workforce\u2014an employer that would likely  receive an age and gender adjustment\u2014without making any actuarial  adjustments to the data. We found that combining 2015 cost data for  active federal government workers enrolled in the BCBS Standard and  BCBS Basic self-only coverage plans resulted in a higher adjustment  amount for the hypothetical employer than did an adjustment based on  BCBS Standard data alone. This also resulted in a higher percentage  difference adjustment factor for the hypothetical employer. (See table 4.)  According to our analysis, combining the BCBS Standard and BCBS  Basic data resulted in an increase in the ratio between the average claims  costs of the oldest and youngest groups, yielding higher age and gender  adjustment amounts for our hypothetical employer.", "We found that different adjustment amounts could have an impact on the  total amount of taxes owed for an employer\u2019s workforce depending on the  number of employees to which the tax was applied. For example, the  adjustment amounts could determine whether or not an employee\u2019s  coverage is subject to the tax and, if the employee\u2019s coverage is subject  to the tax, how much tax is owed. Using the previously presented  hypothetical example of an employer with a workforce that is older, on  average, than the national workforce can illustrate the potential impact. In  this example, we compare the hypothetical tax owed for 100 similar  workers employed by that employer to illustrate the difference in the total  taxes owed depending on whether the data used as the basis for the age  and gender adjustment are the BCBS Standard data alone or the  combined BCBS Standard and Basic data.

Although the current law specifies the  use of premium cost data from the BCBS Standard plan, relying on BCBS  Standard plan data alone does not provide IRS with the comprehensive  information it may need to determine an appropriate and adequate age  and gender adjustment. Because the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2016 delayed the implementation of the age and gender adjustment until  2020, an opportunity exists for IRS to consider options for mitigating the  limitations of the BCBS Standard plan premium cost data.

However, if data were pooled from plans with  different benefit structures, the data may need to be actuarially adjusted.  Nonetheless, because of its limitations, using the BCBS Standard plan  data alone as the basis of the age and gender adjustment could result in  an adjustment that is not as effective as it could be at increasing the  applicable dollar limit for employers with costlier than average employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that, in implementing the age and gender adjustment, the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue consider taking steps to mitigate the  limitations of the BCBS Standard plan premium cost data\u2014such as by  combining data from multiple FEHBP plans. If combining the costs of  plans with different benefit structures, the Commissioner should consider  whether an appropriate actuarial adjustment should be used. If the  Commissioner interprets that the statute does not provide the flexibility to  mitigate the limitations of the BCBS Standard plan premium cost data by  combining data from multiple sources or by other means, we recommend  seeking that authority from Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to IRS and OPM for review and  comment. The draft report was also reviewed by Treasury. Subsequent to  reviewing the draft, IRS and Treasury officials contacted us to share  some of their concerns with the wording of the recommendation related to  combining claims costs of multiple health plans with varying designs. As a  result of these discussions, we clarified our recommendation language so  that it more explicitly focused on the need to mitigate the limitations of the  BCBS Standard plan data. We continue to believe that it is worthwhile to  consider using cost data from multiple FEHBP plans, but, as we note in  the report, if this is done, an actuarial adjustment should be considered.  We then shared the clarified recommendation language with the  agencies.", "We later received written comments from IRS, which are reproduced in  appendix I. We also received technical comments on the draft from both  IRS and OPM, which we incorporated as appropriate. We did not receive  additional comments from Treasury. In its written comments, IRS neither  agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation, but stated that it would  consider the recommendation as it continues to review comments  received in response to an agency notice and work with the Department  of the Treasury to issue guidance on the age and gender adjustment.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue and the Acting Director of the Office of Personnel Management.
