Regarding the B61 program, although NNSA completed the refurbishment of the strategic variants of the B61 bomb--the Mods 7 and 11--on schedule in November 2008, the refurbished weapons do not meet all refurbishment objectives. According to NNSA and DOD officials, NNSA established an unrealistic schedule and failed to fully implement its refurbishment guidance, known as the Phase 6.X process. NNSA was able to meet its refurbishment schedule and avoid significant cost overruns for the B61 program only because (1) some of the refurbishment objectives were changed, (2) NNSA was able to reuse, rather than manufacture, a critical component when B61 bombs were decommissioned, and (3) the Nuclear Weapons Council significantly reduced the number of B61 bombs in the stockpile. Despite DOD concerns about the adequacy of NNSA testing of the B61 bombs under certain conditions, NNSA continued refurbishing the weapons. Some of the B61 refurbishment problems could have been avoided if DOD had fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in overseeing NNSA's life extension program activities. For example, the Air Force did not adequately review NNSA's design, engineering, and testing activities--a review that would have alerted DOD that NNSA was missing some of its refurbishment objectives. Regarding the W76 program, NNSA did not effectively manage a high risk associated with manufacturing an essential material, known as Fogbank, needed to refurbish the W76 warhead. NNSA had developed a risk mitigation strategy to avoid potential cost overruns and schedule delays related to the manufacture of this key material but failed to effectively implement this strategy. As a result, NNSA's original plans to produce the first refurbished W76 weapon in September 2007 slipped to September 2008; NNSA spent $69 million to address Fogbank production problems; and the Navy faced logistical challenges owing to the delay. Furthermore, NNSA did not have a consistent approach to developing a cost baseline for the W76 program, which makes it difficult to track refurbishment costs over time and to know the actual cost of the program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear weapons are an essential part of the nation\u2019s defense strategy.

NNSA\u2019s process consists of seven steps, which involve,  among other things, establishing a cost and schedule baseline; conducting  experiments, tests, and analyses to validate design options and assess  production capabilities; preparing production facilities for manufacturing  parts and components; and entering full-scale production of refurbished  weapons. In addition, under the Phase 6.X process, DOD, including the  U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), is responsible for developing,  reviewing, and updating the military requirements that specify the  performance characteristics for each warhead type and the environments  in which the warhead must perform or remain safe. As NNSA designs the  warhead or bomb and conducts tests to ensure that they meet these  requirements, DOD reviews NNSA\u2019s actions in each phase of the  refurbishment. NNSA plans to use this same management process for the  design of a new warhead, known as the reliable replacement warhead,  which NNSA states is a way to replace the nation\u2019s aging stockpile with  warheads that are safer, provide longer-term reliability, and are less  expensive to maintain than those currently in the stockpile.", "In December 2000, we reported that the W87 warhead, which was  designed to be carried on the land-based Peacekeeper missile, had  experienced significant design and production problems that increased its  refurbishment costs by over $300 million and caused schedule delays of  about 2 years. As we reported, at the heart of many of the problems that  contributed to this outcome were an inadequate Office of Defense  Programs management process and unclear leadership, which prevented  the Office from adequately anticipating and mitigating the problems that  arose. In 2005, NNSA completed the refurbishment of the W87. This was  the first weapon to be refurbished under the life extension program.", "In a follow-up study in July 2003, we reported that NNSA had not  adequately addressed the budgetary, cost accounting, and other  management issues that contributed to problems with the W87 as it began  research and development activities for refurbishing the B61 bomb and  W76 warhead. As of December 15, 2008, two nuclear weapons were being  refurbished\u2014the B61 bomb and the W76 warhead. The B61 bomb is  designed to be carried on the B-52 or B-2 bomber by the Air Force. There  are two different types of strategic B61 bombs\u2014the Mod 7 and the Mod 11.  The Mod 11 is used exclusively as an earth penetrator in free-fall mode to  destroy deeply buried targets. NNSA began refurbishment production in  June 2006 for the Mod 7 and January 2007 for the Mod 11 and completed  production for both weapons in November 2008.

We then reviewed  NNSA\u2019s project plans for the B61 bomb and W76 warhead, life extension  guidance documents, risk management practices, briefing slides, and  strategic weapons directives to determine whether NNSA reached critical  milestones on time. To assess the technical challenges NNSA was facing in  refurbishing the B61 bomb and W76 warhead and the steps it was taking to  minimize technical risk, we interviewed officials from the Office of  Defense Programs at DOE in Washington, D.C.; the nuclear weapons  design laboratories, including Lawrence Livermore (LLNL) in California  and Los Alamos (LANL) and Sandia in New Mexico; and the weapons  production plants, including Y-12 in Tennessee, Pantex in Texas, and  Kansas City in Missouri.

As a result of changes in arms control, arms  reduction, and nonproliferation policies, the National Defense  Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 required that DOE develop a  science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain the stockpile  without nuclear testing. After this program was established, DOE, in  January 1996, initiated the Stockpile Life Extension Program. The purpose  of this program is to develop a standard approach for planning nuclear  weapons refurbishment activities so that the nuclear weapons complex  can extend the operational lives of the weapons in the stockpile by  another 20 to 30 years.", "Within NNSA, the Office of Defense Programs is responsible for the  warheads and bombs in the stockpile. This responsibility encompasses  many different tasks, including the manufacture, maintenance,  refurbishment, surveillance, and dismantlement of weapons in the  stockpile; activities associated with the research, design, development,  simulation, modeling, and nonnuclear testing of nuclear weapons; and the  planning, assessment, and certification of the weapons\u2019 safety and  reliability. A national complex of nuclear weapons design laboratories and  production facilities carries out the Office of Defense Programs\u2019 mission.  Three national laboratories in this complex design nuclear weapons:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, Los Alamos  National Laboratory in New Mexico, and Sandia National Laboratories in  New Mexico and California.", "For the B61 and W76 life extension programs, Los Alamos National  Laboratory is responsible for designing and developing these weapons\u2019  nuclear explosives package.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  peer reviews design and production activities. Los Alamos and Sandia  National Laboratories work closely with the production plants to ensure  that components meet design specifications. The complex\u2019s four  production sites include the Y-12 National Security Complex plant in  Tennessee, the Kansas City Plant in Missouri, the Savannah River Site  plant in South Carolina, and the Pantex Plant in Texas. The Y-12 plant  manufactures critical nuclear components, such as parts made from  enriched uranium, for the nuclear explosives package. The Kansas City  plant produces and procures nonnuclear parts and electronic components  and manufactures the new arming, fuzing, and firing system for the W76  warhead. The Savannah River Site plant fills gas bottles it receives from  Kansas City with tritium and deuterium, which are used to facilitate the  nuclear explosion. Last, the Pantex plant assembles all components  supplied by other production plants to produce a weapon for the  stockpile. See figure 1 for a summary of this process.", "An end to underground nuclear testing in 1992 in the United States  suspended the development of weapons with new, untested designs. This  suspension created a shift away from the strategy of replacing older  warheads with newer designs to a new strategy of retaining and  refurbishing previously produced warheads indefinitely, without nuclear  testing, and with no plans to replace the weapons. To manage this new  strategy of refurbishing nuclear weapons, NNSA uses a process called  Phase 6.X, which it jointly developed with DOD. This process consists of  the following elements:    Phase 6.1, concept assessment\u2014conducting studies to provide planning  guidance and to develop information so that a decision can be made on  whether or not to proceed to phase 6.2.", "Phase 6.2, feasibility study\u2014developing design options and studying their  feasibility.", "Phase 6.2A, design definition and cost study\u2014completing definition of  selected design option(s) from phase 6.2 and determining the cost of  pursuing the design option(s).", "Phase 6.3, development engineering\u2014conducting experiments, tests, and  analyses to validate the design option and assess its potential for  production.", "Phase 6.4, production engineering\u2014making a strong commitment of  resources to the production facilities to prepare for stockpile production.", "Phase 6.5, first production\u2014producing a limited number of refurbished  weapons and then disassembling and examining some of them for final  qualification of the production process.", "Phase 6.6, full-scale production\u2014ramping up to full production rates at  required levels.", "DOD oversees NNSA\u2019s refurbishment activities through the military  services\u2019 Lead Project Officer and the Nuclear Weapons Council\u2019s Standing  and Safety Committee.

However, an NNSA study completed in 2001 by  the national laboratories and production facilities found that they could  not meet the September 2004 date given the requirements, production  capabilities, risk assessments, and Phase 6.X guidelines. Instead, the  national laboratories and production facilities concluded that they would  need until September 2008\u20144 years later than the September 2004 date  proposed by NNSA\u2014to refurbish the first weapon. This proposed  schedule was considered low risk because it allowed NNSA to follow the  steps in the Phase 6.X process and included contingencies to address  technical challenges. NNSA did not approve this schedule, however. It was  concerned that the proposed production schedule for the B61 bomb would  conflict with the refurbishment of the W76 warhead, which was originally  scheduled for September 2007 and considered a DOD priority. NNSA  wanted to complete production of the refurbished B61 bomb before  beginning full-scale production of the W76 warhead because the  production facilities, such as the Y-12 plant, had limited capacity. To allow  the national laboratories and production facilities more time for design,  engineering, and production activities while avoiding conflicts with the  W76 life extension program, NNSA set a June 2006 date for the first  refurbished B61 bomb.", "To meet this more aggressive and, as stated in NNSA\u2019s program plan,  \u201csuccess-oriented\u201d schedule, NNSA adopted a modified Phase 6.X process  that compressed and overlapped the development engineering and  production engineering phases, leaving little time to conduct the  experiments, tests, and analyses needed to validate design options and to  certify that production facilities that manufacture and assemble parts  could meet design requirements. NNSA assumed that it would not need  time for development and production engineering because it would reuse  rather than manufacture critical materials\u2014one of the most critical of  which was a plastic. Before fully determining whether the plastic could be  reused, NNSA developed a production schedule with fixed delivery dates.  However, additional tests showed that NNSA could not reuse this material  because it did not function properly under certain conditions. NNSA  therefore decided to develop an alternative material with superior  properties that would work under all conditions. Since NNSA did not  include any cost or schedule contingencies in its baseline to address  unforeseen technical challenges, development work on an alternative  material posed a significant risk to meeting the program\u2019s milestones and  added $11 million to the program\u2019s cost. NNSA was unable to produce a  substitute that could retain the shape needed for the B61 bomb and would  perform under all delivery conditions. NNSA\u2019s effort to manufacture this  alternative material resulted in significant schedule delays and cost  overruns.", "In addition to a lack of sufficient time for development and production  engineering work, NNSA\u2019s B61 life extension program schedule did not  include contingencies for testing failures. NNSA assumed that modeling  and computational analysis would be sufficient to properly design a  component and a physical test of the design would be successful, avoiding  the need for follow-up tests. If a test revealed a problem with the design,  NNSA would have had to conduct additional tests or change the design,  which would have potentially increased cost and delayed the program.", "As it turned out, NNSA\u2019s tests were not all successful, and the Air Force  and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory peer reviewers  recommended delaying production and conducting additional tests to test  the refurbished weapon. Nevertheless, NNSA proceeded with full-scale  production to meet its schedule milestones.

After STRATCOM reviewed its needs, NNSA  was then able to abandon its attempt to develop an alternative material,  which it could not successfully manufacture to meet requirements, and  was able to reuse the original material in the B61 bomb.", "Dismantlement of decommissioned B61 bombs allowed NNSA to obtain  the necessary material for the refurbished B61 bombs.

Working  from lessons learned from the W87 life extension program, NNSA strove to  achieve an early operations start date to allow sufficient time to address  any potential problems in manufacturing Fogbank. In 2000, we reported  that production problems resulting from such factors as restarting an  atrophied production complex and addressing safety and technician  training issues led directly to slippage in the W87 life extension program  schedule and contributed to increased costs. In addition, NNSA\u2019s own  lessons learned report on the W87 program identified the need to  demonstrate processes early and often and stated that, with limited  resources, assumptions such as \u201cwe did it before so we can do it again\u201d are  often wrong.", "NNSA started the new facility\u2019s operations about 1 year late because the  schedule for building the facility was unrealistic, disagreements on the  implementation of safety guidelines emerged, and the W76 program  manager lacked authority to control the schedule. Focused on meeting an  operations start date of March 2005, NNSA developed an aggressive  construction and operation start schedule with no contingency for cost  overruns or schedule delays. This schedule increased risk to meeting the  program schedule because any delay would leave less than 2 years to  conduct test production runs, which NNSA determined were necessary for  perfecting the process. In addition, the Fogank facility was the first new  manufacturing facility to be built at Y-12 in 30 years; therefore, a lack of  recent experience with construction project management and  implementing safety guidelines heightened the potential for problems. In  fact, the contractor building the facility underestimated the time needed to  complete preparations for start-up, including training and certifying staff  to use the equipment and calibrating instruments.", "In addition, NNSA and the contractor disagreed on the interpretation and  implementation of safety guidelines. A lack of clarity about which  guidelines would apply and the proper interpretation of the guidelines  caused confusion over the course of the project. At a late stage, NNSA  directed the contractor to apply more conservative nuclear facility safety  requirements. As a result, the contractor needed additional time to address  safety concerns by, for example, installing weather- and earthquake-proof  equipment.", "When these issues emerged, the W76 NNSA program manager did not have  the authority to manage the construction of the project or resolve the  dispute over safety guidelines even though a key risk mitigation strategy  was the timely start of facility operations. Construction and start-up of the  facility was managed by Y-12, which reported to the Y-12 Site Office, a  separate organization not under the authority of the program manager. As  soon as the March 2005 new facility start date was missed, the program  manager raised concerns and elevated them to the Deputy Administrator  for Defense Programs, the cognizant management organization at NNSA  headquarters, but the issues remained unresolved. Ultimately, start-up of  the new facility was postponed by approximately 1 year, leaving NNSA  with half the time originally planned to re-learn the Fogbank production  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Did Not Make Full Use of the Pilot Plant", "paragraphs": ["NNSA planned to use the Y-12 pilot plant to gain a better understanding of  Fogbank properties and to test the production process on a small scale  while the new facility was under construction.

Although NNSA used the pilot plant from 2000 to  2003, it did not have funds to continue the effort because it shifted money  from the W76 program to support higher priority programs at the time,  such as the W87 and B61 life extension programs.", "However, in 2004, anticipating delays in starting operations at the new  facility and recognizing the importance of continuing work at the pilot  plant, NNSA provided funding to pay for additional work at the pilot plant.  By completing this work, NNSA learned that certain techniques  significantly affected the quality of the end product and made adjustments  to meet requirements.

In addition, LANL\u2019s computer models and simulations were not  sophisticated enough to provide conclusive evidence that the alternate  material would function exactly the same as Fogbank. Still further, the  Navy, the ultimate customer, had expressed a strong preference for  Fogbank because of its proven nuclear test record. In response to the  Navy\u2019s preference and the lack of sufficient test data on the alternate  material, NNSA did not pursue the development of an alternate material  until 2007.", "In March 2007, however, NNSA again considered producing an alternative  material when it was unable to produce usable Fogbank and was facing  the prospect of significant schedule delays. Computer models and  simulations had improved since 2001, enabling greater confidence in the  analysis of alternate materials. Thus, NNSA began a $23 million initiative  to develop an alternate material. LANL officials told us that NNSA plans to  certify the use of the alternative material by the end of 2009 for the W76  warhead and if NNSA faced additional Fogbank manufacturing problems  during full-scale production, the alternate material could then be used  instead of Fogbank. Had NNSA continued research and development of an  alternate material during the program, it would have had more information  on the viability of using the alternate material in the weapon before March  2007. This additional information also might have provided the Navy  greater assurance that an alternate material performed as well as Fogbank."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ineffective Risk Management Led to Schedule Delays and Cost Increases", "paragraphs": ["A failure to implement the three components of NNSA\u2019s risk management  strategy for Fogbank led to a 1-year schedule delay and a $69 million cost  overrun. This cost overrun included $22 million to resolve Fogbank  production problems, $23 million to develop the alternate material, and  $24 million to maintain Pantex\u2019s production capabilities. Regarding  Fogbank production problems, in March 2007, NNSA discovered that final  batches of the material had problems. To address the problems and try to  meet its September 2007 date for producing the first refurbished weapon,  NNSA launched a major effort\u2014\u201cCode Blue\u201d\u2014that made the manufacture  of Fogbank a priority for the design laboratories and production facilities.  However, this effort failed, and, as a result, NNSA delayed producing the  first refurbished weapon from September 2007 to September 2008, and it  began its efforts to develop an alternate material to Fogbank. Finally,  while Pantex was unable to begin assembling refurbished units in  September 2007 as planned, it still spent $24 million in fiscal year 2008 to  remain in \u201cstand-by\u201d mode, which includes maintaining the skills of the  technicians who will assemble refurbished W76 weapons.", "The 1-year delay led to logistical challenges for the Navy and an aggressive  production schedule of refurbished W76 warheads to make up time. The  Navy originally planned to start replacing old W76 warheads with  refurbished ones on submarines in April 2008. However, owing to W76  production delays, the Navy had to replace aging parts of W76 warheads in  its current arsenal and has had to delay replacing old warheads with newly  refurbished weapons until April 2009. Furthermore, to make up for initial  schedule setbacks caused by Fogbank production problems, NNSA has  increased the rate at which it plans to produce refurbished W76 weapons.  NNSA will produce more weapons per year than originally planned, an  annual increment that over time will enable it to still finish production at  the originally planned end date. However, a higher rate of production  requires more resources and leaves less room for error because any  slowdown will have a greater impact on the larger number needed to be  produced. NNSA production officials have indicated that they may not be  able to meet this more compressed schedule if they do not receive extra  resources or if they encounter any production problems, both considered  realistic possibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Lacks a Consistent Approach to Developing the W76 Cost Baseline", "paragraphs": ["NNSA does not have a consistent approach for developing a cost baseline for  the W76 program. NNSA has changed its baseline almost every year since  2001 to reflect changes in the number of warheads needed in the stockpile  and changes in NNSA reporting guidelines. For example, in fiscal year 2004,  the cost estimate for the W76 program was $2.1 billion; in fiscal year 2005, it  was $6.2 billion; and in fiscal year 2006, it was $2.7 billion (see fig. 2).", "Changes in the baseline were the result of changes in the percent of the  stockpile to be refurbished, which ranged from 25 percent to 86 percent.  As the number of weapons to be refurbished changed, the baseline moved  correspondingly because it costs more to refurbish more weapons. For  example, NNSA planned to refurbish significantly more weapons in 2005  than 2004, based on official guidance, accounting for part of the $4.1  billion differential between those years.", "Significant changes in the baseline were also driven by inconsistent NNSA  accounting practices. For example, in fiscal year 2005, NNSA required  program managers to include all indirect costs, such as the overhead costs  of operating facilities, as well as direct costs in the baseline. The next year  it dropped this requirement. Prior to fiscal year 2005, NNSA did not tie  overhead costs to specific weapon systems. However, in an attempt to  provide a more accurate estimate of total costs by weapon, NNSA created  accounts for the W76 warhead that captured a pro-rated portion of general  costs, such as research and production support at the laboratories and  production facilities. For example, NNSA included the pro-rated cost of  forklift operators, who load and unload trucks for all weapon systems.  Thus, a portion of these overhead costs was added to the 2005 baseline to  better account for the full the costs of the program. However, NNSA  discovered that this approach constrained flexibility. If priorities shifted  and changes needed to be made to overhead activities, resources could  not be easily redirected to different weapon systems. Any change would  require congressional approval because such overhead costs were tied to a  specific weapon system as a budget line item. Consequently, in fiscal year  2006, NNSA reported the production and research support accounts  separately. While this change restored some flexibility for overall NNSA  complex management, the transition reduced clarity about the total cost of  a weapon system. Accounting changes have persisted, with, for example,  some baseline years including large expense items, such as employee  benefits, and other baseline years excluding such costs. A lack of a  consistent baseline approach with similar cost assumptions and criteria  makes it difficult to track the costs of the program over time and  determine how well NNSA develops cost estimates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Refurbishing the nuclear weapons stockpile is a difficult task. NNSA must  draw on the scientific expertise of the nuclear weapons laboratories and  the manufacturing and engineering expertise of the nuclear weapons  production facilities. Recognizing this challenge, NNSA and DOD have  developed multiple tools for managing the refurbishment effort: Phase 6.X,  risk management strategies, test and evaluation plans, and a lessons  learned document from the W87 life extension program.", "By selectively using these guidance documents, however, NNSA has  incurred significant cost increases and schedule delays that it could have  avoided. In addition, NNSA did not include any cost or schedule  contingencies in its baseline to address the unforeseen technical  challenges that arose. If NNSA had more carefully followed the Phase 6.X  process, it might have had sufficient time in its schedule to develop and  test key materials that it had not manufactured in decades and address  unforeseen technical issues.", "Moreover, NNSA did not fully implement its risk management strategy to  address one of the highest risks to the W76 life extension program\u2014the  manufacturing of Fogbank. If NNSA had effectively implemented its risk  management strategies, schedule delays and cost increases might have  been avoided or mitigated. Most importantly, if NNSA had started  operations of the new facility on schedule, it would have had more time to  address manufacturing challenges. In fact, the 1-year delay in the startup  of the new Fogbank facility corresponded almost exactly to the 1-year  program delay. In addition, without the authority to control the  construction and start of operations of the new facility, the W76 program  manager could not help resolve the disagreement over the safety  regulations needed at the facility. Potentially compounding these  problems, NNSA committed to an ambitious production schedule to make  up for delays related to Fogbank\u2014a schedule that does not leave time to  address any future production problems. Furthermore, NNSA cannot be  held accountable to meeting its cost targets without a consistent approach  in developing a cost baseline for the W76 program. The ability to track  cost over time and assess how well an agency holds to a cost baseline is  fundamental for proper management and oversight.", "Finally, because DOD failed to adequately oversee the B61 refurbishment  program, as Phase 6.X requires, NNSA spent unnecessary time and money  trying to find an alternative material. In addition, because the Lead Project  Officer for the B61 bomb did not adequately monitor NNSA\u2019s activities  during critical phases or have the technical expertise to do so, the Air  Force did not have sufficient time to ask NNSA to conduct additional tests  before NNSA entered full-scale production.", "All of these management issues raise significant questions about NNSA\u2019s  ability not only to complete life extension programs on time and on budget  that meet all refurbishment objectives, but also its ability to manage the  design and production of new weapons, such as the proposed reliable  replacement warhead. NNSA and DOD state that the reliable replacement  warhead is a way to replace the nation\u2019s aging stockpile with a safer, more  reliable, and more secure warhead than those currently in our stockpile, and  plan to use the Phase 6.X process to design and manufacture this warhead.  Because NNSA did not properly follow the Phase 6.X process, meet all  refurbishment objectives for the B61 bomb, and conduct all planned tests, it  raises questions about NNSA\u2019s ability to design a new weapon that meets  DOD\u2019s needs and also provides sufficient confidence to DOD that a new  weapon will perform as expected without conducting underground nuclear  tests. In addition, NNSA\u2019s failure to implement its risk mitigation strategy for  the highest risk to the program and implement lessons learned from prior life  extensions, like the W87 warhead, does not inspire confidence in its ability to  achieve the program\u2019s goals on time and on budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management of the stockpile life extension program, we  recommend that the Administrator of NNSA direct the Deputy  Administrator for Defense Programs to take the following six actions:    Develop a realistic schedule for the W76 warhead and future life extension  programs that allows NNSA to (1) address technical challenges while  meeting all military requirements and (2) build in time for unexpected  technical challenges that may delay the program.", "Assess the cost and include funding in the baseline for risk mitigation activities  that address the highest risks to the W76 and future life extension programs.", "Before beginning a life extension program, assess the risks, costs, and  scheduling needs for each military requirement established by DOD.", "Ensure that the program managers responsible for overseeing the  construction of new facilities directly related to future life extension  programs coordinate with the program managers of such future programs  to avoid the types of delays and problems faced with the construction and  operation of the Fogbank manufacturing facility for the W76 program.", "Ensure that program managers for the construction of new facilities for  future life extensions base their schedule for the construction and start-up  of a facility on the life extension program managers\u2019 needs identified in  their risk mitigation strategies.", "Develop and use consistent budget assumptions and criteria for the  baseline to track costs over time.", "To improve DOD\u2019s oversight over NNSA\u2019s life extension activities and  ensure that refurbished weapons meet all military requirements, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following three actions:    Direct STRATCOM and the Secretary of the responsible Service to  comprehensively review military requirements for a weapons system prior  to entering Phase 6.2A of a life extension program.", "Direct STRATCOM and the Secretary of the responsible Service to work  with NNSA to assess the cost and schedule implications for meeting each  military requirement prior to entering Phase 6.3.", "Direct the Secretaries of the Air Force and the Navy to ensure that their  respective Lead Project Officers have the technical and managerial  expertise and resources to review NNSA\u2019s progress and technical  challenges throughout the life extension program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided NNSA and DOD with draft copies of our classified report for  their review and comment.

As discussed in our  classified report, NNSA agreed with our recommendations and plans to take a  number of steps to implement them. First, NNSA plans to assess the risks,  costs, and scheduling needs for each military requirement DOD establishes  during the early phases of a life extension program. NNSA will consult  officials from the production facilities to better understand the potential  impact on cost and schedule of manufacturing critical nuclear and non- nuclear materials. In addition, NNSA plans to adopt an Integrated Phase Gate  process that establishes well-defined milestones, or gates, throughout the  Phase 6.X process. Before proceeding to the next gate, NNSA and DOD  officials must identify any risks to cost and schedule and can opt to delay the  life extension program if the risks are too high and additional actions, such as  testing, should be taken. Second, NNSA will include funding needs for risk  mitigation activities that address the highest risks to future life extension  programs in budget reports to Congress. Third, NNSA plans to better  coordinate construction activities at the production facilities with the needs  of life extension program activities. Last, according to NNSA, it developed a  methodology to establish a baseline with consistent budget assumptions and  criteria to track costs over time.

DOD agreed with our two  recommendations directed at the department, but asked us to make  modifications to the language of the recommendations to better target the  responsible service or agency that has authority to implement them. We  modified our recommendations by (1) including the Department of the Navy  because it is responsible for reviewing NNSA\u2019s refurbishment activities for  certain nuclear weapons, such as the W76, and (2) specifying during which  phase of the phase 6.X process DOD should comprehensively review its  military requirements and assess the cost and schedule implications for  meeting each military requirement. DOD also expressed concern that the report  placed an undue burden of responsibility for program delays for the B61 life  extension program on DOD and that there were other technical issues NNSA  faced that were not discussed in this report that led to program delays. We  believe that our report fairly attributes management problems with the B61 life  extension program to both NNSA and DOD. As we state in the report, NNSA  did not include any cost or schedule contingencies in its baseline to address  unforeseen technical challenges in refurbishing the B61 bomb, and its  aggressive schedule posed a significant risk to meeting the program\u2019s  milestones. This report did not address all of the technical challenges that  NNSA faced in refurbishing the B61 bomb because some did not have an  impact on cost and schedule and others were additional examples of problems  NNSA faced by compressing the development and engineering schedule. As we  noted on page 3 of this report, the scope of our discussion of the B61 was  limited to the most significant technical challenge that had an impact on cost,  schedule, and weapon performance and reliability\u2014the decision to reuse or  manufacture a new material for a critical component. NNSA had the burden of  completing the refurbishment on time and on schedule, but DOD failed to  provide the necessary oversight. Last, we recognize that the Air Force has taken  steps to strengthen the management and oversight of nuclear activities, such as  consolidating nuclear activities under a newly established Air Force Nuclear  Weapons Center.
