Some information about the racial and ethnic composition of Cleveland's and Milwaukee's public school and voucher students is available, but it is unclear whether the composition changed as a result of the voucher programs. Ohio and Wisconsin use different methods to provide state funds for the voucher programs and spend less on voucher students than on public school students. The Cleveland voucher program is funded with Disadvantaged Pupil Impact Aid funds up to a limit set by the Ohio Legislature. Wisconsin funds the Milwaukee voucher program with general state aid funds on the basis of number of students participating in the program in a given year.

Only three states\u2014Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin\u2014have initiated programs within the last decade to provide public funding that allows families to send their children to private elementary and secondary schools. These states created their voucher programs largely in reaction to state and parental dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools. Opinions vary widely about whether voucher programs are a viable solution to public school problems. Some advocates have claimed that voucher programs will provide poor families with educational choices like those available to affluent families and will promote greater competition among schools, forcing them to become more effective in order to remain viable. Opponents have stressed that voucher programs will hurt public school funding by steering tax dollars to private schools, and that evidence of student achievement gains is inconclusive. Opponents have also warned of the potential for increased segregation by race and income as voucher schools may attract the best students from the traditional public schools.", "You indicated your interest in both publicly and privately funded school voucher programs. For this report you requested that we provide information on the publicly funded school voucher programs in Cleveland and Milwaukee, primarily based on research conducted on these programs. As of the 1999\u20132000 school year, the Cleveland program had about 3,400 voucher students enrolled in 52 private schools, and the Milwaukee program had about 7,600 students enrolled in 91 private schools. We focused our work on answering the following questions:   What are the key eligibility criteria for student and private school participation in the Cleveland and Milwaukee voucher programs?", "How does research characterize students and private schools participating in these voucher programs compared to public schools and their students in the two cities?", "What is known about the racial composition of public school and voucher students and whether this composition has changed as a result of the voucher programs?", "What is known about how these voucher programs are funded and the amount spent on public school students compared to the amount spent on voucher students?", "What is known about student academic achievement within these voucher programs?", "Most of the data we used to address these questions were collected from studies of the Cleveland and Milwaukee voucher programs. We selected studies for review that met two or more of the following criteria: (1) were performed under contract to Ohio or Wisconsin state departments of education; (2) had been published in a peer-reviewed journal; (3) had been issued by a research institution that reviews work prior to release; or (4) employed quantitative analysis to examine student academic achievement. The studies we selected included assessments of the student and school characteristics, racial and ethnic composition of public school and voucher students, and evaluations of Cleveland and Milwaukee students\u2019 academic achievement. We examined the studies to determine if the data they contained met criteria for reliability and completeness and if analyses of the voucher programs\u2019 effects employed impact evaluation methods, such as the use of comparison groups and multivariate analysis procedures. We did not include data in our analyses from studies that did not meet our criteria. In addition to these studies, we reviewed state laws and regulations, school district and voucher program office records, state budget data, and a variety of school voucher-related reports and articles. We conducted site visits to Ohio and Wisconsin and interviewed officials from the state departments of education, the administering program offices, the public school districts, and several private schools. Appendix I further describes our scope and methodology. A list of the studies we reviewed is provided in the bibliography to this report. We conducted our review between February and July 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Cleveland voucher program is officially called the Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring Program and provides state funding to help primarily low-income children in kindergarten through the eighth grade attend private schools in Cleveland or to attend public schools in districts adjacent to the Cleveland school district. The voucher program was implemented in the 1996\u201397 school year, and only private schools have participated in it. Students new to the program generally start in kindergarten through the third grade and may have previously attended a public or a private school or never attended school. In June 2000, the Cleveland program had about 3,400 voucher students enrolled in 52 private schools, which received about $5.2 million in publicly funded voucher payments for the 1999\u20132000 school year. By comparison, the Cleveland school district in 1999\u20132000 had about 76,000 students enrolled in its 121 schools supported by $712 million in total revenues.", "In Cleveland, actual voucher payments follow the student to the school attended, even when he or she changes schools. Voucher checks are made out to the student\u2019s parent or guardian and require endorsement before the school can use the funds. These funds are sent to the participating schools in two payments. Prior to payment, a voucher payment report is generated for each participating school listing all current voucher students. Each school verifies this report as accurate or updates it before it is sent to the Ohio Department of Education\u2019s School Finance Division to be processed for payment. For low-income voucher students, the voucher amount is limited to 90 percent of school tuition up to a maximum of $2,250. For those voucher students who do not come from low-income families, the voucher amount is limited to 75 percent of school tuition up to a maximum of $1,875. Any payments sent to a voucher school are proportionately reduced if a student is not enrolled in the school for the entire period covered by the scheduled voucher payment.", "About 90 percent of the Cleveland voucher schools are religious schools. The constitutionality of providing state-funded vouchers for attendance at religious schools has been challenged in the courts since the program\u2019s inception. In December 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the program is unconstitutional because it has the effect of advancing religion, and that the program constitutes an endorsement of religion and sectarian education in violation of the first amendment. Subsequently, the court of appeals decided that the program could continue operating while interested parties seek U.S. Supreme Court review of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling.", "Two teams have conducted research on the academic achievement of students in Cleveland\u2019s voucher program. The first was the contract researcher, a team from Indiana University, which was contracted by the Ohio Department of Education to conduct a multiyear evaluation of the program. The second team, supported by Harvard University\u2019s Program on Education Policy and Governance (Harvard researchers), conducted its own studies. The contract research team analyzed students\u2019 academic achievement in school years 1996\u201397 and 1997\u201398, the first 2 years of the voucher program. The Harvard team reanalyzed the contract researcher team\u2019s data for the first year and 1996\u201397 data from two additional private schools participating in the voucher program.", "The Milwaukee voucher program, officially called the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, provides state funding exclusively for low-income children in Milwaukee to attend private schools and was first implemented in the 1990\u201391 school year. Wisconsin initially limited participation to nonsectarian private schools, but amended the program to include religious schools in 1995. For the 1994\u201395 school year, 771 full-time equivalent voucher students attended 12 nonreligious schools. Following legal challenges to the 1995 program revision permitting religious school participation, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the revision in 1998, and program enrollment tripled when Milwaukee voucher students began attending religious schools in 1998\u201399 school year. Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court chose not to hear an appeal of the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision that the program did not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. In school year 1998\u201399, nearly three- quarters of the participating schools were religious.", "Currently, students new to the program may start in kindergarten through the 12th grade if, in the year prior to enrolling, they attended a Milwaukee public school; a Milwaukee private school in kindergarten, first, second, or third grade; or never attended school anywhere. In the 1999\u20132000 school year, the Milwaukee program had 7,621 voucher students enrolled in 91 schools, which received about $38.9 million in publicly funded voucher payments. The Milwaukee school district in 1999\u20132000 had about 105,000 students enrolled in 165 schools supported by $917 million in total revenues.", "The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction makes voucher payments in four installments during the school year. Similar to Ohio\u2019s program, the voucher check is payable to the voucher family. The Department mails the checks to the schools where the parent or guardian endorses them to the schools. If the school cannot obtain a signature because, for example, the student is no longer enrolled, it returns the check to the Department. The school keeps the lesser of the voucher amount or an amount equal to their per-pupil operating and debt service costs as determined by an independent financial audit. Because a school\u2019s actual costs may be less than the maximum allowable payment, and because of other factors that may require adjustments to payments\u2014such as audited enrollment reports\u2014the Department makes adjustments after the completion of the school year. Schools with lower costs must return excess payments, and schools that gain students receive an additional amount.", "Wisconsin has required the Department of Public Instruction and the Legislative Audit Bureau to evaluate the voucher program. The Department contracted with an independent researcher to conduct an evaluation over the first 5 years of the program. The evaluation focused on students\u2019 academic achievement, at a time when student and private school participation was limited to less than one-tenth of what it was in 1999\u20132000 and was limited to nonreligious schools. The evaluation was terminated at the end of school year 1994\u201395, and data on students\u2019 characteristics have not been collected for an evaluation since then, nor has student academic achievement been evaluated. Three teams conducted research on Milwaukee\u2019s voucher program during its early years: (1) the contract researchers, a group of investigators affiliated with the Department of Political Science and the Robert M. La Follette Institute of Public Affairs, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison; (2) the Harvard team that also conducted research on the Cleveland program; and (3) a researcher affiliated with Princeton University. All three teams used the data set on Milwaukee voucher and public school students and parents created by the contract researcher team. All three teams also analyzed students\u2019 academic achievement as measured by scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills administered by the Milwaukee school district in school years 1990\u201391 to 1993\u201394.", "In addition to the Cleveland and Milwaukee voucher programs, state- funded voucher programs operate in Florida, Maine, and Vermont. Although not an integral part of this review, some information on these three additional state programs is provided to help put the Cleveland and Milwaukee programs in a more complete context of publicly funded voucher programs. The Florida voucher program began operating in the 1999\u20132000 school year. The program provides a private school choice to students whose public schools have been judged by the state as failing. The Maine and Vermont programs have been operating for more than 100 years and provide for the private, secular education of students whose public school districts do not have sufficient school capacity. More detail on the Florida, Maine, and Vermont voucher programs is provided in appendix II.", "Although not a direct sponsor of voucher programs, the federal government in the past has sponsored research into alternative educational programs, including a voucher program operated in a public school system. The National Institute of Education sponsored research on an education voucher demonstration program begun during the 1972\u201373 school year in six schools of the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District of San Jose, California. In this demonstration, parents could choose from among these six public schools and receive a voucher equal to the cost of the child\u2019s education at that school. The voucher amount was paid to the chosen school when the child enrolled. After a 5-year implementation period, an evaluation found little difference in the benefits to students of the voucher and regular school programs. The U.S. Department of Education is considering funding a grant to study Florida\u2019s school accountability system, which may include the voucher program and its effect on improving school quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cleveland and Milwaukee Voucher Programs Have Similar Student and Private School Eligibility Criteria", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with state laws and regulations for student and school participation in the Cleveland and Milwaukee voucher programs, both programs target students from low-income families residing within the city or school district.

Generally, first-time program enrollees must be in kindergarten or grades one, two, or three. Priority for a voucher award is given to students from families whose income is less than 200 percent of federal poverty guidelines. However, the state determines the number of new vouchers that will be awarded each year within the limitations of the amount of annual program funds appropriated. Any student who has received a voucher in the preceding year may continue to receive one until the student has completed grade eight. Assuming students\u2019 residency requirements are maintained, school admission priority is given to students who were enrolled in the school during the preceding year and to siblings of these students, at the school\u2019s discretion. A student\u2019s family income is also a key eligibility criterion for determining the monetary size of the voucher award offered each student. Students who meet the low-income definition qualify for a voucher amount equal to 90 percent of school tuition, not to exceed $2,250. This voucher amount has not changed over time. Students not meeting the low-income definition qualify for 75 percent of the tuition amount, not to exceed $1,875.", "For the Milwaukee voucher program, all students must reside within the city of Milwaukee and come from families whose incomes do not exceed 175 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. In addition, in the year prior to entering the program, the student must have been enrolled in either a Milwaukee public school or in kindergarten, first, second, or third grade in a Milwaukee private school; or not enrolled in any school.

However, the state also allows public schools located in any school district adjacent to the Cleveland school district to participate in the voucher program. No public schools have chosen to participate. Participating private schools must be registered with the Ohio State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Registered schools must adhere to a variety of requirements such as (1) not discriminating on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background; (2) agreeing not to charge tuition to low-income voucher families in excess of 10 percent of the maximum voucher amount or the established school tuition, if lower; and (3) permitting any such tuition over the voucher amount, at the discretion of the parent, to be satisfied by the low-income family\u2019s provision of in-kind contributions or services.

These standards provide guidance and direction on such things as a school\u2019s educational goals, curriculum and instruction, teacher qualifications, instructional materials and equipment, and the quantity and quality of facilities. In addition, schools\u2019 educational programs must be evaluated at least once every 5 years in accordance with professionally recognized criteria and procedures.

For example, if the number of Cleveland vouchers to be awarded to first-time voucher applicants in any school year is less than the number of eligible applicants, the state program office uses a random selection process in which low- income applicants are given priority. The director of the Cleveland voucher program stated that random selection has generally been used at some point during each year\u2019s selection process. However, if the number of available vouchers exceeds the number of low-income applicants, applicants above the low-income threshold may be awarded the remaining vouchers. Once first-time voucher applicants have been awarded a voucher, they seek enrollment in a voucher-participating school. After enrolling voucher students who attended a voucher school during the preceding year or siblings of those students, schools must admit low- income, first-time voucher students by random selection if potential enrollees exceed the number of spaces in the school. The school is to admit such students to kindergarten, first, second, and third grades up to 20 percent of the total number of students enrolled in the school during the preceding year for those grades. The extent to which schools have used random selection for their enrollments is unknown because the voucher program office has not monitored its use.", "In the Milwaukee voucher program, participating schools must be located within the city of Milwaukee. They must also be private schools as defined in Wisconsin statute, which requires them to provide at least 875 hours of instruction each school year and to have a sequentially progressive curriculum of instruction in subjects such as mathematics and reading. Schools must also meet applicable health and safety codes; meet at least one of the state performance standards, such as for academic progress or attendance; and comply with federal antidiscrimination laws. Participating schools are subject to uniform financial accounting standards and must submit an annual independent financial audit to the state. Similar to the Cleveland program, a key provision is the use of a random selection process when the number of eligible applicants exceeds the number of spaces a school has designated for students. Each school has discretion in setting the number of voucher students it will accommodate in each grade and must specify this number at the time it notifies the state of its intent to participate in the program. Each school must also submit an annual written plan describing its intended method for randomly selecting voucher students when the number of applicant voucher students exceeds the number of available spaces allocated for them. As in Cleveland, the extent to which schools have used random selection is unknown because schools are not required to report on its use.

A school was defined as racially isolated when 90 percent or more of the enrolled students were members of a minority group or white.", "One study of the Cleveland voucher program identified the proportion of students attending racially isolated public schools in Cleveland and its suburbs, and in private schools participating in the voucher program. For example, at the beginning of the 1999\u20132000 school year, two-fifths of Cleveland public school students attended schools that had fewer than 10 percent white students and more than three-fifths of suburban public school students attended schools in which the student body was more than 90 percent white. When the researcher combined the public schools in these metropolitan areas, he found that 60.5 percent of the students attended schools that either had more than 90 percent or fewer than 10 percent white students. On the other hand, among Cleveland\u2019s voucher students, fewer than two-fifths attended a private school that had fewer than 10 percent white students and less than one-fifth attended a private school that had more than 90 percent white students. On the basis of such comparisons, the researcher concluded that school choice helps promote integration. However, factors other than the Cleveland voucher program\u2014 such as all population groups\u2019 moves into and out of the city, their birth and death rates, and students\u2019 movement among schools and school systems\u2014that contributed to the racial and ethnic composition of Cleveland\u2019s public and private schools were not identified or isolated in the analysis.", "Two studies of the Milwaukee voucher program examined the proportion of public school students and voucher students who attended racially isolated schools and reached conclusions about the effect of the Milwaukee voucher program on voucher students\u2019 racial isolation. One study examined the proportion of students attending racially isolated schools in the 1998\u201399 school year and found that approximately 20 percent more Milwaukee public school students attended racially isolated schools than did voucher students who attended 26 Catholic elementary schools. The authors concluded that the Milwaukee voucher program appeared to have increased racial and ethnic enrollment balance for students participating in the program and for students at participating private schools. However, the 26 Catholic elementary schools examined in this study were not selected randomly and represented only 41 percent of the 63 religious schools participating in the voucher program in the 1998\u2013 99 school year.", "The second study, which examined the proportion of Milwaukee students who attended racially isolated schools in the 1999\u20132000 school year, found that 50.3 percent of Milwaukee public school students attended schools that were racially isolated. Among the 86 private schools participating in the voucher program that year, students attending religiously affiliated voucher schools had a different experience than students attending voucher schools with no religious affiliation. Among the 56 religiously affiliated voucher schools, 30.1 percent of the students attended racially isolated schools. Among the 30 private voucher schools with no religious affiliation, 83.1 percent of students attended racially isolated schools. The authors concluded that the addition of religiously affiliated schools had led to a lower level of racial isolation in private schools participating in the voucher program than in Milwaukee public schools. However, neither this study, nor the first study of Milwaukee students\u2019 racial isolation, ruled out routinely occurring demographic changes, such as births, deaths, moves into and out of the city, or students\u2019 movement among schools and school systems, as factors contributing to the proportion of racially isolated schools they identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Fund Voucher Programs Differently and Spend Less on Each Voucher Student Than on Each Public School Student", "paragraphs": ["Ohio and Wisconsin use different methods to fund their school voucher programs and spend less on each voucher student than on each public school student.

Based on this appropriation, the Cleveland school district\u2019s $80.5 million in Disadvantaged Pupil Impact Aid was reduced by $11.2 million to $69.3 million. In the context of the school district\u2019s revenues from all sources for 1999\u20132000, the $11.2 million amounted to nearly 1.6 percent of the district\u2019s $712.1 million total. Actual voucher program expenditures were $6.2 million\u2014only 55.4 percent of what was appropriated. Voucher program expenditures are charged to a designated state account and the Cleveland school district does not monitor the program\u2019s expenditures. School district officials stated that the district has not obtained additional property tax levies for the purpose of recovering state revenue deductions from the district\u2019s Disadvantaged Pupil Impact Aid funds. According to these officials, the last major school levy for funding school operations was passed in 1996 and provided $67 million to the district annually over a period of 5 years.", "The state of Wisconsin funds the Milwaukee voucher program from a separate general-purpose revenue appropriation. The state deducts the amount of the appropriation from general school aid payments to all 426 school districts statewide. Once the state determines the total amount needed to fund the voucher program for the year, it reduces the aid payable to the Milwaukee public school district by half that amount. The other half of program funding is drawn from aid authorized for the remaining 425 school districts in proportion to the total state aid to which each district is entitled. The school districts have the option of increasing property tax levies to offset reductions in general state aid related to the voucher program. According to a Milwaukee school district official, the district has generally levied taxes to the maximum extent possible under state school revenue limits. For the 1999\u20132000 school year, the Milwaukee school district absorbed half of the voucher program\u2019s $38.9 million cost.", "That amount, $19.45 million, represented about 2.1 percent of the district\u2019s $917 million in total revenues.", "Because there are no definitive studies, state and school district officials did not have definitive explanations as to what extent the voucher programs negatively or positively affected the Cleveland or Milwaukee public school districts. In Cleveland, with the exception of a public accounting firm\u2019s management study touching on this issue, state and school district officials were unaware of any studies addressing the financial impact of the voucher program. Official and unofficial studies of the Milwaukee voucher program have described possible effects ranging from slightly negative to indeterminate. According to some of these studies, changing the assumptions of such studies could modify the results. Assumptions, for example, could include estimates of the number of voucher students who were formerly enrolled in the public school districts and where they might have been enrolled in the absence of a voucher program. In addition, the amount of funding that the Milwaukee public school district has received from state revenues and local property tax levies has been affected by policy decisions that have not necessarily been driven by the voucher programs. For example, the Milwaukee public school district has experienced an increase in total state aid, largely because of the state\u2019s policy of funding two-thirds of certain school costs beginning in the 1996\u201397 school year. In Cleveland, local school revenues are not based on enrollments. Consequently, when students leave public schools to attend private schools, the public school retains the same amount of local revenue and thus has a higher expenditure of local funds per pupil. However, in Milwaukee, the amount that may be contributed from the local tax levy is determined by the difference between the school revenue cap and state school aid, which are based on the school district\u2019s enrollment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Both Ohio and Wisconsin Spend Less on Each Voucher Student Than on Each Public School Student", "paragraphs": ["Ohio provides less state revenue for each voucher student than for each public school student in the Cleveland school district. For example, on a per-student basis, the state spent $1,832 on voucher payments for each voucher student and program administration, compared to $4,910 for each Cleveland school district student for the 1999\u20132000 school year. The $4,910 per public school student paid by the state does not include the per student amounts of $3,212 in local taxes and $745 in federal funds that were received by the Cleveland school district for the same year.", "Two factors may help to explain why the amount spent by the state for voucher students was only about 37 percent of the amount the state spent for public school students in Cleveland. First, the private schools participating in the program generally have low tuition. For example, the estimated average voucher amount for low-income students at 33 Catholic schools was $1,592 in 1999\u20132000, which is well below the maximum voucher amount of $2,250. Several representatives from participating religious schools stated that their schools\u2019 missions were to provide a private-school education to children in their communities, many of whom come from low-income families. The schools purposely subsidize the cost of educating all enrolled students to achieve this mission. Representatives from nonreligious schools with higher tuition (about $4,000) stated that they could afford to accommodate just a few voucher students because they must find corporate or other sponsors to subsidize the difference between the maximum voucher amount allowed and the tuition charged. Second, the maximum voucher amount ($2,250 for low-income students) established by the Ohio legislature at the beginning of the voucher program appears to have limited the program primarily to low-tuition religious schools. The 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals stated in December 2000 that, practically speaking, the tuition restrictions mandated by the statute limit the ability of nonreligious private schools to participate in the program, since religious schools often have lower overhead costs, supplemental income from private donations, and consequently lower tuition needs. In the 1999\u20132000 school year, 90 percent of the participating schools were religious and 97 percent of the voucher students attended these schools.", "Wisconsin also provides less state revenue for voucher students than for public school students in the Milwaukee school district. For 1999\u20132000, the estimated number of voucher students was 7,621\u2014therefore the total budgeted amount for just the cost of voucher payments was about $38.9 million, or $5,106 per voucher student. By comparison, this per-student voucher amount is about 85 percent of the $6,011 per student in state aid received by the Milwaukee school district. The $6,011 per public school student paid by the state does not include the per student amounts of $1,573 in local taxes and $1,073 in federal funds that were received by the Milwaukee school district for the 1999\u20132000 school year.", "The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, which administers the voucher program, establishes its budget for the voucher program in two steps. First, it computes a set amount per student\u2014the amount paid in the previous school year to voucher schools plus the amount of per-student revenue increase provided to public school districts taking into account revenue limits in the current year. For example, the 1999\u20132000 per-student payment of $5,106 was based on the 1998\u201399 per-student payment of $4,894 plus $212, the statewide per-student increase. The second step is estimating the number of students who will participate in the voucher program.

Under this study design, the Harvard team isolated the effect of the voucher program by controlling for factors related to students\u2019 assignment to schools.

Although voucher programs represent a small segment of school choice options, interest in the academic achievement of voucher program students is likely to continue and new evaluations of voucher program initiatives may be undertaken in the future. The studies we reviewed offer some useful lessons on the difficulties in achieving definitive assessments of voucher programs and of other alternative education programs targeted to low-income or disadvantaged students.", "First, reliance on administrative data for achievement test scores and student background information can conserve time and resources in data collection where school records are complete and the data system is automated, as in Milwaukee. However, even when complete and automated records are available, reliance on scores from school- administered tests can result in data gaps if the school district changes its testing policy, as did the Milwaukee system. On the other hand, when the evaluation team selects and administers the achievement tests, as in Cleveland, the cooperation of all schools in the study population must be negotiated. The separate analysis of Cleveland\u2019s Hope school results in the first-year evaluation, which the contract research team felt was required because the schools had not yet agreed to be tested, limited the applicability of the first-year findings.", "Second, the Milwaukee team\u2019s experience with survey data collection from the program\u2019s low-income families confirms that special data collection and followup procedures are needed to achieve survey response rates that meet minimum data quality standards when low-income households are members of the study population. For example, although the Milwaukee team sent its survey twice to voucher and public school parents, response rates were very low\u2014from 30 to 50 percent. Additional strategies, such as offering respondents a cash incentive and conducting several rounds of follow-up by telephone with nonrespondents, may increase response rates further.", "Finally, vital information about voucher program performance may be lost if adequate funding is not provided for program evaluations. For example, Wisconsin has not funded voucher student academic achievement evaluations since 1995, thereby losing data on program performance during the years when the program had grown the most. Because such school choice initiatives are of national interest, it would be useful to have more definitive research about their effect.

The two designs differ primarily in the way that the comparison groups are developed. In an experimental design, the comparison group is referred to as the control group. This group is composed of students randomly selected from possible program participants, such as applicants to a voucher program. Because control group members are selected randomly, researchers can compare outcomes to determine the program\u2019s effect without using statistical controls for other factors that could have influenced the outcomes. In a quasiexperimental design, the comparison group is composed of individuals who share characteristics with program participants, but who have not been randomly selected and who have may or may not have sought program services. For example, applicants to a voucher program who did not receive a voucher might serve as a comparison group, because they share with voucher recipients an interest in alternative educational services. With this design, statistical controls, such as those provided by a multivariate analysis procedure, are needed to isolate the program from other factors that could influence outcomes.", "The same data quality criteria we discussed above were used for assessing the administrative and survey data used in the impact evaluations.
