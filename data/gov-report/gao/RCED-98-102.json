Customs officials also told us they already have authority to examine private companies\u2019 inbound and outbound express mail but do not have authority to search U.S. Postal Service\u2019s outbound international mail. The Postal Service has long opposed such authority for searching outbound international mail as contrary to its authority to protect the mail from unwarranted searches. Postal Service officials said that Customs neither consulted with them nor provided a copy of the legislative proposal for their review.

Neither Customs nor the Postal Service officials we contacted knew whether there was a focal point for coordinating the Commission\u2019s recommendations. A Customs official said that no one has attempted to mediate the opposing positions between Customs and the Postal Service and that legislative action appears to be the only way to resolve it. However, the Postal Service believes that there is no demonstrated aviation security need for warrantless outbound search authority and that, therefore, the legislation is neither needed nor appropriate in connection with this issue.

The recommendations FAA targeted for completion in fiscal year 1997 built on existing programs and airport relationships and did not require the development and deployment of complex technologies. The purpose of these recommendations was to quickly enhance the capabilities of airport and air carrier personnel in identifying and addressing risks. Table 1 identifies the three recommendations that FAA expected to complete in fiscal year 1997.", "FAA implemented the first recommendation by providing security clearances and granting access to classified information to airport and airline officials. However, a majority of the airport officials we met with questioned the need for clearances, since they believed that the classified information they received was not useful and timely. FAA officials stated that they have attempted to get the maximum amount of information out in unclassified form by obtaining declassified versions of originally classified information from the originating intelligence agencies so that it could be shared with all airport and air carrier security officials whether or not they had security clearances.", "FAA has substantially completed the recommendation to ensure that passengers are positively identified when boarding an aircraft; however, delays have occurred that prevent FAA from considering this recommendation as completed (see fig. 1). Over the past several years, FAA has issued a series of security directives designed to positively identify ticketed passengers and subject them to security procedures. For example, one of the directives establishes procedures for positively identifying passengers by requiring them to provide a valid form of identification at the check-in counter. However, FAA has not yet incorporated these directives and other procedures, as it had planned, into the air carriers\u2019 security program\u2014the Air Carrier Standard Security Program (ACSSP). Amending the ACSSP is taking longer than expected because FAA received many significant comments from air carriers on proposed changes and had to obtain a second round of comments on a revised proposal. FAA also decided to wait until it had addressed some technological issues, such as computer-assisted passenger screening procedures, before completing the ACSSP.

FAA cannot issue new guidance for consortia until it has determined whether airports and air carriers will be subject to penalties when consortia self-disclose security violations. Air carrier and airport officials told us that they do not want to disclose security violations unless they have some assurance that they will not be penalized. FAA\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel is still examining this issue and expects to issue a ruling in April 1998. FAA plans to issue the guidance shortly after the legal ruling. As figure 1 shows, FAA postponed issuing its guidance on consortia for 12 months and extended its date for fully implementing the recommendation\u2014to establish consortia at another 200 airports. The new completion date, December 1998, is 15 months later than originally planned.", "Once FAA has implemented these two recommendations, air carriers will need to follow the revised ACSSP, and airports will need to decide if they want to establish consortia.

This automated screening permits the carriers to focus on the small percentage of passengers who may pose a security risk and whose bags should be screened by explosives detection equipment or matched with the boarding passenger.

No air carriers met this implementation date. Northwest Airlines, however, had this system in place the following month and, in February 1998, two other major air carriers implemented the system. Most of the other major carriers are either testing the system or still integrating it into their reservation systems. FAA also needs to issue a regulation governing this system. FAA\u2019s revised completion date for implementation by all but one of the other major carriers is September 1998\u20149 months past the original implementation date.

FAA has established a panel to review the results and select the best model for assessing a facility\u2019s vulnerabilities. FAA plans to make this model available to those who have responsibility for performing assessments, including FAA inspectors, airports, air carriers, and consortia, to meet the various requirements for conducting assessments and identifying vulnerabilities at individual airports. FAA plans to have this model available in March 1999. Although some delays have occurred in starting these assessments, they have not been significant. The delays occurred in the course of soliciting and awarding contracts to six firms and the Department of the Navy, which will conduct the assessments. FAA has requested $2 million in its fiscal year 1999 budget to perform additional assessments at other airports.", "Second, to address the requirement for joint threat and vulnerability assessments under the Reauthorization Act, FAA and FBI conducted their first assessment in December 1997 and began conducting one to two each month starting in February 1998. These assessments differ from the above effort to develop a model because the results of the joint assessments will be used for comparing threat and vulnerabilities at different airports. By having both threat and vulnerability information, FAA and FBI should be able to determine which airports and areas of airports present the highest risks. Initially, FAA selected a pool of 72 airports, which account for 92 percent of commercial travelers in the United States, as candidates for the joint assessments. In January 1998, FAA and FBI agreed to a schedule for assessing 31 high-risk candidates by the end of calendar year 1999 from the pool of 72 airports. Under the Reauthorization Act, the initial assessments are to be completed by October 9, 1999. According to the schedule for the joint vulnerability assessments, FAA and FBI plan to complete their reviews at 28 of the 31 airports by this date. However, an FAA official acknowledged that as the agencies gain experience in conducting these assessments, they may be able to conduct more per month than scheduled.", "Third, the Reauthorization Act mandates that FAA require airports and air carriers to conduct periodic vulnerability assessments. FAA plans to implement this requirement through a security program change rather than through the rulemaking process. Airports and air carriers will have to incorporate this requirement into their individual security programs. However, before implementing this change, FAA said, it intends to make the standardized model it is currently developing available to both airports and air carriers for use in conducting these assessments.

Several screening company officials we spoke with said that certification was a good idea; others had no comment.", "Improving the training and testing of people hired by these companies to screen passengers\u2019 baggage at airport security checkpoints would also improve aviation security. Currently, the people who are hired to screen baggage attend a standardized classroom training program, but FAA believes that the use of a computerized, self-paced training program would have benefits. FAA began developing such a computerized training and testing system, called the Screener Proficiency Evaluation and Reporting System (SPEARS), well before the Commission issued its initial report and the Reauthorization Act was enacted. As of February 1998, FAA had deployed computer-based training systems for personnel who use X-ray machines for screening carry-on bags at 17 major airports. Deployment is planned for two additional major airports by May 1998. FAA has also awarded a contract to deploy these systems at another 60 airports. As of March 11, 1998, FAA had decided to deploy only 15 of the 60 training systems because it lacked necessary funding.

Currently, two different methods are being used to train personnel who screen baggage at security checkpoints: the traditional classroom training and the new computer-based training program. FAA plans to compare the results of the computer-based training, a pilot program, with the currently used classroom training program. FAA must also validate the computer-based training program for the certified explosives detection system before the program can be pilot-tested.", "FAA must analyze the results of the various models being used by contractors to assess the vulnerability of airports.

Some of the rulemaking depends on information obtained in the evaluations. Rulemaking is a multistep process that results in the issuance of final regulations for implementing programs. The rulemaking process may begin with an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This notice, which FAA has issued as a first step in developing a regulation for certifying screening companies, solicits information from affected parties, such as air carriers, airports, and screening companies. Next, FAA must analyze this information and use it to develop a proposed regulation (called a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking), which it then publishes for comment. On the basis of the comments it receives, FAA then revises the proposed regulation, obtains clearance from OMB, and issues the regulation. FAA must issue a regulation within 16 months of the final day of the public comment period on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. If the process includes an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FAA must issue a final rule within 24 months of when the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published.

FAA has changed the completion date for issuing the final regulation for certifying screening companies from March 1999 to March 2000. According to FAA officials, they need the extra time to gather data from the TIP systems to develop and incorporate standards for screener\u2019s performance into the final regulation. In addition, the regulatory process will take time, since screening companies have not previously been regulated by the federal government and screening company representatives have expressed an interest in how these regulations will affect their operations. Some air carriers have also expressed concerns about how a regulation on matching bags and passengers might be structured because its implementation could delay flights. Figure 3 shows FAA\u2019s progress in completing the rulemaking process for these recommendations.", "Although air carriers, airports, and screening companies are taking some steps to implement the recommendations, full implementation will not occur until after FAA has issued various regulations. For example, air carriers and their reservation companies will have to develop and implement a CAPS system and a passenger-bag match program based on an automated passenger profiling system in accordance with FAA\u2019s regulation. FAA plans to issue the regulation by December 1998. As discussed earlier, some air carriers have already voluntarily implemented both of these actions and others expect to do so before the regulation is issued.

During our review, FAA officials told us that FAA did not plan to initiate a rulemaking that would require airports and air carriers to conduct periodic vulnerability assessments as mandated under the Reauthorization Act.

We also met with an official of the National Security Council to determine if it had a role in overseeing actions on all the recommendations.", "We analyzed the 31 aviation security recommendations to determine which ones FAA expected to complete in fiscal year 1997. We reviewed three of the five recommendations in FAA\u2019s tracking system that the reports and other documents targeted for completion in fiscal year 1997. We did not review two other recommendations because one involved an agency other than FAA and the other involved an international security issue. We discussed the status of these recommendations with officials from FAA\u2019s policy and operating offices, analyzed related documents, and discussed their status with airport, air carrier, and screening company officials at the seven airports we visited.", "To determine the progress FAA had made in implementing the key recommendations that were both recommended by the Commission and mandated by the Congress in 1996 and the major issues that needed to be addressed before these recommendations could be fully implemented, we used the requesters\u2019 criteria to determine which of the Commission\u2019s recommendations and the act\u2019s mandates covered the same issues. We identified seven issues in which the recommendations and mandates were substantially similar. We selected five of the seven for review because of their interrelationships and high visibility in improving aviation security. We discussed the status of these recommendations with officials of FAA\u2019s policy and operating offices and analyzed related documents. We also discussed the status of recommendations with airport, air carrier, and screening company officials at seven airports we visited. We met with headquarters officials of Northwest Airlines to discuss the status of the CAPS system.", "We selected the seven airports in order to obtain a wide coverage of airports\u2019 and air carriers\u2019 involvement in implementing the recommendations. Five were major airports that had considerable involvement in implementing the recommendations. Visiting these airports enabled us to obtain the views of airport, air carrier, and screening company officials who had experience with implementing the recommendations and to observe the explosives detection and training equipment in place and the operation of that equipment. Two airports were smaller and had no involvement with the recommendations at the time of our field work. Visiting these airports enabled us to obtain the views of airport, air carrier, and screening company officials on recommendations such as obtaining clearances and forming consortia that were voluntary on the airports\u2019 and air carriers\u2019 part, as well as their views on those recommendations that they would eventually be required to implement. Because of the sensitive nature of aviation security and ongoing efforts at specific airport locations, we are not listing the seven airports we visited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Postal Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["J.
