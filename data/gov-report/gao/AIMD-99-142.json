Additionally, under the TVA Act of 1933  (TVA Act), as amended, TVA is not subject to most of the regulatory and  oversight requirements that must be satisfied by commercial electric  utilities; instead, all authority to run and operate TVA is vested in its three- member board of directors.  In 1959, the Congress amended the TVA Act by  establishing what is commonly referred to as the TVA \u201cfence,\u201d which  prohibits TVA\u2014with some exceptions\u2014from entering into contracts to sell  power outside the service area that TVA and its distributors were serving  on July 1, 1957.  Under EPAct, TVA is exempt from having to allow other  utilities to use its transmission lines to transmit power to customers within  TVA\u2019s service area.  This legislative framework generally insulates TVA  from direct wholesale competition and, as a result, TVA remains in a  position similar to a regulated utility monopoly.", "However, TVA is still subject to some forms of indirect competition.  For  example, TVA has no protection against its industrial customers relocating  outside its service area or businesses deciding not to move to its service  area for reasons related to the cost of power.  In addition, customers can  decide to generate their own power.  Accordingly, TVA is currently subject  to some competitive pressures.", "EPAct\u2019s requirement that utilities make their transmission lines accessible  to other utilities to transmit (wheel) wholesale electricity has enabled  wholesale customers to obtain electricity from a variety of competing  suppliers and has resulted in increased wholesale competition in the  electric utility industry across the United States.  This requirement does not  apply to TVA if the power is going to be consumed within its service  territory.  Most of TVA\u2019s sales are wholesale because they are to its power  distributors.  In addition, continuing deregulation efforts in some states  have led to competition at the retail level.  Industry experts expect that  retail deregulation will continue to occur on a state-by-state basis over the  next several years.  As this occurs, industrial, commercial, and, ultimately,  residential consumers will be able to choose their power supplier from  among several competitors rather than from one utility monopoly, as is  now the case for long distance telephone service and cellular phones.", "Because EPAct exempts TVA from having power wheeled to consumers in  its territory, TVA has not been directly impacted by the ongoing  deregulation of the electric utility industry to the same extent as other  utilities.  However, if TVA were to lose its exemption from the wheeling  provisions of EPAct, its customers would have the option of obtaining their  power from other sources after the expiration of their contracts.  Under  legislation proposed by the administration to promote retail competition in  the electric power industry, which TVA supports, TVA's exemption from the  wheeling provisions of EPAct would be eliminated after January 1, 2003.  If  the legislation is enacted, TVA may be required to use its transmission lines  to transmit the power of other utilities for consumption within TVA's  service territory.  In addition, the proposed legislation would remove the  statutory restrictions that prevent TVA from selling power outside its  service territory.", "Most of TVA\u2019s power is sold to municipal and cooperative power  distributors who would be directly affected in the future by retail  competition through their customers\u2019 ability to choose alternate power  suppliers.  Further, deregulation and the possibility of TVA losing its  legislative protections have made many of TVA\u2019s customers more aware of  price differences among utilities, raised expectations of lower prices, and  increased demands for more competitive pricing.", "Because of these ongoing deregulation efforts, TVA management, like many  industry experts, anticipates that TVA may lose its legislative protections in  the future.  Even if TVA does not lose its legislative protections, TVA\u2019s  management has recognized the need to take action to better position TVA  to be competitive in an era of increasing competition and customer choice  and, in July 1997, issued a 10-year business plan with that goal in mind.   TVA established a 10-year horizon for implementing the key changes  outlined in the plan largely because TVA officials expect to be facing  greater competitive pressures within that time frame and many of its long- term contracts with customers could begin to expire in 2007.  The  published plan, which formed the basis of our evaluation, contains three  strategic objectives: reducing TVA\u2019s cost of power in order to be in a position to offer  competitively priced power in 2007, increasing financial flexibility by reducing fixed costs, and building customer allegiance.", "In developing the 10-year plan, TVA set several goals and made certain  assumptions about the future.  These goals and assumptions are that the future market price of wholesale power will be 3.4 to 3.5 cents per  kilowatthour (kWh) by 2007; annual growth in demand through 2007 will average 2 percent; fuel costs will increase 1.7 percent annually through 2007; improvements in supply chain management will save $50 million  annually;", "TVA\u2019s labor force will be reduced and additional cost savings will be  achieved through the creation of shared services and other initiatives; debt will be reduced by about one-half to about $14 billion, and the  balance of deferred assets will be reduced from $8.5 billion to $500 million\u2014TVA\u2019s estimated net realizable value of these assets; capital expenditures will be limited to about $600 million annually and  increases in demand through 2007 will be met primarily through  purchased power; $200 million will be saved annually through cost improvement initiatives  primarily related to refinancing Federal Financing Bank (FFB) and  public bond debt, pursuing changes to its retirement plan, and  improving business processes; revenues from power sales will be increased by about $325 million  annually by implementing a rate increase in 1998 and maintaining it  through 2007; and customer relations will improve through new contract and pricing  options.", "To implement the 10-year plan, TVA has developed action plans and has  linked the goals and objectives of the 10-year plan to its corporate and  business unit goals.  For example, one of TVA\u2019s corporate goals is to lower  costs; one of the 10-year plan\u2019s strategic objectives is to increase financial  flexibility by reducing fixed costs; and the Fossil and Hydro Power  business unit\u2019s business plan includes a unit goal of maximizing net return  by reducing fixed and variable costs.  However, TVA has not yet completed  the process of developing performance measures to provide accountability.   TVA expects to develop these performance measures later in 1999,  business units will be expected to meet performance goals in 2000, and unit  managers and TVA executives are expected to be held directly accountable  through the use of compensation incentives in 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We evaluated the three strategic objectives of TVA\u2019s plan and the underlying  goals and assumptions for reasonableness, achievability, and  completeness.

These deferred assets, which totaled about $8.5 billion as of the beginning  of the plan period, are primarily the result of investments made since the  1970s in nuclear generating plants that were never put into production.   This helped contribute to TVA\u2019s large debt, which totaled about $27 billion  as of September 30, 1998, and resultant high fixed financing costs.", "TVA\u2019s ability to meet its strategic objective of being in a position to offer  competitively priced power by 2007 and to improve its financial flexibility  hinges largely on its being able to meet its goal of reducing debt by about  one-half\u2014to about $14 billion\u2014by 2007.  While not specifically stated in  the plan, TVA also plans to recover through rates all but $500 million of its  deferred asset costs by the end of the period covered by the plan.", "These issues were highlighted in reports we issued in 1995 and 1997, in  which we stated that TVA\u2019s annual financing costs and deferred assets were  substantially greater than those of the utilities with which TVA would most  likely have to compete.  We also reported that these high fixed costs and  deferred assets would limit TVA\u2019s flexibility to adjust its rates in a  competitive environment.  TVA, through its 10-year plan, is taking steps to  address these issues.  Other utilities are taking similar actions to prepare  for competition.  For example, utilities we previously identified as those  most likely to compete with TVA are also taking steps to refinance debt at  lower interest rates and accelerate recovery of the costs of their regulatory  assets.  However, as we reported in 1995 and 1997, these other utilities  generally have fewer financing costs and deferred assets than TVA, giving  them more flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.  To the  extent TVA recovers the costs of its deferred assets and increases its  financial flexibility, it will increase its ability to adjust rates as necessary to  meet changing market conditions.  TVA\u2019s focus on these areas before the  full advent of competition is key to its chances of being competitive  without legislative protections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Does Not Include Certain Major Costs", "paragraphs": ["The 10-year plan includes costs that correspond to those incurred in prior  years and to those reported by other utilities.

Specifically, the plan does not include the  following:", "The capital costs of additional generating capacity that may be acquired  to meet growth in demand for power.

These appropriations, which  amounted to $70 million in fiscal year 1998, are expected to be  substantially reduced or discontinued beginning in fiscal year 2000.", "By not including these costs, TVA will have less cash than contemplated in  the plan to pay down debt and reduce fixed costs, which could jeopardize  full achievement of the plan\u2019s objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Plan Does Not Include Costs Associated With Investing in New Generating Capacity", "paragraphs": ["TVA estimates that the demand for peaking power in its service territory  through 2007 will exceed its current and planned generating capacity.  TVA  currently has several options planned or underway to meet a portion of this  excess demand, including (1) purchasing new gas-fired combustion  turbines, (2) purchasing power that was already under contract when the  10-year plan was issued, (3) modernizing hydro facilities, (4) improving the  efficiency of certain existing fossil plants and combustion turbines, (5) contracting for the power from a new lignite plant, (6) upgrading  certain nuclear plants, and (7) issuing a request for proposal for purchasing  power generated from renewable resources.  TVA projected that these  measures would not be sufficient to meet the entire increase in demand,  and the 10-year plan assumes that TVA will purchase power from other  utilities to make up the difference, which is inconsistent with prior year  practices.", "However, since the plan was finalized, TVA officials have told us that they  plan to evaluate other power supply options and to invest in new capacity if  the resulting long-term increase in costs to produce power (interest and  operating expense) would ultimately be less than the cost of purchased  power.  TVA has already decided to invest in new capacity rather than  purchasing power in at least one case\u2014in 1998, TVA announced plans to  purchase eight gas-fired combustion turbine units that will be used to  replace a like amount of purchased peaking power that was assumed in the  original plan.", "According to TVA officials, while they expect this decision to result in a  positive cash flow by fiscal year 2010, the decision to purchase these units  will require about $65 million more in cash disbursements through 2007  than would have been necessary to purchase a comparable amount of  power from other utilities.  But, according to TVA\u2019s analysis, while  acquiring this new generating capacity in lieu of purchasing power will  initially increase capital expenditures and thus reduce the amount of cash  available to pay down debt, it will also decrease TVA\u2019s annual cost of power  because it will be less expensive for TVA to operate this new equipment  than to purchase a like amount of power from other utilities.  Decreasing  the cost of power should, in the long term, improve TVA\u2019s ability to meet its  ultimate objective of offering competitively priced power.  In addition,  purchasing new generating capacity provides the added benefit of  removing the uncertainty of having to rely on another utility for power.   Based on our discussions with TVA officials, while it may make economic  sense in the long term, additional decisions to increase capacity in lieu of  purchasing power from other utilities will likely further reduce TVA\u2019s cash  available for debt reduction through 2007, thus jeopardizing its ability to  fully meet the plan\u2019s debt reduction goals by 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Does Not Include Costs of Complying With Environmental Regulations", "paragraphs": ["The 10-year plan does not include estimated costs of complying with recent  and proposed environmental regulations because TVA did not believe the  costs were estimable at the time the plan was developed.  Since that time,  some of these costs have become estimable.", "In October 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a  regulation requiring states to develop plans to reduce nitrogen oxide  emissions.  TVA now estimates that it could spend about $500 million to  $600 million for capital modifications to its fossil plants to comply with  state plans that would be implemented under this regulation, which is  commonly referred to as the NOx SIP Call.  The time frame for TVA\u2019s  compliance with the states\u2019 plans is 2003, within the scope of the 10-year  plan.  In October 1998, EPA also issued a proposed regulation regarding  regional haze, which EPA expects to be put into effect during the life of  the plan but for which EPA does not expect compliance until after 2004.   TVA has estimated that this regulation could require capital expenditures of  about $450 million to $500 million.  It is likely that at least a portion of these  costs will be incurred during the time frame of the 10-year plan.  Additionally, all of the estimated $500 million to $600 million in costs  related to the NOx SIP Call will be incurred during the plan time frame and,  thus, will negatively impact TVA\u2019s ability to meet its cost reduction goals.   However, as discussed later, TVA officials told us that they still believe TVA  will be in a position to offer competitively priced power in 2007 because  these same types of costs will be incurred by many other power suppliers  and therefore would tend to increase the future market price of power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Does Not Include Costs of Nonpower Programs Formerly Funded Through Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["The plan does not include the costs of nonpower programs that historically  have been funded through appropriations but now are likely to be funded  through power revenues.

The combined  range of EIA and DRI estimates was 3.57 cents to 4.35 cents per kWh.

TVA officials stated that the new environmental regulations  would likely drive up the market price of power and affect many utilities  similarly.  Any upward revision in the projected price of wholesale power in  2007 would have a positive impact on TVA\u2019s ability to achieve the objectives  of the plan and would help offset some of the previously identified costs  that are not currently considered in the plan\u2014specifically, costs for the  new environmental regulations.", "However, the extent to which new environmental regulations affect any  utility depends on the type and condition of its generating equipment, the  portion of its power generated by coal, and the types of controls it chooses  to meet the new environmental regulations.

Although deregulation of the electric utility industry is expected to put  downward pressure on rates, the 10-year plan assumes that TVA will not  have to offer any additional price breaks to its large industrial customers  through 2007.
