For example, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 required drinking water facilities serving populations greater than 3,300 to complete vulnerability assessments, but no such requirement exists for wastewater facilities. While federal law governing wastewater security is limited, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 designated EPA as the lead agency to oversee the security of the water sector, including both drinking water and wastewater. The directive tasked EPA with several responsibilities, including the development of mechanisms for information sharing and analysis within the water sector. Our survey of over 200 of the nation's large wastewater facilities shows that many have made security improvements since 9/11. Most facilities indicated they have completed, have under way, or plan to complete some type of security assessment. Similarly, more than half of responding facilities indicated they did not use potentially dangerous gaseous chlorine as a wastewater disinfectant. Survey responses show that other security measures taken after 9/11 have generally focused on controlling access to the treatment plant through improvements in visual surveillance, security lighting, and employee and visitor identification. Little effort, however, has been made to address collection system vulnerabilities, as many facilities cited the technical complexity and expense involved in securing collection systems that cover large areas and have many access points. Others reported that taking other measures, such as converting from gaseous chlorine, took priority over collection system protections. While EPA and DHS have initiatives to address wastewater facility security, efforts to provide critical and threat-related information would benefit from closer coordination. EPA and DHS fund multiple information services designed to communicate information to the water sector--specifically, EPA funds the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC) and its Water Security Channel, while DHS funds the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN). EPA, DHS, and other industry experts are concerned that these multiple information services may overlap and produce inefficiencies. For example, a substantial part of the $2 million annual grant EPA uses to fund the WaterISAC is dedicated to purchasing computer services likely available through DHS and HSIN at no cost. A Water Sector Coordinating Council was established by the water sector to help determine the appropriate relationship among these information services. A preliminary review is under way to examine options for improving coordination between the WaterISAC, the Water Security Channel, and HSIN; however, the scope and time frame for completion of this review is unclear."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Wastewater facilities in the United States provide essential services to  residential, commercial, and industrial users by collecting and treating  wastewater and discharging treated effluent into receiving waters.

For example, damage to a wastewater facility or collection  system could prevent water from being treated, impacting downriver water  intakes. Destroying tanks that hold large amounts of chemicals at  treatment plants could release toxic chemical agents, such as gaseous  chlorine, that can be deadly if inhaled and, at lower doses, could burn eyes  and skin and inflame the lungs.

The experts noted that security-enhancing activities that  most warrant federal support include replacing gaseous chemicals used in  wastewater treatment with less hazardous alternatives; improving local,  state, and regional collaboration efforts; and completing vulnerability  assessments for individual wastewater systems. When asked how federal  wastewater security funds should be allocated among potential recipients,  the vast majority of experts suggested that wastewater utilities serving  critical infrastructure (e.g., public health institutions, government,  commercial, and industrial centers) should be given the highest priority.  Other recipients warranting highest priority included utilities using large  quantities of gaseous chemicals and utilities serving areas with large  populations.", "As a follow-on to that review, this report examines: (1) what federal  statutory authorities and directives govern the protection of wastewater  treatment facilities from terrorist attack, (2) what steps critical wastewater  treatment facilities have taken since the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, (hereafter referred to as \u201c9/11\u201d) to ensure that potential  vulnerabilities are addressed, and (3) what steps the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  have taken to help these facilities in their efforts to address such  vulnerabilities.", "To identify federal statutory authorities and directives that govern  protection of wastewater treatment facilities, we reviewed applicable laws;  Homeland Security Presidential Directives; and EPA and DHS policies,  guidance, and regulations related to wastewater security.

Together, these facilities  provide wastewater service to approximately 36 percent of the U.S.  population served by POTWs. We received an 82 percent response rate to  the survey. To determine what steps EPA and DHS have taken to help these  facilities in their efforts to address such vulnerabilities, we reviewed  relevant EPA and DHS guidance and other documents, and interviewed  agency personnel.

A relative handful of large wastewater systems serve the  great majority of people, as about 500 large public wastewater systems  provide service to 62 percent of the population connected to a sewer  system. In addition to serving residential populations, approximately  27,000 commercial and industrial facilities rely on wastewater treatment  facilities to treat their wastewater. POTWs discharge treated effluent into  receiving waters and are regulated under the Clean Water Act.", "Wastewater systems vary by size and other factors, but all include a  collection system and a treatment facility.", "The collection system is the underground network of sewers including  both sanitary and storm water collection lines. Collection systems tend  to be dispersed geographically and have multiple access points,  including drains, catch basins, and manholes. Lines may range from 4  inches to greater than 20 feet in diameter, and access is usually  conducted through manholes that are typically 300 feet apart. Many  collection systems rely on gravity to maintain the flow of sewage  through the pipes toward the treatment plant. However, collection  systems may also depend on pumping stations to propel the flow when  gravity alone is insufficient. Nationwide, there are approximately  800,000 miles of sewer lines and 100,000 major pumping stations.", "The wastewater treatment facility receives wastewater from the  collection system and begins the treatment process which typically  involves several stages before treated effluent is released into receiving  waters. Primary treatment includes removal of larger objects through a  screening device or a grit removal system, and the removal of solids  through sedimentation. Secondary stage treatment includes a biological  process that consumes pollutants, as well as final sedimentation. Some  facilities also use tertiary treatment to remove nutrients and other  matter even further. Following these treatments, the wastewater is  disinfected to destroy harmful bacteria and viruses. Disinfection is often  accomplished with chlorine, which is stored in gaseous or liquid form  on-site at the wastewater treatment plant. The collection system and  treatment process is typically monitored and controlled by a  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, which  allows utilities to control such things as the amount of chlorine needed  for disinfection.", "Wastewater treatment facilities may possess certain characteristics that  terrorists could exploit either to impair the wastewater treatment process  or to damage surrounding communities and infrastructure. For example,  the numerous storm drains, manholes, and sewers that make up a  community\u2019s wastewater collection system\u2019s network of sewers could be  used to covertly place explosives beneath a major population center or to  introduce substances that may damage a wastewater treatment plant\u2019s  process. Damage to (or destruction of) tanks that hold large amounts of  gaseous chlorine used to disinfect wastewater could release the potentially  lethal gas into the atmosphere.

Fumes from the solvent ignited, and the resulting  explosions collapsed a 12-foot diameter pipe and damaged more than 2  miles of streets. No one was seriously injured, but sewer line repairs  took 20 months, followed by several more months to repair the streets.", "In 1992 in Guadalajara, Mexico, a gasoline leak into a sewer caused  explosions that killed 215 people, injured 1,500 others, damaged 1,600  buildings, and destroyed 1.25 miles of sewer.", "In 2002 in Hagerstown, Maryland, chemicals from an unknown source  entered the wastewater treatment plant and destroyed the facility\u2019s  biological treatment process.

For example, the 1990 Clean  Air Act amendments mandated EPA oversight of risk management  planning at facilities that handle more than specified-threshold quantities  of hazardous substances, including the gaseous chlorine often used as a  disinfectant at wastewater facilities. Specifically, EPA regulations  implementing the Clean Air Act require these facilities to prepare Risk  Management Plans (RMPs) that summarize the potential threat of sudden,  accidental, large releases of certain chemicals; including the results  occurring off-site in a worst-case chemical accident, and the facility\u2019s plan  to prevent releases and mitigate any damage. RMPs are to be revised and  resubmitted to EPA at least every 5 years, and EPA is required to review  them and require revisions, if necessary.", "For a March 2003 report, EPA told us it believed the Clean Air Act could be  interpreted to provide authority to address site security from terrorist  attacks at RMP facilities, because the act imposes certain requirements on  these facilities regarding \u201caccidental releases.\u201d The act defines an  accidental release as an unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or  other extremely hazardous substance into the air, so any chemical release  caused by a terrorist attack could be considered \u201cunanticipated\u201d and  covered under the Clean Air Act. Such an interpretation would provide EPA  with authority under the act\u2019s RMP provisions and general duty clause to  require security measures or vulnerability assessments with regard to  terrorism. However, EPA has not attempted to use these Clean Air Act  provisions because it is concerned that such an interpretation would pose  significant litigation risk and has concluded that chemical facility security  would be more effectively addressed by passage of specific legislation.", "Wastewater facilities that store certain amounts of hazardous chemicals  may also be subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.   Under regulations implementing the act, facilities that house hazardous  waste generally must take certain security actions, such as posting warning  signs and using a 24-hour surveillance system, or surrounding the active  portion of the facility with a barrier and controlled entry gates. However,  according to EPA, these security measures are aimed at keeping out  trespassers or wanderers, not intentional intruders.", "Other federal statutes impose safety requirements on certain wastewater  facilities that may incidentally reduce the likelihood and mitigate the  consequences of terrorist attacks. For example, the Occupational Safety  and Health Act imposes a number of safety requirements, including a  general duty to furnish a workplace free from recognized hazards that may  cause death or serious physical harm to employees. The Emergency  Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires owners of facilities  that maintain specified quantities of certain extremely hazardous  chemicals to submit information annually on their chemical inventory to  state and local emergency response officials.

The CWSRF is an EPA-administered program that provides  grants to the states to fund a variety of water-quality projects, including  those at municipal wastewater treatment facilities. States may use the  funds to provide loans to local governments to assist wastewater utilities in  making infrastructure improvements needed to protect public health and  ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act. According to EPA, states may  use the CWSRF to assist utilities in completing a variety of security-related  actions, such as vulnerability assessments, contingency plans, and  emergency response plans. In addition, EPA has identified other  infrastructure improvements that may be eligible for funding, such as the  conversion from gaseous chemicals to alternative treatment processes,  installation of fencing or security cameras, securing large sanitary sewers,  and installing tamper-proof manholes. In our January 2005 report  summarizing experts\u2019 views on wastewater security, a number of experts  expressed caution about relying heavily on the CWSRF program to support  security enhancements, largely because of the time-lag in obtaining funds  for security-related measures, and because such demands on the CWSRF  would divert needed funding away from the kind of critical infrastructure  investments that are the CWSRF program\u2019s primary purpose.", "Another source of federal funding potentially available for wastewater  security-related measures is the State Homeland Security Grant Program  administered by DHS.

For example, one facility manager we interviewed  expressed a need for federal guidance and best practices on collection  system security. For its part, in 2002, EPA provided funding to the  American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) to develop a set of security  guidance documents that cover the design of online contaminant  monitoring systems, and physical security enhancements of drinking water,  wastewater, and storm water infrastructure systems. ASCE sub-contracted  with American Water Works Association and the Water Environment  Federation (WEF) for assistance on this project. In 2004 these documents  were released as interim voluntary security design standards for the water  sector and finalized standards are to be established in late 2006 or early  2007.

EPA funded the development and  dissemination of several risk assessment methodologies to assist water  sector utilities in identifying how to better protect their critical  infrastructures. In addition, EPA funded training for wastewater utilities on  how to conduct risk assessments and update or complete emergency  response plans. EPA provided funding to the Association of Metropolitan  Sewerage Agencies to develop a software tool, called the Vulnerability  Self Assessment Tool (VSAT), for drinking water utilities. In addition,  through an interagency agreement with EPA, the Department of Energy\u2019s  Sandia National Laboratories provided training to selected firms in a  vulnerability assessment methodology developed by the labs, called the  Risk Assessment Methodology for Water Utilities (RAM-W). For  vulnerability assessments at smaller water systems, EPA supported the  dissemination of the Security and Emergency Management System (SEMS)  software tool.", "Sixty-nine wastewater facilities responding to our survey indicated they  used, were currently using, or planned to use the VSAT software to  complete a vulnerability or security assessment; 27 facilities indicated they  either used, were currently using, or planned to use the RAM-W assessment  tool. Another four facilities indicated they either used, were currently  using, or planned to use the SEMS software.", "EPA has also reorganized its own internal structure and sought input from  experts outside of the agency to better assist the wastewater industry\u2019s  security efforts. In particular, in 2003, EPA created a Water Security  Division to work with the states, tribes, drinking water and wastewater  utilities, and other partners to enhance the security of water and  wastewater utilities and the ability to respond effectively to security threats  and breaches. In addition, in 2004, the National Drinking Water Advisory  Council (NDWAC), at EPA\u2019s request, established a Water Security Working  Group made up of 16 members from wastewater utilities, drinking water  utilities, and environmental and rate-setting organizations to advise on the  development of best security practices and policies for water utilities. The  group advises the NDWAC on ways to address several specific security  needs of the sector. In June 2005, the working group provided NDWAC with  a report that identified features of an active and effective security program  and ways to measure the adoption of these practices.", "As noted, EPA provided funding to ASCE to develop a set of security  guidance documents that cover the design of online contaminant  monitoring systems, and physical security enhancements of drinking water,  wastewater, and storm water infrastructure systems. This effort, called the  Water Infrastructure Security Enhancement project, is to address physical  infrastructure security needs in the water sector by issuing guidance  documents, training materials, and voluntary standards relating to water  infrastructure security. The project group is currently developing physical  security standards that focus on physical security upgrades to reduce risk  to water, wastewater, and storm water arising from malevolent acts.", "For its part, DHS has two broad initiatives that have facilitated efforts to  improve wastewater security. First, the Buffer Zone Protection program is  a DHS grant program designed to reduce specific vulnerabilities at a critical  infrastructure or key resource site by assisting local law enforcement to  develop a plan for preventative and protective measures that make it more  difficult for terrorists to plan or launch attacks from the immediate vicinity  of the site. They also identify equipment that could be purchased to  mitigate the vulnerabilities. Upon plan approval, DHS grants funds for  procuring materials and equipment necessary for implementation of the  site\u2019s buffer zone protection plan. According to DHS, as of October 31,  2005, security at 14 wastewater facilities has been reviewed under the  Buffer Zone Protection program.", "Under its second broad initiative, the Site Assistance Visits program, DHS  visits critical infrastructure sites nationwide to address key areas of  concern at facilities requiring security enhancements. DHS subject matter  experts in the areas of physical security measures, system  interdependencies, and terrorist attack prevention conduct these visits\u2014 generally lasting 1 to 3 days\u2014in which, among other things, the  vulnerabilities of the site or facility are identified and mitigation options are  discussed. According to DHS, as of October 31, 2005, a total of 350 site  assessment visits have been conducted. Of this total, seven were conducted  with wastewater facilities.", "In addition to these programs, DHS funded a NACWA project to develop a  decision tree and report template to help water systems assess and  examine chlorine gas alternatives for water and wastewater disinfection.  The decision tree guides water systems in evaluating the potential costs  and benefits of conversion and determining whether an alternative  disinfection method will still enable them to meet their permit  requirements. The report template is to ensure that the results of the  decision tree analysis are reported in a consistent format, improving a  water system\u2019s ability to pursue and secure any available state or federal  funding for conversion. According to a NACWA representative, they are in  the process of finishing the design of the decision tool and, once the final  product is reviewed and approved by DHS, printing of the CD tool will  begin. NACWA expects to make the tool available to water and wastewater  utilities free of charge no later than the end of March 2006.", "While EPA and DHS have these wastewater security-related initiatives  under way, the Congress has expressed concerns that EPA\u2019s homeland  security responsibilities are not well articulated in relation to DHS\u2019  responsibilities. In the conference report for the fiscal year 2005  Consolidated Appropriations Act, conferees directed EPA to enter into a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) with DHS that defines the  relationship and responsibilities of the two entities regarding homeland  security and protection. EPA did not enter into the MOU, but instead, on  November 1, 2005, issued a report to the Congress entitled \u201cHomeland  Security Roles and Responsibilities and Interactions Between EPA and the  Department of Homeland Security.\u201d  The report identified the homeland  security-specific authorities, core mission authorities, presidential  directives, and existing MOUs EPA uses to implement its homeland  security roles and responsibilities. In the report, EPA stated that it believes  its homeland security roles and responsibilities are sufficiently delineated  not only through statutes, presidential directives, and existing MOUs, but  also through planning documents and deliverables associated with a wide  variety of collaborative homeland security-related projects that EPA and  DHS are carrying out."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Efforts to Provide Critical and Threat-Related Information to the Water Sector Need Additional Coordination", "paragraphs": ["In December 2002, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies  (AMWA) received a grant from EPA to establish a communication system  to share security information with water sector utilities, known as the  Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC). The  WaterISAC is one of thirteen critical infrastructure and key resource sector- specific information sharing and analysis centers. The WaterISAC was  designed to meet the information sharing needs of both water and  wastewater utilities by providing real-time alerts of possible terrorist  activity, allowing for the secure reporting of incidents and the sharing of  information among users, and allowing access to a library of security- related information and contaminant databases. Beginning in fiscal year  2003, EPA has annually provided AMWA with a $2 million grant to support  the WaterISAC. This grant is augmented by subscription fees paid by  drinking water and wastewater systems. In November 2004, the  WaterISAC launched a free security advisory system known as the Water  Security Channel that distributes federal advisories on security threats via  e-mail to the water sector. The Water Security Channel also includes a  searchable archive of federal alerts, advisories, and bulletins. However, it  does not provide access to the same level of service as the subscription- based WaterISAC.

Under the Homeland Security  Act of 2002, DHS is responsible for reducing the vulnerability of the  national infrastructure and for coordinating and communicating with all  key stakeholders on homeland security-related matters. According to DHS,  to fulfill this mandate, it requires a communication system that provides  equal and appropriate access to security information to all owners and  operators of critical infrastructure and key resources. In 2004, it piloted a  new secure network, the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN),  to help achieve this mandate.", "HSIN is DHS\u2019 primary conduit through which it shares information on  domestic terrorist threats, suspicious activity reports, and incident  management. It is composed of multiple communities of interest, including  the HSIN Critical Sector (HSIN-CS) program, which is intended to enhance  the protection, preparedness, and crisis communication and coordination  capabilities of the nation\u2019s 17 critical infrastructure and key resource  sectors identified in HSPD-7. The HSIN platform for critical sectors is being  developed and offered to each sector to provide a suite of information and  communication tools to share critical information both within the sector,  with DHS, and eventually across sectors. Because the water sector is one of  the nation\u2019s 17 critical infrastructure and key resources, a HSIN-CS portal  for the sector, called HSIN Water Sector (HSIN-WS), is currently being  developed by DHS. A Water Sector Coordinating Council was also  established by the water sector with representative members of the water  sector community and charged with identifying information and other  needs of the sector, including the appropriate use of and the relationship  among Water ISAC, the Water Security Channel, and HSIN.", "While these efforts are helping to improve communication, staff at EPA and  DHS, as well as other industry experts with whom we spoke, have  expressed concern that the evolution of the information sharing and  dissemination function for the water sector has resulted in several  inefficiencies.", "WaterISAC access is limited to drinking water and wastewater  subscribers, plus a restricted number of subscribers from EPA and the  state drinking water programs. For example, the agreement limits  designated users to five individuals at EPA headquarters and one person  in each EPA region, for a total of fifteen EPA users. States are limited to  only two users. EPA staff note that access for others in the sector, such  as the technical service community, universities, training centers and  laboratories, would benefit the overall protection of drinking water and  wastewater critical infrastructures. EPA and DHS staff told us that,  depending upon the user policy established by the sector, the HSIN  network could allow for broader sharing of access than currently  available under the WaterISAC.", "Only a small portion of the water sector is reached by the WaterISAC.", "According to EPA staff, just over 530 utilities are reached by the  WaterISAC, while over 8,000 utilities receive information through the  Water Security Channel. However, the Water Security Channel does not  provide the same level of notification and information sharing provided  by the WaterISAC. The Water Security Channel is essentially a \u201cpush e- mail system\u201d that sends out general security bulletins to water utilities  and other users, and allows for searches of previous bulletins. This  service is much more limited than that provided to WaterISAC  subscribers, which provides a secure communication system for users  to share information, access to vulnerability assessment tools and  resources, access to an online library related to water security issues,  and access to databases about chemical, biological, and radiological  agents. One water industry representative told us that the WaterISAC  recently lowered its subscription fees due to industry concerns that the  fees were limiting WaterISAC subscriptions. EPA staff told us that the  water sector generally has less funding available to support ISAC  services than other sectors such as electric, financial, and  transportation.", "WaterISAC duplicates some operational functions likely available  through HSIN. EPA estimates that roughly $600,000 to $700,000 of the  annual $2 million WaterISAC grant is used to support computer  hardware and software for the secure web portal. Meanwhile, to support  HSIN, DHS funds similar computer software and hardware and its  related technical support. EPA staff noted that WaterISAC could make  use of the software and hardware platform available through HSIN. EPA  staff believed that WaterISAC could then better focus its resources on  managing its user list, managing information content on the secure web  site, and analyzing and distributing threat information, while leaving  DHS to manage and run the hardware and software.", "The current reach and levels of service offered by the WaterISAC and the  Water Security Channel do not meet DHS\u2019 objective to establish a  communication system that provides equal and appropriate access to  security information to all owners and operators in this critical  infrastructure area.

Using  funding from the supporting grant from EPA, the WaterISAC is currently  examining options for coordination between the WaterISAC, the Water  Security Channel, and HSIN. EPA noted that this review is ongoing and will  likely be presented in preliminary form to the Water Sector Coordinating  Council in a mid-March 2006 meeting. However, the scope of the  preliminary review is not clear, nor is a time frame set to complete the  review.
