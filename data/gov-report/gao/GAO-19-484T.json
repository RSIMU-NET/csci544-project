Accreditors\u2014independent agencies responsible for ensuring that schools provide a quality education\u2014must be recognized by the Department of Education (Education) as reliable authorities on educational quality. The accreditors can issue sanctions, including terminations and probations, to schools that do not meet accreditor standards. However, GAO previously found that schools with weaker student outcomes were, on average, no more likely to be sanctioned by accreditors than schools with stronger student outcomes, and Education does not make consistent use of sanction data that could help it identify insufficient accreditor oversight. In 2014, GAO recommended that Education use accreditor data in its recognition review process to determine whether accreditors are consistently applying and enforcing their standards to ensure schools provide a quality education. Education agreed with the recommendation, but has yet to use this data in this manner.", "Financial stability. Education uses a financial composite score to measure the financial health of schools participating in federal student aid programs, and increases its oversight of schools when it identifies concerns to protect against the risk of school closures. School closures, although rare, can result in hundreds of millions of dollars in unrepaid federal student loans and displacement of thousands of students. However, the composite score has been an imprecise risk measure, predicting only half of closures from school years 2010-11 through 2015-16. This is due in part to the fact that the composite score does not reflect changes in accounting practices and standards, relies on outdated financial measures, and is vulnerable to manipulation. Despite these limitations, Education has not updated the composite score since it was first established more than 20 years ago. In 2017, GAO recommended that Education update its financial composite score. Education has proposed some revisions, but changes have not yet been implemented to protect students and taxpayers against financial risks.", "Student loan defaults. According to federal law, schools may lose their ability to participate in federal student aid programs if a significant percentage of their borrowers default on their student loans within the first 3 years of repayment. However, GAO previously found that some schools managed these default rates by hiring consultants that encouraged borrowers with past-due payments to put their loans in forbearance, an option that allows borrowers to temporarily postpone payments and bring past due loans current. Although Education officials and student loan experts said forbearance is intended to be a short-term option, GAO's analysis of Education data found that 20 percent of borrowers who began repaying their loans in 2013 had loans in forbearance for 18 months or more. These borrowers defaulted more often in the fourth year of repayment, when schools are not accountable for defaults, suggesting long term forbearance may have delayed\u2014not prevented\u2014default. In 2018, GAO suggested that Congress consider statutory changes to strengthen schools' accountability for student loan defaults.

However, recent news reports  about students attending low quality schools, an increasing number of  schools closing due in part to financial difficulties, and the substantial  amount of student loans in default have raised questions as to whether  this existing accountability system is sufficient for protecting students and  taxpayers.", "Drawing on our prior work on ensuring accountability in the higher  education system, my remarks today address Education\u2019s role in (1)  recognizing accrediting agencies, (2) overseeing the financial condition of  schools, and (3) overseeing schools\u2019 student loan default rates. My  testimony is based on our prior reports on these topics issued between  2014 and 2018 and cited throughout this statement.

Accrediting agencies, also known  as accreditors, are generally nongovernmental, nonprofit entities that  work with Education and states as part of the \u201ctriad\u201d that oversees  postsecondary schools participating in federal student aid programs. The  Higher Education Act and Education\u2019s regulations require accreditors to  meet certain criteria and have certain operating procedures in place to be  \u201crecognized\u201d by Education as reliable authorities on assessing academic  quality (see fig. 1). Accreditors must have their recognition renewed by  Education at least every 5 years. To recognize an accrediting agency,  Education officials and the National Advisory Committee on Institutional  Quality and Integrity (NACIQI), which advises the Secretary of Education  on accreditation issues, review among other things whether the accreditor  applies its own standards, policies, and procedures when they accredit  schools.", "While Education is required to determine whether accrediting agencies  have standards for schools in certain areas, such as student achievement  and curricula, before recognizing them, the accrediting agencies are  responsible for evaluating member schools to determine if they meet the  accreditors\u2019 standards. The specific standards that accreditors develop in  these areas can differ, and accreditors may also establish additional  standards in areas not required by law. When schools do not meet  accreditor standards, accrediting agencies may impose sanctions, such  as placing a school on probation or terminating the school\u2019s accreditation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Oversight of College Finances", "paragraphs": ["Education conducts annual reviews of the financial condition of all  schools participating in federal student aid programs to determine if they  are financially responsible, based on criteria and processes established in  federal law and regulations. The specific financial responsibility  standards that apply to each school depend on the school\u2019s ownership  type, and the bulk of Education\u2019s financial oversight efforts focus on  private nonprofit and for-profit schools.", "One key financial responsibility standard that Education uses to assess  nonprofit and for-profit schools is a financial composite score that is  calculated for each school based on items drawn from the school\u2019s  audited financial statements. The composite score\u2014a metric for  evaluating a school\u2019s financial condition\u2014uses a formula based on three  financial ratios. A passing score is 1.5 to 3.0; a \u201czone\u201d score is from 1.0  to 1.4, and a failing score is from -1.0 to 0.9. (See fig. 2)", "Schools that receive a zone or failing composite score, or do not meet  one or more of the other financial responsibility standards, may continue  to participate in federal student aid programs if they agree to additional  oversight. Education may place these schools under heightened cash  monitoring (increasing schools\u2019 reporting requirements and postponing  the timing for receiving federal student aid payments), or require schools  to post a letter of credit (a financial commitment from a bank to protect  Education against potential liabilities should the school close), or a  combination of the two."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Oversight of School Default Rates", "paragraphs": ["Education may rescind a school\u2019s ability to participate in federal student  aid programs if a significant percentage of its borrowers\u2014generally, 30  percent or more of borrowers for 3 consecutive years or more than 40  percent in 1 year\u2014default on their federal student loans within the first 3  years of repayment. This calculation is called the cohort default rate. To  compute a school\u2019s cohort default rate, Education divides the number of  student loan borrowers in a cohort\u2014those entering repayment in the  same fiscal year\u2014who have defaulted on their loans in the initial 3 years  of repayment by the total number of a school\u2019s student loan borrowers in  that cohort (see fig. 3).

Although Education  is prohibited from specifying the specific content of accreditor standards,  the agency is responsible for assessing whether accreditors are  effectively overseeing schools\u2019 academic quality as part of their criteria for  recognizing accreditors. Our 2014 analysis found that schools with  weaker student outcomes were, on average, no more likely to be  sanctioned by accreditors than schools with stronger student outcomes,  and that the proportion of their member schools that accreditors  sanctioned varied. For example, our analysis of Education\u2019s sanction  data from October 2009 through March 2014 found that two accreditors  sanctioned less than 2 percent of their member schools during this time  frame, compared to 41 percent sanctioned by another accreditor. Our  2017 report also discussed challenges with the accreditation system\u2019s  oversight of academic quality. For example, some experts and literature  stated that accreditors may be hesitant to terminate schools\u2019 accreditation  when they identify issues because such action would adversely affect  schools\u2019 eligibility for federal student aid programs.", "Despite inconsistencies in accreditors\u2019 use of sanctions, our 2014 report  found that Education did not systematically examine data on accreditor  sanctions that could have helped it identify insufficient accreditor  oversight and thereby reduce potential risk to students and federal funds.  Accreditors provide Education with records of terminations and  probations. However, Education officials told us that they had not used  this sanction information for oversight of accreditors because Education\u2019s  regulations did not have specific criteria that require them to do so. While  Education is not required to use sanction data or analyze accreditor  sanctions as part of the accreditor recognition process, we found that it  could be useful for Education to consider these data when evaluating  whether accreditors meet prescribed criteria, such as whether they  consistently apply and enforce standards. Federal internal control  standards call for federal agencies to track data to help them make  decisions, as well as conduct ongoing, consistent monitoring to identify  weaknesses. Since accreditors are gatekeepers for tens of billions of  dollars in federal student aid from Education, as well as the key oversight  bodies for ensuring academic quality at schools, we found that failure on  the part of Education to spot weaknesses in accreditors\u2019 processes could  result in poor quality schools gaining access to federal funds.", "To strengthen Education\u2019s oversight of accreditors, we recommended in  2014 that Education draw upon accreditor data to determine whether  accreditors are consistently applying and enforcing their standards to  ensure that the education offered by schools is of sufficient quality. For  example, Education could systematically use available information related  to the frequency of accreditor sanctions or could do additional analyses,  such as comparing accreditor sanction data with Education\u2019s information  on student outcomes, to inform its recognition reviews. Education agreed  with this recommendation and initially started to track the number of  accreditor sanctions issued by each accrediting agency. However,  Education has since questioned the usefulness of this information and  has not yet used this sanction data to inform its discussions of accreditor  recognition and oversight. We continue to believe that implementing the  recommendation could help inform Education\u2019s reviews of accreditors and  ultimately reduce potential risk to students and federal funds. For  example, analyses of accreditor sanction data could help reveal patterns  in individual accreditor behavior and the extent to which they are  consistently enforcing standards. This recommendation remains open  and we will continue to monitor Education\u2019s efforts in this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in Education\u2019s Financial Oversight Metric Hinder Its Ability to Identify At-Risk Schools", "paragraphs": ["Holding schools accountable for their financial condition can help protect  taxpayers and students against the risk of school closure, but the  limitations of Education\u2019s financial composite score hamper its  effectiveness at identifying at-risk schools. Although a relatively small  number of schools close each year, these closures can affect tens of  thousands of students and result in hundreds of millions of dollars in  financial losses for the federal government and taxpayers from unrepaid  student loans. However, we reported in 2017 that Education\u2019s composite  score has been an imprecise predictor of school closures. Half the  colleges that closed in school years 2010-11 through 2015-16 received  passing financial composite scores on their last assessment before they  closed. For example, 58 of the 96 schools that closed in school year  2015-16 had recently received passing scores. Closures can be difficult to  predict in part because each school faces its own unique challenges, both  financial and nonfinancial, that can eventually push it into financial  trouble. Education\u2019s composite score is not designed to account for  nonfinancial risks; however, it is a primary means of securing financial  protections in the form of a letter of credit from schools at risk of closure.", "The composite score\u2019s inconsistent performance in identifying at-risk  schools is due in part to limitations of the underlying formula and the fact  that it has remained unchanged for more than 20 years. The composite  score is based on common financial ratios that Education selected in  1997 after consulting with an accounting firm, school officials, and other  experts. However, the composite score formula has not been updated  since then and several experts and school officials we interviewed  identified three key weaknesses:", "Accounting changes: The composite score has not kept pace with  changes since 1997 in accounting practices and standards, creating  ambiguity and making it more difficult to apply the formula in a uniform  manner. Accounting practices and standards are periodically updated,  for example, to improve the comparability and usefulness of financial  reporting. When these updates diverge from the components and  definitions in Education\u2019s composite score, certain components of the  composite score are no longer directly linked to items on schools\u2019  audited financial statements. These accounting changes can also  cause large shifts in schools\u2019 composite scores. For example,  administrators at one school we talked to said changes to state laws  have affected how some schools categorize their endowment holdings  in financial audits, and that this had the effect of reducing the school\u2019s  composite score from passing to not passing. However, Education  has not updated the composite score formula to ensure the score is a  reliable measure of financial health.", "Outdated financial measures: The composite score does not  incorporate new financial metrics that would provide a broader  indication of schools\u2019 financial health. For more than 20 years, the  composite score formula has remained unchanged as the field of  financial analysis has continued to evolve with new measures  becoming important as economic conditions change. For example,  liquidity (i.e., access to cash) has become an important financial  measure since the 2007-09 economic downturn, when some schools  had trouble meeting payroll and fulfilling contractual obligations. More  sophisticated methodologies used by credit rating agencies have  sometimes resulted in assessments of a school\u2019s financial condition  that are strikingly different from the school\u2019s composite score. For  example, in 2016, two credit rating agencies assigned non-investment  grade (i.e., junk bond) ratings to 30 schools that received passing  composite scores from Education.", "Vulnerability to manipulation: We previously reported that the  composite score can be manipulated by some schools that take on  long-term debt (e.g., loans with terms in excess of 12 months)  because these debts can increase a school\u2019s composite score and  help it avoid requirements to post a letter of credit. Long-term debt  usually represents a long-term investment in a school\u2019s campus and  buildings, and the composite score formula treats this type of debt in a  positive manner. An accountant for multiple schools told us that  some schools have taken advantage of this provision and taken on a  million dollars in debt in order to obtain a passing composite score.  Corinthian Colleges, which closed in 2015, also exploited this  vulnerability to boost its composite score and avoid having to post a  letter of credit that could have been used by Education to cover some  of the hundreds of millions in student loan discharges resulting from  the school\u2019s closure, according to company documents and Education  documents and officials.", "These three weaknesses with the financial composite score hamper  Education\u2019s ability to effectively fulfill its statutory responsibility to  determine whether schools participating in federal student aid programs  are financially responsible. Identifying and responding to risks is a key  component of federal internal control standards, but Education\u2019s financial  composite score formula has remained unchanged for over 20 years  despite significant changes in the financial landscape of higher  education.", "To address these limitations, we recommended in our 2017 report that  Education update the composite score formula to better measure schools\u2019  financial conditions and capture financial risks. Education generally  disagreed with this recommendation and stated that the issues identified  in our report did not necessarily mean that the composite score was an  unreliable measure of schools\u2019 financial strength. Since our report was  issued, new regulations have gone into effect specifying that certain  financially risky events, such as those related to litigation and certain  accreditor actions, will generally trigger a recalculation of a school\u2019s  composite score. In addition, Education has also published proposed  regulations that would update some of the definitions of terms used to  calculate a school\u2019s composite score to conform with changes in  accounting standards and also make an adjustment to how the formula  treats long-term debt, which according to Education would be intended to  make the formula less susceptible to manipulation. However, Education  has not finalized these regulations and has not released a timeline for  when it plans to do so, nor has it indicated that it has any broader plans to  update the composite score, as we recommended. Since the existing  composite score calculation remains unchanged, we are leaving this  recommendation open and will continue to monitor Education\u2019s efforts in  this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Ability to Hold Schools Accountable for Loan Default is Limited by Schools\u2019 Ability to Distort Their Cohort Default Rates", "paragraphs": ["The cohort default rate, which is specified in federal law, is a key  measure for holding schools accountable for borrower outcomes and for  protecting borrowers and the federal government from the costs  associated with default. However, in 2018 we reported that this rate has  limitations as an accountability tool. Some schools managed their 3- year cohort default rate by hiring consultants that encouraged borrowers  with past-due payments to put their loans in forbearance, an option that  allows borrowers to temporarily postpone payments and bring past-due  loans current. At five of the nine default management consultants we  selected (that served about 800 schools), we identified examples when  forbearance was encouraged over other potentially more beneficial  options for helping borrowers avoid default, such as repayment plans that  base monthly payment amounts on income. Four of these consultants  also provided inaccurate or incomplete information to borrowers about  their repayment options in some instances.", "Although Education officials and student loan experts said that  forbearance is intended to be a short-term option, our analysis of  Education data found that 20 percent of borrowers who began repaying  their loans in 2013 had loans in forbearance for 18 months or more during  the 3-year cohort default rate period. Spending this much time in  forbearance reduces the potential for borrowers to default within the 3- year period, thus helping improve a school\u2019s cohort default rate. However,  postponing loan payments through forbearance can increase borrowers\u2019  loan costs in the long term. For example, a typical borrower with $30,000  in loans who spends the first 3 years of repayment in forbearance would  pay an additional $6,742 in interest, a 17 percent increase, over the life of  the loan. In addition, borrowers in forbearance for 18 months or longer  defaulted more often in the fourth year of repayment, when schools are  not accountable for defaults, than they did during the 3-year period. While  forbearance can help borrowers avoid default in the short term, this  finding suggests that forbearance may have delayed\u2014not prevented\u2014 default, potentially resulting in increased costs to the federal government.", "Reducing the number of borrowers in long-term forbearance and directing  them toward other options for avoiding default, such as repayment plans  that base monthly payment amounts on income, could help reduce the  number of borrowers that later default and may eventually save the  federal government money. Specifically, for William D. Ford Federal  Direct Loans issued in fiscal year 2018, Education estimates that it will  not recover over 20 percent of defaulted loans. These unrecovered  defaulted loan amounts total an estimated $4 billion, according to our  analysis of Education\u2019s budget data.", "Schools are seldom held accountable for their students\u2019 defaults, in part  because of the high rate of borrowers in long-term forbearance. To  examine the impact of long-term forbearance on schools\u2019 3-year default  rates, we recalculated schools\u2019 cohort default rates by excluding  borrowers who were in forbearance for 18 months or more and who did  not default during the 3-year period. We found that over 260 additional  schools\u2014receiving a combined $2.7 billion in Direct Loans and Pell  Grants in academic year 2016-2017\u2014would potentially have had a  default rate high enough to put them at risk of losing access to federal  student aid programs.", "The reduced effectiveness of cohort default rates as a tool for holding  schools accountable creates risks to the federal government and  taxpayers, who are responsible for the costs associated with high rates of  default. Since the way the cohort default rate is calculated is specified in  federal law, any changes to its calculation would require legislation to be  enacted amending the law. Our 2018 report suggested that Congress  consider strengthening schools\u2019 accountability for student loan defaults,  for example, by revising the cohort default rate calculation or using other  accountability measures to complement or replace the cohort default rate.  In the 115th Congress, proposals were introduced to revise, supplement,  or replace the cohort default rate, though none of the legislation was  enacted. This matter for congressional consideration remains open. We  continue to believe that strengthening the accountability measure for loan  defaults could further protect borrowers and the billions of dollars of  federal student aid the government distributes each year.", "In conclusion, the large federal investment in higher education makes it  essential that the federal government maintain a robust system of  accountability to protect students and taxpayers. My statement has  highlighted three actions Education and Congress could take to  strengthen the existing accountability tools for educational quality,  financial sustainability, and student loan defaults. Students deserve to go  to schools that provide a quality education and are financially stable.  Taxpayers deserve an accountability system that protects federal student  aid funds from going to schools that are financially irresponsible or push  borrowers into forbearance for long periods in order to reduce the  school\u2019s cohort default rate. We believe that fully implementing the two  recommendations and matter for congressional consideration discussed  in this testimony would improve federal accountability, help students, and  potentially lead to financial savings for taxpayers.", "Chairwoman Davis, Ranking Member Smucker, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
