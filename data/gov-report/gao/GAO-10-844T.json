CMS has made progress in some of these areas, and recent legislation may provide the agency with enhanced authority. However, CMS faces continuing challenges. 1. Strengthening provider enrollment process and standards. Checking the background of providers at the time they apply to become Medicare providers is a crucial step to reduce the risk of enrolling providers intent on defrauding or abusing the program. In particular, GAO has recommended stricter scrutiny of providers identified as particularly vulnerable to improper payments to ensure they are legitimate businesses. 2. Improving pre-payment review of claims. Pre-payment reviews of claims are essential to helping ensure that Medicare pays correctly the first time. GAO has recommended that CMS further enhance its ability to identify improper claims through additional automated pre-payment claim review before they are paid. 3. Focusing post-payment claims review on most vulnerable areas. Post- payment reviews are critical to identifying payment errors and recouping overpayments. GAO has recommended that CMS better target claims for post payment review on the most vulnerable areas. 4. Improving oversight of contractors. Because Medicare is administered by contractors, overseeing their activities to address fraud, waste, and abuse is critical. GAO found that CMS's oversight of prescription drug plan sponsors' compliance programs has been limited. However, partly in response to GAO's recommendation, CMS oversight of these programs is expanding. 5. Developing a robust process for addressing identified vulnerabilities. Having mechanisms in place to resolve vulnerabilities that lead to improper payment is vital to program management, but CMS has not developed a robust process to specifically address these. GAO has recommended that CMS establish an adequate process to ensure prompt resolution of identified improper payment vulnerabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work regarding fraud, waste,  and abuse in the Medicare program. We have designated Medicare as a  high-risk program since 1990, in part because we found the program\u2019s size  and complexity make it vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Fraud  represents intentional acts of deception with knowledge that the action or  representation could result in an inappropriate gain, while abuse  represents actions inconsistent with acceptable business or medical  practices. Waste, which includes inaccurate payments for services, such as  unintentional duplicate payments, also occurs in the Medicare program.", "Fraud, waste, and abuse all can lead to improper payments, overpayments  and underpayments that should not have been made or that were made in  an incorrect amount. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS)\u2014the agency that administers Medicare\u2014has estimated improper  payments for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) at $24.1 billion in calendar  year 2009. Even this may not be a full picture of the risk for improper  payments because some improper payments may not be detected and  hence may not be reflected in the improper payment rate.", "Beginning in 1997, Congress has allocated funds specifically for CMS  oversight activities designed to ensure that claims are paid correctly, both  through dedicated funding and augmented more recently through annual  appropriations. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010  (HCERA) have provisions that may help strengthen strategies CMS may  take to reduce improper payments. For example, the legislation requires  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to undertake certain  actions designed to strengthen the agency\u2019s processes of screening and  enrolling Medicare providers in an effort to combat fraud, waste, and  abuse.", "However, preventing improper payments in Medicare is a continuing  challenge. Within Medicare FFS, CMS contractors are responsible for  processing and paying approximately 4.5 million claims per day, enrolling  providers, responding to beneficiary questions, and investigating potential  Medicare fraud. For Medicare Advantage, Medicare\u2019s private health  insurance program, and the Medicare prescription drug benefit, CMS  contracts with private health plans and drug plan sponsors, respectively,  that are responsible for administering Medicare benefits. Hence, CMS  contractors have an important role in preventing improper payments. In  the course of our work, we have identified challenges facing CMS and  selected key strategies that are particularly important to helping prevent  fraud, waste, and abuse, and ultimately to reducing improper payments.  My testimony today will focus on our findings in these areas.", "This statement is based on nine products that we have issued regarding  fraud, waste, abuse, and improper payments in the Medicare program.  These products were issued from September 2005 through March 2010  using a variety of methodologies, including analysis of claims, review of  relevant policies and procedures, stakeholder interviews, and site visits.  For this statement we also received updated information from CMS in  June 2010. Our work was performed in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.

Checking the background of providers at the time they apply  to become Medicare providers is a crucial step to reduce the risk of  enrolling providers intent on defrauding or abusing the program. In  particular, we have recommended stricter scrutiny of enrollment  processes for two types of providers whose services and items CMS has  identified as especially vulnerable to improper payments\u2014home health  agencies (HHA) and suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics,  orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS).", "CMS contractors are responsible for screening enrollment applications  from prospective HHAs. We found that the screening process was not  thorough. This may have contributed to a rapid increase in the number of  HHAs that billed Medicare in certain states with unusually high rates of  billing patterns indicative of fraud and abuse. For example, the  contractors were not required to verify the criminal history of persons  named on the application. We recommended that CMS assess the  feasibility of such a criminal history verification of all key officials\u2019 names  on an HHA enrollment application; to date, CMS has not implemented this  recommendation.", "Regarding DMEPOS suppliers, we also found that CMS had not taken  sufficient steps to prevent entities intent on defrauding Medicare from  enrolling in the program. In 2005, we reported that more effective  screening and stronger enrollment standards were needed. CMS  implemented new supplier enrollment standards in January 2008, partly in  response to our recommendation. However, in that same year, we exposed  persistent weaknesses when we created two fictitious medical equipment  companies that were enrolled by CMS\u2019s contractor and given permission  to begin billing Medicare. As an enrollment requirement, suppliers are  required to show that they have contracts for obtaining inventory\u2014but the  contracts provided with the applications of our fictitious companies would  have been shown to be fabricated if they had been reviewed properly.", "Since January 2008, CMS has taken two additional steps to ensure that  only legitimate DMEPOS suppliers can bill Medicare. First, it implemented  a requirement for DMEPOS suppliers to post a surety bond to help ensure  that the Medicare program recoups erroneous payments that result from  fraudulent or abusive billing practices. Second, CMS required that all  DMEPOS suppliers be accredited by a CMS-approved accrediting  organization to ensure that they meet minimum standards. CMS told us  that thousands of DMEPOS suppliers were removed as result of these  requirements.", "In addition, Congress has directed CMS to implement a competitive  bidding program for DME, which could also help reduce fraud, waste, and  abuse because it authorizes CMS to select suppliers based in part on new  scrutiny of their financial documents and other application materials.  However, the program will not take effect until January 2011 and it will  initially be implemented in only nine metropolitan areas.", "Implementation of additional authorities in PPACA and HCERA also may  help the agency strengthen provider enrollment, including addressing  vulnerabilities our work has identified. In particular, among other  provisions, the legislation allows HHS to (1) add criminal and background  checks to its enrollment screening processes, depending on the risks  presented by the provider; and (2) impose a temporary moratorium on  enrollment of providers, if the agency deems it necessary to prevent fraud  and abuse. In addition, there are specific requirements for providers to  disclose any current or previous affiliation with a provider or supplier that  has uncollected debt, has been or is subject to a payment suspension  under a federal health care program, has been excluded from participation  under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program (CHIP) or has had its billing privileges denied or revoked. HHS  may deny enrollment to any such provider whose previous affiliations  pose an undue risk. However, the effectiveness of these authorities is  unknown and will depend on CMS\u2019s implementation. CMS told us that the  agency is in the process of implementing these authorities, including  drafting regulations on criminal and background checks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Pre-Payment Review of Claims", "paragraphs": ["Pre-payment reviews of claims are essential to helping ensure that  Medicare pays correctly the first time; however, these reviews are  challenging due to the volume of claims. Overall, less than 1 percent of  Medicare\u2019s claims are subject to a medical record review by trained  personnel\u2014so having robust automated payment controls called edits in  place that can deny inappropriate claims or flag them for further review is  critical. However, we have found weaknesses in these pre-payment  controls. For example, in 2007, we found that contractors responsible for  reviewing DMEPOS suppliers\u2019 claims did not have automated pre-payment  controls in place to identify questionable claims that might connote fraud,  such as those associated with atypically rapid increases in billing or for  items unlikely to be prescribed in the course of routine quality medical  care. As a result, we recommended in 2007 that CMS require its  contractors to develop thresholds for unexplained increases in billing and  use them to develop automated pre-payment controls. Although CMS has  not implemented that recommendation specifically, it has added edits to  flag claims for services that were unlikely to be provided in the normal  course of medical care. This is a valuable addition to the program\u2019s  safeguards, but additional pre-payment controls, such as using thresholds  for unexplained increases in billing, could further enhance CMS\u2019s ability to  identify improper claims before they are paid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Focusing Post-Payment Claims Review on Most Vulnerable Areas", "paragraphs": ["Post-payment reviews are critical to identifying payment errors to recoup  overpayments. CMS\u2019s contractors have conducted limited post-payment  reviews\u2014for example, we reported in 2009 that two contractors paying  home health claims conducted post-payment reviews on fewer than 700 of  the 8.7 million claims that they paid in fiscal year 2007. Further, we found  that they were not using evidence, such as findings from pre-payment  reviews, to target their post-payment review resources on providers with a  demonstrated high risk of improper payments. We recommended that  post-payment reviews be conducted on claims submitted by HHAs with  high rates of improper billing identified through pre-payment review. In  response, CMS commented that other types of post-payment review may  already include claims from these HHAs. We continue to believe including  this targeted post-payment review should be a priority.", "Cross-checking claims for home health services with the physicians who  prescribed them can be a further safeguard against fraud, waste, and  abuse, but we have found that this is not always done. For example, CMS  does not routinely provide physicians responsible for authorizing home  health care with information that would enable them to determine  whether an HHA was billing for unauthorized care. In one instance, a CMS  contractor identified overpayments in excess of $9 million after  interviewing physicians who had referred beneficiaries with high home  health costs. The physicians indicated that their signatures had been  forged or that they had not realized the amount of care they had  authorized. We recommended that CMS require that physicians receive a  statement of services beneficiaries received based on the physicians\u2019  certification, but to date, the agency has not taken action.", "CMS\u2019s new national recovery audit contracting program, begun in March  2009, was intended to address post-payment efforts; however, we continue  to have concerns about post-payment reviews of HHAs and DMEPOS.  Congress authorized the national program after completion of a three-year  recovery audit contracting demonstration program in 2008. The national  program is designed to help the agency supplement the pre- and post- payment reviews of other contractors. Recovery audit contractors (RAC)  review claims after payment, with reimbursement to them contingent on  finding improper overpayments and underpayments. Because RACs are  paid on a contingent fee based on the dollar value of the improper  payments identified, during the demonstration RACs focused on claims  from inpatient hospital stays, which are generally more costly services.  Therefore, other contractors\u2019 post-payment review activities could be  more valuable if CMS directed these contractors to focus on items and  services where RACs are not expected to focus their reviews, and where  improper payments are known to be high, specifically home health and  durable medical equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Oversight of Contractors", "paragraphs": ["Because Medicare is administered by contractors, such as drug plan  sponsors, overseeing their activities to address fraud, waste, and abuse  and prevent improper payment is critical. All drug plan sponsors are  required to have programs to safeguard the Medicare prescription drug  program from fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS\u2019s oversight of these programs  has been limited but is expanding. In March 2010, we testified that CMS  had completed desk audits of selected sponsors\u2019 compliance plans. At  that time, CMS was beginning to implement an expanded oversight  strategy, including revising its audit protocol and piloting on-site audits,  to assess the effectiveness of these programs more thoroughly. As of  June 2010, the agency has conducted 5 on-site audits and plans to conduct  a total of 30 on-site audits by the end of the fiscal year. These audits are in  response to a recommendation we made in our 2008 study that found that  the five sponsors we reviewed (covering more than one-third of total  Medicare prescription drug plan enrollees) had not completely  implemented all seven of CMS\u2019s required compliance plan elements and  selected recommended measures for a Medicare prescription drug fraud,  waste, and abuse program. In addition, CMS published a final rule in  April 2010 to increase its oversight efforts and ensure that sponsors have  effective compliance programs in place.

Further, our  Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool affirms that in order  to establish an effective internal control environment, the agency has to  appropriately assign authority, including holding individuals accountable  for achieving agency objectives.", "As we reported in March 2010, CMS did not establish an adequate process  during its initial recovery audit contracting demonstration or in planning  for the national program to ensure prompt resolution of identified  improper payment vulnerabilities. During the demonstration, CMS did  not assign responsibility for taking corrective action on these  vulnerabilities to either agency officials, contractors, or a combination of  both. According to CMS officials, the agency only takes corrective action  for vulnerabilities with national implications, and leaves it up to the  contractors that process and pay claims to decide whether to take action  for vulnerabilities that may only be occurring in certain geographic areas.  Additionally, during the demonstration CMS did not specify in a plan what  type of corrective action was required or establish a timeframe for  corrective action. The documented lack of assigned responsibilities  impeded CMS\u2019s efforts to promptly resolve the vulnerabilities that had  been identified during the demonstration.", "For the recovery audit contracting national program, CMS established a  corrective action team that will compile, review, and categorize identified  vulnerabilities and discuss corrective action recommendations. CMS has  also appointed the Director of the Office of Financial Management as  responsible for the day-to-day operations of the program, and the CMS  Administrator as the responsible official for vulnerabilities that span  agency components. However, the corrective action process still does not  include any steps to either assess the effectiveness of the corrective  actions taken or adjust them as necessary based on the results of the  assessments. Further, the agency has not developed time frames for  implementing corrective actions. We recommended that CMS develop and  implement a process that includes policies and procedures to ensure that  the agency promptly (1) evaluates findings of RAC audits, (2) decides on  the appropriate response and a time frame for taking action based on  established criteria, and (3) acts to correct the vulnerabilities identified.  CMS concurred with this recommendation. Agency officials indicated that  they intended to review vulnerabilities on a case-by-case basis and were  considering assigning them to risk categories that would help them  prioritize action.
