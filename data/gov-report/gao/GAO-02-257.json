The Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service was to issue the checks on behalf of IRS, with the first checks to be received during the week of July 23, 2001. As of September 30, 2001, 84 million taxpayers were to have received $36 billion in advance tax funds. IRS offset about $2.1 billion from these advance tax refunds to recover delinquent federal taxes. IRS spent $104 million to run the program through September 2001, which included IRS staffing costs as well as the costs associated with contracts, postage, and printing. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified two initial problems that affected either the accuracy or timeliness of the advance refund notices. One involved computer programming errors that resulted in 523,000 taxpayers receiving notices indicating that they would receive larger advance tax refunds than they were entitled to receive. The IG also determined that 5.3 million taxpayers who had filled their tax returns by the April 16 filing deadline would have delays of up to nine weeks in receiving their advance refund notices. Two problems that continued throughout the advance tax refund period involved (1) undeliverable refund notices and checks due to incorrect addresses and (2) taxpayer difficulties in reaching IRS telephone assistors. Another problem that was quickly identified and corrected during the early stages of the advance tax refund period involved duplicate checks sent to about 25 taxpayers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 directed the Secretary of the Treasury to issue advance 2001 tax refunds to eligible individual taxpayers who filed a tax year 2000 return.

In addition, we discussed advance tax refund procedures with FMS officials and obtained statistics on the number of refund checks that were undeliverable and the number and dollar value of refunds that were offset for debts other than federal tax debts. We identified problems encountered during the  program\u2019s implementation through (1) analyses of statistical data and  other information and (2) discussions with IRS and FMS officials and staff  of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) who  were reviewing various aspects of the program.

To stimulate the economy more rapidly than would be achieved if  taxpayers had to wait until they filed their tax year 2001 tax returns to  realize the full impact of this rate reduction, the Act provided for eligible  taxpayers to receive an advance 2001 tax refund. To be eligible for an  advance refund, taxpayers (1) had to have a federal income tax liability on  their tax year 2000 return, (2) could not be claimed as a dependent on  someone else\u2019s tax year 2000 return, and (3) could not be a nonresident  alien. The amount of advance tax refund that taxpayers could receive  depended on the filing status and amount of taxable income shown on the  taxpayer\u2019s tax year 2000 return. The maximum refund amount was $600  for a married couple filing jointly or a qualified widow(er), $500 for a head  of household, and $300 for a single individual or married person filing  separately.", "Before issuance of the advance tax refund checks, IRS was to send every  individual who filed a return for tax year 2000 a notice either informing  them of the refund amount they were to receive and the week in which  they were to receive it or telling them that they were ineligible for a refund  and why. FMS was to issue the advance tax refund checks for IRS with  assistance from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).Before issuing any check, IRS and FMS were to reduce the amount of the  check by the amount of any delinquent federal tax or certain other debts,  such as delinquent child support payments, owed by the taxpayer.", "Most advance refund checks were to be issued over a 10-week period from  the week of July 23, 2001, through the week of September 24, 2001, based,  in general, on the last two digits of a taxpayer\u2019s Social Security number  (SSN). For example, taxpayers with 00 through 09 as the last two digits of  their SSN were to receive their checks the week of July 23, 2001, while  taxpayers with 90 through 99 as the last two digits of their SSN were to  receive their checks the week of September 24, 2001. Taxpayers who filed  their tax year 2000 returns after April 16 were to receive their advance tax  refund checks later in the fall. All checks were to be issued by December  31, 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Billions of Dollars in Advance Tax Refunds Sent to Millions of Taxpayers", "paragraphs": ["IRS, through FMS, mailed out advance tax refunds according to a schedule  that called for taxpayers to begin receiving checks the week of July 23,  2001. As shown in table 1, from then through the end of September, about  84.1 million taxpayers were to have received about $35.5 billion in advance  tax refunds.", "According to IRS officials, it cost IRS about $104 million to administer the  advance tax refund program through the end of fiscal year 2001. Included  in these costs were $36 million for contract costs, $33 million for postage,  $30 million for labor, and $5 million for printing. IRS expected to incur an  additional $12 million in labor costs during fiscal year 2002 related to the  advance tax refunds, because refund payments were to be made through  the end of December 2001. FMS expected to incur about $34 million in  total costs to issue the checks on behalf of IRS, including the assistance  provided by DFAS.", "To administer the advance tax refund program, IRS, among other things,  had to develop the computer programming necessary to determine taxpayer  eligibility for the refund and the amount of each refund, including any  related federal tax offset; arrange for printing and mailing of notices that informed taxpayers prepare adjustment notices for refunds that were offset due to federal tax  whether they would receive a refund;  respond to telephone calls and correspondence from taxpayers  concerning the refund;  resolve undelivered and returned advance refund checks; and  debts.", "According to an IRS official, it took about 3 months between March 2001  and June 2001 to develop the necessary computer programming and to  arrange for printing and mailing of notices needed to implement the  advance tax refund program. IRS temporarily reassigned staff from other  functions to assist with taxpayer telephone calls and correspondence  related to the advance tax refunds. For example, IRS recalled furloughed  staff at its forms distribution centers to assist taxpayers who called IRS  with questions about the advance refund that were relatively easy to  answer.

However, the actual amount of the advance refund was limited to the  lesser of (1) 5 percent of the taxable income on the taxpayer\u2019s tax year  2000 return and (2) the net income tax from the tax year 2000 return after  subtracting nonrefundable credits, such as the credit for child and  dependent care expenses, child tax credit, credit for the elderly, and  education credit. TIGTA found that IRS had erred in developing its  computer program by not limiting advance refund amounts to the net  income tax after credits, thus resulting in the inaccurate advance refund  notices.", "TIGTA informed IRS of this problem on July 3, 2001, and IRS was able to  correct the problem before any advance refunds were issued\u2014thus  avoiding overpayments of about $118 million. IRS also sent corrected  notices to the affected taxpayers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Taxpayers Received Untimely Notices", "paragraphs": ["TIGTA also determined that 5.3 million taxpayers who filed their tax  returns by the April 16 filing deadline would have delays from 1 week to 9  weeks in receiving their advance refund notices.

Thus, many nonrefund returns filed by April 16  had not been processed by the time IRS prepared the list of taxpayers who  would receive the first mailout of advance refund notices.", "When IRS developed the programming to generate the advance refund  notices for taxpayers affected by the above processing procedure, it  decided to have the notices mailed to the taxpayers just before they were  to receive their advance refund checks instead of having the notices  mailed as soon as the tax return was processed.", "In response to a TIGTA recommendation, IRS issued a news release  explaining that some taxpayers might experience a delay in receiving their  advance tax refund notices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Advance Refund Notices and Checks Were Undeliverable", "paragraphs": ["One problem that IRS encountered throughout the implementation of the  advance tax refund program involved undeliverable refund notices and  checks due to incorrect addresses. Undeliverable advance refund notices  were to be returned to IRS\u2019 Philadelphia Service Center, and undeliverable  advance refund checks were to be returned to the FMS payment center  from which they were issued.", "Through September 30, 2001, almost 2 million advance tax refund notices  were returned to IRS as undeliverable, including about 1.1 million notices  sent to taxpayers who were to receive a refund and about 900,000 notices  sent to taxpayers who were ineligible for a refund. According to an IRS  official, the undeliverable notices were sorted and counted by type of  notice and then destroyed. Because these notices were sent to taxpayers  via first class mail, the Postal Service was to forward notices for which  taxpayers had provided an address change. Therefore, IRS decided that it  would not be cost effective to follow up on the undeliverable notices. Even  if a notice to a taxpayer who was to receive an advance tax refund was  returned as undeliverable, a check would still have been sent to that  taxpayer.", "In a news release dated October 30, 2001, IRS indicated that there were  almost 300,000 undeliverable advance refund checks valued at about $95  million for which they urged taxpayers to contact IRS so that the checks  could be reissued to the correct address.  According to an FMS official,  undeliverable tax refund checks are cancelled and information concerning  the cancelled checks is sent to IRS. IRS is to then research a taxpayer\u2019s  account to determine if there is an updated address to which another  check can be sent. IRS updates taxpayer addresses each week through a  National Change of Address Database maintained by the Postal Service.  Taxpayers can also update their addresses with IRS by submitting an IRS  Form 8822 \u201cChange of Address.\u201d In addition, IRS authorized its customer  service representatives to accept change of address information over the  telephone from taxpayers who call about their advance tax refund.  According to IRS Philadelphia Service Center officials, much of the written  correspondence they received involved address changes from taxpayers  who wanted to ensure that they would receive their advance refunds.  Although the number of undeliverable advance refund checks was  substantial, the percentage of checks returned as undeliverable (less than  1 percent) was less than the approximate 4 percent rate that an FMS  official indicated was normal for undeliverable tax refunds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taxpayers Calling IRS During the Advance Tax Refund Period Had Problems Reaching an Assistor", "paragraphs": ["At the time we prepared this report, we had data on the accessibility of  IRS\u2019 telephone assistance for the first 3 months of the advance tax refund  period. The data showed that taxpayers calling IRS during those 3 months  had problems reaching an assistor. Overall, when compared with the same  3-month period in 2000 and with the 2001 tax filing season, the  accessibility of IRS\u2019 telephone assistance during the advance tax refund  period generally declined.", "IRS had a two-pronged approach for responding to the increased demand  for telephone assistance that it expected during the advance tax refund  period. The first prong of IRS\u2019 strategy was to handle as many calls as  possible through automation, thereby freeing up assistors to handle calls  that required live assistance. To accomplish this, IRS publicized its  TeleTax phone number on notices sent to taxpayers and though an  announcement played on IRS\u2019 main telephone assistance line. The TeleTax  line had recorded information on the rebate program and an interactive  service that told the taxpayer the expected date the check would be  mailed based on the last two digits of the Social Security number entered  by the taxpayer. The second prong of IRS\u2019 strategy was to increase the  staffing devoted to telephone assistance. We are continuing to obtain  information on the extent of IRS\u2019 efforts in this regard. Among other  things, however, IRS\u2019 forms distribution centers recalled 450 employees  from furlough and trained them to handle simpler calls related to the  rebate.", "Despite IRS\u2019 efforts to meet the increased demand for telephone  assistance during the advance tax refund period, taxpayers had greater  difficulty in accessing that assistance. IRS has four measures for judging  its performance in providing access to telephone assistance. As shown in  table 2, IRS\u2019 performance during the first 3 months of the advance tax  refund period declined for all four measures compared with the same time  period in 2000 and declined for three of the four measures compared with  the 2001 filing season.", "We are inquiring into reasons for the decline in telephone accessibility  during the advance tax refund period and will include that information in  our final report. However, one possible explanation is that the demand for  telephone assistance exceeded IRS\u2019 expectations. Although we did not  have usable information on IRS\u2019 expectations when we wrote this report,  we did have IRS data on actual demand. IRS measures demand in two  ways\u2014total call attempts and unique telephone number attempts.According to IRS data for both of those measures, the demand for  telephone assistance was about twice as high during the first 3 months of  the advance tax refund period as it was during the same time period in  2000. In the first 3 months of the advance tax refund period, IRS received  about 23.8 million total call attempts and about 13.3 million unique number  attempts, compared to about 11.4 million and 7.1 million, respectively,  during the same period in 2000.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue said that although IRS made \u201cextraordinary efforts to handle  advance refund calls,\u201d the high volume of telephone calls resulted in a  reduced level of service.  The Commissioner\u2019s letter, which is in appendix  I, cites various statistics to document the increase in demand.  Because  those statistics include calls to TeleTax, they differ from the statistics  cited in the preceding paragraph."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Taxpayers Received Duplicate Checks", "paragraphs": ["Another problem related to the advance tax refunds was identified within  the first 2 weeks of the advance refund period and promptly corrected.  The problem involved duplicate checks sent to taxpayers by one of the  three DFAS centers that assisted FMS in issuing the advance tax refund  checks. The problem surfaced when two taxpayers who had received  duplicate checks tried to cash the second check and a third taxpayer  notified IRS about receiving a duplicate check. Once the problem was  identified, FMS decided to suspend use of the DFAS center from which the  duplicate checks had emanated.  According to FMS, due to significantly  lower check volumes than originally anticipated, the DFAS center was  subsequently retained as a contingency site, rather than being returned to  full check production.", "According to an FMS official, as of November 2001, about 25 instances of  duplicate checks had been identified.  Of the 25 taxpayers who received  duplicate checks, 14 taxpayers had either fully repaid the extra payment or  had returned the duplicate check and 2 taxpayers had partially repaid the  extra payment.
