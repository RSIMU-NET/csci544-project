To  respond to your concerns about the possible emergence of a digital divide  as well as your ongoing interest in telecommunications issues, we surveyed  Internet users to gain a deeper understanding of issues related to Internet  usage\u2014such as which Internet access methods Internet users thought were  available to them, why users chose their providers, and how various  applications (e.g., e-mail) and content (i.e., information sources or Web  pages) available from their Internet service provider (ISP) or on the  Internet were used. This information can aid understanding of how  advanced telecommunications services are being deployed throughout the  United States. As agreed with your office, we examined (1) the  demographic characteristics of Internet users compared with those of the  general U.S. population, (2) the characteristics of areas where broadband  Internet transport is available and of consumers who selected a broadband  transport provider, and (3) the factors influencing consumers\u2019 choice of an  ISP and how consumers rate the importance of content and applications  offered by their ISP or over the Internet.", "Because we were primarily interested in the choices made by those with  access to the Internet, we surveyed current Internet users only.  Specifically, we contracted with a market research firm to sample a panel  of Internet users over the Internet. The firm sampled two groups of Internet  users: (1) a group intended to be representative of the U.S. Internet-user  population and (2) a group living in geographic areas that we believed had  at least one broadband option available. In both instances, survey  participants were 18 years and older. Because we sampled a panel of  Internet users, the survey results presented in this report are estimates of  the population values for that panel. Throughout this report, all references  to \u201cInternet users\u201d denote members of that panel of Internet users.

Usually,  consumers buy these services separately, but some providers (particularly  cable companies) sell transport and ISP services as an integrated package.  Some wireless providers also offer an integrated ISP as part of their  Internet transport services.", "Different transport providers, depending on the physical makeup of their  network, can supply different amounts of \u201cbandwidth,\u201d or data  transmission capacity. A \u201cnarrowband\u201d connection, such as that provided  by a conventional telephone line, offers limited capacity resulting in  relatively slow rates of data transmission. A \u201cbroadband\u201d connection, such  as that provided by cable modem service or by a telephone technology  known as digital subscriber line (DSL), has greater capacity, giving the user  faster data transmission rates and better access to sophisticated,  \u201cbandwidth-intensive\u201d content. While many Internet users enjoy fast  Internet transport at their place of work or school, no substantial  commercial deployment of broadband connections to homes took place  until the late 1990s. To date, the two most widely used broadband  technologies in homes are cable modem service and DSL. Increased  deployment of and subscription to competing broadband transport  methods, such as satellite, terrestrial wireless, and optical fiber  technologies, is expected in the future.", "An ISP is the consumer\u2019s \u201con-ramp\u201d to the Internet, and once connected to  the ISP, the consumer actually becomes part of the Internet. ISPs have  routers, switches, and other equipment necessary to transmit traffic to and  from the long-haul networks\u2014known as the Internet \u201cbackbone\u201d\u2014which  connect the computers and communications networks that are part of the  Internet. ISPs differ in the features and functions they offer to  subscribers. While some only provide access to the Internet and an e-mail  application, others offer a \u201chome page\u201d with direct links to specific  content on the Internet, as well as proprietary content and additional  applications available only to the ISP\u2019s subscribers.", "Through section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Congress  directed the FCC and the state commissions to \u201cencourage the deployment  on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications  capability to all Americans\u2026.\u201d In its most recent report on the  deployment of advanced telecommunications capability (released in  August 2000), FCC identified certain categories of Americans who may  have difficulty obtaining access to advanced services. These categories  include low-income consumers, those living in sparsely populated areas,  minority consumers, Native Americans, persons with disabilities, and those  living in U.S. territories. In particular, FCC concluded that several barriers  might hinder the ability of low-income, inner-city residents to obtain  advanced services. Such barriers include the poor quality of the  telecommunications plant or of the inside wiring in multiple-tenant  buildings, the relatively high price of advanced services, the lower rates of  computer ownership among inner-city residents, and the lack of marketing  by providers of advanced services to low-income populations. FCC also  found that for the majority of Americans who live in rural areas, lowest- cost access to advanced services was not readily available, and that some  rural areas still lacked basic access to the Internet through a local  telephone call.", "Similarly, the Department of Commerce stated in a recent report that  although a sharp upward trend in the number of Americans connecting to  the Internet from their homes exists (a trend Commerce found to  encompass every income category, education level, racial group, and family  type and to include both urban and rural areas), some demographic groups  are nevertheless still connecting to the Internet far less than others.

We found the proportion of Internet users living in each  type of geographic area to approximate the breakdown of the overall U.S.  population across these areas.

FCC generally found significant investment in the facilities needed to  provide advanced services, steadily rising subscription rates for advanced  services, and a proliferation of providers in the marketplace. However,  FCC stated that less than 20 percent of sparsely populated areas had high- speed subscribers and concluded that many rural Americans are  \u201cparticularly vulnerable to untimely access to advanced services if left to  market forces alone.\u201d Likewise, the Commerce Department, which based  its report on a survey of U.S. households, found the percentages of Internet  users with a broadband transport method to be 12.2 percent in central  cities and 11.8 percent in urban areas, but only 7.3 percent in rural areas.", "To further gauge the level of broadband deployment, we asked current  Internet users about the availability of DSL and cable modem services  where they live.

We excluded 409 responses (16.2 percent of the  sample) as recommended by NPD to ensure that the sample was  representative of the target population. Of the remaining respondents, 140  were excluded because they did not make the primary decisions about  Internet access and therefore did not complete the entire survey.  Additionally, 21 observations were removed because the respondent  provided inconsistent answers to questions 2 and 4 (see app. III for the  questions in the survey) or because the respondent was under 18 years old.  This left 639 complete responses (25.3 percent of the sample).", "The sample frame determines the population to which we can generalize  the survey results. For the first sample, the sample frame was intended to  be representative of the U.S. Internet user population 18 years or older. The  second sample frame was intended to be representative of the U.S. Internet  user population, 18 years or older, who reside in areas where broadband  access was likely to be available. While demographic and usage patterns  for survey participants were intended to be representative of the U.S.  Internet user population, some biases might be present because  participants were volunteers.", "Because we used a sample to develop the estimates of Internet  characteristics presented throughout this report, each estimate has a  measurable precision, or sampling error, that may be expressed as a plus or  minus figure. A sampling error indicates how closely we can reproduce  from a sample the results that we would obtain if we were to take a  complete count of the population we are analyzing using the same  measurement methods. By adding the sampling error to and subtracting it  from the estimate, we can develop upper and lower bounds for each  estimate. This range is called a confidence interval. Sampling errors and  confidence intervals are stated at a certain confidence level\u2014in this case,  95 percent. For example, a confidence interval at the 95-percent confidence  level means that in 95 out of 100 instances, the sampling procedure used  would produce a confidence interval containing the universe value we are  estimating.", "To assess the demographic characteristics of Internet users and of local  areas where broadband service was expected to be available, we relied on  a number of Census Bureau data sets. We compared the proportion of  Internet users in various categories of each demographic variable with the  proportion of the general population in the same categories using the most  recent Census Bureau data available. This permitted us to assess whether  Internet users were more or less prevalent in certain categories of  demographic variables than the general population. To assess the  demographic characteristics of local areas where broadband service was  reported to be available, we relied on Census Bureau zip code data. For  each respondent, NPD provided a corresponding zip code for the area  where the respondent lived. We gathered demographic data for each zip  code from the Census of Population and Housing, 1990: Summary Tape File  3B, Tables P57, P80A, P117, and H61A (the most recent data available). On  the basis of respondents\u2019 answers about the availability of broadband  service, we made inferences about the demographic characteristics of local  areas with and without broadband service as indicated by Census Bureau  data at the zip code level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Results for Sample Intended to Be Representative of the U.S. Internet Population", "paragraphs": ["The following tables show the questions included in our survey of Internet  users and the responses, by percentage of respondents.
