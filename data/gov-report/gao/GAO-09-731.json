These limitations include incomplete and inconsistent race and ethnicity data on emergency room reports and the inconsistent presence of product-related information on death certificates. In 2007, race and ethnicity data were not coded in about 31 percent of cases in CPSC's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), which collects data from a nationally representative sample of hospital emergency rooms. In addition, the hospitals that do record race and ethnicity information in CPSC's NEISS system do so inconsistently, in part because of limited CPSC guidance. While death certificates may include more complete race and ethnicity information compared with nonfatal injury data from hospitals, related product information is not consistently documented on the certificates. Despite this lack of data, CPSC has developed or modified some consumer information efforts to reach specific minority populations, but it has not assessed the results of these efforts. CPSC provides information in Spanish for many of its outreach efforts, including its telephone hotline, Web site, television, radio, and print publications. CPSC has also identified and established relationships with other organizations to help disseminate consumer safety information to minority communities. And while CPSC has used some consumer input to develop safety information, it has not assessed outreach efforts for specific audiences. CPSC has also established goals for its overall consumer information efforts, but not for its messages targeted to specific populations. In addition, CPSC relies on its Neighborhood Safety Network, a group of organizations that have expressed interest in receiving product safety information, to share information with audiences that can be hard to reach, but the agency has not assessed whether these populations are receiving and using the information. Organizations we contacted for this report, including Neighborhood Safety Network members and children's safety groups, generally reported using safety information provided by CPSC, but some offered suggestions for improvement of efforts to reach minority communities, such as providing safety information in other languages and additional exposure through broadcast media."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), an independent  federal agency charged with protecting the public from consumer  products that pose an unreasonable risk of injury and death, estimated  that 29,400 deaths in the United States related to consumer products  occurred in 2004. CPSC works to fulfill its broad mission in part by  conducting research into the causes and prevention of product-related  deaths, illnesses, and injury and assisting consumers in evaluating the  comparative safety of consumer products. CPSC has identified certain  populations as vulnerable or hard to reach with safety information,  including older Americans, urban and rural low-income families, new  parents, and minority groups. Consumer groups and researchers have also  suggested that minority children, particularly those living in low-income  communities, may face an increased risk of death from injuries because of  factors associated with living in poverty, such as poor living conditions  and less access to health care, quality recreational activities, and safety  devices. Similarly, reports from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) have documented racial disparities in injury-related  death rates among children.", "The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA)  established consumer product safety standards and other safety  requirements for children\u2019s products. It also contained a provision  requiring GAO to study disparities in the risks and incidence of  preventable injuries and deaths among children of minority populations  related to consumer products intended for children\u2019s use. Specifically,  GAO is to look at preventable injuries and deaths related to suffocation,  poisoning, and drowning, including those associated with the use of  swimming pools and spas; toys; cribs, mattresses, and bedding materials;  and other products intended for children\u2019s use. Minority populations  specified in the mandate include Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska  Native, Native Hawaiian, and Asian/Pacific Islander. The mandate also  required GAO to provide information about ways to minimize risks of  preventable injuries and deaths among minority children, including  through consumer education initiatives. To address this mandate, we  examined (1) what is known about the relative incidence of preventable  injuries and deaths related to drowning, poisoning, and suffocation  associated with products intended for children\u2019s use among minority  children compared with nonminority children, and (2) what actions CPSC  has taken through its public information and education initiatives to  minimize child injuries and deaths, including those in minority  populations, related to products intended for children\u2019s use.", "To answer these questions, we reviewed studies and reports by the  Institute of Medicine, federal agencies, researchers, and other  organizations that assessed racial or ethnic differences in injury and death  among children and related studies that discussed injury prevention  programs targeted to minority populations. We reviewed injury and death  data sources used by CPSC to estimate product-related injuries and  deaths. We interviewed federal officials at CPSC and five Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) organizations to learn about their  related programs and initiatives. In addition, we obtained information  about injury data, racial and ethnic disparity issues, and injury prevention  campaigns from researchers, representatives of injury prevention  programs, consumer groups, and groups representing the health and  consumer interests of minority populations.

CPSC oversees about 15,000 types of  consumer products used in the home, in schools, and in sports and  recreation. In fiscal year 2008, CPSC carried out its mission with a budget  of about $80 million and 396 full-time employees. Prior to 2008, CPSC  experienced significant budget cuts and a sharp decline in its staffing level  from a high of 978 employees in 1980. Congress appropriated increased  funding totaling about $105 million for fiscal year 2009.

CPSC maintains a National Injury Information Clearinghouse that  disseminates information to the public related to deaths and injuries  associated with consumer products under the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. CPSC  also warns the public about product hazards by announcing product  recalls and providing other safety information through print and electronic  media, a telephone hotline, electronic mail, and the Internet. For example,  CPSC works with manufacturers to provide public notice of product  recalls, in which a defective item is to be removed from store shelves and  consumers are alerted to return the item for repair, replacement, or  refund, or otherwise dispose of them. To further its reach, CPSC also  provides safety information to broadcast outlets, such as radio and  television stations, and to print media outlets. According to CPSC officials,  CPSC has allocated approximately $1 million annually to support its  consumer information efforts and has nine employees in the Office of  Public Affairs, the office responsible for developing and implementing  CPSC\u2019s consumer information efforts in consultation with CPSC\u2019s  technical experts and other CPSC staff. Congress appropriated funding in  2009 to help CPSC administer the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa  Safety Act, including about $2.4 million for a state grant program and over  $4 million for a program to inform the public and pool owners of pool and  spa hazards to prevent children from drowning.", "Recently passed legislation requires CPSC to improve its consumer  information activities. For example, the Consumer Product Safety  Improvement Act (CPSIA) requires CPSC to develop an online database  that is publicly available and searchable by date, product name, model,  and manufacturer. The database must contain reports of harm relating to  the use of consumer products. CPSIA also specifies the information that  must be included in a mandatory product recall notice, including details  about related injuries and deaths.

The study used data  collected by CPSC about drowning deaths from death certificates, medical  examiner reports, and newspaper clippings. The study found that black  non-Hispanic males and females had higher swimming pool drowning  rates compared with white non-Hispanic males and females of comparable  age. Drowning rates were highest among black males, often occurring  during the day at public pools, and this increased risk persisted after  controlling for differences in neighborhood income. Hispanic males also  had higher rates of pool drowning compared with white non-Hispanic  males, but they had lower rates compared with black non-Hispanic males  of comparable age. The drowning rates among Hispanic females were  similar to those of white non-Hispanic females. The drowning rates among  foreign-born victims were higher than among American-born victims.

In 2003, the agency funded a literature  review to examine the factors influencing consumers\u2019 understanding of  and responses to recall notices and other safety information. The study  findings suggested ways product recall communications could be  improved to help consumers eliminate or reduce product hazards, such as  using pictures and signal language like \u201cwarning\u201d or \u201cdanger\u201d to help  consumers attend to and understand safety messages. CPSC also created  an online Consumer Opinion Forum that consumers can join to provide  feedback on product safety issues, such as how a recall notice could be  written more clearly; however, consumers must have Internet access to  participate in this forum. In addition, CPSC recognizes that to understand  the culture and diversity within the Hispanic community, it must take  certain steps such as interviewing members of the community, reviewing  related research, and consulting with colleagues from other federal  agencies. For example, to translate and adapt materials for one of its  outreach campaigns for different segments of the Spanish-speaking  audience, CPSC conducted interviews with members of the Hispanic  community from varying educational backgrounds. Although CPSC has  periodically conducted audience research, agency officials told us they do  not have the resources to regularly pretest safety messages. However,  officials from a few organizations we interviewed noted that CPSC could  conduct focus groups with members of the target audience or include  representatives of organizations that work with the target audience on an  advisory committee to help design and implement safety campaigns.", "CPSC has also established goals for its overall consumer information  efforts, but not for its messages targeted to specific populations. In its  2008 performance and accountability report, CPSC stated that its goal for  using consumer information was to alert the public to children\u2019s and other  hazards through consumer outreach, press releases, and conducting nine  public information efforts that included topics such as drowning and  poisoning prevention. CPSC sets annual performance goals that measure  the success for each of these consumer information methods according to  the total number of items issued, viewed, or conducted during that fiscal  year. For example, CPSC set a fiscal year 2008 goal to receive 450 million  views of its safety messages through television appearances, video news  releases, and downloads of e-publications.", "CPSC relies on the Neighborhood Safety Network to share product safety  information with audiences that can be hard to reach, but the agency has  not formally assessed whether these populations are receiving and using  the information. And while CPSC tracks the number of views its safety  messages receive, CPSC officials stated that they do not collect  information on audience demographics, which could indicate the target  audiences being reached. Likewise, CPSC has conducted surveys to assess  customer satisfaction with its toll-free hotline, Web site, and partnerships  with state government agencies, and these surveys indicate a high level of  satisfaction with CPSC services; however, these surveys do not collect  information about the demographic characteristics of the consumers using  CPSC\u2019s services to determine the extent to which they are representative  of the general population. According to CPSC officials, CPSC has also not  identified outcome measures to evaluate how well its campaigns affected  the attitudes and behaviors of the target audiences it set out to influence.  We previously identified strategies used by other federal agencies to  evaluate the effectiveness of information campaigns, including analyzing  findings from previous research, collaborating with program partners to  help meet the information needs of diverse audiences and expand the  usefulness of evaluations, and surveying the intended audience to ask  about program exposure, knowledge, and attitude change. CPSC officials  have also cited a lack of resources as a challenge to establishing  evaluation programs to measure results; however, CPSC has recently  received more resources from the fiscal year 2009 appropriation for the  Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act. In the course of our  review, CPSC officials stated that with this new funding for the act, they  planned to include an evaluation component, but as of the writing of this  report, it was not yet known how CPSC planned to implement this  component."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Protecting children from dangerous consumer products is a critical part of  CPSC\u2019s mission. Some research suggests that there are racial and ethnic  disparities in child death rates due to injuries related to particular  consumer products; however, CPSC does not routinely assess whether  such disparities exist, primarily because data limitations make it  challenging to conduct such analyses. In addition, the lack of information  about other characteristics of individuals who are injured or die from  involvement with a consumer product, such as socioeconomic status,  prevents CPSC from identifying potential underlying causes of racial and  ethnic differences in injury and death rates. Without efforts to augment or  improve existing data, CPSC may not know which groups are most  vulnerable to product-related injury or death. If available data are  improved, CPSC may be better able to identify hazards that  disproportionately affect certain communities and develop ways to reduce  those hazards.", "Despite limited information on racial and ethnic differences in product- related injury and death, CPSC has made some special efforts to deliver  some of its consumer information to audiences the agency identified as  hard to reach, including minority groups. However, CPSC has not  collected information on whether these targeted groups are receiving and  acting on the safety information. Without fully assessing its consumer  education and public outreach campaigns, CPSC cannot know how  effective these initiatives are at reaching intended audiences, some of  which may be at an elevated risk of injury or death."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better understand the relative risk of product-related injury among  minority and nonminority children, we recommend that the Commission,  in consultation with HHS,    Develop and implement cost-effective means of improving CPSC\u2019s data  collection on factors that may contribute to differences in the incidence of  injury and death related to specific types of consumer products, including  race, ethnicity, and other patient characteristics. For example, steps CPSC  could consider include improving the NEISS racial and ethnic  classification system; working with NEISS hospitals to improve collection  of data on patient race and ethnicity; and leveraging related data collection  efforts, such as those sponsored by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau,  the National Center for Health Statistics, or the National Institutes of  Health.", "To improve the effectiveness of consumer information efforts, we  recommend that the Commission,    Develop and implement cost-effective ways to enhance and assess the  likelihood that CPSC\u2019s safety messages are received and implemented by  all the intended audiences. For example, CPSC could consider convening  groups of consumers or Neighborhood Safety Network members to advise  on the design and implementation of campaigns targeted to specific  communities, surveying NSN members, establishing metrics to measure  NSN\u2019s success, and evaluating the effectiveness of information campaigns  targeted to the racial and ethnic groups at highest risk of drowning as part  of its implementation of the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety  Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CPSC and HHS for review and  comment.

We  reviewed data and documentation obtained from CPSC concerning its  databases that contain injury and death data, including the Death  Certificates database, National Electronic Injury Surveillance System  (NEISS), Injury or Potential Injury Incidents file, and In-Depth  Investigations file. We reviewed information describing Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) mortality data, which includes  information from death certificates filed in the United States collected  through the National Vital Statistics System. We also reviewed HHS  household and health care provider surveys that include injury data, such  as the National Health Interview Survey and the National Hospital  Discharge Survey. We also interviewed CPSC officials, HHS officials, and  researchers to gather information about the strengths and weaknesses of  available data sources.", "We assessed the completeness and reliability of the NEISS data set by (1)  reviewing NEISS\u2019s technical documentation and methodological reports,  (2) interviewing CPSC officials, (3) examining these data for obvious  inconsistencies, and (4) visiting three NEISS hospitals to better  understand how the data are coded. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable to use as sources of summary statistics about the  extent of missing race and ethnicity information in the NEISS system. To  determine the extent of missing race and ethnicity information in CPSC\u2019s  NEISS system, we analyzed NEISS data obtained from CPSC for the years  1999-2007.", "To explore available data published in related studies, we searched  relevant databases, including PubMed, ProQuest, PsycFirst, and  ScienceDirect. We also consulted with CPSC and HHS staff to identify  related studies. We limited the scope of our work by looking at studies  published since 1999. Through this process, our literature search identified  about 70 studies, but only 3 studies published data on racial and/or ethnic  differences in child injury or death rates related to specific consumer  products, and we conducted detailed reviews of these studies. Our reviews  entailed an assessment of each study\u2019s research methodology, including its  data quality, research design, and analytic techniques, as well as a  summary of each study\u2019s major findings and conclusions. We also assessed  the extent to which each study\u2019s data and methods supported its findings  and conclusions.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed CPSC documents and  interviewed CPSC officials regarding the development, operation, and  evaluation of the agency\u2019s consumer information efforts. Specifically, we  reviewed CPSC\u2019s Web site, and documents such as CPSC customer  satisfaction surveys, press releases, strategic plans, and performance and  accountability reports. We compared the processes used by CPSC with  key practices identified by experts in GAO\u2019s previous work as important to  planning a consumer education campaign, motivating a target audience,  and alleviating challenges in a campaign (see app. II for a description of  these practices). We interviewed federal officials at CPSC and five HHS  organizations\u2014Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Indian Health  Service, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, National Institutes of Health,  and the Office of Minority Health\u2014to learn about their related programs  and initiatives.
