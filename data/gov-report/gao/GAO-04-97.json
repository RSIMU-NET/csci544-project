This report examines: (1) who serves as an assistant-atsurgery, (2) whether health professionals who perform the role must meet a uniform set of professional requirements, and (3) whether Medicare's payment policies for assistants-at-surgery are consistent with the goals of the program and, if not, whether there are alternatives that would help attain those goals. GAO analyzed information provided by physician and other health professional associations and Medicare payment data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Members of a wide range of health professions serve as assistants-at-surgery, including physicians, residents in training for licensure or board certification in a physician specialty, several different kinds of nurses, and members of several other health professions. Hospitals employ all the types of nonphysician health professionals who perform the role. Hospital employees likely serve as assistants-at-surgery for a majority of the procedures for which the American College of Surgeons says an assistant is \"almost always\" necessary. The number of assistant-at-surgery services performed by physicians and paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule has declined, while the number of such services performed by nonphysician health professionals eligible to receive payment under the physician fee schedule has increased. There is no widely accepted set of uniform requirements for experience and education that the health professionals who serve as assistants-at-surgery are required to meet. The health professions whose members provide assistant-at-surgery services have varying educational requirements. No state licenses all the health professionals who serve as assistants-at-surgery. Furthermore, the certification programs developed by the various nonphysician health professional groups whose members assist at surgery differ. GAO found that there was insufficient information about the quality of care provided by assistants-at-surgery generally, or by a specific type of health professional, to assess the adequacy of the requirements for members of a particular profession to perform the role. There are three flaws in Medicare's policies for paying assistants-at-surgery that prevent the payment system from meeting the program's goals of making appropriate payment for medically necessary services by qualified providers. First, because Medicare pays for assistant-at-surgery services under both the hospital inpatient prospective payment system and the physician fee schedule, and hospital payments for surgical care are not adjusted when an assistant receives payment under the physician fee schedule, Medicare may be paying too much for some hospital surgical care. Second, paying a health professional under the physician fee schedule to be an assistant-at-surgery, instead of including this payment in an all-inclusive payment, gives neither the hospital nor surgeon an incentive to use an assistant only when one is medically necessary. Third, the distinctions between those health professionals eligible for payment as an assistant-at-surgery under the physician fee schedule and those who are not eligible are not based on surgical education or experience as an assistant. Criteria for determining who should be paid as assistants-at-surgery under the physician fee schedule do not exist. However, hospitals are responsible under health and safety rules to provide quality care for their patients."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries receive care from qualified providers  and that payments to providers are for the appropriate amount and only  for medically necessary services are recognized goals of Medicare.

Medicare makes a single payment to hospitals for all the  services, including assistant-at-surgery services, that a hospital provides to  a beneficiary while an inpatient. The inpatient PPS pays predetermined  fixed amounts for groups, or bundles, of services, designed to provide  incentives to control spending by rewarding efficiency. Medicare also pays  teaching hospitals under the inpatient PPS for providing graduate medical  education (GME) to the residents employed by the hospital, some of  whom assist at surgery.", "Medicare also makes payments under the Medicare physician fee schedule  for assistant-at-surgery services performed by physicians and members of  certain nonphysician health professions whose members assist.

Congress required that we give  special consideration to quality of care, appropriate education  requirements, and appropriate rates of Medicare payment for assistants-at- surgery.

These summary data are derived from the  Medicare Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files, which  contain procedure-specific billing data for all physician and supplier  services provided to Medicare beneficiaries each year. CMS contractors  edit these data, and data limitations are published annually. We used our  analysis of these data to determine the number, variety, and location of  surgical procedures for which physician and nonphysician health  professional assistants-at-surgery sought Medicare payment under the  physician fee schedule. We also analyzed these data by the categories in  the American College of Surgeons\u2019 (ACS) study that classifies each  surgical procedure by the likelihood that it will require an assistant-at- surgery. We could not determine the number of assistants-at-surgery who  were paid under the inpatient PPS because CMS does not collect those  data. We interviewed staff from CMS; representatives of nine large  academic teaching hospitals distributed across the country; and  representatives of state licensing boards, assistant-at-surgery education  programs, and associations of hospitals, physicians, nurses, and other  health professions, including those whose members assist at surgery (see  app. I). We used these interviews to determine whether nonphysician  health professionals who perform the role of assistant-at-surgery must  meet a uniform set of professional requirements.

These studies classify surgical  procedures as \u201calmost always,\u201d \u201csometimes,\u201d or \u201calmost never\u201d requiring   an assistant-at-surgery.

Part B, or Supplementary Medical Insurance, includes  payment for the services and items provided by physicians, certain other  nonphysician health professionals, suppliers, outpatient hospital  departments, and home health care agencies.", "Medicare makes payments to hospitals under part A through the hospital  inpatient PPS for assistants-at-surgery. A fixed payment is made for all  the inpatient hospital services, including assistant-at-surgery services, that  a hospital provides to a beneficiary with a given diagnosis or receiving a  particular type of surgery. Payments under the hospital inpatient PPS  reflect the average bundle of services that beneficiaries with a particular   diagnosis receive as inpatients in similar hospitals. The hospital\u2019s payment  for a bundle of services is the same regardless of whether an assistant-at- surgery is used or who provides the assistant-at-surgery services.", "Prospective payment systems, such as the hospital inpatient PPS, are  designed to promote efficiency: because the payment for a particular  bundle of services is almost always the same, regardless of the services a  particular patient receives, hospitals are discouraged from providing  unnecessary services. Providing additional services would not increase  their payments. Consequently, PPS payments to the hospital are  sometimes less and sometimes more than the cost of providing care.", "Payments are also made under the hospital inpatient PPS to teaching  hospitals for providing GME to the residents employed by the hospital. In  2001, about 20 percent of the approximately 5,800 U.S. hospitals were  considered teaching hospitals. In 2003, surgical residents comprised about  20 percent of all residents at these hospitals. There were about 7,500  residents in general surgery and about 13,000 more surgical residents  training for specialties, such as orthopedics, all of whom were required to  serve as assistants-at-surgery as part of their training. In addition to these  surgical residents, some nonsurgical residents have surgical rotations  during which they serve as assistants-at-surgery.", "Medicare makes part B payments to assistants-at-surgery under the  physician fee schedule when assistant services are performed by a  physician or by a nonphysician health professional authorized to receive  such payment. In 2002, these payments totaled about $158 million, less  than 2 percent of the $10.5 billion Medicare paid to surgeons for surgical  procedures that year. Medicare also makes global payments to surgeons  under the physician fee schedule that cover the surgery and some pre- and  postoperative services that the surgeons and their employees perform.  Assistant-at-surgery services are not included in this bundle of services.  Generally, the amount Medicare pays under the physician fee schedule is  based on the resources needed to perform a service: the physician\u2019s time  and skill, practice expenses that include the costs of staff, equipment, and  supplies, and the cost of liability insurance. While a surgeon\u2019s global fee  for a surgical procedure is set to reflect the resources required to perform  the service, payments under the physician fee schedule for assistant-at- surgery services are not; they are calculated as a fixed percentage of the  surgeon\u2019s global fee. The percentage varies depending on the profession of  the assistant-at-surgery. The Medicare physician fee schedule pays  physicians more than nonphysician health professionals for assistant-at- surgery services (see table 1).", "Medicare sets requirements that various health care institutions, suppliers,  and professionals must meet to be paid by the program. Institutions, such  as hospitals, must meet conditions of participation (CoP)\u2014health and  safety rules used to ensure quality of care.

Because neither the hospital nor the surgeon incurs a cost when an  assistant-at-surgery is paid under the physician fee schedule, neither has a  financial incentive to use an assistant only when one is necessary. The  lack of this incentive is of concern because assistant-at-surgery services  receive little review to determine the medical necessity of the services.

In 1997, Congress passed legislation that requires virtually all kinds of  services or items furnished to beneficiaries residing in skilled nursing  facilities (SNF) that had been paid for separately under part B, instead be  included in a bundle of services paid for under part A. Prior to  implementation of the provision, SNFs could permit a nonphysician health  professional or supplier to seek payment under part B for ancillary  services or items furnished directly to SNF residents, as long as the SNF  did not include the service or item in its part A bill. The legislation,  however, prevents this \u201cunbundling\u201d by including in Medicare SNF PPS  payments ancillary services or items a SNF resident may require that  previously had been paid under part B.", "Bundling assistant-at-surgery services into the package of services covered  by the surgeon\u2019s global payment based on the Medicare physician fee  schedule has significant drawbacks. First, because the amount paid under  the inpatient hospital PPS for assistants-at-surgery is unknown, the total  amount to be added to the physician fee schedule for providing assistants  is unknown. Second, a payment amount for assistant-at-surgery services  would have to be determined for each surgical procedure. Since data are  not collected on how often each surgeon uses assistants-at-surgery for  each surgical procedure, the bundled payment would presumably include  an allotment for the expected average cost of assistants for all surgeons  performing the procedure. Using this approach, surgeons with an  unusually high number of procedures requiring assistants would be paid  too little, while those with an unusually low number of procedures  requiring assistants would be paid too much. In addition, a surgeon would  have a financial incentive to use an assistant-at-surgery less frequently for  surgical procedures for which ACS says that an assistant may be needed,  even when the condition of the beneficiary indicates that an assistant  would be desirable. Because there is a difference in costs to a surgeon  depending on whether an assistant-at-surgery is used, a surgeon\u2019s bundled  payment amount could be adjusted when an assistant is used. Doing so,  however, would provide no financial incentive for surgeons to use an  assistant-at-surgery only when one is medically necessary."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Decisions to use an assistant-at-surgery should not be influenced by  payment; they should be based on medical necessity. The majority of  assistants-at-surgery are likely employed by hospitals, where the inpatient  hospital PPS pays for their services. If Congress were to consolidate  Medicare physician fee schedule payments for assistant-at-surgery  services into the inpatient hospital PPS, this would give hospitals an  incentive to use assistants only when they are necessary. Meanwhile, the  hospital CoP would continue to give hospitals an incentive to assure that  the most appropriate assistants-at-surgery are used as part of their  responsibility to provide quality care for their patients. Paying for  assistants under the physician fee schedule provides no such incentive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["We suggest that Congress may wish to consider consolidating all Medicare  payments for assistant-at-surgery services under the hospital inpatient  prospective payment system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We received comments on a draft of this report from CMS, which agreed  that payment policy for assistants-at-surgery could be improved.
