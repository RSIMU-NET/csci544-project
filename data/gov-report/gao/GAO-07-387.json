MDA's strategy is to field new capabilities in 2-year blocks. In January 2006, MDA initiated its second block--Block 2006--to protect against attacks from North Korea and the Middle East. Congress requires GAO to assess MDA's progress annually. This year's report addresses MDA's progress during fiscal year 2006 and follows up on program oversight issues and the current status of MDA's quality assurance program. GAO assessed the progress of each element being developed by MDA, examined acquisition laws applicable to major acquisition programs, and reviewed the impact of implemented quality initiatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2006, MDA fielded additional assets for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), enhanced the capability of some assets, and realized several noteworthy testing achievements. For example, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element successfully conducted its first end-to-end test of one engagement scenario, the element's first successful intercept test since 2002. However, MDA will not meet its original Block 2006 cost, fielding, or performance goals because the agency has revised those goals. In March 2006, MDA: reduced its goal for fielded assets to provide funds for technical problems and new and increased operations and sustainment requirements; increased its cost goal by about $1 billion--from $19.3 to $20.3 billion; and reduced its performance goal commensurate with the reduction of assets. MDA may also reduce the scope of the block further by deferring other work until a future block because four elements incurred about $478 million in fiscal year 2006 budget overruns. With the possible exception of GMD interceptors, MDA is generally on track to meet its revised quantity goals. But the deferral of work, both into and out of Block 2006, and inconsistent reporting of costs by some BMDS elements, makes the actual cost of Block 2006 difficult to determine. In addition, GAO cannot assess whether the block will meet its revised performance goals until MDA's models and simulations are anchored by sufficient flight tests to have confidence that predictions of performance are reliable. Because MDA has not entered the Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition cycle, it is not yet required to apply certain laws intended to hold major defense acquisition programs accountable for their planned outcomes and cost, give decision makers a means to conduct oversight, and ensure some level of independent program review. MDA is more agile in its decision-making because it does not have to wait for outside reviews or obtain higher-level approvals of its goals or changes to those goals. Because MDA can revise its baseline, it has the ability to field fewer assets than planned, defer work to a future block, and increase planned cost. All of this makes it hard to reconcile cost and outcomes against original goals and to determine the value of the work accomplished. Also, using research and development funds to purchase operational assets allows costs to be spread over 2 or more years, which makes costs harder to track and commits future budgets. MDA continues to identify quality assurance weaknesses, but the agency's corrective measures are beginning to produce results. Quality deficiencies are declining as MDA implements corrective actions, such as a teaming approach, designed to restore the reliability of key suppliers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The concern that nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are  proliferating has heightened the sense of urgency for our country to  develop a comprehensive missile defense system capable of defending the  United States and its allies against weapons of mass destruction and the  ballistic missiles that could deliver them. The threat from ballistic missiles  is growing with at least 25 countries now possessing or acquiring  sophisticated missile technology. For nearly half a century, the  Department of Defense (DOD) has been funding efforts to develop a  system to detect, track, and defeat ballistic missiles deployed from enemy  launch sites. The current system under development\u2013the Ballistic Missile  Defense System (BMDS)\u2013includes a diverse collection of land-, air-, sea-,  and space-based assets located around the globe and founded on cutting- edge technology.

The  elements are: Airborne Laser (ABL); Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (Aegis  BMD); BMDS Sensors; Command, Control, Battle Management, and  Communications (C2BMC); Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD);  Kinetic Energy Interceptors (KEI); Multiple Kill Vehicles (MKV); Space  Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS); and Terminal High Altitude  Area Defense (THAAD). MDA has adopted an evolutionary acquisition  approach in which the BMDS will be fielded in 2-year blocks. The first  block, known as Block 2004, ended on December 31, 2005. The block  fielded a limited capability that included initial versions of GMD; Aegis  BMD; Patriot Advanced Capability-3; and C2BMC elements. This capability  is designed to provide limited protection of the United States from  intercontinental ballistic missile attacks out of North Korea and the Middle  East and protection of U.S. forces and critical assets from short- and  medium-range ballistic missiles.", "The current block, Block 2006\u2013which represents the period of  development for calendar years 2006 and 2007\u2014enhances existing  capabilities, provides additional assets for operational use, and continues  development of future capabilities. MDA submitted its goals for Block  2006 to Congress shortly after its fiscal year 2006 budget request. The  goals quantified the number of assets that MDA planned to field by the end  of the block, defined the performance that fielded assets were expected to  deliver, and identified the cost of all Block 2006 efforts, including the cost  of assets being fielded and of developmental activities for three  elements\u2014ABL, STSS, and THAAD\u2014that will not be operational until  future blocks. Fiscal year testing goals were also established by element  program offices, but these goals were not formally reported to Congress.", "The National Defense Authorization Acts for fiscal years 2002 and 2005  mandated that we prepare annual assessments of MDA\u2019s ongoing cost,  schedule, testing, and performance progress through fiscal year 2006. To  date, we have delivered assessments covering fiscal years 2003, 2004, and  2005 to Congress. In this report, we assess the progress MDA made during  fiscal year 2006 against the Block 2006 goals submitted to Congress in  March 2005, as well as the testing goals established by the nine BMDS  elements. We have also followed up on two previously reported issues:   (1) whether the flexibility granted to MDA in acquiring the BMDS has  reduced decision-makers\u2019 knowledge of program outcomes, thereby  limiting program oversight and MDA\u2019s accountability for the investment  being made in missile defense; and (2) the current status of MDA\u2019s quality  assurance program.", "To address our objectives, we looked at the accomplishments of six BMDS  elements\u2014ABL, Aegis BMD, BMDS Sensors, C2BMC, GMD, and STSS. The  report also includes information on the progress of three elements\u2014KEI,  MKV, and THAAD\u2013being developed during fiscal year 2006 that MDA  considers part of future blocks. Together, these nine elements collectively  account for about 72 percent of MDA\u2019s fiscal year 2006 research and  development budget. The remainder of MDA\u2019s budget funds activities such  as new technology and system concepts and common support for all  elements. To determine the elements\u2019 progress toward Block 2006 goals,  we examined System Element Reviews, test plans and reports, production  plans, and Contract Performance Reports. We also interviewed officials  within each element program office and within MDA functional offices. In  assessing whether a match exists between the missile defense program\u2019s  flexibility, and the program\u2019s transparency, we examined documents such  as those defining MDA\u2019s changes to Block 2006 goals, acquisition laws for  major DOD programs, and BMDS policy directives issued by the Secretary  of Defense. We examined the current status of MDA\u2019s quality assurance  program by visiting various contractor facilities and holding discussions  with MDA officials, such as officials in the Office of Quality, Safety, and  Mission Assurance. We performed our work from June 2006 to March 2007  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["MDA\u2019s mission is to develop and field an integrated and layered Ballistic  Missile Defense System to defend the United States, its deployed forces,  allies, and friends against all ranges of enemy ballistic missiles in all  phases of flight. This is challenging, requiring a complex combination of  defensive components\u2014space-based sensors, surveillance and tracking  radars, advanced interceptors, command and control, and reliable  communications\u2014that work together as an integrated system.", "A typical hit-to-kill engagement scenario for an intercontinental ballistic  missile (ICBM) would unfold as follows:  Infrared sensors aboard early-warning satellites detect the hot plume of  a missile launch and alert the command authority of a possible attack.", "Upon receiving the alert, land- or sea-based radars are directed to track  the various objects released from the missile and, if so designed, to  identify the warhead from among spent rocket motors, decoys, and  debris.", "When the trajectory of the missile\u2019s warhead has been adequately  established, an interceptor\u2014consisting of a \u201ckill vehicle\u201d mounted atop  a booster\u2014is launched to engage the threat. The interceptor boosts  itself toward a predicted intercept point and releases the kill vehicle.", "The kill vehicle uses its onboard sensors and divert thrusters to detect,  identify, and steer itself into the warhead. With a combined closing  speed on the order of 10 kilometers per second (22,000 miles per hour),  the warhead is destroyed through a \u201chit-to-kill\u201d collision with the kill  vehicle above the atmosphere.", "To develop a system capable of carrying out such an engagement, MDA is  executing an evolutionary acquisition strategy in which the fielding of  missile defense capabilities is organized in 2-year increments known as  blocks. Each block is intended to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense  System with capabilities that will enhance the development and overall  performance of the system. The first block\u2014Block 2004\u2014ended on  December 31, 2005, and fielded a limited initial capability that included  early versions of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense; Aegis Ballistic  Missile Defense; Patriot Advanced Capability-3; and the Command,  Control, Battle Management, and Communications element.", "During calendar year 2006 and 2007, MDA is focusing its program of work  on the enhancement of four fielded BMDS elements\u2014GMD, Aegis BMD,  Sensors, and C2BMC. The primary contribution of Block 2006 is that it  fields additional assets and continues the evolution of Block 2004 by  providing improved GMD interceptors, enhanced Aegis BMD missiles,  upgraded Aegis BMD ships, a Forward-Based X-Band\u2014Transportable  radar, and enhancements to the C2BMC software.", "MDA divides each year\u2019s budget request into a request for the current  block and requests for future blocks that have not yet formally begun. For  example, in fiscal year 2006, MDA requested funds for Block 2006 and for  blocks that begin in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. When MDA submitted its  Block 2006 budget to Congress in February 2005, the agency requested  funding for not only the four elements fielding assets during Block 2006,  but also for the continued development of three elements\u2014ABL, STSS,  and THAAD\u2014that will not field assets for operational use until future  blocks.  According to MDA officials, these elements\u2014which are primarily  developmental elements\u2014were included in the block because the agency  believed that during the block time frame the elements offered some  emergency capability. MDA also requested fiscal year 2006 funds for two  other developmental elements, MKV and KEI. However, MDA did not  include funding for these elements in its Block 2006 budget request  because they provided no capability during the block. Instead, MDA  requested funding for MKV in its fiscal year 2006 request for Advanced  Component Development and Prototypes\u2014a program element that is not  tied to any block\u2014and for KEI in the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2006 request for  Block 2014. Table 1 provides a brief description of all elements being  developed by MDA.", "As part of MDA\u2019s planning process, the agency defines overarching goals  for the development and fielding of the current BMDS block. These goals  identify the composition of the block (the elements in development and  those planned for fielding), the type and quantity of assets to be fielded,  the cost associated with element development and fielding (including  operation and sustainment activites), and the performance expected of  fielded assets. For example, in March 2005, MDA told Congress that its  Block 2006 program of work would include seven elements\u2014ABL, Aegis  BMD, C2BMC, GMD, Sensors, STSS, and THAAD. Further, MDA identified  the cumulative number of assets that Aegis BMD, C2BMC, GMD, and the  Sensors elements would field by the end of the block, and the performance  that those assets would deliver in terms of probability of engagement  success, the land area from which a ballistic missile launch could be  denied, and the land area that could be protected from a ballistic missile  launch. Finally, MDA told Congress that it would try to complete all Block  2006 work for $20.458 billion.", "To enable MDA to meet its overarching goals, each element\u2019s program  office establishes its own plan for fielding and/or developmental activities.  For example, each program office develops a delivery plan and a test  schedule that contributes to MDA\u2019s performance and fielding goals. The  programs also work with their prime contractor to plan the block of work  so that it can be completed within the program\u2019s share of MDA\u2019s budget.", "Since 2002, missile defense has been seen as a national priority and has  been funded at nearly requested levels. However, DOD\u2019s Program Budget  Decision in December 2004 called for MDA to plan for a $5 billion  reduction in funding over fiscal years 2006-2011. Future MDA budgets  could be affected by cost growth in federal entitlement programs that are  likely to decrease discretionary spending and by increased DOD  expenditures, such as expenses created by the Iraq conflict.", "Last year we reported that MDA strayed from the knowledge-based  acquisition strategy that allows successful developers to deliver, within  budget, a product whose performance has been demonstrated. In doing  so, MDA fielded assets before their capability was known and the full cost  of the capability was not transparent to decision makers. We noted that it  was possible for MDA to return to a knowledge-based approach to  development while still fielding capability in blocks, but that corrective  action was needed to put all BMDS elements on a knowledge-based  approach. That is, instead of concurrently developing, testing and fielding  the BMDS, MDA would need to adopt knowledge points at which the  program would determine if it was ready to begin new acquisition  activities. These knowledge points would be consistent with those called  out in DOD\u2019s acquisition system policy. To provide a basis for holding  MDA accountable for delivering within estimated resources and to ensure  the success of future MDA development efforts, we recommended that the  Secretary of Defense implement a knowledge-based acquisition strategy  for all the BMDS elements, assess whether the current 2-year block  strategy was compatible with the knowledge-based development strategy,  and adopt more transparent criteria for reporting each element\u2019s  quantities, cost, and performance. DOD has not taken any action on the  first two recommendations because it considers MDA\u2019s acquisition  strategy as knowledge-based and because MDA\u2019s block strategy is  compatible with the strategy MDA is implementing. Neither did DOD agree  to take action on our third recommendation to adopt more transparent  criteria for identifying and reporting program changes. In its comments,  DOD responded that MDA is required by statute to report significant  variances in each block\u2019s baseline and that these reports along with  quarterly DOD reviews provide an adequate level of program oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BMDS Elements Made Progress, but It Was Less Than Expected and It Cost More than Planned", "paragraphs": ["MDA made progress during fiscal year 2006 in carrying out planned  accomplishments for the block elements, but it will not deliver the value  originally planned for Block 2006.

Cost increases  were caused by the:    addition of previously unknown operations and sustainment  requirements,  realignment of the GMD program to support a successful return to  flight,  realignment of the Aegis BMD program to address technical  challenges and invest in upgrades to keep pace with the near term  threat, and    preparations for round-the-clock operation of the BMDS when the  system was put on alert.", "In an effort to keep costs within the goal, MDA shifted THAAD\u2019s future  development costs of $1.13 billion to another block.

While this test provided some assurance that the element will work as  intended, the program must test other engagement sequences, which  would include other GMD assets that have not yet participated in an end- to-end flight test. Additionally, independent test agencies told us that  additional flight tests are needed to have a high level of confidence that  GMD can repeatedly intercept incoming ICBMs. Additional tests are also  needed to demonstrate that the GMD element can use long-range  surveillance and tracking data developed by the Aegis BMD element. In  March 2006, we reported that Aegis BMD was unable to participate in a  GMD flight test, which prevented MDA from exercising Aegis BMD\u2019s long- range surveillance and tracking capability in a manner consistent with an  actual defensive mission.

For example, GMD officials told us  that the element has experienced one anomaly during each of its flight  tests since its first flight test conducted in 1999. This anomaly has not yet  prevented the program from achieving any of its primary test objectives;  but, to date, neither its source nor solution has been clearly identified or  defined.

One flexibility accorded MDA was the authority to develop the BMDS  outside of DOD\u2019s normal acquisition cycle, by not formally entering the  system development and demonstration phase.

In  2002, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics delegated to MDA the authority to establish its own baseline and  make changes to that baseline without approval outside of MDA. Because  it has not formally entered system development and demonstration, MDA  can also initiate a block of capability and move forward with its fielding  without an independent cost estimate or an independent test of the  effectiveness and suitability of assets intended for operational use. The  ability to make decisions on its own and proceed without independent  verifications reduces decision timelines, making the BMDS program more  agile than other DOD programs.", "MDA\u2019s ability to quickly field a missile defense capability is also enhanced  by its ability to field the BMDS before all testing is complete. MDA  considers the assets it has fielded to be developmental assets and not the  result of the production phase of the acquisition cycle. Because MDA has  not advanced the BMDS or its elements into the acquisition cycle, it is  continuing to produce and field assets without completing the operational  test and evaluation normally required by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2399 before full-rate  production. For example, MDA has acquired and emplaced 14 ground- based interceptors for operational use before both developmental and  operational testing is completed.

This is  particularly true of an element. For example, a Block 2006 element like  GMD covers a wide range of activities, from research and development on  future enhancements to the fabrication of interceptors for operations.

For example, between  2003 and mid-2005, MDA changed its Block 2004 delivery goals three  times, progressively decreasing the number of assets planned for the block  when it was initially approved for funding. This trend has continued into  Block 2006, with the agency changing its delivery plans once since it  presented its initial Block 2006 goals to Congress. MDA is required to  report such changes only if MDA\u2019s Director considers the changes  significant.", "In addition to deferring the delivery of assets from one block to another,  MDA also has the flexibility to defer other work activities from a current  to a future block. This creates a rolling scope, making it difficult to keep  track of what an individual block is responsible for delivering. For  example, during Block 2004, MDA deferred some planned development,  deployment, characterization, and verification activities until Block 2006  so that it could cover contractor budget overruns. MDA is unable to  determine exactly how much work was deferred. However, according to a  November 2006 report to Congress, MDA found it necessary to defer the  work until Block 2006 to make Block 2004 funding available to implement  a new GMD test strategy following two GMD flight test failures, resolve  quality issues associated with GMD interceptors and its exoatmospheric  kill vehicle, and add an FBX-T radar to the initial deployed capability.  Agency officials are already anticipating the deferral of work from Block  2006 into Block 2008. In fiscal year 2006, the work of five of the six  contractors responsible for elements included in Block 2006 cost more  than expected. Given program funding limits, MDA officials told us that  they will either have to defer work or request additional funds from  Congress during the remaining years of the block. MDA did not increase  its fiscal year 2007 budget request; therefore, it is likely that the agency  will once again have to defer some planned work into the next block.", "Not only do changes in a block\u2019s work plan make it difficult to know what  outcomes the program expects to achieve, the changes also have the  potential to impact the BMDS\u2019 performance. For example, by decreasing  the number of fielded interceptors, MDA decreases the likelihood that it  can defeat enemy missiles if multiple threats are prevalent because the  number of available interceptors will be limited. In addition, if activities,  such as testing and validation, are not complete when assets are fielded,  the assets may not perform as expected and changes may be needed.

Further, MDA  does not track the cost of deferred work from one block to the next and,  therefore, cannot make adjustments that would match the cost with the  block it benefits. For example, in March 2006, we reported that MDA  deferred some Block 2004 work until Block 2006 so that it could use the  funds appropriated for that work to cover unexpected cost increases  caused by such problems as poor quality control procedures and technical  problems during development, testing, and production. MDA officials told  us that additional funds have been, or will be, requested during Block 2006  to carry out the work. However, the officials could not tell us how much of  the Block 2006 budget is attributable to the deferred work. These actions  caused Block 2004 cost to be understated and Block 2006 cost to be  overstated. In addition, if MDA delays some Block 2006 work until Block  2008, as expected, Block 2006 cost will become more difficult to compare  with its original estimate as the cost of the deferred work will no longer  count against the block.

Because the BMDS and its elements are  a single major defense acquisition program that has not officially entered  into system development and demonstration, it is not required to provide  the detailed reports to Congress directed by statute. While it is possible  to reconstruct planned unit costs from budget documents, the planned  unit cost of some assets\u2014for example, GMD interceptors\u2014is not easy to  determine because the research and development funds used to buy the  interceptors are spread across 3 to 5 budget years. Also, because MDA is  not required to report significant increases in unit cost, it is not easy to  determine whether an asset\u2019s actual cost has increased significantly from  its expected cost. For example, we were unable to compare the actual and  planned cost of a GMD interceptor. By comparison, the Navy provides  more transparency in reporting on the cost of ships, some of which are  incrementally funded with procurement funds. When a Navy ship program  overruns the cost estimate used to justify the budget, the Navy identifies  the additional funding needed to cover the overruns separately from other  shipbuilding programs.", "Using research and development funds to purchase fielded assets further  reduces cost transparency because these dollars are not covered by the  full-funding policy for procurement. Therefore, when the program for a 2- year block is first presented in the budget, Congress is not necessarily fully  aware of the dimensions and cost of that block. Although a particular  block may call for the delivery of a specific number of interceptors, the  full cost of those interceptors may not be contained in that block. In  addition, incremental funding has the potential to \u201ctie the hands\u201d of future  Congresses to finish funding for assets started in prior years.

By  streamlining the process, DOD commissions and task forces hoped to  drastically cut system development and production time and reduce costs  by eliminating management layers, eliminating certain reporting  requirements, using more commercial-off-the-shelf systems and  subsystems, reducing oversight from within as well as from outside DOD,  and by eliminating perceived duplication of testing. In addition to  acquisition streamlining, schedule pressures caused MDA to be less  attentive to quality assurance issues. This was particularly true for the  GMD element that was tasked with completing development and  producing assets for operational use within 2 years of a Presidential  directive to begin fielding an initial missile defense capability. While the  GMD program had realized for some time that its quality controls needed  to be strengthened, the program\u2019s accelerated schedule left little time to  address quality problems.", "MDA has initiated a number of mechanisms to rectify the quality control  weaknesses identified in the BMDS program. For example, as early as  2003, MDA, in concert with industry partners, Boeing, Lockheed Martin,  Raytheon, and Orbital Sciences began a teaming approach to restore  reliability in a key supplier. In exchange for allowing the supplier to report  to a single customer\u2014MDA\u2014the supplier gave MDA\u2019s Office of Quality,  Safety, and Mission Assurance authority to make a critical assessment of  the supplier\u2019s processes. This assessment determined that the supplier\u2019s  manufacturing processes lacked discipline, its corrective action  procedures were ineffective, its technical data package was inadequate,  and personnel were not properly trained. The supplier responded by hiring  a Quality Assurance Director, five quality assurance professionals, a  training manager, and a scheduler. In addition, the supplier installed an  electronic problem reporting database, formed new boards\u2014such as a  failure review board\u2014established a new configuration management  system, and ensured that manufacturing activity was consistent with  contract requirements. According to MDA, by 2005, these changes began  to produce results. Between March 2004 and September 2005, test failures  declined by 43 percent. In addition, open quality control issues decreased  by 64 percent between September 2005 and August 2006 and on-time  deliveries increased by 9 percent between March 2005 and August 2006.  MDA\u2019s teaming approach was expanded in 2006 to another problem  supplier and many systemic solutions are already underway.", "MDA also continues to carry-out regular contractor quality inspections.  For example, during fiscal year 2006, MDA completed quality audits of   6 contractors and identified a total of 372 deficiencies and observations.  As of December 2006, the contractors had closed 157 or 42 percent of all  audit findings. These audits are also producing other signs of quality  assurance improvements. For example, after an August 2006 review of  Raytheon\u2019s production of the last five GMD exoatmospheric kill vehicles,  MDA auditors reported less variability in Raytheon\u2019s production  processes, increasing stability in its statistical process control data, fewer  test problem reports and product waivers, compliance with manufacturing  \u201cclean room\u201d requirements, and a sustained improvement in product  quality. Because of the emphasis placed on the recognition of quality  problems, Raytheon is conducting regular inspections independently of  MDA to identify problems.", "Over the course of 2006, MDA also continued to incorporate MDA  Assurance Provisions (MAP) into its prime contracts. The MAP provides  MDA methods to measure, verify, and validate mission success through  the collection of metrics, risk assessment, technical evaluations,  independent assessments, and reviews. Four BMDS elements\u2013BMDS  Sensors, C2BMC, KEI, and THAAD\u2013modified their contracts during 2006  to incorporate the MAP. The remaining five BMDS elements have not yet  included the plan on their contracts because the contract is mostly in  compliance with the MAP or because of the timing and additional costs of  adding the requirements.", "MDA also encourages better quality assurance programs and contractors\u2019  implementation of best practices through award fee plans. In 2003, three  BMDS elements\u2013BMDS Sensors, KEI, and THAAD\u2013revised their contracts  to include 25 MAP criteria in their award fee plans. For example, the  BMDS Sensors element included system quality, reliability, and  configuration control of data products as part of its award fee criteria for  its FBX-T contract. Contractors are also bringing their best practices to  the table. For example, in an effort to prevent foreign object debris in  components under assembly, Raytheon and Orbital Sciences have placed  all tools in special tool boxes known as shadow boxes. Raytheon has also  incorporated equipment into the production process that handles critical  components, removing the possibility that the components will be  dropped or mishandled by production personnel.", "Because of its quality assurance efforts, contractors and other government  agencies have called on MDA to lead quality conferences and sponsor an  improvement council. MDA\u2019s Office of Quality, Safety, and Mission  Assurance was co-sponsor of a conference on quality in the space and  defense industry and the office\u2019s Director has also served as panel  discussion chair at numerous other conferences. The conferences focus  on the safety, reliability, and quality aspects of all industries and agencies  involved in defense and space exploration. MDA is also a co-sponsor of the  Space Quality Improvement Council, a council established to  cooperatively address critical issues in the development, acquisition, and  deployment of national security space systems. Contractors are also  adopting some MDA methods for improving quality assurance. For  example, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems has adopted the MAP as a  performance standard for all of its defense programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In a general sense, our assessment of MDA\u2019s progress on missile defense is  similar to that of previous years: accomplishments have been made and  capability has been increased, but costs have grown and the scope of  planned work has been reduced. The fielding of additional assets, the  ability to put BMDS on alert status, and the first end-to-end test of GMD  were notable accomplishments during fiscal year 2006. On the other hand,  it is not easy to answer the question of how well BMDS is progressing  relative to the funds it has received and goals it has set for those funds.", "As with previous years, we have found it difficult to reconcile the progress  made in Block 2006 with the original cost and scope of the program. The  block concept, while a useful construct for harvesting and fielding  capability incrementally, is a muddy construct for accountability. Although  BMDS is managed within a relatively level budget of about $10 billion a  year, the scope of planned work is altered several times each year.  Consequently, work travels from one block to another, weakening the  connection between the actual cost and scope of work done and the  estimated cost and scope of work used to justify budget requests. Block  2006 is a case in point. Compared with its original budget justification, it  now contains unanticipated work from Block 2004 but has deferred some  of its own planned work to future blocks. Costs for the THAAD element  are no longer being counted in Block 2006 although they were last year.  Some developmental elements that will be fielded in later blocks, such as  KEI and MKV, are not considered part of Block 2006, while ABL, which is  also a developmental element to be fielded in later blocks, is considered  part of Block 2006. Establishing planned and actual costs for individual  assets is also elusive because MDA\u2019s development of the BMDS outside of  DOD\u2019s acquisition cycle blurs the audit trail. Using research and  development funds\u2014funds that are not covered by the full-funding  policy\u2014contributes to the difficulty in determining some assets\u2019 cost.", "None of the foregoing is to suggest that MDA has acted inconsistently with  the authorities it has been granted. Indeed, by virtue of its not having  formally begun system development and demonstration, coupled with its  authority to use research and development funds to manufacture and field  assets, MDA has the sanctioned flexibility to manage exactly as it has. It  could be argued that without this latitude, the initial capability fielded last  year and put on alert this year would not have been possible. Yet, the  question remains as to whether this degree of flexibility should be retained  on a program that will spend about $10 billion a year for the foreseeable  future. It does not seem unreasonable to expect a program of this  magnitude to be held to a higher standard of accountability than delivering  some capability within budgeted funds. In fact, the program is likely to  undergo greater scrutiny as DOD faces increasing pressure to make  funding trade-offs between its investment portfolios, ongoing military  operations, and recapitalization of its current weapon systems.", "Within BMDS, key decisions lie ahead for DOD. Perhaps the most  significant decision in the next 2 years will be to determine what  investments should be made in the two boost phase elements\u2014ABL and  KEI\u2014under development. This decision would benefit greatly from good  data on actual versus expected performance, actual versus expected cost,  and independent assessments of both cost and performance.", "The recommendations that follow build upon those we made in last year\u2019s  report on missile defense.

DOD  partially concurred with our first three recommendations and non- concurred with the last two.", "In partially concurring with the first recommendation, DOD recognized the  need for greater program transparency, but objected to implementing an  element-centric approach to reporting, believing that this would detract  from managing the BMDS as a single integrated system. We agree that  management of the BMDS as a single, integrated program should be  preserved. However, since DOD already requests funding and awards  contracts by the individual elements that compose the BMDS, we believe  that establishing a baseline for those elements far enough along to be  considered in system development and demonstration provides the best  basis for transparency of actual performance. This would not change  DOD\u2019s approach to managing the BMDS, because merely reporting the  cost and performance of individual elements would not cause each  element to become a major defense acquisition program. DOD stated that  MDA intends to modify its current biennial block approach that is used to  define reporting baselines. In making this change, MDA states that it  intends to work with both Congress and GAO to ensure that its new  approach provides useful information for accountability purposes. At this  point, we believe that the information needed to define a reporting  baseline for a block would best be derived from individual elements. That  having been said, a discourse can be had on whether elements are the only  way to achieve the needed transparency and we welcome the opportunity  to work toward constructive changes.", "DOD also partially concurred with our second recommendation that  BMDS elements effectively in system development and demonstration  provide information consistent with the acquisition laws that govern  baselines and unit cost reporting, independent cost estimates, and  operational test and evaluation for major programs. DOD did commit to  providing additional information to Congress to promote accountability,  consistency, and transparency. Nonetheless, DOD remains concerned that  having elements, rather than the BMD system, report according to these  laws will have a fragmenting effect on the development of an integrated  system and put more emphasis on individual programs as though each is a  major defense acquisition program. We believe that greater transparency  into the BMDS program depends on DOD reporting in the same manner  that it requests program funding. This ensures that decision makers can  reconcile the expected cost and performance of assets DOD plans to  acquire with actual cost and performance. We recognize that MDA does  provide Congress with information on cost and testing, but this  information is not of the caliber or consistency called for by acquisition  laws.", "DOD stated that our third recommendation on reporting at the BMDS-level  appears to be inconsistent with our recommendations on reporting at the  element level. The basis for our third recommendation is that a block,  which is a construct to describe and manage a defined BMDS-wide  capability, must be derived from the capabilities that individual elements  can yield. Except for activities like integrated tests that involve multiple  elements, the cost, schedule, and performance of the individual assets to  be delivered in a block come from the elements. Further, those elements  that are not far enough along to deliver assets or capabilities within a  particular block should not be considered part of that block. We believe  that as MDA works to modify its current biennial block approach, it needs  to be clearer and more consistent about what is and is not included in a  block and that the cost, schedule, and performance of the specific assets  in the block should be derived from the information already generated by  the elements.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation that it request and use  procurement funds to acquire fielded assets. It noted that the flexibility  provided by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation funding is  necessary to develop and acquire new capabilities quickly that can  respond to new and unexpected ballistic missile threats. We recognize the  need to be able to respond to such threats. However, other DOD programs  are also faced with unexpected threats that must be addressed quickly and  have found ways to do so while acquiring operational assets with  procurements funds. If MDA requires more flexibility than other programs,  there should be a reasonable budgetary accommodation available other  than funding the entire budget with Research, Development, Test, and  Evaluation funds. More needs to be done to get a better balance between  flexibility and transparency. Thus, we continue to believe that decision  makers should be informed of the full cost of assets at the time DOD is  asking for approval to acquire them and that procurement funds are the  best way to provide that transparency.", "DOD also did not concur with our fifth recommendation to conduct an  independent evaluation of ABL and KEI to inform the upcoming decisions  on these programs. It believes that MDA\u2019s current integrated development  and decision-making approach should continue as planned. We continue  to believe that MDA would benefit from an independent evaluation of both  ABL and KEI. However, we do believe such an evaluation should be based  on the results of the key demonstrations planned for the elements in 2008  and 2009.

Because MDA is  requiring its prime contractors to perform work that includes enough  uncertainty that the cost of the work cannot be accurately estimated, all of  the agency\u2019s prime contracts are cost reimbursement arrangements. Under  a cost reimbursement contract, a contractor is paid for reasonable,  allowable, and allocable costs incurred in performing the work directed by  the government to the extent provided in the contract.

Cost plus award fee contracts provide for a fee consisting of a  base amount, which may be zero, that is fixed at the inception of the  contract and an award amount, based upon a subjective evaluation by the  government, that is meant to encourage exceptional performance. The  amount of the award fee is determined by the government\u2019s assessment of  the contractor\u2019s performance compared to criteria stated in the contract.

The MKV prime contract is an indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity cost-reimbursement arrangement. This type of contract allows the  government to direct work through a series of task orders. Such a contract  does not procure or specify a firm quantity of services (other than a  minimum or maximum quantity). This contracting approach permits MDA  to order services as they are needed after requirements materialize and  provides the government with flexibility because the tasks can be aligned  commensurate with available funding.

The Orbital Boost Vehicle\u2019s cost grew as the need  for more program management, systems engineering, and production  support was required to work an extended delivery schedule. The Boost  Vehicle+ contractor incurred additional costs as a result of its efforts to  redesign the booster\u2019s motors. For example, the contractor spent  additional time preparing drawings and providing technical oversight of  suppliers.", "The contractor also experienced cost growth as it readied the Sea-based   X-Band radar for deployment. Maintenance, repair, and certification  problems cost more than expected. In addition to making changes that an  independent review team suggested were needed before the radar was  made operational, the contractor had to repair an unexpected ballast leak  requiring the installation of hydraulic valves and other engineering  changes.", "GMD\u2019s cumulative negative schedule variance is primarily caused by a  subcontractor needing more time than planned to manufacture  exoatmospheric kill vehicles.

Integration issues were also discovered  as the payload was tested at successively higher levels of integration.  According to program officials, the prime contractor tightened its  inspection and oversight of the subcontractor responsible for integrating  and testing the satellite payloads. Also, a re-education effort was  undertaken to ensure that all personnel on the program knew and  understood program instructions.
