GAO was asked to examine the eight civilian IC elements' use of contractors. This report examines (1) the extent to which the eight civilian IC elements use core contract personnel, (2) the functions performed by these personnel and the reasons for their use, and (3) whether the elements developed policies and strategically planned for their use. GAO reviewed and assessed the reliability of the eight civilian IC elements' core contract personnel inventory data for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, including reviewing a sample of 287 contract records.

The IC Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) conducts an annual inventory of core contract personnel that includes information on the number and costs of these personnel. However, GAO identified a number of limitations in the inventory that collectively limit the comparability, accuracy, and consistency of the information reported by the civilian IC elements as a whole. For example, changes to the definition of core contract personnel and data shortcomings limit the comparability of the information over time. In addition, the civilian IC elements used various methods to calculate the number of contract personnel and did not maintain documentation to validate the number of personnel reported for 37 percent of the 287 records GAO reviewed. Further, IC CHCO did not fully disclose the effects of such limitations when reporting contract personnel and cost information to Congress, which limits its transparency and usefulness.", "The civilian IC elements used core contract personnel to perform a broad range of functions, such as information technology and program management, and reported in the core contract personnel inventory on the reasons for using these personnel. However, limitations in the information on the number and cost of core contract personnel preclude the information on contractor functions from being used to determine the number of personnel and their costs associated with each function. Further, civilian IC elements reported in the inventory a number of reasons for using core contract personnel, such as the need for unique expertise, but GAO found that 40 percent of the contract records reviewed did not contain evidence to support the reasons reported.", "Collectively, CIA, ODNI, and the departments responsible for developing policies to address risks related to contractors for the other six civilian IC elements have made limited progress in developing those policies, and the civilian IC elements have generally not developed strategic workforce plans that address contractor use. Only the Departments of Homeland Security and State have issued policies that generally address all of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's requirements related to contracting for services that could affect the government's decision-making authority. In addition, IC CHCO requires the elements to conduct strategic workforce planning but does not require the elements to determine the appropriate mix of government and contract personnel. Further, the elements' ability to use the core contract personnel inventory as a strategic planning tool is hindered because the inventory does not provide insight into the functions performed by contractors, in particular those that could inappropriately influence the government's control over its decisions. Without guidance, strategies, and tools related to these types of functions, the eight civilian IC elements may not be well-positioned to identify and manage related risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that IC CHCO take several actions to improve the inventory data's reliability and transparency and revise strategic workforce planning guidance, and develop ways to identify contracts for services that could affect the government's decision-making authority.

Like  other federal agencies, these civilian IC elements rely on contractors to  meet a variety of mission needs. In a 2013 report on intelligence oversight  activities, Congress cited long-standing concerns about the IC\u2019s reliance  on contractors, which it noted increased dramatically after the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001. In October 2009, the Director of National  Intelligence (DNI), who serves as head of the IC, issued Intelligence  Community Directive (ICD) 612 to define and establish IC-wide policy for  managing the use of core contract personnel that support intelligence  missions. As defined by ICD 612, core contract personnel provide a range  of direct technical, managerial, and administrative support functions to IC  elements\u2014some of which may directly inform government decisions,  such as intelligence collection, processing, and analysis, along with  program management. Core contract personnel are distinct from  individual contract personnel who produce commodities or provide widely  available commercial services such as building security. ICD 612 also  states that core contract personnel typically work alongside government  personnel, augment the government workforce, and perform staff-like  work.", "Determining whether services should be performed by federal employees,  contract personnel, or a mixture of both is essential to the federal  government\u2019s effective and efficient use of taxpayers\u2019 dollars. Further,  while the use of contractors can provide benefits in supporting agency  missions, such as flexibility to meet immediate needs and obtain unique  expertise, their use can also introduce risks for the government to  consider and manage. Federal acquisition regulations state that certain  functions government agencies perform, such as setting agency policy  and issuing regulations, are inherently governmental and must be  performed by federal employees. In some cases, contractors perform  functions closely associated with the performance of inherently  governmental functions. For example, contractors performing certain  intelligence analysis activities may closely support inherently  governmental functions. Agencies should give special management  attention to contractors performing services that closely support inherently  governmental functions to guard against the potential for loss of  government control and accountability for mission-related policy and  program decisions.", "Our prior work has examined reliance on contractors and the mitigation of  related risks at the Department of Defense (DOD), DHS, and several  other civilian agencies and found that they generally did not fully consider  and mitigate risks of acquiring services that may inform government  decisions.

ODNI, in consultation with the other civilian IC elements, deemed  some of the information in the September 2013 report as classified, which  must be protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits  sensitive information about (1) the number and associated costs of  government and core contract personnel and some details on how the  civilian IC elements prepare the core contract personnel inventory, (2)  specific contracts from civilian IC elements we reviewed, and (3) details  related to the civilian IC elements\u2019 or their respective departments\u2019  progress in developing policies to mitigate risks related to contractors and  the civilian IC elements\u2019 strategic workforce planning efforts.", "To determine the extent to which the civilian IC elements rely on core  contract personnel, the functions performed by these personnel, and the  factors that contribute to their use, we requested and reviewed data from  each of the eight civilian IC elements: CIA, DEA NN, DHS I&A, DOE IN,  FBI, ODNI, State INR, and Treasury OIA. provided by the civilian IC elements to the IC Chief Human Capital Officer  (IC CHCO) for use in the annual core contract personnel inventories.

The policy therefore directs agencies to ensure that they maintain  sufficient government expertise to manage the contracted work. The  Federal Acquisition Regulation also addresses the importance of  management oversight associated with contractors providing services  that have the potential to influence the authority, accountability, and  responsibilities of government employees. Core contract personnel  perform the types of functions that may affect an IC element\u2019s decision- making authority or control of its mission and operations. While core  contract personnel may perform functions that closely support inherently  governmental work, these personnel are generally prohibited from  performing inherently governmental functions, which require discretion in  applying government authority or value judgments in making decisions  that can only be performed by government employees.

Although the IC elements are not required to  address certain aspects of the OMB policies, either because of the  classified nature of the contracts or because the IC element is a  component of an executive department, these efforts provide IC elements  with leading practices related to considering and mitigating risks when  relying on contractors to perform services that are closely associated with  inherently governmental and critical functions. The IC elements are also  required to follow applicable IC-wide guidance and federal laws and  regulations on the use of contractors. In addition, the departmental  elements\u2014the six civilian IC elements that are components within  executive departments\u2014must comply with related departmental policies  and guidance. For example, DEA NN must comply with federal laws and  regulations as well as all applicable OMB, DOJ, DEA, and IC-wide  guidance.", "OMB\u2019s July 2009 guidance and our prior work have emphasized that  decisions regarding the use of contractors should be based on strategic  workforce planning regarding what types of work are best done by  government personnel or by contractors. Specifically, agencies should  identify the appropriate mix of government and contract personnel on a  function-by-function basis, especially for functions that are critical to an  agency\u2019s mission. The OMB guidance requires an agency to have  sufficient internal capability to control its mission and operations when  contracting for these critical functions. Our prior work has found that  agencies should have overarching strategic-level guidance related to the  extent to which contractors should be used, and agencies\u2019 strategic  workforce planning documents should contain evidence of strategic  considerations of contractor use. In May 2013, we found that DOD had  not yet assessed the appropriate mix of government and contract  personnel in its strategic workforce plans as required by law and, as a  result, was hampered in making more informed strategic workforce  decisions. We recommended that DOD revise existing workforce policies  and procedures to address the determination of the appropriate workforce  mix.

The policy letter also builds  upon past OMB guidance by seeking to broaden agencies\u2019 focus to  include critical functions, which can pose a risk if not carefully monitored.  The policy letter establishes criteria agencies are to use in identifying their  critical functions, which are functions that are necessary to the agency to  effectively perform and maintain control of its mission and operations. The  policy letter further states that the more important the function, the more  important it is that the agency have internal capability to maintain control  of its mission and operations.

The inventories  can assist an agency in understanding the extent to which contractors are  being used to perform activities that closely support inherently  governmental work or support the agency\u2019s mission and operations.  Civilian agencies and DOD are statutorily required to compile service  contract inventories on an annual basis.

In response  to federal statute, IC CHCO prepares an annual personnel assessment  that compares the current and projected number and costs of core  contract personnel to the number and costs during the prior 5 years.  According to IC CHCO, the number of core contract personnel FTEs and  associated costs declined nearly one-third from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal  year 2011. However, we could not validate the extent to which there was  a change in the number of core contract personnel providing support as  we determined that a significant portion of the reported reduction is  attributable to definitional changes and improvements to data systems.  Further, we assessed the reliability of the civilian IC elements\u2019 reported  information for the total FTEs and fiscal year obligations data fields and  determined that the data were not sufficiently reliable for our purpose of  identifying the extent of reliance on core contract personnel (see app. II).", "Since IC CHCO\u2019s initial data collection efforts for the core contract  personnel inventory in fiscal year 2006, it has taken actions to further  clarify and refine its guidance to address concerns that IC elements were  interpreting the definition of core contract personnel differently and to  improve the consistency of the information in the inventory. IC CHCO  worked with the elements to develop a standard definition that was  formalized with the issuance of ICD 612 in October 2009. Further, IC  CHCO formed the IC Core Contract Personnel Inventory Control Board,  which has representatives from all of the IC elements, to provide a forum  to resolve differences in the interpretation of IC CHCO\u2019s guidance for the  inventory. As a result of the board\u2019s efforts, IC CHCO provided  supplemental guidance in fiscal year 2010 to either include or exclude  certain contract personnel, such as those performing administrative  support, training support, and information technology services. For  example, the guidance stated that IC elements should include contract  personnel who provide training that is unique to the IC mission but  exclude those who provide training commercially available through a  vendor. IC CHCO officials told us that changes made over time were  intended to clarify the definition of core contract personnel and improve  the consistency of the information in the inventory. Appendix V  summarizes the major changes in the definition reflected in IC CHCO\u2019s  guidance from fiscal years 2007 through 2011.", "While these changes could improve the inventory data, it is unclear the  extent to which the definitional changes contributed to the reported  decrease in the number of core contract personnel and associated costs  from year to year. For example, for fiscal year 2010, officials from one  civilian IC element told us they stopped reporting information technology  help desk contractors, which had been previously reported, to be  consistent with IC CHCO\u2019s revised definition. One of these officials stated  consequently that the element\u2019s reported reduction in core contract  personnel between fiscal years 2009 and 2010 did not reflect an actual  change in their use of core contract personnel, but rather a change in how  core contract personnel were defined for the purposes of reporting to IC  CHCO. The official told us that their reported information for fiscal year  2010 was therefore not comparable to data from prior years, in part  because of definitional changes.", "Further, this civilian IC element identified data reliability limitations in the  information reported to IC CHCO for certain fiscal years\u2019 inventories,  which the element has taken steps to address. However, while IC CHCO  noted that this civilian IC element implemented an enhanced contract  management system that affected the element\u2019s reporting in the briefing  and annual personnel level assessment, IC CHCO did not disclose how  these improvements affected the ability to compare data across years.  For its submission to the fiscal year 2011 inventory, officials from the  civilian IC element stated that they used a new contract management  system that provided more clarity into which FTEs and obligations should  be included in the inventory and thus improved the reliability of their  reported information. These officials acknowledged significant limitations  with certain aspects of their reported data prior to fiscal year 2011 due to  limitations with the contract management system used for those years.  For example, officials told us that prior to the contract system upgrade,  the system did not allow them to accurately separate out which  obligations and FTEs on certain contracts should be considered core  versus non-core. As a result, these officials stated that we should not  compare the information reported from fiscal year 2010 to 2011 due to the  improvements made in the contract management system.", "However, IC CHCO included this civilian IC element\u2019s data when  calculating the IC\u2019s overall reduction in number of core contract personnel  between fiscal years 2009 and 2011 in its fiscal year 2011 briefing to  Congress. In addition, IC CHCO included these data when comparing the  number and costs of core contract personnel between fiscal year 2009  and 2011 in the fiscal year 2013 personnel level assessment.

IC CHCO did not  explain that the rebaselining would limit the comparability of the number  and costs of core contract personnel for both this civilian IC element and  the IC as a whole because the element did not adjust the number and  costs previously reported.", "In addition, another civilian IC element changed its methodology for  calculating core contract personnel FTEs over time, which limits the ability  to compare this FTE information across certain years.

For its submissions to the  fiscal year 2010 and 2011 inventories, the element reported the actual  number of core contract personnel FTEs. According to officials from this  civilian IC element, because the methodology for calculating the number  of core contract personnel FTEs fundamentally changed from fiscal year  2009 to 2010, the data cannot be compared across these years.  However, IC CHCO reported and compared these numbers in its annual  briefings and personnel level assessments without including information  on these changes and any associated limitations.

ODNI officials stated that a new contract management  system was used for reporting contract obligations in their submission for  the fiscal year 2011 inventory. According to these officials, the new  system offers greater detail and improved functionality for identifying the  amount of obligations on their contracts.

For example, some civilian IC elements estimated contract  personnel FTEs using target labor hours while other civilian IC elements  calculated the number of FTEs using the labor hours invoiced by the  contractor. As a result, the reported numbers are not comparable across  these elements. The IC CHCO core contract personnel inventory  guidance for both fiscal years 2010 and 2011 state that full accounting is  the preferred method for identifying FTEs, but does not provide additional  detail, such as specifying appropriate methodologies for calculating FTEs,  requiring IC elements to describe their methodologies, or requiring IC  elements to disclose any associated limitations with their methodologies.", "Depending on the methodology used, an element can calculate a different  number of FTEs for the same contract. For example, for one contract we  reviewed at a civilian IC element that reports FTEs based on actual labor  hours invoiced by the contractor, the element reported 16 FTEs for the  contract. For the same contract, however, a civilian IC element that uses  estimated labor hours at the time of award would have calculated 27  FTEs. As a result, using different methodologies limits the comparability  of civilian IC elements\u2019 reported numbers and obscures what the  information represents in a given fiscal year. IC CHCO officials stated  they have discussed standardizing the methodology for calculating the  number of FTEs with the IC elements but identified challenges, such as  identifying a standard labor-hour conversion factor for one FTE. IC CHCO  guidance for fiscal year 2012 instructs elements to provide the total  number of direct labor hours worked by the contract personnel to  calculate the number of FTEs for each contract, as opposed to allowing  for estimates, which could improve the consistency of the FTE information  reported across the IC. Since this methodology is different than the  methodology used by several civilian IC elements to calculate their  number of FTEs in the fiscal year 2010 and 2011 inventories, IC CHCO  will be further limited in the extent to which it can compare FTE data  across years.", "In addition, we found that most of the civilian IC elements did not maintain  readily available documentation of the information used to calculate the  number of FTEs reported for a significant number of the records we  reviewed. As a result, these elements could not easily replicate the  process for calculating or validate the reliability of the information reported  for these records. Federal internal control standards call for appropriate  documentation to help ensure the reliability of the information reported.  For 37 percent of the 287 records we reviewed, we could not determine  the reliability of the information reported. Two of the civilian IC elements  were able to provide documentation to support the number of FTEs  reported for almost all of the records we reviewed, but the other civilian IC  elements experienced challenges in providing documentation to varying  degrees. For example, officials from one civilian IC element explained  that they did not document how they calculated the number of core  contract personnel FTEs at the time of reporting. As a result, these  officials stated that it would be very time-consuming to replicate the  process for making these calculations, and that, for contracts with higher  numbers of contract personnel, it could take months to recreate the  methodology used. In addition, another civilian IC element had challenges  providing documentation for certain records, in part because some  contracts included in the inventory are fixed-price contracts for which it  does not negotiate or have insight into the number of FTEs. While IC  CHCO does not require the IC elements to maintain documentation of  their calculations, without complete documentation, elements cannot  ensure the reliability of the information reported in their submissions or  may not be able to replicate the methodology used to report the number  of FTEs for their contracts.

Officials at several civilian IC elements stated that they  experienced turnover in the staff who prepared their submissions over the  years. As a result, these officials were unable to explain the methodology  used by staff to report the information for certain submissions in prior  years. IC CHCO officials stated that they frequently have to work with  new staff at the elements to help them understand the reporting  requirements because the elements did not have documentation of how  prior staff reported certain information.

Our prior work and  OMB policies have underscored the importance of agencies having  guidance, strategies, and reliable data to inform decisions related to the  appropriate use of contractor personnel. Building on longstanding OMB  policy, OFPP\u2019s September 2011 guidance requires agencies to develop  internal procedures to identify and oversee contractors providing services  that closely support inherently governmental functions. Yet, of the  agencies we reviewed, ODNI, CIA, DOJ, DOE, and Treasury have not  fully developed such procedures or established required time frames for  doing so. Without these procedures in place, ODNI, CIA, and the civilian  IC elements within these three departments risk not taking appropriate  steps to manage and oversee contract personnel, particularly those  performing work that could influence government decision making. In an  effort to help manage the use of contractor personnel within the IC,  elements are required by ICD 612 to conduct strategic workforce planning  related to their use of core contract personnel. However, ICD 612 falls  short of OMB\u2019s July 2009 memorandum on managing the multisector  workforce by not requiring the elements to document their assessment of  the appropriate use of contractors or the appropriate mix of government  and contractor personnel on a function-by-function basis. One tool  identified by OFPP that can help agencies plan for the use of contract  personnel and mitigate associated risks is a service contract inventory,  which for the IC is the annual core contract personnel inventory.

As a result, the civilian IC  elements cannot use the inventory to identify those services that require  increased management attention under OFPP\u2019s September 2011  guidance.

As we  note in our report, however, not all core contract personnel perform  functions that closely support inherently governmental functions and  therefore do not need enhanced management oversight required by  OFPP. Further, the definition of core contract personnel does not identify  those functions that are critical to an agency\u2019s mission.

The  eight civilian IC elements covered by our review are the Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of  Intelligence and Counterintelligence (DOE IN), Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (DHS I&A), Department of  State\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (State INR), Department of  the Treasury\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis (Treasury OIA), Drug  Enforcement Administration\u2019s Office of National Security Intelligence  (DEA NN), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Office of the  Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).", "To address our first and second objectives, we examined the civilian IC  elements\u2019 submissions to the fiscal years 2007 to 2011 core contract  personnel inventories, when available. The submissions contain  information on the elements\u2019 core contracts from over 10 data fields,  which vary by fiscal year. For the purposes of answering the first and  second objectives, we focused on five data fields related to the elements\u2019  extent of reliance on core contract personnel, the functions performed by  these contract personnel, and the factors that contributed to their use:  fiscal year obligations, total full-time equivalents (FTE), primary contractor  occupation and competency expertise, budget category, and reason  code. We were not able to assess the reliability of the information  reported for these data fields in the elements\u2019 submissions to the fiscal  years 2007 to 2009 inventories for various reasons, such as elements not  having records of their submissions for certain years. In addition, the  information reported for the fiscal year obligations, total FTEs, budget  category, and reason code data fields in the elements\u2019 submissions to the  fiscal years 2010 to 2011 inventories was not sufficiently reliable for our  intended purposes of determining the civilian IC elements\u2019 extent of  reliance on core contract personnel, the functions performed by these  personnel, or the factors that contribute to their use. We present this  information with the associated limitations in the report where appropriate.  Although we identified some limitations, the primary contractor occupation  and competency expertise data field was sufficiently reliable for  identifying the general types of functions performed. However, because  neither the fiscal year obligations nor total FTEs data field was sufficiently  reliable, we could not determine the extent to which the civilian IC  elements use contract personnel to perform certain functions based on  the primary contractor occupation and competency expertise data field.  Appendix II contains a more detailed discussion of our sampling  methodology and data reliability assessment.", "We also reviewed the Intelligence Community Chief Human Capital  Officer\u2019s (IC CHCO) annual guidance to elements for preparing their  submissions to the fiscal years 2007 to 2012 inventories and information  reported in annual core contract personnel inventory briefings and  personnel level assessments provided to Congress.

We reviewed Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP)  Policy Letter 11-01 and compared the policy letter\u2019s requirements  addressing contracting for closely supporting inherently governmental  functions to civilian IC elements\u2019 or their respective departments\u2019  acquisition policies and guidance to determine the extent to which the  requirements were met. We reviewed OMB\u2019s July 2009 Memorandum on  Managing the Multisector Workforce and GAO\u2019s prior work on strategic  human capital best practices and compared the leading practices  identified to the strategic workforce planning requirement in Intelligence  Community Directive (ICD) 612 and civilian IC elements\u2019 strategic human  capital or other workforce plans to determine the extent to which the  leading practices were implemented. We reviewed the leading practices  identified in OMB\u2019s November 2010 and December 2011 memoranda on  service contract inventories and the civilian IC elements\u2019 data on  functions performed by contractors. We reviewed IC CHCO guidance on  core contract personnel to determine the extent to which it addressed  services that closely support inherently governmental functions and  critical functions. We also interviewed human capital, procurement, or  program officials at each civilian IC element to discuss ongoing efforts  related to strategic planning and developing policies to mitigate risks from  each IC element or their respective departments.", "ODNI, in consultation with the other civilian IC elements, deemed some of  the information in the September 2013 report as classified, which must be  protected from public disclosure.

The IC CHCO core contract personnel inventory guidance  instructs the elements to complete the budget category data field by  reporting where the funding for the contract is assigned according to the  Congressional Budget Justification Books. Civilian IC element officials  acknowledged that the budget category is not the best representation of  the functions being performed by contractors.
