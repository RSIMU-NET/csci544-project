Regional councils were created by statute to help manage fisheries in federal waters, including allocating\u2014or distributing\u2014fishing privileges, when warranted. Starting in 1985, the South Atlantic council established allocations, generally a percentage of allowable harvest, for 50 of its 51 mixed-use fish stocks and revised most of those at least once. The Gulf of Mexico council established allocations for nine of its 23 mixed-use fish stocks, revising three of those once. Historically, allocations have been largely based on estimates of the commercial and recreational fishing sectors' past use of the resource, according to NMFS.", "Key sources of information that may be available to help NMFS and the councils review allocations include trends in catch and landings (the amount of fish caught or brought to shore); fish stock assessments; and economic analyses. Each source presents some challenges in supporting allocation decisions, however. For example, NMFS works with states to estimate recreational catch, which provides information about demand, but faces difficulties generating reliable estimates. This is in part because of attributes of the recreational fishing sector, including the greater number of recreational anglers compared with commercial fishing participants. NMFS issued guidance in 2019 to promote consistency in estimating recreational catch data to help improve the quality of the information.", "The South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico councils developed processes for when to initiate fish stock allocation reviews, but not for how to conduct those reviews. A 2012 report for NMFS found that reviews had been done inconsistently, and stakeholders were dissatisfied with allocation decision-making. In response, NMFS developed guidance calling for structured and transparent allocation review processes. Both councils established criteria for initiating reviews, such as time-based triggers, and as of December 2019 they had several reviews underway (see figure). In April 2019, the Gulf of Mexico council began convening a workgroup to propose a draft allocation review process, but has not indicated what actions it will take, if any, in response to a proposal. The South Atlantic council postponed any discussions until March 2020. As of December 2019, neither council had a documented process. Documented processes for conducting allocation reviews would provide NMFS with better assurance that the councils carry out upcoming reviews in a structured and transparent manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations, including that NMFS work with the councils to develop documented processes for conducting allocation reviews.

The South Atlantic and Gulf of  Mexico regions are each home to multiple fisheries with a combination of  commercial and recreational fishing, known as mixed-use fisheries.  Commercial fishing in these regions landed nearly 2 billion pounds of  seafood in 2016, valued at more than $1 billion dollars. These regions  also have the greatest recreational fishing activity in federal waters,  according to NOAA, which estimates that recreational anglers in these  regions made more than 127 million fishing trips in 2016.", "The lead federal agency responsible for managing commercial and  recreational marine fisheries is NOAA\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service  (NMFS). Under the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976,  often referred to as the Magnuson-Stevens Act, as amended, NMFS and  eight regional fishery management councils (councils) created by the act  are responsible for fisheries management and conservation in federal  waters. In particular, NMFS and the councils, including the South Atlantic  and Gulf of Mexico councils, are responsible for allocating\u2014or  distributing\u2014privileges for catching fish between the commercial and  recreational fishing sectors in these two regions when such allocations  may be warranted. Allocations are generally a percentage of the  fisheries\u2019 allowable harvest. Historically, mixed-use fisheries allocations  have been predominantly based on estimates of each fishing sector\u2019s  past use of the resource, according to NOAA.", "Allocations between the commercial and recreational fishing sectors can  be complex and difficult, in part due to perceptions of fairness that arise in  making allocation decisions. Allocation decisions establish the  proportional access each sector has to a fishery, which in turn may result  in economic and social impacts for participants in the sectors. There may  be differences in the economic and social values that participants in each  fishing sector place on fishery resources, leading to divergent views on  what the allocations should be.", "Differences in the management of the commercial and recreational fishing  sectors have also led to questions about the equity of allocations. For  instance, participants from the commercial fishing sector have raised  concerns that fishery management disparities between the two sectors  could result in unfair allocations. Specifically, commercial participation in  fisheries is generally limited through federal permits, but recreational  anglers do not have similar limits, according to commercial sector  participants. They also noted that the recreational sector has at times  exceeded its allocations for certain fisheries, and that the two sectors are  not always held accountable for adhering to their allocations in the same  way. In contrast, recreational participants have expressed concerns that  recreational interests have been historically underrepresented in  allocations. These participants indicated that as coastal populations have  increased and fishing technologies such as navigational systems have  improved, recreational fishing has become more popular, generating  significant economic activity in related sales and jobs, including in the  South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. They indicated that some allocations  may be outdated and called for NMFS and the councils to review those  allocations.", "In 2016, NMFS issued a policy and guidance to the councils on  establishing and reviewing fisheries allocations, which are intended to  help the councils and NMFS review and update allocations under the  Magnuson-Stevens Act. In particular, the NMFS guidance calls for the  councils to identify criteria for triggering allocation reviews and outlines various factors the councils should consider in conducting their allocation  reviews and when making allocation decisions.

We met with many of these stakeholders in  person when we attended the June 2019 meetings of the South Atlantic  and Gulf of Mexico councils in Florida. In advance of the meetings, each  council publicized our attendance at the meeting and provided our contact  information so that interested stakeholders could contact us to set up a  meeting. We interviewed stakeholders that (1) contacted us before or  after the meetings, and (2) contacted us on a first-come, first-served basis  at the council meetings.

We analyzed the information  to summarize and describe the number of allocations established for  mixed-use fish stocks in the two council regions and the extent to which  those allocations have been revised. To verify the information provided by  the councils, we reviewed related documents, including fishery  management plans and plan amendments the councils submitted to  NMFS that established or revised allocations for specific fish stocks. To  clarify any potential discrepancies in their documents on allocations, we  also interviewed council staff or reviewed their written responses to our  questions.

NMFS carries  out this responsibility primarily through its five regional offices and six  regional fisheries science centers, which are responsible for collecting  and analyzing data to conduct stock assessments. Stock assessments  consider information about the past and current status of a managed fish  stock, including information on fish biology, abundance, and distribution  that can be used to inform management decisions. To the extent  possible, stock assessments also predict future trends of stock  abundance. NMFS provides the results of its stock assessments and  other analyses, as appropriate, to the councils for use in implementing  their respective fisheries management responsibilities. In the South  Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions, NMFS provides support to the  councils\u2019 management efforts through its Southeast Regional Office and  the Southeast Fisheries Science Center.", "Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the councils are responsible for  managing the fisheries in their region. This includes developing fishery  management plans, subject to NMFS approval, based on the best  scientific information available and through collaboration with a range of  stakeholders. The councils convene committees and advisory panels to  assist them in developing research priorities and selecting fishery  management options, in addition to conducting public meetings. The  councils are to comprise members from federal and state agencies, as  well as the commercial and recreational fishing sectors (see fig. 2).", "The councils\u2014supported by council staff such as biologists, economists,  and social scientists\u2014are responsible for preparing proposed fishery  management plans or plan amendments for NMFS review. These plans  or amendments are to identify, among other things, conservation and  management measures to be used to manage a fishery, including  determining the maximum size of a fish stock\u2019s allowable harvest. This is  generally done by developing annual catch limits for each fish stock, that  is, the amount of fish that can be harvested in the year. Fishery  management plans or amendments also include establishing or revising  any allocations between the commercial and recreational sectors for  mixed-use fish stocks where the councils determine it may be  warranted. For example, councils may allocate a percentage of a fish stock\u2019s annual catch limit between the recreational and commercial  fishing sectors. See figure 3 for an overview of the federal fisheries  management process.", "Council staff facilitate the fisheries management process by organizing  council meetings, preparing and providing analyses for those meetings,  and facilitating input from stakeholders and the public on fisheries  management issues, among other things. Stakeholders include  participants in the commercial and recreational fishing sectors and related  industries, such as fishing associations, seafood dealers and processors,  food and travel industry representatives, and conservation groups. Once  the councils complete proposed fishery management plans or plan  amendments, they are to provide them to NMFS for review. NMFS is  responsible for determining if the plans or amendments are consistent  with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable laws, and for issuing  and enforcing final regulations to implement approved plans.", "Tables 1 and 2 highlight the mixed-use fish stocks the South Atlantic and  Gulf of Mexico councils manage, respectively."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fisheries Allocations", "paragraphs": ["Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act\u2019s national standards for fishery  management plans, allocations are to be fair and equitable to all U.S.  fishermen; reasonably calculated to promote conservation; and carried  out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other  entity acquires an excessive share. NMFS guidelines for the national  standards further indicate that in making allocations, councils should  consider certain factors relevant to the fishery management plan\u2019s  objectives. These factors include economic and social consequences of  the allocations, food production, consumer interest, dependence on the  fishery by present participants and coastal communities, efficiency of  various types of gear used in the fishery, transferability of effort to and  impact on other fisheries, opportunity for new participants to enter the  fishery, and enhancement of opportunities for recreational fishing.

To collect commercial and recreational  data, NMFS works with partners such as coastal states and interstate  marine fisheries commissions. In particular, for the commercial fishing  sector, NMFS collects data on landings, which include the weight and  value of fish stocks sold to seafood dealers using a network of  cooperative agreements with states. For recreational fishing, NMFS  uses data from its Marine Recreational Information Program, which the  agency began implementing in 2008 in place of the Marine Recreational  Fisheries Statistics Survey. The Marine Recreational Information Program  collects data on private anglers\u2019 fishing effort and catch rates and uses  these to estimate total recreational fishing catch. NMFS officials said  that the program also collects information to estimate recreational  landings. The program collects these data through such methods as mail  surveys and shore-side interviews of anglers at public access fishing  sites.", "Recognizing the difficulty in making allocation decisions\u2014in part because  allocations may be perceived as unfair by some stakeholders\u2014NMFS  commissioned a nationwide study in 2012 to examine allocation issues  and gain stakeholders\u2019 perspectives from commercial and recreational  fishing sectors. The results of the study showed widespread  dissatisfaction with how past allocation decisions were made. The study  found little consensus on how to address concerns with allocations. For  example, some stakeholders said that some allocations were outdated  and that changes over time in human population, seafood demand, and  recreational fishing warranted a comprehensive examination of  allocations. Other stakeholders expressed concern that a uniform  approach to allocation policy could harm fishing sectors, while others  noted that it is important for the councils to have the flexibility to make  regionally-focused decisions. The study concluded that many  stakeholders may continue to view allocations as unbalanced or unfair  unless the outcomes align with the positions they seek. The study  recommended that NMFS take a number of steps to address allocation  issues, including increasing stakeholder engagement in allocation  decisions, periodically reviewing allocations, and creating a list of factors  to guide allocation decisions.", "In response to the 2012 study, NMFS issued a fisheries allocation review  policy in 2016 and two guidance documents to the councils, intended to  help the councils and NMFS review and update allocations. The  objective of the NMFS policy was to describe the fisheries allocation  review process, which called for using an adaptive management  approach. NMFS policy defined fisheries allocation review as the  evaluation that leads to the decision of whether or not the development  and evaluation of allocation options is warranted, but the allocation review  is not, in and of itself, an implicit trigger to consider alternative allocations.", "Through its policy, NMFS established a multi-step process for reviewing  and potentially revising fisheries allocations. Specifically, once an  allocation review trigger has been met (as described below), the councils  are to complete an allocation review. For this review, NMFS policy does  not call for in-depth analyses but calls for a clear articulation of how  objectives are or are not being met and a clear rationale and  documentation on relevant factors considered. Based on the allocation  review, the councils may decide to maintain existing allocations, or  proceed to evaluate allocation options for a fishery management plan  amendment. When proceeding with this next step, the councils are to  undertake formal analyses and follow the fishery management plan  amendment process to ultimately recommend that an existing allocation  either be retained or revised.", "To supplement its fisheries allocation review policy, NMFS also issued  two guidance documents, as follows:", "Criteria for initiating fisheries allocation reviews. NMFS  guidance recommended that the councils establish criteria for  initiating allocation reviews\u2014or allocation review triggers\u2014within 3  years, or as soon as practicable, for all fisheries that have allocations  between sectors. The guidance identified three types of potential  criteria for allocation review triggers: (1) time-based, which include  provisions for periodic allocation reviews at specific time intervals on a  regular basis; (2) public interest-based, which provide an opportunity  for the public to express interest in allocation reviews; and (3)  indicator-based, such as triggers based upon economic or other  metrics.", "Factors to consider when reviewing and making allocation  decisions. NMFS guidance outlined four categories of factors for  the councils to consider when making allocation decisions, and noted  that there may also be other appropriate factors to consider.

According to an NMFS document, some  of the different methodologies the states use to design surveys have  produced different estimates in years when two or more surveys were  conducted side by side, making it difficult to determine the best estimates  of recreational catch in the Gulf of Mexico.", "NMFS is taking steps to improve its recreational catch estimates. For  instance, in September 2019 NMFS issued procedural guidance to help  ensure that survey estimates from the Marine Recreational Information  Program are based upon the best scientific information available and to  promote nationwide consistency in collecting data and estimating  recreational catch. NMFS is also working with Gulf of Mexico states to  evaluate the critical assumptions made by each state\u2019s data collection  program and to help ensure that the states\u2019 recreational catch estimates  are comparable across years and with other states.

However, NMFS  officials noted that few stock assessments incorporate spatial models that  would allow forecasts of future spatial distributions. To help improve the  availability of such information, NMFS is conducting evaluations that will,  among other things, assess changes in the distribution of fish stocks in  the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic in response to regional climate  change impacts. NMFS officials said they anticipate completion of these  evaluations in 2020, which will help them forecast future spatial  distributions for some fish stocks going forward.", "In addition, stock assessments are one source of information that the  councils can use to assess each fishing sector\u2019s expected ecological  impacts, according to NMFS officials.

According to the guidance and NMFS officials,  economic efficiency refers to how well scarce resources are used in  production and consumption, and is achieved when all resources are  allocated to their most valuable productive use. In principle, an allocation  is most economically efficient when the net economic benefits to the  commercial and recreational fishing sectors in total are maximized. If  net economic benefits are not maximized, then modifying the allocation  may increase economic efficiency and economic benefits to the nation.  NMFS officials said the agency focuses on conducting economic  efficiency analyses to help guide allocation reviews. Economic efficiency  analyses can help NMFS and the councils analyze whether a proposed  change in an allocation would generate greater net economic benefits for  society (that is, improve economic efficiency), compared with the current  allocation, according to NMFS officials.", "We found the councils face challenges in using economic efficiency  analyses in allocation decisions. According to NMFS officials and the  agency\u2019s published research, reliable data for estimating economic values  associated with recreational fishing may not be readily available. This is  because no market prices for fish caught by private anglers are available  and thus, non-market valuation techniques must be used to estimate the  marginal value of fish to recreational anglers. For example, a 2014  NMFS study on the economic efficiency of allocations for gag, red, and  black grouper found that there are insufficient data on the recreational  harvest by grouper species to generate statistically reliable estimates of  economic value for each fish stock.", "In addition, it is difficult to estimate the economic value associated with  one fish stock because recreational anglers may be willing to catch other  species of fish if fishery managers limit anglers\u2019 access to a particular  stock, according to members of both councils\u2019 socioeconomic panels.  This transfer of effort from one fish stock to another makes it difficult to  determine which fish stock drives the economic value that anglers  associate with fishing. Further, a 2014 NMFS study on the economic  efficiency of red snapper allocations indicated that a relevant market price  that could be used as a benchmark for the recreational estimates is  unavailable. The study found that in prior work the agency attempted to  use charter fishing trip prices to address this concern, but no current data  on charter prices existed to update that analysis. As a result, the study  cautioned against comparing estimates of recreational value to that in the  commercial sector, which is a key aspect of determining an economically  efficient allocation.", "Moreover, two 2014 NMFS studies found that there are also  methodological and data challenges related to obtaining economic  information from the commercial fishing sector. For example, the studies  raised questions about the quality of some of the price data that were  used in developing estimates of economic values for the commercial  sector. In addition, the studies\u2019 estimates of the economic value of  commercial fishing did not include the potential net value derived from  other components of the commercial seafood supply chain, such as the  processing, distribution, and sale of the fish to the end consumers,  according to the NMFS studies and agency officials (see fig. 5). These  NMFS studies noted that data for estimating the values from these other  components are not readily available. Council staff and members,  socioeconomic panel members, and fishery stakeholders we interviewed  noted the importance of including the value of fish to the end consumers  when considering the economic value of commercial fishing. To estimate  the values of these other components of the commercial seafood supply  chain, NMFS would need information about the consumer demand for fish  as a function of domestic and international production, as well as  information on changes in the price of the fish as they move from the  dockside to retail markets, according to a separate NMFS study.", "NMFS officials said they are taking some steps related to improving  economic analyses that the councils could consider in allocation reviews.

The stock assessment for red grouper included the Marine  Recreational Information Program\u2019s updated estimates for recreational  landings. The updated estimates approximately doubled previous  estimates of recreational landings, according to a council newsletter.  Council staff said that applying these updated estimates to the time series  the council had used to establish the red grouper allocation could result in  a percentage shift of the allocation to the recreational fishing sector.
