This request reflected a $2 billion increase for initiatives and a $2.1 billion decrease for ongoing health care services, for a net decrease of $110 million in expected obligations. This decrease partially offset a decline in anticipated resources available to VA of $275 million, resulting in the net increase in the President\u0092s request of $165 million. Two of the three factors that accounted for most of these changes were not transparent. First, VA used a new reporting approach for initiatives that combined both funding for initiatives and for certain ongoing health care services in its initiatives estimate. Previously, VA had reported only funding it identified for initiatives during that year. This new reporting approach resulted in an increase in VA\u0092s initiatives estimate and a commensurate decrease in VA\u0092s ongoing services estimate. VA officials told GAO that this change was made to be more transparent about the total funding needed for initiatives. However, because VA did not disclose this change in its budget justification, VA has not made it transparent that its initiatives estimate is greater and its ongoing health care services estimate is lower than they would have been using VA\u0092s past approach. Second, VA included additional funding in its initiatives estimate, in part, to fund initiatives that were not identified in the fiscal year 2013 advance appropriations request. VA also did not make transparent in its budget justifications that some initiatives identified in its fiscal years 2013 and 2014 advance appropriations requests may require additional funding if the initiatives are continued. The lack of transparency regarding VA\u0092s estimates for initiatives and ongoing health care services results in unclear information for congressional deliberation.", "The issues GAO previously identified related to NRM (non-recurring maintenance), such as renovations and other improvements of VA medical facilities, and operational improvements remain. VA\u0092s fiscal year 2013 estimate for NRM\u0097$710 million\u0097does not appear to correct for the long-standing pattern where VA\u0092s NRM spending exceeds VA\u0092s NRM estimates. For example, in fiscal year 2011 VA spent about $2 billion for NRM, which was $867 million more than estimated. According to VA officials, this pattern has occurred because VA medical facilities have spent more funds on NRM projects that were originally expected to be spent on other activities\u0097such as utilities, grounds maintenance, and janitorial services\u0097which is consistent with VA\u0092s authority to allocate its appropriations. When GAO asked if the fiscal year 2013 estimate addressed the historical discrepancies between estimated and actual NRM spending, VA officials said that all information was considered in developing the estimate. However, they noted that the final estimate was a policy decision and did not say specifically whether these discrepancies were addressed. Regarding operational improvements, VA estimated savings for fiscal year 2013 using the same methodologies it used in the past, some of which GAO previously found lacked analytical support or were flawed. GAO previously recommended that VA develop a sound methodology for estimating savings from its operational improvements, which according to officials, VA is addressing for future estimates. Until these issues are addressed, VA\u0092s estimates of NRM and operational improvements may not be reliable and are of limited use for decision makers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA state in its budget justification whether the estimates for initiatives include funding for ongoing services and whether its advance appropriations request reflects funding that may be required if initiatives are continued.

VA provides a range of health  care services for eligible veterans, including primary care, inpatient and  outpatient surgery, prosthetics, mental health services, prescription drugs,  and nursing home care. In fiscal year 2011, VA served about 6.2 million  patients and spent $51.4 billion on health care services. Unlike most other  agencies, VA receives advance appropriations for health care in addition  to annual appropriations. In preparation for the appropriations process,  therefore, VA develops an annual estimate of the resources needed to  provide its health care services for 2 fiscal years. This budget estimate is  reviewed through successively higher levels within the agency and  revised until consolidated into a departmentwide annual budget estimate  that is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for  review and consideration. OMB subsequently includes both an  appropriations request for VA health care services for 1 fiscal year and an  advance appropriations request for the next fiscal year in the President\u2019s  annual budget request, which is submitted to Congress in February of  each year.", "In support of the President\u2019s request, VA prepares an annual budget  justification for Congress. The budget justification provides Congress and  stakeholders with estimates and other information that support the  policies and spending decisions represented in the President\u2019s budget  request, including information on what VA plans to achieve with the  resources requested. In particular, VA\u2019s budget justification includes  detailed information on estimates of funding needed for ongoing health  care services and health-care-related initiatives proposed by the  Secretary of VA and the President. As such, VA\u2019s budget justification is  used to provide Congress and stakeholders with important information  about agency priorities, as well as the implications of the requested  amounts for VA\u2019s provision of health care services to veterans.", "The development of VA\u2019s health care budget estimate is inherently  complex, as assumptions and imperfect information are used to project  the likely quantity and cost of the health care services VA expects to  provide.based on data from the most recent fiscal year.

The law requires that we report on  our analysis within 120 days after the President\u2019s budget requests are  submitted in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Our June 2011 report, in response to  the act, noted that in recent years VA\u2019s spending for NRM exceeded the  amounts identified in VA\u2019s budget justifications and reflected in the  President\u2019s budget request.

We interviewed VA  officials and OMB staff to discuss the key reasons for any differences  between the estimates used to support the two requests. Finally, we  reviewed the budget justification supporting the President\u2019s fiscal year  2013 request in the context of whether it provided Congress relevant  information that could have a significant impact on VA achieving its  objectives, including what VA plans to achieve with the resources  requested.

We interviewed VA officials and OMB staff to discuss the methods VA  used to develop these estimates as well as the consistent pattern in  recent years in which VA\u2019s spending for NRM has exceeded its estimates.

Typically, VA\u2019s  Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which administers VA\u2019s health  care program, starts to develop a health care budget estimate  approximately 10 months before the President submits the budget  request to Congress the following February. The budget estimate  includes the total cost of providing health care services, including direct  patient costs as well as costs associated with management,  administration, and maintenance of facilities. VA develops most of its  budget estimate for health care services using the Enrollee Health Care  Projection Model (EHCPM). VA uses other methods to develop the  remaining parts of its budget estimate, that is, the costs of long-term care  and other health care programs.", "VA\u2019s annual budget estimate for a fiscal year includes estimates of  anticipated funding from several sources. These sources include new  appropriations, which refer to the appropriations to be provided during the  current annual appropriations process for the upcoming fiscal year, and  with respect to advance appropriations, the next fiscal year. For example,  VA estimated it needed $52.7 billion in new appropriations for fiscal year  2013 and $54.5 billion for fiscal year 2014. In addition to new  appropriations, sources of funding include resources expected to be  available from unobligated balances and collections and reimbursements  that VA anticipates it will receive in the fiscal year.include third-party payments from veterans\u2019 private health care insurance  for the treatment of nonservice-connected conditions and veterans\u2019  copayments for outpatient medications.

This increase came about as a result of changes in the  estimates supporting the two requests. Specifically, the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2013 request reflected an estimate of funding needed for initiatives  that increased by $2 billion and an estimate for ongoing health care  services that decreased by $2.1 billion, for a net decrease of $110 million.  In addition, VA\u2019s estimate of anticipated resources from collections and  reimbursements decreased by $275 million. This decline in anticipated  resources was partially offset by the $110 million decrease in expected  obligations, which resulted in the net increase in the President\u2019s request  of $165 million.

The  three factors that accounted for the $2 billion increase in the initiatives  estimate and the $2.1 billion decrease in the ongoing health care services  estimate were: (1) a new approach in reporting the estimate for initiatives,  (2) updated assumptions and data to estimate ongoing health care  services, and (3) additional funding needed for initiatives. The first  factor\u2014VA\u2019s new reporting approach\u2014accounted for $1.2 billion of the  increase in VA\u2019s initiatives estimate and a corresponding decrease in  VA\u2019s ongoing health care services estimate. The second factor accounted  for a $900 million decrease in VA\u2019s ongoing health care services  estimate. This decrease was largely offset by the third key factor\u2014an  almost $800 million increase in additional funding for initiatives. (See  table 2.)", "A new approach in reporting the estimate for initiatives. VA used a new  reporting approach for initiatives that combined both funding for initiatives  and funding for certain ongoing health care services in its initiatives  estimate, which increased VA\u2019s initiatives estimate and decreased VA\u2019s  ongoing services estimate. In prior budget justifications, VA\u2019s estimated  funding for initiatives only included funding identified for initiatives during  that year while funding needs for all ongoing services were included in  VA\u2019s estimate for ongoing health care services. However, VA, in its  budget justification, did not disclose that it had used a new reporting  approach for initiatives. OMB staff and VA officials told us that the reason  for this change in reporting was to be more transparent about the total  amount of funding needed to support VA\u2019s initiatives. Nevertheless, by  not stating in its budget justification that it made this change, VA has not  made it transparent that the estimate for initiatives is greater and the  estimate for ongoing services is less than they would have been using  VA\u2019s past reporting approach.", "Updated data and assumptions to estimate ongoing health care services.  As reported in its budget justification, VA used updated assumptions and  data, which reduced VA\u2019s estimate for ongoing health care services.  Specifically, the amount of funding needed to support health care  services estimated by the EHCPM decreased because VA updated some  of the assumptions used in the EHCPM. For example, VA updated the  EHCPM\u2019s assumption accounting for the pay freeze for civilian  employees in fiscal years 2011 and 2012, which reduced the base salary  of VA employees in future years. VA also used updated data to adjust the  estimates produced by the EHCPM and the estimates for long-term care  and other health care programs. Updated data for long-term care and  other health care programs generally indicated that costs for these  services would grow at a slower rate than the data used to support the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2013 advance appropriations request indicated.", "Additional funding for initiatives. According to VA\u2019s budget justification, as  a result of the reduced estimate for ongoing health care services, VA  increased the estimate of funding needed for its initiatives. This estimate  of funding included funding for all initiatives for which funding was not  requested in the fiscal year 2013 advance appropriations request and  increased funding for some initiatives for which funding had been  identified in the earlier request. However, in its fiscal year 2013 budget  justification, VA did not make it clear that part of the additional increase in  its initiatives estimate occurred because VA\u2019s earlier estimate in support  of the advance appropriations request did not include funding for all the  initiatives the agency intended to continue. According to OMB staff, the  purpose of the advance appropriations request is to provide assurance for  the continuation of ongoing health care services and select initiatives that  represent direct care to veterans. As a result, rather than including  estimates of funding needed to support all initiatives in advance  appropriations requests\u2014including the fiscal year 2013 advance  appropriations request and the fiscal year 2014 advance appropriations  request\u2014the funding needs for all initiatives are taken into account during  the following budget formulation cycle. At that time, once updated data  are available to produce revised estimates for ongoing health care  services, VA and OMB assess the amount of likely resources available to  fund initiatives in the context of overall budget constraints. However, VA  did not state that some initiatives for which estimates were included in the  fiscal years 2013 and 2014 advance appropriations requests would  require additional funding if the initiatives were to be continued.

In June 2011, we reported  VA\u2019s spending on NRM exceeded the estimates reported in VA\u2019s budget  justifications from fiscal years 2006 to 2010. More recently, we found  that in fiscal year 2011 VA spent about $2 billion for NRM, which was  $867 million more than estimated (see fig. 1). According to VA officials,  NRM spending has exceeded estimates of needed funding in recent  years because VA medical facilities have spent more funds on NRM  projects that were originally expected to be spent on other activities\u2014 such as utilities, grounds maintenance, and janitorial services. This  spending is consistent with VA\u2019s authority to increase or decrease the  amounts VA allocates from the Medical Facilities account for NRM and  with congressional committee report language. When we asked VA  officials if the fiscal year 2013 estimate addressed the historical  discrepancies between amounts estimated and actual spending, VA  officials said that all information was considered in developing the  estimate. However, VA officials noted that the amount requested was a  policy decision and did not specifically say whether these discrepancies  were addressed. This explanation suggests that VA has not changed the  way in which it determines the final NRM estimate; as we previously  reported VA lowered its fiscal year 2012 estimate due to a policy decision  to fund other initiatives. Because the fiscal year 2013 estimate of $710  million is significantly lower than past spending and lower than the  estimate provided last year, it does not appear that medical facilities\u2019  spending was addressed. Furthermore, VA estimates that the NRM  backlog for health care facilities\u2014which reflects the total amount needed  to address facility deficiencies\u2014will remain over $9 billion in fiscal year  2013. As such, the NRM information provided in VA\u2019s budget justification  may not be a reliable estimate of future spending for NRM.", "Regarding operational improvements, VA estimated savings for fiscal  year 2013 using the same methodologies it used in the past, some of  which we recently reported lacked analytical support or were flawed.

VA officials told us during the course  of our current review that the agency is taking steps to address  deficiencies in the methodology used for estimating savings for some of  its operational improvements.

However, we do not address VA\u2019s approach to budgeting in this report  and our recommendation is that VA state in future budget justifications  whether the estimates for initiatives in support of the advance  appropriations request reflect all the funding that may be required if all  initiatives are continued.

We do not believe that a table footnote in  a document, which consists of nearly 400 pages, provides adequate  transparency in explaining a change of more than $1 billion that resulted  from a new reporting approach. Moreover, because the footnote does not  explain that this approach is new or that the estimate for ongoing services  was also affected, we continue to believe that the transparency of VA\u2019s  reporting could be improved. We support VA\u2019s plans to include an  expanded narrative regarding its approach to reporting estimates for  initiatives in future budget justifications and believe this will enhance  transparency.", "VA also indicated that it disagreed with what VA characterized as our  assertion that Congress cannot use VA\u2019s estimates of costs for ongoing  health care services or initiatives due to a lack of transparency. As  evidence, VA pointed to the detailed information presented in the budget  justification and described how the estimates are determined, including a  description of the actuarial model it uses. However, we did not state that  Congress cannot use VA\u2019s estimates for the cost of ongoing health care  services and initiatives. Instead, what we identified was that the lack of  transparency regarding the factors that changed VA\u2019s estimate for  ongoing health care services and initiatives resulted in unclear  information for congressional deliberation. VA\u2019s concurrence with two of  our recommendations and its implementation of them would address the  concerns we raised and improve the transparency of the information that  VA provides to Congress in its annual budget justifications.", "VA also expressed concern that our conclusions cast doubt on its strong  commitment to stewardship of resources. VA noted that the agency and  its resources need to be flexible and responsive to changes in veterans\u2019  medical care needs, which may occur after its budget estimates are  formulated. VA has the authority to respond to such changes. We have  pointed out, for example, that VA\u2019s NRM spending is consistent with its  authority to increase and decrease the amounts VA allocates from the  Medical Facilities account for NRM. However, in regard to NRM, the long- standing pattern in which NRM spending has significantly exceeded VA\u2019s  estimates needs to be better accounted for in VA\u2019s budget estimates.  Doing so will not decrease VA\u2019s flexibility to be responsive to veterans\u2019  needs. Moreover, we believe that VA\u2019s plans to address our  recommendation will provide Congress with more reliable estimates with  which to make decisions about VA appropriations.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  and the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and  appropriate congressional committees.
