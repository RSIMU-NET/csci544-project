Funds from these sources are collected from users and credited to the Highway Trust Fund for highway and mass transit projects or related activities. The fund is divided into a highway account and a mass transit account.

Designation of a road as part of a federal-aid system does not mean the road is owned, operated, or maintained by the federal government. The designation is simply the first step in establishing the eligibility of selected state and local roads for federal assistance. Previously, federal aid was apportioned to Interstate, primary, secondary, and urban highways.", "ISTEA, however, discarded this approach by creating only two systems: the National Highway System (NHS) and the Interstate System, which is a component of the NHS. The NHS is the centerpiece of ISTEA, and the system is expected to be the major focus for the federal-aid highway program into the 21st century. In a speech on December 9, 1993, the Administrator of FHWA noted that since the Interstate was begun in 1956, the nation\u2019s population has grown and shifted, the economy has changed, and needs are different. To serve these needs\u2014to extend the benefits of the Interstate system to areas not served directly by it\u2014the NHS was conceived as a way of focusing federal resources on the nation\u2019s most important highways. DOT, working cooperatively with state and local officials as well as the private sector, proposed to the Congress in December 1993 an NHS network of about 159,000 miles. This network is about 17 percent of the approximately 950,000-mile federal-aid network and includes only 4 percent of the approximately 4 million miles of public roads. However, this system would handle about 40 percent of all vehicle miles traveled and accommodate over 70 percent of all commercial truck traffic.", "For other roads eligible for federal assistance, a program with the characteristics of a block grant, the Surface Transportation Program (STP), provides financial assistance. In addition, ISTEA continued authorizations for a separate Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program and Interstate Maintenance Program and an array of other separate highway program initiatives as well as funding categories addressing various equity issues, such as each state\u2019s share of funding as compared with what it received in past years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ISTEA Expanded the Goals of Surface Transportation", "paragraphs": ["ISTEA broadened the overall goals of surface transportation. Previously, the federal-aid highway program had focused on completing and preserving the Interstate Highway system and on maintaining other federal-aid highways as well as bridges eligible for federal funds. While these goals remain a part of the overall surface transportation program, ISTEA broadened the goals and included new programs, planning processes, and management systems that are intended to help ensure that the states\u2019 transportation plans are intermodal (that is, coordinate various modes of transportation), environmentally sound, and energy efficient. For example, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) directs funds to transportation projects in clean air nonattainment areas\u2014areas that have not achieved federal standards for air quality. ISTEA also provides for increased emphasis on mobility for the elderly, disabled, and economically disadvantaged.", "ISTEA expanded the use of equity adjustments for the apportionment of federal-aid funds among the states. For example, it modified minimum allocation funding. It also created \u201chold harmless\u201d funding, which establishes the state\u2019s share of overall federal highway apportionments. These adjustments, which are more fully explained in chapter 2, are generally used to increase the states\u2019 return on their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.", "ISTEA also embodied quality-of-life objectives, stating that the nation\u2019s transportation system should be economically efficient and environmentally sound, provide the foundation for the nation to compete in the global economy, and move people and goods in an energy-efficient manner.

We interviewed officials from FHWA\u2019s Legislation and Strategic Planning Division, Office of Highway Information Management, and Bridge Division. We also solicited the states\u2019 views on the current formula and on future apportionment issues in meetings with state transportation officials from 34 states and the District of Columbia at regional or national transportation meetings in Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit. We also held meetings with state transportation officials in our Washington, D.C., offices. In addition, we met with representatives from various transportation organizations, including the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the Surface Transportation Policy Project.", "While we focused our review on existing, overarching highway objectives, new components could be added to recognize the states\u2019 capacity to fund highway needs from state resources, the states\u2019 level of effort in meeting their own needs, and geographic differences in the cost of maintaining existing highway networks. Although similar factors have been applied in other programs, they have not been applied to highway programs in the past. But FHWA did provide a report to the Congress in 1994 that addresses measures for assessing how much of their available resources the states or local areas devote to surface transportation.", "Finally, working with FHWA\u2019s Office of Policy Development, we analyzed the effect of a series of hypothetical changes to the current formula. This analysis was based on comparing the actual fiscal year 1995 funding that the states received with what they would have received under the various alternatives. In this analysis, the states\u2019 contributions to the Highway Trust Fund were based on estimates for fiscal year 1993\u2014the most recent year for which data were available at the time of our analysis.", "We performed this review in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

While each state\u2019s share of funds is calculated annually for each of these separate programs, these separate calculations are essentially meaningless since the total funding for the four programs is fixed over the 6-year authorization period for ISTEA. Consequently, the total funding for the four programs does not respond to changing conditions in a state, such as increased highway use. Furthermore, the factors underlying the distribution of highway funds to the states, such as land area and postal mileage, are generally outdated and often do not reflect the extent or use of the nation\u2019s highway system. Our March 1986 report and a study commissioned by FHWA from a contractor noted that alternative factors, such as lane miles, are more closely aligned with highway needs.", "The Congress has used funding adjustments to improve equity among the states. These equity adjustments, which occur towards the end of the 13-step apportionment process, increase the total amount of funds for eligible states. In fiscal year 1995, the equity funding categories increased the amount of federal highway funds apportioned to 41 states and the District of Columbia. The amount of funding that the majority of states received through the highway formula process was therefore ultimately increased by these equity adjustments.", "The Congress can further adjust the federal highway funds a state receives by authorizing specific projects, commonly referred to as demonstration projects. Funding for these demonstration projects is not distributed by formula. Rather, the Congress requires that particular projects receive a specified amount of funding. In ISTEA, for instance, the Congress provided $6.2 billion in funds for over 500 demonstration projects over the 6-year authorization period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Distribution of Federal-Aid Funds Among the States Is a Complex Process", "paragraphs": ["The formula for apportioning federal-aid highway funds established in ISTEA is a complex arithmetic tool used by FHWA to determine each state\u2019s share of the funds. On the basis of the formula, funding is provided for eight programs, including the NHS and STP, and for five separate mechanisms to raise individual states\u2019 funding levels to achieve certain goals for equity among the states. The calculations that determine the level of funding that each state receives for these various categories occur in a strict sequence, as illustrated in figure 2.1. During the first step of the calculation, for example, funding is provided to complete the construction of the Interstate Highway System. Funding for the other program categories is also based on separate calculations. However, as depicted in figure 2.1 and discussed later in this report, the funding for four programs\u2014Interstate Maintenance, Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, the NHS, and the STP\u2014is interdependent since a state\u2019s total share of funding for all four programs is fixed.", "Later steps in the formula\u2019s calculation provide additional funding to certain states; these funding categories are legislatively designated as equity adjustments. Equity adjustments generally address the concerns of states that contribute a greater share of highway user taxes than they receive in federal-aid highway funds. Equity adjustments also provide each state with the same relative share of overall funding that it received in the past. In fiscal year 1995, these equity adjustments represented 16 percent of the total funds apportioned. Figure 2.1 outlines the sequence of the equity adjustments and program funding categories (app. I provides additional details). However, DOT has proposed changes to the existing equity adjustments and program categories. The changes, proposed in DOT\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget justification, were preceded by the statement that if less federal money will be invested in transportation, state and local governments need to have greater authority and flexibility to decide which projects are most important. DOT has stated that it will provide an authorization proposal for such changes at an appropriate time.", "While apportionments for highway programs are based on individual calculations, for some programs the dollar amount apportioned by formula has little practical meaning because the states have substantial flexibility to transfer funds from one program category to another. For example, with the Secretary of Transportation\u2019s approval, up to 100 percent of a state\u2019s apportionment for the Interstate Maintenance and NHS programs can be transferred to the state\u2019s surface transportation program. In addition, ISTEA\u2019s flexible funding provisions have allowed decisionmakers at the state and regional level to decide for themselves whether to allocate transportation funds to highway or transit projects. ISTEA provided for a potential $70 billion in such flexible funding for transit or highway projects over 6 years. According to DOT\u2019s preliminary data through the end of fiscal year 1995, $2,160.6 million in highway funds had been transferred to transit projects and $2.2 million in transit funds had gone to highway projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Total Funding Share for Major Programs Is Fixed", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1995, 70 percent of the funding under the formula went to the four largest programs\u2014the Interstate Maintenance Program, Bridge Program, NHS, and STP. Separate calculations determine each state\u2019s share of funds for the Interstate Maintenance Program, Bridge Program, and NHS. Nonetheless, these program-specific calculations are essentially meaningless because each state\u2019s ultimate share of funding for all four programs is fixed. With a few minor adjustments, these fixed shares derive from the shares of funds that the states received, on average, during fiscal years 1987-91 for the predecessor programs that ISTEA consolidated into these four new programs. As a result, the states\u2019 funding shares for the four major programs are divorced from current conditions, as the states\u2019 current and future shares of total funding for these programs must equal the adjusted historical shares.", "In practice, the states\u2019 funding shares for these programs remain fixed over time because the final program included in the four-part calculation\u2014the STP\u2014behaves as an adjuster. The states\u2019 funding levels for the other three programs\u2014the Interstate Maintenance Program, Bridge Program, and NHS\u2014are independently calculated on the basis of factors specific to each program. After those calculations are completed, however, each state\u2019s STP funding is determined by simply taking the difference between (1) the state\u2019s predetermined share of the total funding available for the four programs and (2) the amount the state is actually scheduled to receive for the three independently calculated programs. This means that any annual increase or decrease in a state\u2019s funding for the Interstate Maintenance Program, Bridge Program, or NHS must be offset by a corresponding, reciprocal change in the STP funds the state receives for that same year.", "Figure 2.2 illustrates this zero-sum game through a hypothetical example involving 2 years and two states. In the example, both State A and State B experience shifts in their apportioned funding between fiscal years 1993 and 1994. State A loses funds for the Interstate Maintenance and Bridge programs, while State B gains funds in both of these categories. However, for both states these shifts are rendered irrelevant because they are offset by a corresponding change in the states\u2019 STP funding levels. As a result, State A has 1.9 percent of the total funding available for the four programs in both fiscal years, despite its losses in funding for the Interstate Maintenance and Bridge programs.

Specifically, the report detailed the following problems with the factors:", "A state\u2019s land area was originally included as a factor in the distribution formula in 1916. Land area was thought to provide a balance for the factor based on population and to reflect a state\u2019s future highway needs. However, this approach resulted in large but sparsely populated states receiving larger apportionments than they otherwise would have. In addition, land area no longer bears a close relationship to future highway needs, namely the need for new construction, since the highway system is no longer growing rapidly throughout the country.", "Postal mileage was included as a formula factor in 1916 to provide a constitutional justification for federal involvement in highways (the power to establish post offices and post roads). By 1919, changes to the highway legislation had ended the need for this justification. In addition, since postal mileage is computed on the basis of the distance traveled both on and off the federal-aid highway system, it is unrelated to either the extent of the federal-aid highway network or its use.", "Population figures for formula use were derived every 10 years from the census. As a result, changes in the states\u2019 populations were accounted for only at 10-year intervals. This problem has been exacerbated under ISTEA, since the population data underlying the states\u2019 historical shares for ISTEA\u2019s major funding calculations are, in part, based on 1980 population data, not the more current 1990 data.", "In our March 1986 report, we also identified those factors previously suggested to the Congress as consistent with basic federal highway programs and for which data were available. Our results supported lane miles as a direct measure of the size of the road network and thus as a reflection of the extent of the system to be preserved. In addition, we found that vehicle miles traveled and motor fuel consumption reflected the extent of highway use. We recognized that each of these factors has its own advantages and disadvantages in establishing a formula. (The advantages and disadvantages of certain formula factors are addressed in ch. 3.)", "Finally, we recognized that changing the factors used in certain highway apportionment formulas would result in some states\u2019 receiving more or less funds than they did under the then-current formulas.

Similarly, the states that contributed large amounts of revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, reflecting substantial use of motor fuels, were also shown to require more repairs of the Interstate.", "The correlation analysis was reported in terms of values between zero and one.

ISTEA established a percentage for selected apportionments and prior-year allocations that each state must receive annually. For example, this legislatively prescribed funding percentage is 1.74 for Alabama, 0.41 for Delaware, 0.69 for Idaho, 3.72 for Illinois, and 4.36 for Massachusetts. These funding percentage shares can result in a state\u2019s receiving an addition to the regular apportionments, so that the state\u2019s total apportionment will equal the established percentage.", "As figure 2.1 showed, the calculations that determine the level of funding that each state receives for the various funding categories occur in a strict sequence. All of the equity adjustments come into play late in the sequential calculation. Therefore, these adjustments essentially increase the funding calculated for a state up to that point. For example, if a state is hypothetically entitled to a total apportionment of $500 million on the basis of the Hold Harmless provision, it will receive that amount regardless of whether all the calculations up to that point yielded a total of $200 million, $300 million, or $400 million.", "In fiscal year 1995, equity adjustments accounted for $2.8 billion (16 percent) of the approximately $18 billion distributed to the states.

While some demonstration projects address critical transportation problems and can be considered nationally significant, authorizing a large number of such projects could prove troublesome. As we noted in a 1991 report and testimony in 1993 and 1995 before the Subcommittee on Transportation, House Committee on Appropriations, demonstration projects often cost more than expected. In our 1991 report, we found that for 66 projects reviewed, the federal funding and state matching funds together accounted for only 37 percent of the projects\u2019 total anticipated costs. Future finances could be drained if extra federal funds are needed to cover the cost of completing the projects. Demonstration projects can also yield a low payoff for a variety of reasons, including the fact that they frequently are not aligned with the states\u2019 transportation priorities, can languish in the early stages of project development, or may never get started at all.

First, a state\u2019s total funding share for the four largest programs is fixed over the life of ISTEA. Second, the Hold Harmless equity adjustment category serves to raise the states\u2019 ultimate level of annual funding to a predetermined percentage share of the total funding available.

The first two objectives translate into formula components that are at the core of the distribution process. Addressing the states\u2019 highway needs, such as the miles of highway in need of repair and the deterioration of the highway associated with traffic loads, is a primary objective in the distribution of highway funds. The second component, calling for a return of funds to the state in which they were generated, supports a congressional objective of having the states receive a substantial return on the federal fuel and other tax receipts that they generate and contribute to the Highway Trust Fund.", "The third and fourth objectives discussed in this chapter could be met through formula components that would distribute funds set aside from the regular apportionment process. A portion of formula funding could be devoted to social goals by, for example, directing a portion of funding to selected purposes such as improving air quality and conserving energy. Finally, a share of funding could be set aside and used to protect the states\u2019 historical funding shares. The formula objectives may be used singly or in combination and may further be targeted to specific program categories\u2014such as the NHS\u2014that are deemed to merit special attention.", "While we focus in this report on the existing, overarching highway objectives, new components could be added to recognize the states\u2019 capacity to fund highway needs from state resources, the states\u2019 level of effort (LOE) in meeting their own needs, and geographic differences in the cost of maintaining existing highway networks.

In this approach, the states with the poorest highway conditions would be granted a larger share of the funds than the states with better highway and bridge conditions.", "However, a formula based on direct measures of need could prove problematic. The use of actual needs can foster a perverse incentive by potentially encouraging the states to permit their highway infrastructure to worsen in order to capture a greater share of federal highway funds.Moreover, this approach would reward the states with the poorest highway and bridge conditions while penalizing the states that have maintained these structures. In addition, the condition of highways and bridges varies considerably among the states. For instance, as of December 1993 the percentage of deficient bridges on the NHS ranged from a low of 8 percent in North Dakota to a high of 64 percent in Massachusetts.", "The disadvantages of basing a formula on actual needs can be remedied through the use of proxies of need, such as those reflecting the extent or usage of a highway system, or more highway-neutral measures such as population. Such proxies have the advantage of being relatively objective and neutral. However, there is debate among the states and other transportation experts on what factors can appropriately serve as proxies for distributing highway funds. Some insight can be gained from the Faucett study performed for FHWA in 1986 and discussed in chapter 2. This study indicated a strong correlation, particularly for repairs of the Interstate, between highway needs and lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. The following sections discuss the advantages and disadvantages of certain proxies in more detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extent of a System Is Reflected in the Number of Miles Covered", "paragraphs": ["The primary measures of the extent of the federal-aid highway network are center-line miles and lane miles. Center-line miles reflect the length of the system, whereas lane miles represent the number of lanes per section multiplied by the actual length of the section. For example, a four-lane section that is 2 miles long would equal 2 center-line miles or 8 lane miles.", "Some states believe that center-line miles, not lane miles, are a more appropriate factor for distributing highway funds. For instance, transportation officials from Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming told us that to the extent that road mileage is considered in a formula, center-line miles more accurately reflect interconnectivity on a national and regional basis. However, while center-line miles accurately depict overall connections though a linear measurement of highways, this measure does not capture any information on the various widths of highways, because a two-lane highway and an eight-lane highway are considered equal under this measure.", "The width and length of highways is reflected in lane miles, and as we noted in our 1986 report, lane miles are a good measure of the extent of the highway system (capital stock) to be preserved. In addition, using lane miles as a factor for apportioning highway funds was endorsed by a Policy Review Committee of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in fiscal year 1991. As the committee noted, lane miles are a direct measure of the extent of public roads in both rural and urban areas. The committee further noted that a measure of lane miles is probably the simplest and most efficient potential apportionment factor on which to obtain accurate information and that annual data are generally available within 6 to 9 months of the close of the calendar year.", "Regardless of whether center-line miles or lane miles are used to indicate the extent of a system, some observers criticize the use of mileage for apportioning future highway funds because such usage could reward expansion of the system. Thus, this type of apportionment factor would tend to encourage more highway construction, to the possible detriment of adequately preserving the existing network and of considering air quality. Several actions could be taken to counterbalance such tendencies. First, as part of the third component of the formula framework discussed later in this chapter, set-asides could be established to reward those states that meet certain preservation or maintenance goals. Second, greater use of performance measures geared to preserving the existing infrastructure would help FHWA ensure that the states do not neglect needed preservation and maintenance. As we noted in our July 1994 testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, performance expectations need to be established for preservation and maintenance and other important goals for the NHS. A well-maintained system is the necessary foundation for pursuing the myriad goals for the system, which include economic development, enhanced mobility, and improved air quality.

A system\u2019s usage is typically gauged using factors such as vehicle miles traveled or consumption of motor fuel.", "One advantage of using data on the vehicle miles traveled as a formula factor is that they tend to be quite reliable. The AASHTO Policy Review Committee observed that data on vehicle miles traveled have been statistically designed for a high level of measurable accuracy and are relevant as an indicator of both capital and system preservation needs. Also, in the Faucett study, vehicle miles traveled garnered one of the highest correlation values, 0.913, of all the factors related to Interstate repair needs. That is, a state with a high number of vehicle miles traveled would also likely have high needs for repair of the Interstate.", "Another proxy of system use is motor fuel consumption. Motor fuel consumption reflects travel on all roads, not just on the federal-aid system or on roads under a state\u2019s jurisdiction. Therefore, it would not be a precise measure for apportioning funds to specific groups of roads. These data are reported by states monthly and adjusted at year\u2019s end. Annual data are generally available within 6 to 9 months of the close of the calendar year. Fuel consumption patterns may differ across states because of the urban-rural population mix, the amount of travel done under congested conditions, differences in physical terrain, and fuel purchases by transients in those states with lower fuel taxes, among other things.", "While vehicle miles traveled and motor fuel consumption correlate well with system usage, they do have some drawbacks. For example, vehicle miles traveled measure the vehicles moved rather than the people and do not account for different vehicle classifications. Moreover, both factors are largely at odds with air quality objectives, and the principle of rewarding motor fuel consumption with more highway funding also conflicts with the goal of encouraging energy conservation. New Jersey transportation officials, for instance, noted that such factors reward energy consumption and air pollution and penalize those who successfully enact measures to reduce the use of single-occupant vehicles. Similarly, transportation officials from several other states noted that the Congress has previously rejected the notion of giving vehicle miles traveled greater weight in apportioning funds, in part because of the strong environmental objections raised.

In his view, population and population density would be preferable alternatives as proxies. These proxies were recommended because they were perceived as avoiding the perverse effects tied to a system\u2019s extent and usage, and because the data are sound.", "Population data, however, also have limitations. As noted by the Executive Director of AASHTO, the link between population and the states\u2019 highway needs is questionable. First, while funds would be targeted to congested urban areas, the approach would do little to accommodate the needs of rural areas. Second, the approach does not recognize that goods produced in sparsely populated areas ultimately must be transported to dense areas. And some state transportation officials from sparsely populated states believe that much of the traffic that occurs in densely populated areas is local.

For years, the highway apportionment formula has endorsed, through one or more equity adjustments, the principle that the states ought to receive back a substantial portion of what they deposit into the Trust Fund. If the formula were restructured to encompass a pure return-to-origin approach, each state\u2019s contribution to the Trust Fund would simply be returned to that state. This does not currently occur. FHWA\u2019s data indicate that in 1993, federal highway apportionments as a percentage of the states\u2019 contributions to the Highway Trust Fund\u2019s highway account ranged from 83 percent for South Carolina to 707 percent for Hawaii.", "FHWA estimates the states\u2019 contributions to the Trust Fund, which derive from various federal excise taxes such as the gasoline and diesel tax.

For instance, those states whose fuel usage is low relative to their land area and extent of highway network would be financially hurt. A prime argument made by officials from these states is that the national interest requires highways to span the wide expanses of large, sparsely populated states that are the source of goods for citizens in the population centers, but the financial resources of those states are often insufficient to construct, maintain, and operate such networks.", "Two additional arguments are made against the return-to-origin approach. First, as New York transportation officials noted, formulas based on returning contributions to the Trust Fund to the state where they are raised meet neither federal or state transportation goals nor national policy as set forth in ISTEA. If the primary goal of federal apportionment formulas is to return revenues from motor fuel taxes to the place they were earned, these officials questioned whether there was a need for a federal program. Second, state officials have questioned the wisdom of selecting a formula factor that is geared predominantly to fuel use. They argue that such an approach rewards greater use of motor fuel and as such contradicts federal goals of improving air quality and conserving energy.", "Finally, this approach would not necessarily preclude congressional direction of the use of those funds. Legislation could still specify that the returned funds be used in certain proportions for certain programs, such as the NHS.

Payments drawn from this set-aside could be used to provide bonuses to advance quality-of-life objectives, to reward improvements in the condition of highway infrastructure above a certain defined floor, and to advance highway safety. These and similar objectives are all laudable; however, constraint in selecting the objectives may be warranted to prevent the dilution of funds that could result from attempting to meet numerous objectives.", "One approach to distributing the set-aside moneys would be to direct set-aside funds to those states suffering from unique or concentrated needs in certain areas. A prime example of this approach is the existing Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program, which directs funds to states with particularly severe problems in air quality. ISTEA provided CMAQ with a $6 billion authorization\u2014 approximately $1 billion annually for 6 years. CMAQ is focused on investment in air quality improvements and provides funds for projects that expand or initiate transportation services that benefit air quality. It is directed to those states that are classified as nonattainment areas for ozone and carbon monoxide (although every state, regardless of its air quality status, is guaranteed an annual minimum apportionment of 0.5 percent of the program\u2019s total funding.) The advantage of such a program is that it focuses funding on precisely those areas with the greatest needs. The disadvantage is that, as occurs with the needs-based formula factors discussed earlier in this chapter, directing funding to states with specific needs can foster a perverse incentive. In the case of the CMAQ program, questions have been raised about the wisdom of essentially rewarding states for their nonattainment status, particularly given that a state loses CMAQ funding if it makes \u201ctoo much progress\u201d in improving air quality.", "A second approach to directing set-aside funding towards specific goals is to treat the funds as incentive payments. Incentive payments, as the name implies, do not redress shortcomings, but instead reward desired behaviors or accomplishments. For example, shared set-aside funding could be used to reward states that make notable and measurable improvements in the percentage of the state\u2019s pavement condition rated as \u201cgood\u201d under FHWA\u2019s classification system. To emphasize the condition of the nation\u2019s most heavily traveled highways, such rewards could be further refined to focus on improvements in the condition of the NHS.", "One concern with providing incentives for improvements in highway conditions, however, is that the data from the states on the condition and performance of their roadways are not always reliable, making it more difficult to equitably distribute such incentive payments. In subcommittee hearings for the House Committee on Appropriations in fiscal year 1994, FHWA was questioned on significant swings in the percentage of Interstate pavement rated in poor condition, as illustrated by table 3.4.", "FHWA explained that the data on the condition of the pavement were based on the use of an index, referred to as the Present Serviceability Index. This index, however, represents a subjective measure of the pavement\u2019s ride quality and can be arrived at by a variety of procedures. Furthermore, FHWA noted that from time to time the states have attempted to improve their estimation of this measure, thus invalidating comparisons with data from previous years. As a result, until the reliability of these data is improved, their use as an indicator for distributing federal highway funds would be suspect and arbitrary. An alternative measure, the International Roughness Index, is a more objective measure of pavement condition (roughness), and FHWA expects this data source to play a more prominent role in the future. In 1993, the most recent year for which data are available on pavement condition, 37 states used the International Roughness Index to measure pavement condition on Interstate highways, while the remaining 13 states continued to rely on the Present Serviceability Index. For other major highways, the proportion of states using the International Roughness Index dropped to about half the states. An FHWA official noted that some states do not use the International Roughness Index because they do not have the money to purchase the necessary equipment. Another impediment to using the International Roughness Index is that the equipment must be operated at a speed of 35-55 miles per hour, thus making in infeasible for use on certain major highways in urban areas because of the presence of other traffic, traffic signals, and other disruptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Component 4: Safeguards to Mitigate Against Sudden Losses", "paragraphs": ["Altering the existing formula would undoubtedly cause shifts in the states\u2019 relative shares of annual highway funding.

Some individual states such as Alaska and Hawaii could lose 50 percent or more of their highway funds under any of the scenarios derived from the approaches based on needs and return to origin.
