It is to provide \u201cprompt, reliable, and efficient services\u201d to patrons in all areas and render these services to all communities. Over the years, the Service has increasingly functioned as a businesslike entity competing with electronic communication and private businesses to provide communication and merchandise delivery services to residential and business customers.", "Today, the Postal Service\u2019s customer base is diverse, and the quality of mail service has many dimensions, such as whether the time to deliver mail meets standards, access to service is convenient, and service is timely and courteous at post offices. Until recent years, the Postal Service\u2019s measurement of service quality was internally focused. For example, it measured the time to process mail from points within the postal system; it did not measure the time from deposit of mail into the system to delivery of mail to customers.", "The Service\u2019s customer orientation continues to change. Increasingly, it is focusing on customer needs, expectations, and perceptions. Its two principal measures of service quality are the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) and Business Customer Satisfaction Index (BCSI), which measure how residential and business customers, respectively, perceive the Postal Service\u2019s performance; and the External First-Class Measurement System (EXFC), a quantitative measure of total delivery performance. Both measurements are done independently of the Postal Service: residential CSI by Opinion Research Corporation; business CSI by Gallup Organization, Inc.; and EXFC by Price Waterhouse and Co. The Vice President/Consumer Advocate, who reports directly to the Postmaster General, oversees the CSI survey process and the EXFC end-to-end measurement system and, until December 1994, was responsible for analyzing and disseminating CSI and EXFC results.", "The quality focus of the Postal Service leadership team is consistent with current national objectives of making government more responsive to the American public. These objectives, outlined recently by the National Performance Review (NPR) task force, emphasize the need to change the way government works by putting the customer first, giving the customer a voice, and setting customer service standards. The Postal Service is following the NPR guidance by recognizing the need to continuously improve customer service to remain competitive.", "Establishing and maintaining consistently high levels of delivery and retail service are critical to the Service\u2019s success in an increasingly competitive communications marketplace. We previously reported that the Postal Service is losing profitable business to the private sector, especially in the parcel post and overnight mail markets. Private carriers dominate the profitable business-to-business segment because they offer cheaper and faster service and have left the Postal Service with the more dispersed and less profitable household market segment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Postal Service Organized for a Customer Focus", "paragraphs": ["Soon after taking office in July 1992, the Postmaster General outlined broad strategic goals that included improving service quality and empowering employees to act responsively when customer satisfaction is at stake. In 1992, the Postmaster General downsized the Postal Service but also reorganized it to focus greater attention on serving customers. The positions of vice president for customer services and vice president for processing, both reporting to the chief operating officer, were established at postal headquarters as part of the reorganization. The Postmaster General created 10 area customer service offices, which oversee 85 customer service districts, and 10 area processing offices, which oversee hundreds of mail processing plants in the field.", "In 1994, to better coordinate customer service and mail processing functions, the Postmaster General eliminated the two above-mentioned vice president positions at headquarters. He also combined the two manager positions in each area into a single vice president position responsible for both customer service and mail processing. Below the area level, district and plant managers continue to report separately to the area vice president.", "Postmasters report to customer service district managers, who report to an area vice president and oversee retail service operations of about 40,000 post offices, stations, and branches nationwide.

The results show the perceptions of residential customers regarding the Service\u2019s overall performance (question 1a of the CSI survey questionnaire) and other aspects of U.S. mail services (37 other questions) for the 3 months preceding the survey. (A copy of the CSI survey questionnaire is included as app. I.) Customers receiving the questionnaire are also asked to provide written comments on (1) especially good experiences with the Postal Service and (2) anything that the Service could do to increase customer satisfaction. We previously reported that the CSI surveys were designed to provide a statistically valid survey for measuring customer satisfaction with the quality of postal services.", "The Service makes some residential CSI results publicly available each quarter showing overall customer satisfaction nationally and for the 170 metropolitan areas. The results are to be used internally to help track trends in customer satisfaction over time and by organizational component. The results also are to serve as a diagnostic tool for improving the quality of both delivery and retail services.", "In April 1993, the Postal Service awarded a 4-year $8.3 million contract to The Gallup Organization, Inc., to develop and operate for the Postal Service a Business Customer Satisfaction Index (BCSI) measurement system. Subsequent contract amendments increased the estimated total cost to about $11.9 million, and the Service had spent about $6.0 million under the contract through September 1995. The information from the system was to be used to measure the satisfaction of these customers and determine the allocation of resources needed to maximize customer satisfaction.

We were also to determine (3) the steps that the Postal Service is taking to improve customer satisfaction using CSI and other data and (4) any additional steps the Service could take to improve customer service and thereby improve customer satisfaction.", "Because the Postal Service had not made public any BCSI data at the time of our review, our work on the dissemination and use of customer satisfaction data was limited to residential CSI data. We reviewed the Gallup contract, analyzed Postal Service data on the relative importance of residential and business mail to the Service\u2019s overall mail volumes, and obtained explanations from Postal Service officials of the status of the Gallup contract and plans for dissemination of BCSI data.", "As part of our work on residential CSI data collection, dissemination, and use, we interviewed Postal Service headquarters officials, including the Chief Operating Officer and the Vice Presidents for Customer Services, Consumer Affairs, and Quality. We interviewed various other headquarters officials responsible for customer retail service to find out how residential CSI data were used and what improvement initiatives were under way. We reviewed various materials and documents, such as reports, video tapes, and briefing documents, used by postal headquarters and selected field offices to disseminate CSI data. We analyzed annual reports sent by the Postal Service to Congress during fiscal years 1991 through 1994 as part of our efforts to determine any opportunities for the Service to improve the sharing of information on customer satisfaction and its performance with Congress.", "Along with interviews with numerous headquarters and field postal officials, we reviewed CSI-related reports prepared by Opinion Research Corporation and the Postal Inspection Service to identify opportunities to improve the dissemination and potential use of CSI data. We used the results of all of these tasks to assess the planning and monitoring of initiatives undertaken to improve customer satisfaction by improving customer service.", "To determine the extent of improvement in customer satisfaction with postal services, we obtained CSI metropolitan area data on question 1a responses relating to customers\u2019 perceptions of satisfaction with the \u201coverall performance\u201d of the Postal Service and 22 other questions on window, telephone, and related retail services. We also analyzed EXFC data to determine changes in on-time delivery rates since the measurements began in 1990 and compared EXFC data with CSI data for the nation and selected metropolitan areas.", "We estimated sampling errors for the CSI results in each of 170 metropolitan areas using CSI data provided by the Service for the first quarter of fiscal year 1992 through the third quarter of fiscal year 1994. Estimates of sampling errors for each area are based on simple random sampling assumptions. Sampling errors are not reported for specific metropolitan areas because the Postal Service did not provide us with the names of specific metropolitan areas associated with the data. We also analyzed national and metropolitan area CSI results from the first quarter of fiscal year 1991 through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1994. We could not calculate sampling errors for national CSI results using the data provided.", "The Postal Service uses 95-percent confidence intervals as indicators of sampling errors for percentages. This means that the chances are about 95 out of 100 that the actual percentage falls within the confidence interval. For example, if 83 percent are reported to be satisfied with Postal Service performance and the sampling error is reported to be \u2013 points, the chances are about 95 out of 100 that the actual percentage satisfied is between 80 and 86 percent.", "To identify steps that the Service is taking to improve customer satisfaction using CSI and other data, we held numerous interviews at postal headquarters and selected postal field offices and, as appropriate, obtained supporting documentation. We visited six customer service districts\u2014three having among the highest CSI ratings for retail services in the nation (Billings, MT; Central Plains in Omaha, NB; and Springfield, MA) and three having some of the lowest CSI scores for retail services (Chicago, IL; New York, NY; and San Francisco, CA). Our purpose in selecting a mix of high-scoring and low-scoring districts was to identify innovative service improvement initiatives in some districts with different levels of customer satisfaction.", "We interviewed the six area managers for customer services with responsibility for the six districts we visited. We held discussions with the district manager and his/her key assistants, the consumer affairs manager, representatives of employee groups, retail specialists, and selected postmasters and/or station managers. We toured several post offices or stations in each district. Appendix II presents background data on the six districts.", "Our review followed generally accepted government auditing standards. Our visits to postal field offices were made between November 1993 and May 1994. For a significant period of time during our review, a portion of our work was delayed because we did not have access to CSI data needed to analyze customer satisfaction with retail services. We requested the data needed for this work in January 1993. In February 1994, the Postal Service provided the data we requested, and we were then able to complete our CSI data analysis. Our analysis of CSI data was done between April 1994 and October 1995.", "We received written comments on a draft of this report from the U.S. Postal Service.

The results were disseminated widely within the organization in several ways: \u2022 The Postmaster General highlighted CSI results in his quarterly report to the Board of Governors. \u2022 The Consumer Advocate provided more detailed briefings for the Board of Governors on the survey results each quarter, highlighting customers\u2019 ratings of the Service\u2019s overall performance and identifying the highest and lowest ranked customer service districts. The Consumer Advocate also visited postal facilities in metropolitan areas having the highest rating for the quarter to commend local management and employees. \u2022 The Service\u2019s contractor, Opinion Research Corporation, provided quarterly written reports detailing CSI results for use by postal headquarters and each subordinate management level in Washington, DC, and field locations. \u2022 The Postal Service made CSI results available electronically to executives, managers, and employees through automated information systems.", "To further promote the use of CSI results, in November 1992, the Consumer Advocate established an Independent Service Analysis Group to assist offices and individuals throughout the Service in using CSI and other customer service data, such as EXFC and customer complaint data. The group made various analyses and issued reports of CSI results periodically and on demand for postal leadership, including the Board of Governors, and postal managers at all levels. Each quarter the group identified the top 10 and bottom 10 metropolitan areas of the total 170 metropolitan areas.

Typically, Members of Congress have responded after news accounts and complaints from the public regarding the quality of mail service in particular areas of the country. The Postal Service reacted to concerns about the quality of delivery service in testimony before Congress several times in 1994.

While the publicized ratings disclose perceptions of overall performance, various data compiled by the Service show that customers are most concerned about the length of time that the Service takes to deliver mail and the consistency of mail delivery service. However, the Service recognizes that a number of factors, not necessarily related to mail delivery, influence customer perception of the Service\u2019s overall performance, as measured by CSI surveys.", "To illustrate how performance perceptions can differ from delivery measurements, in postal quarter 4, 1994, EXFC scores for 28 of 93 metropolitan areas varied by more than 5 percentage points from CSI scores for the same areas. For 16 of the 28 areas, the CSI ratings were higher than the EXFC ratings. For 8 of these same 28 metropolitan areas, the difference between the EXFC and CSI ratings was 10 or more percentage points.

Of the 170 metropolitan areas for which CSI results are reported, these 3 areas were the 3 lowest ranked in quarter 4. In all three of these metropolitan areas, the CSI ratings had dropped below the EXFC rating during 1994. The EXFC results improved in all three areas during the year, but the CSI ratings for all three were still well below their EXFC ratings at year\u2019s end. (See figs. 2.4-2.6.)", "As indicated above, for some areas, customer perception of overall performance remained relatively low after overnight First-Class delivery performance improved. Because of such differences, it is important that the results of the CSI and EXFC systems be presented in a way that makes clear that they represent two very different measures of the Service\u2019s performance.", "A Postal Service manager responsible for CSI data analysis said that the Service does not expect a \u201cmatch\u201d between CSI and EXFC results, either overall or by specific CSI question or service attribute. He said there is a tenuous relationship between internally driven commitments, e.g., overnight delivery service, and customer expectations. He said that responses to CSI question 1a are affected by many factors, such as the Service\u2019s announcements of postage rate increases and adverse publicity in the news media, and that on-time delivery explains about one-half of the question 1a results. After reviewing a draft of this report, the Vice President/Consumer Advocate agreed with the manager\u2019s comments summarized above. She said, however, that the impact of adverse publicity on CSI ratings is short-lived and does not affect the ratings in every metropolitan area across the nation.", "We believe that the above comments by the manager and Vice President are all good reasons why CSI and other performance data need to be analyzed and presented to Congress in a way that provides as complete and accurate a picture as possible of both the Service\u2019s delivery performance and customer perceptions of its performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customer Responses Could Be Broken Out to Better Disclose Levels of Satisfaction", "paragraphs": ["In presenting CSI results to Congress, the Postal Service could break out the results to show more clearly how satisfied, in terms of specific response categories, customers are with the Service\u2019s overall performance.

The Postal Service disclosed only what it termed \u201cfavorable\u201d responses when presenting CSI information in quarterly pamphlets to the public. These responses were the sum of excellent, very good, and good responses for each of 170 metropolitan areas and the nation. If the Service disclosed the percentage of customers giving the higher ratings of excellent and very good combined, as it does for its internal reports, Congress would have a more precise picture of how customers\u2019 perceptions have changed over time.", "For most of its internal purposes, including calculation of performance incentive payments for executives and employees (discussed in ch. 3), the Service uses excellent and very good ratings only. Most of its management reports use these two ratings alone or in combination with the overall favorable rating, which includes not only excellent and very good responses but also good responses. Disclosing excellent and very good responses is important because, as figure 2.7 shows, good responses alone accounted for almost one-third of all responses.", "Combining good responses with excellent and very good responses and reporting only the totals can mask shifts in customer satisfaction, and the changes can sometimes be statistically significant. This masking occurs when customers either increase their ratings from good to the higher ratings or drop ratings from excellent and very good to good. For example, for the San Francisco, CA, metropolitan area, the favorable rating increased by 4 percentage points, from 82 to 86, which the Service considers to be statistically significant, between quarter 4, 1993, and quarter 4, 1994. However, excellent and very good responses did not have a significant change, decreasing by 1 percentage point. Conversely, in 14 metropolitan areas, the percentage of excellent and very good responses together increased even though the overall favorable rating went down between these same 2 quarters.", "Service officials include good responses in the publicized CSI ratings and disclose that excellent, very good, and good responses are combined. However, the sum of excellent and very good ratings alone, or together with the good ratings, nationally and for each of the 10 postal areas and 170 metropolitan areas, would give Congress a more complete picture of the status of and changes in customer satisfaction. In addition, such presentation would be more consistent with the Postal Service\u2019s internal reporting.

In one metropolitan area, satisfaction with delivery of mail to the correct post office box was 69 percent in 1 quarter and 79 percent in another metropolitan area for the same quarter. However, both ratings were based on a small number of responses: 29 responses in 1 metropolitan area and 36 responses in the other. The small number of responses results in a large margin of sampling error. (Details on sampling errors for metropolitan areas are included in app. III.)", "Postal managers and employees are expected to use all CSI reports for tracking progress in improving customer service and analyzing processes at post offices and processing plants that affect customer satisfaction. However, high rates of sampling error for some questions can result in inappropriate inferences if users of CSI results compare one metropolitan area with another. To illustrate how this can happen, we will use the above example involving post office box services. After sampling errors are considered in this case, the rating is between 53 and 85 (69 percent,  16 percentage points) for one area and between 63 and 95 percent  16 percentage points) for the other area. Thus, an inference that the 79 rating indicates higher satisfaction than the 69 rating may be inappropriate because the difference could be due to sampling error.", "Consumer Advocate officials we contacted were aware that CSI results for some questions do not have the same degree of precision as the overall ratings that are published quarterly using question 1a responses. They said that they inform field personnel of this imprecision during all briefings and that the Corporate Information System shows whether changes in responses to each question are statistically significant. They believe that even the less precise results for some CSI questions can still be useful to managers, particularly when combined with other data and when the results are compared for several postal quarters or several years.", "We agree that the CSI results can be useful but also believe that users of written CSI reports could be provided with additional information on how sampling errors limit the precision of some CSI data.

In its December 1994 report, the Inspection Service reported that while all aspects of customer service require continuing attention, processing plants continued to be minimally involved in analyzing CSI data and planning and implementing activities to increase customer satisfaction. Customer service districts had taken the lead in using CSI data, and their actions generally included only post office and carrier services and not the operations at processing plants.

In 1993, the Service began to automate the sorting of letter mail to each home and business address to relieve carriers of this workload. The Service\u2019s automation goal has primarily been to reduce work hours and employees, not to improve delivery service by reducing mail cycle times.

For example, APWU is the largest postal union and did not participate in initiatives, such as Striving for Excellence Together (SET), Employee Involvement, and Quality of Work Life, which are described in our earlier reports. Neither APWU nor the National Association of Letter Carriers, which together represent about 85 percent of the total number of craft employees, participate in the SET program.", "As we reported earlier, a lack of labor-management cooperation has been a serious limitation on the Service\u2019s ability to make significant, sustained improvements in customer satisfaction.

The development of the plan was to begin in January 1995, and implementation was to begin within 120 days after the plan was finalized.", "We did some follow-up after completing our field work to determine the status of the plan and were told that some effort had been made to develop a plan.

In June 1995, the Vice President responsible for developing the plan advised the Postal Inspection Service that major changes had occurred in the corporate approach to improving customer satisfaction. One such change was a decision to apply the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Criteria to the Postal Service, mentioned earlier.", "According to Service officials, the Baldrige initiative was started in 1994, with the guidance of a new Vice President for Quality and outside consulting services. In this initiative, the Service had set up 10 teams, including a team of senior leaders headed by the Postmaster General and an information and analysis team headed by the Vice President for Work Force Planning and Service Management. The functions of these teams included those described in seven categories of Baldrige criteria. As a first step, an outside consulting firm worked with the 10 area offices and 10 of the 85 performance clusters to assess current conditions against the criteria and provide baseline data for future assessments. In March 1995, the 10 teams were created and began developing actions plans for applying the criteria to the particular deficiencies identified by the Baldrige assessment.", "The Service\u2019s plan to apply the Baldrige criteria, in what it refers to as CustomerPerfect!, appears to be another innovative and promising initiative that could make a difference in future levels of customer satisfaction. However, as with some of the Service\u2019s past initiatives, labor unions representing postal employees are not a part of this new initiative. According to the Vice President for Work Force Planning and Service Management, leaders of major unions discontinued their participation in meetings with postal leadership when contract negotiations began in August 1994.

These performance incentives, which we consider an innovative approach to linking employee pay more closely to organizational performance, are used to focus greater management and employee attention on customer service. The incentive payments are based on residential customers\u2019 perceptions of the Service\u2019s overall performance and other measures relating to financial performance and employee relations. However, it seems to us that the plans may be more effective if they also incorporate some of the key measures of service reliability, such as EXFC delivery performance data. Moreover, because the Service has not yet obtained and used BCSI results, the incentive plans do not incorporate levels and changes of satisfaction among the business customers, representing about 90 percent of the Service\u2019s business.", "Some craft employees, all supervisors and managers, and most executives are all rewarded, in part, on the basis of CSI results. As part of union contract negotiations in 1990, the Service and 2 unions agreed to use 2 factors, CSI results by performance cluster and Service-wide financial (budget) performance, to make annual performance incentive payments to certain craft employees (92,852 employees, or about 15 percent of the craft work force in 1994) under the SET program.", "Subsequently, in consultation with the management associations, the Service extended the performance incentive plan to all supervisors and managers, i.e., those covered by the Service\u2019s Executive and Administrative Schedule (EAS). In addition, the Service later began to base incentive payments to most executives (about 950) in the Postal Career Executive Service (PCES) on local and national CSI results, financial performance, and EOS results.", "Customers\u2019 perception of the Service\u2019s overall performance, as indicated by responses to question 1a in the residential CSI surveys and reported by performance cluster, dictate the difference in incentive payments to those craft employees, supervisors, and managers covered by the incentive plans. Payments based on financial performance are the same for all of these employees. Incentive payments to executives vary depending on question 1a results for groups of performance clusters or nationally and national financial performance. In fiscal year 1994, the Service incorporated EOS survey results into the incentive program for PCES-I employees. (App. IV provides additional details on the incentive pay plans.)", "None of the incentive plans include available EXFC data and other available delivery measures (e.g., measures of second- and third-class on-time delivery). We believe that the recognition of such delivery measures in the incentive plans is important because, as discussed previously, CSI data analysis shows that improving service reliability offers the greatest opportunity for improving customer satisfaction. Moreover, CSI and EXFC data show that a wide gap often exists between customers\u2019 perceptions of the Service\u2019s performance and its actual delivery performance. Consequently, in using only the overall CSI rating as one component in determining performance payments, the Service rewards employees on the basis of factors that are less under their control, i.e., perceptions of the Postal Service, than some other factors that are more under their control, i.e., mail collection, transportation, sorting, and delivery.", "If CSI and EXFC ratings generally were consistent with each other, the use of CSI alone would not be nearly as consequential. However, the Service\u2019s delivery performance often differs significantly from customers\u2019 perceptions of its overall performance for many metropolitan areas.", "We visited the Springfield, MA, and Chicago, IL, metropolitan areas because the former was among the highest-ranking of all clusters in CSI ratings and the latter was among the lowest. We found that management in both areas were using CSI results to emphasize the need to improve customer service and had a number of initiatives under way to improve service. Moreover, the differences in EXFC ratings for the two areas (shown in figure 3.3) were much smaller than differences in their CSI ratings (shown in figure 3.4).", "Our analysis showed that the relationship of EXFC and CSI ratings for some other metropolitan areas was similar to the above two areas. Further, many metropolitan areas having the highest CSI ratings in 1994 also had similarly high ratings at the time of the first CSI survey in 1991, before the Service began many of its current improvement initiatives. In contrast, some areas having the lowest ratings experienced significant change in CSI scores over the same period, as figures 3.5 and 3.6 show for selected high-ranking and low-ranking areas.", "Customer perception of the Service\u2019s overall performance is only one indicator of its performance and service quality. Other indicators that are available to the Postal Service include not only the results of the Service\u2019s independent measurements of First-Class, second-class, and third-class mail delivery service, but also customers\u2019 responses to some of the specific CSI questions. CSI surveys include questions that relate directly to delivery performance; customers are asked about their satisfaction with both local and nonlocal mail delivery.", "Including the Service\u2019s available delivery performance measures, broken out by performance cluster, in the calculation of incentive payments would appear to provide a more direct link between the incentive payments and both (1) mail delivery processes that are most under performance cluster employees\u2019 control and (2) the factors that are most important to customer satisfaction.", "Postal officials administering the incentive plan said that the incentive payments for some employees were developed as a result of 1990 contract negotiations with unions, before the first CSI and EXFC results were available. These officials said that the objectives at that time were to get the plan adopted and to keep it simple. The Service\u2019s Vice President for Quality, who came to the Postal Service in July 1994, said that he was concerned about the Service\u2019s heavy reliance on customer perception as a single or principal performance measure. The Vice President said the Service is reexamining its collection and use of all externally generated data. He also said that several new efforts, including the application of Baldrige criteria, are under way to focus greater attention on those processes that employees can improve.", "In September 1995, after reviewing a draft of this report, the Vice Presidents for Quality and Human Resources said that as part of CustomerPerfect!, the Service will be aligning the PCES compensation system for PCES employees.

Each customer complaint was to be logged, and a case history and caller profile were to be developed so that the complaint could be tracked until final resolution. The office\u2019s data showed that about 60 percent of complaints received at the centralized call centers through December 1994 were resolved by employees at the center. The remaining calls required assistance from district or post office employees.", "The Office of Consumer Affairs was also monitoring the use of Consumer Advisory Councils. Postmasters were to decide when they wanted to set up a council, and through December 1994, relatively few post offices had formed councils.
