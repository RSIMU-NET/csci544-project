Communities may use these funds to address unmet needs for housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. GAO was asked to evaluate the federal government's response to the 2017 hurricanes. In this initial review of CDBG-DR, GAO examined, among other things, (1) the status of the 2017 grants, (2) HUD's review of the initial steps grantees have taken and its plans for future monitoring, and (3) challenges HUD and grantees face in administering grants.", "GAO reviewed documentation from the four largest 2017 CDBG-DR grantees and HUD.

Before signing the agreements, HUD certified the grantees' financial processes and procedures. It also approved the grantees' assessments of their capacity to carry out the recovery and of unmet needs (losses not met with insurance or other forms of assistance). Before funding begins to reach disaster victims, the grantees need to take additional steps, such as finalizing plans for individual activities. As of January 2019, Texas had drawn down about $18 million (of $5 billion) for administration and planning only, and Florida had drawn down about $1 million (of $616 million) for administration, planning, and housing activities. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands had not drawn down any of the $1.5 billion and $243 million, respectively, they had been allocated.", "HUD lacks adequate guidance for staff reviewing the quality of grantees' financial processes and procedures and assessments of capacity and unmet needs, and has not completed monitoring or workforce plans. The checklists used to review grantees' financial processes and procedures and assessments ask the reviewer to determine if the grantee included certain information, such as its procurement processes, but not to evaluate the adequacy of that information. In addition, the checklists, which include a series of \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, do not include guidance that the HUD reviewer must consider. HUD also does not have a monitoring plan that identifies the risk factors for each grantee and outlines the scope of monitoring. Further, HUD has not developed a workforce plan that identifies the critical skills and competencies HUD needs and includes strategies to address any staffing gaps. Adequate review guidance, a monitoring plan, and strategic workforce planning would improve HUD's ability to oversee CDBG-DR grants.", "Without permanent statutory authority and regulations such as those that govern other disaster assistance programs, CDBG-DR appropriations require HUD to customize grant requirements for each disaster in Federal Register notices\u2014a time-consuming process that has delayed the disbursement of funds. In a July 2018 report, the HUD Office of Inspector General found that as of September 2017, HUD used 61 notices to oversee 112 active CDBG-DR grants. Officials from one of the 2017 grantees told us that it was challenging to manage the multiple CDBG-DR grants it has received over the years because of the different rules. CDBG-DR grantees have faced additional challenges such as the need to coordinate the use of CDBG-DR funds with other disaster recovery programs that are initiated at different times and administered by other agencies. HUD officials said that permanently authorizing CDBG-DR would allow HUD to issue permanent regulations for disaster recovery. Permanent statutory authority could help address the challenges grantees face in meeting customized grant requirements for each disaster, such as funding lags, varying requirements, and coordination with multiple programs. The expected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events underscores the need for a permanent program to address unmet disaster needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider permanently authorizing a disaster assistance program that meets unmet needs in a timely manner.

Because the CDBG program already has a mechanism to provide federal  funds to states and localities, the program is widely viewed as a flexible  solution to disburse federal funds to address unmet needs in emergency  situations. When disasters occur, Congress often appropriates additional  CDBG funding (CDBG-DR) through supplemental appropriations. These  appropriations often provide HUD the authority to waive or modify many  of the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the CDBG program,  thus providing states with greater flexibility and discretion to address  recovery needs.

To estimate unmet needs, HUD then multiplied the  number of units it identified as having major-low, major-high, and severe  damage by corresponding SBA average cost-of-repair amounts (see table  5).", "To estimate the needs of owner-occupied and rental units for their unmet  needs assessments, the four grantees generally used FEMA and SBA  data but used different methodologies to analyze these data. Below is  an overview of the methodology each of the 2017 CDBG-DR grantees  used to estimate housing needs for owner-occupied and rental units.", "Florida. Florida included all SBA applicants and FEMA applicants  with units that incurred minor damage as defined by HUD\u2019s two lowest  damage categories, neither of which was included in HUD\u2019s estimate.  Florida did not use HUD repair estimates; instead, it developed its  own estimates using SBA data.", "Puerto Rico. Like Florida, Puerto Rico included all SBA applicants  and FEMA applicants with minor damage. Puerto Rico also included  an estimate of units with \u201cpotential unmet needs.\u201d Puerto Rico  calculated its own cost-of-repair estimates based on SBA data.", "Texas. Texas\u2019 methodology was the same as HUD\u2019s methodology.", "Specifically, Texas included FEMA applicants with major and severe  damage and used the repair estimates HUD provided in the February  2018 Federal Register notice.", "U.S. Virgin Islands. The U.S. Virgin Islands included units that FEMA  did not inspect and units with minor damage, neither of which HUD  included in its estimate. The U.S. Virgin Islands used estimates HUD  provided in an April 2018 memorandum to determine the repair costs.", "Because three of the grantees tailored their unmet needs estimates for  their individual planning purposes, aggregating these estimates would not  be appropriate because the estimates do not provide comparable  measures of unmet housing needs. Although we did not conduct an  extensive assessment of the estimates, we performed some limited  analysis to illustrate the impact of some of the grantees\u2019 methodological  decisions. The three grantees\u2019 decisions expanded the definition of unmet  housing needs, which resulted in higher estimates compared to HUD\u2019s  methodology.", "Including FEMA applicants with minor damage. Florida, Puerto  Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands included FEMA applicants with minor  damages that fell into HUD\u2019s two lowest categories of damage.  Including these applicants increased the needs estimate for the U.S.  Virgin Islands by approximately $431 million. Our analysis showed  that including these applicants increased Puerto Rico\u2019s needs  estimate by at least $1.5 billion. Grantees said that including FEMA  applicants with the two lowest levels of damages provided a more  accurate representation of the needs for owner-occupied and rental  units. For example, Puerto Rico\u2019s action plan states that these  applicants were unlikely to receive other federal or local assistance to  repair their homes, and therefore would have needs. HUD officials  told us that grantees have the discretion to use allocated funds to  assist applicants with less severe damage as long as those  individuals have unmet needs.", "Including SBA applicants that were denied assistance. Florida  and Puerto Rico included SBA applicants whose units were not  inspected because they were denied disaster loans, although the  extent to which these units sustained damages was unknown. Florida  estimated approximately $1.8 billion and Puerto Rico approximately  $1.5 billion in housing needs for these SBA applicants. Florida and  Puerto Rico officials told us that they included these applicants  because being denied did not necessarily mean that these applicants  did not experience losses. For example, SBA applicants can be  denied loan assistance based on their inability to repay, despite  potentially having unmet needs. Similarly, HUD officials explained that  they consider applications that SBA has denied as a potential  indicator of unmet needs.", "Including FEMA applicants without verified losses. Florida  included FEMA applicants without verified losses and the U.S. Virgin  Islands included units that FEMA did not inspect. Absent verified  losses and inspections, they assumed the FEMA applicants had some  level of unmet needs. Florida\u2019s action plan states that it included  FEMA applicants without verified losses, but the plan did not include  the number of such applicants or their associated housing needs. The  U.S. Virgin Islands\u2019 action plan states that it included 3,774 such  FEMA applicants in its estimate of damaged homes, but the plan did  not include the associated repair costs. According to Florida and  Virgin Islands officials, they included these applicants to account for  what they determined was underrepresentation of impacted  populations. According to HUD officials, grantees typically conduct  their own inspections or rely on SBA inspections in an effort to capture  more comprehensive damage estimates.", "Including owner-occupied and rental units with \u201cpotential unmet  needs.\u201d Puerto Rico included an estimate of \u201cpotential unmet housing  needs\u201d to account for owners and renters that did not apply to FEMA  and FEMA applicants without verified losses. Absent applications or  verified losses, Puerto Rico assumed that nonapplicants and  applicants without verified losses had some level of unmet needs.  Puerto Rico estimated these potential unmet needs to be  approximately $5.8 billion. HUD officials told us that there were a  significant number of FEMA applicants who were denied in Puerto  Rico due to an inability to prove property ownership.", "In general, HUD officials stated that the methodologies HUD and  grantees used to develop unmet needs estimates did not need to be the  same. This is because HUD\u2019s estimate of unmet needs was used to  allocate funds to grantees and grantees\u2019 estimates were used to target  their funding. They also noted that there was more than one way to  determine unmet needs and that it was acceptable for grantees to use  different methodologies to reflect their local circumstances. Although  grantees\u2019 estimates of unmet needs do not affect the amount of CDBG- DR funds that they are allocated, the flexibility grantees have in defining  unmet needs increases the importance of HUD\u2019s review of these  estimates.

HUD staff use a checklist to  assess a grantee\u2019s financial controls, procurement processes, and  procedures for prevention of duplication of payments to detect fraud,  waste, and abuse of funds (financial certification checklist). The  questions on this checklist focus on whether certain information required  in the February 2018 Federal Register notice was included. For  example, as figure 2 shows, the financial certification checklist asks HUD  staff to determine whether a grantee has attached its procedures for  preventing duplication of benefits and verifying all sources of disaster  assistance received. However, it does not ask HUD staff to assess the  adequacy of the grantee\u2019s approach for verifying all sources of disaster  assistance. In addition, the financial certification checklist, which is  framed as a series of \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, does not include guidance  that the HUD reviewer must consider. For example, the certification  checklist asks whether the grantee has standards to maintain \u201cadequate  control\u201d over all CDBG-DR funds but does not define what it means to  maintain adequate control. HUD officials told us that HUD reviewers do  assess the quality of grantees\u2019 submissions during their reviews.

HUD\u2019s checklist for reviewing management  capacity (capacity checklist) assesses whether the grantee included  certain information required in the February 2018 Federal Register  notice. For example, the capacity checklist asks whether a grantee  provided a timeline for addressing the gaps it identified in its capacity  assessment. However, it does not require the reviewer to evaluate the  adequacy of the assessment or the timeline (see fig. 3). Similarly, the  capacity checklist asks whether the grantee planned to designate  personnel for program management, procurement, monitoring, and other  functions but does not require the reviewer to assess the adequacy of the  number of personnel. One question asks whether the personnel will be \u201cin  proportion to applicant population\u201d but does not cite the required  proportion.

HUD staff also use a checklist to assess  the grantees\u2019 action plans, including their assessments of unmet needs  (see fig. 4). The questions ask the reviewer to determine whether the  needs assessment covers housing, infrastructure, and economic  revitalization and to estimate the portion of those three areas to be funded  from other sources, as required in the February 2018 Federal Register  notice. However, the reviewer is not required to evaluate the reliability of  the grantees\u2019 assessments or estimates, and HUD does not provide  additional guidance for staff to help assess the reliability of the  information provided.", "HUD officials said they have other documentation that supplements the  checklists.

The notices instead require  CDBG-DR grantees to submit an action plan for disaster recovery  specifically that includes an unmet needs assessment.", "Another reason HUD cited for not having additional guidance is the  reviewers\u2019 years of professional experience.

Further, all four grantees\u2019 initial assessments  showed that their CDBG-DR allocations will not meet their unmet needs.  Having reliable estimates of unmet needs that will not be met with the  appropriated $35.4 billion is important because Congress could use these  estimates to determine if further appropriations are necessary.

Our review of this documentation showed variation in the extent  to which the reviewer requested information about the quality of the  information provided. In written feedback that HUD provided to the  grantee on its capacity assessment, the HUD reviewer asked for more  comprehensive analysis of staffing needs and to include a rationale for  the number of staff to be assigned to each function. Yet, other feedback  HUD provided focused on whether certain information was included  rather than on the quality of the information. For example, when reviewing  the grantee\u2019s financial processes and procedures, the reviewer pointed  out that the grantee had not shown that it had addressed prior audit  findings. In another instance, the reviewer asked the grantee to include  additional information in the section of its action plan on unmet needs, but  did not focus on the grantee\u2019s methodology.", "According to a HUD official, this documentation was not readily available  for each grantee because it is not part of the official administrative record.  Even if readily available, such documentation likely would not  substantiate HUD\u2019s conclusions that grantees\u2019 submissions and estimates  were sufficient.

HUD guidance states that the purpose of this analysis is to  provide the information needed for HUD to effectively target its resources  to grantees that pose the greatest risk to the integrity of CDBG-DR,  including identification of the program areas to be covered and the depth  of the review. In comments on the draft report, HUD stated that it had  completed its risk analysis and updated its monitoring schedule to include  all the grantees it planned to visit in fiscal year 2019.

For earlier hurricanes, it took at least a  month for HUD to issue the Federal Register notices that outlined the  CDBG-DR requirements for each disaster. For the 2017 disasters, it took  longer. As noted previously, these notices lay out the steps that grantees  must take before they can enter into grant agreements with HUD and  begin expending funds. As shown in figure 5, it took 45 days for HUD to  issue the requisite Federal Register notice after the first appropriation for  the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, 35 days after the first appropriation for  Hurricane Sandy, and 154 days (or 5 months) after the first appropriation  for the 2017 hurricanes. According to HUD officials, they delayed  issuance of the first notice for the 2017 hurricanes because they expected  a second appropriation and wanted to allocate those funds in the same  notice. After HUD issued the Federal Register notices, it generally took  the grantees months to complete all of the required steps to enter into  grant agreements. For example, it took each of the 2017 grantees over 6  months to execute grant agreements with HUD.", "Two 2017 grantees that we interviewed suggested that the CDBG-DR  process could be shortened if there were an established set of rules for  states to follow instead of waiting months for a new Federal Register  notice to be published for each allocation. One grantee told us that  CDBG-DR should be codified as a formal program with basic rules in  place so that grantees do not have to wait months for a notice to be  published before they begin planning. In a May 2018 hearing on CDBG- DR, a 2017 grantee testified that disaster recovery could be greatly  expedited if HUD had written regulations that governed CDBG-DR  allocations. The official stated that states would not have to wait for the  Federal Register notice to be published to begin designing activities and  developing action plans.", "Similarly, for our January 2010 report on the Gulf Coast hurricanes, HUD  officials told us that a permanently authorized CDBG-DR program would  allow HUD to issue permanent regulations and require less need for  Federal Register notices and the use of waivers after each disaster,  thereby allowing funds to be available for providing assistance sooner.  As part of our current review, HUD officials reiterated that a permanently  authorized CDBG-DR program would allow HUD to issue permanent  regulations. They stressed that for a permanently authorized CDBG-DR  program to be effective, Congress would need to provide HUD the  flexibility to waive traditional CDBG statutory requirements and adopt  alternative requirements to help address recovery needs.", "Varying requirements. CDBG-DR grant requirements vary from notice to  notice. In a July 2018 report, the HUD OIG found that as of September  2017, HUD used 61 notices to oversee 112 active disaster recovery  grants totaling more than $47.4 billion, and would issue additional notices  for funding provided in 2017 and 2018. The HUD OIG also noted that as  of February 2017, Louisiana had seven open grants and had to follow 45  Federal Register notices, and that Texas had 6 open grants and had to  follow 48 Federal Register notices. Officials from one of the 2017  grantees we interviewed said it was challenging to manage seven  different CDBG-DR grants, each with different rules. As an example, they  noted that 2015 grant funds cannot be used on levees, while funds from  other years can be. To help manage these different requirements, they  stated that they must tie each grant to the relevant public law in their  grant management system. To further ensure compliance with the various notices, their legal department prepares a new template for the  agreement that the states signs with subrecipients for each public law.  Officials from another 2017 grantee stated that it was difficult to build an  infrastructure for the management of current and future CDBG-DR funds,  as the rules often could be different for each allocation. They also noted  that variations across different allocations can make it more difficult for  grantees to manage and comply with differing requirements. According to  HUD officials, the requirements have varied due to differences in  appropriations language and policies across administrations and changes  made in response to input from the HUD OIG.", "In addition, the July 2018 HUD OIG report identified 59 duplicative or  similar requirements in most of the notices that could benefit from a  permanent framework. For example, the following rules or waivers were  consistently repeated: allowing states to directly administer grants and  carry out eligible activities, requiring grantees to submit an action plan,  requiring grantees to review for duplication of benefits, allowing states to  use subrecipients, and allowing flood buyouts. The HUD OIG  recommended that the Office of Block Grant Assistance work with its  Office of General Counsel to codify CDBG-DR in regulations. HUD  disagreed with this recommendation, stating that it lacked statutory  authority to create a permanent CDBG-DR program. In commenting on  the report, HUD acknowledged that the current process of changing  appropriations requirements, which results in waivers and alternative  requirements, can be challenging. It further stated that congressional  direction would be needed for a more standard, regulation-governed  program.", "Further, we and others have cited four additional challenges that could be  addressed in a statute permanently authorizing CDBG-DR or another  disaster assistance program for unmet needs.", "Lag between a disaster and appropriation of CDBG-DR funds. In a  July 2015 report on Hurricane Sandy, we found that the unpredictable  timing of the appropriation for CDBG-DR challenged grantees\u2019 recovery  planning. As shown in figure 6, the first CDBG-DR supplemental  appropriation for the Gulf Coast hurricanes was enacted 4 months after  the first Gulf Coast hurricane occurred. Less time elapsed between  Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Harvey (the first of the 2017 hurricanes)  and Congress\u2019 appropriation of funds, 3 months and 2 weeks,  respectively. In contrast, a presidential disaster declaration activates the  provision of funds from FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund. The SBA Disaster  Loan Program is also activated by a presidential disaster declaration.  Congress funds both programs through annual appropriations.", "Lag in spending funds once grant agreements have been signed.  Once grantees have entered into grant agreements with HUD, it can take  years for them to implement activities and expend all of their CDBG-DR  funds. There is no consensus on the amount of time it should take  grantees to expend their funds. Congress has established obligation and  expenditure deadlines, such as through a provision in the Disaster Relief  Appropriations Act, 2013. In that act, which applies to 47 grants, grantees  are required to spend the funds within 24 months of obligation unless the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides a waiver. Similarly,  the appropriations for the 2017 disasters also must be expended within  24 months of the date of obligation, and OMB is authorized to provide a  waiver of this requirement. In addition, legislation has been proposed  that would require funds to be expended within 6 years, with the  possibility of an extension up to 3 years upon a waiver by OMB.", "Since 2015, HUD has imposed a requirement that grantees expend their  funds within 6 years of signing a grant agreement. According to HUD  officials, they chose 6 years because their research showed that most  expenditure activity occurs within the first 6 years of the grant. However,  of the 50 grants awarded in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 that are at or  approaching the original 6-year mark, 9 grantees (18 percent) had  expended less than half of the funds. Some of these grantees have  received extensions that allow their grants to remain open until  September 2022. According to HUD, a number of factors can delay  recovery efforts, including subsequent disasters, litigation, and limited  constructions seasons due to weather. See appendix III for more  information on these grants.", "Housing programs that are not aligned with unmet needs. In past  work, we found that CDBG-DR grantees are not required to align their  housing activities with the needs of the affected communities. In a  January 2010 report on the Gulf Coast hurricanes, we found that states  used their broad discretion and additional flexibility to decide what  proportion of their CDBG-DR funds went to homeowner units and rental  units. In Louisiana and Mississippi, more homeowner units were  damaged than rental units, but the proportional damage to rental stock  was generally greater. However, 62 percent of damaged homeowner  units were assisted and 18 percent of rental units were assisted. We  recommended that Congress consider providing more specific direction  regarding the distribution of disaster-related CDBG assistance that states  are to provide for homeowners and renters. Since the Gulf Coast  hurricanes, Congress has appropriated funding for subsequent disasters;  however, as of February 2019, no appropriations had addressed this  issue.", "Coordination with multiple federal agencies. In our July 2015 report on  Hurricane Sandy, we found that different federal disaster response  programs are initiated at different times, making it challenging for state  and local officials to determine how to use federal funds in a  comprehensive manner. In response to a survey that we conducted for  that report, 12 of 13 states and cities reported that navigating the multiple  funding streams and various regulations was a challenge that affected  their ability to maximize disaster resilience opportunities. For example,  state officials we interviewed for that report noted the redundancy of  some federal requirements for receiving disaster assistance such as the  duplication of environmental reviews, which are required by both HUD  and FEMA. In our January 2010 report on the Gulf Coast hurricanes, we  noted that a Department of Homeland Security study indicated that  experts should discuss how challenges associated with the different  federal efforts that provide disaster recovery assistance\u2014such as CDBG- DR and those administered by FEMA\u2014could be addressed. The study  also suggested that experts explore new methods for delivering  assistance.", "In our June 2009 report on CDBG-DR, we also found that guidance for  the Gulf Coast disaster recovery was insufficient and that conflicting  federal decisions hindered coordination of CDBG-DR and FEMA\u2019s Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program funds. We recommended that HUD coordinate  with FEMA to ensure that new guidance clarified the potential options,  and limitations, available to states when using CDBG disaster assistance  funds alongside other disaster-related federal funding streams. HUD  issued the guidance, and the recommendation was closed in November  2011.", "Without permanent statutory authority for a disaster assistance program  that meets verified unmet needs, grantees will likely continue to  encounter the challenges associated with needing customized grant  requirements for each disaster, such as funding lags and varying  requirements. Permanent statutory authority could also improve  coordination among federal agencies that administer disaster funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grantees Have Faced Administrative Challenges, Such as Building Capacity and Avoiding Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the challenges experienced because CDBG-DR is not  permanently authorized, reports on prior disasters cited CDBG-DR  administrative challenges such as building capacity, avoiding improper  payments, and following procurement processes.", "Grantee capacity. Grantees have experienced difficulties establishing  the necessary capacity to manage large CDBG-DR grants. An Urban  Institute testimony described constraints on grantees\u2019 comprehensive  capacity building. Specifically, it noted levels of expertise and program  management as a repeated source of challenges, citing limitations on the  availability of skilled staff. In addition, a paper on large-scale disaster  recovery reported that large-scale CDBG-DR programs are significantly  larger than traditional CDBG programs, and that many grantees need to  hire private contractors to fill gaps in expertise and operational capacity.", "We also found in our June 2009 report on Gulf Coast disaster recovery  that Louisiana and Mississippi lacked sufficient capacity to administer and  manage CDBG-DR programs of such unprecedented size. As  discussed previously, the 2017 grantees plan to hire more staff to  administer CDBG-DR funds. However, officials of one grantee and HUD  officials said they are all competing for the same small pool of potential  applicants with CDBG-DR expertise. HUD officials said grantees in  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands face the additional challenge of  relocating potential candidates, and in the case of Puerto Rico finding  bilingual candidates.", "Improper payments. Our prior reports and those of the HUD OIG have  identified improper payments as an ongoing challenge for HUD and  CDBG-DR grantees. In February 2015, we found that HUD\u2019s policies and  procedures did not address all key requirements for estimating improper  payments for Hurricane Sandy CDBG-DR funds. To help ensure that  HUD produced reliable estimates of its improper payments, we  recommended that HUD revise its policies and procedures by (1)  requiring payments to federal employees to be included in populations for  testing as required by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as  amended, and (2) including steps to assess the completeness of the  population of transactions used for selecting the samples to be tested.  HUD concurred with our recommendation and has since updated its  policies and procedures to require that payments to federal employees be  included in the improper payment testing for the program. However,  because it has not yet taken steps to ensure that all grantee files are  included in the population for testing improper payments, this  recommendation remained open as of February 2019.", "The HUD OIG also has conducted numerous audits of the internal  controls of prior CDBG-DR grantees, a number of which resulted in  findings related to improper payments. For example, in an August 2017  report on the State of New Jersey, the OIG found that the state disbursed  Sandy CDBG-DR funds to homebuyers who did not meet all of the  program eligibility requirements. It also found in a December 2016  report that the City of New York disbursed more than $18.2 million in  CDBG-DR funds for state sales tax on program repairs and maintenance  services that the city was not legally required to pay under New York  state law. In a July 2016 report on the administration of SBA and  CDBG-DR disaster assistance, the Congressional Research Service  noted that the availability and timing of disaster assistance from different  sources can result in agencies providing duplicative assistance. In  addition, according to SBA data we reviewed for our July 2010 report on  the Gulf Coast hurricanes, SBA determined that 76 small businesses  approved for loans under Louisiana\u2019s Business Recovery Grant and Loan  Program, funded by CDBG-DR, received duplicate benefits under SBA\u2019s  Disaster Loan Program.", "In the appropriations acts for the 2017 disasters, Congress required  federal agencies, including HUD, to submit their plans for ensuring  internal control over disaster relief funding to Congress, among others.  HUD submitted its plan to Congress on November 2, 2018. As previously  noted, we are conducting a separate review on, among other things,  HUD\u2019s internal control plan.", "Procurement. The HUD OIG has issued nearly 20 audits on disaster  recovery grantees that contained findings related to procurement,  including reviews of grantees that received funds to recover from the Gulf  Coast hurricanes and Hurricane Sandy. In a September 2017 report, the  HUD OIG found that HUD did not provide sufficient guidance and  oversight to ensure that state disaster grantees followed proficient  procurement processes. The OIG focused on whether HUD staff had  ensured that the grantee had adopted federal procurement standards or  had a procurement process that was equivalent to those standards. It  made four recommendations to help ensure that products and services  are purchased competitively at fair and reasonable prices in future  disaster allocations.", "In a September 2016 report, the HUD OIG described the results of an  initiative by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and  Efficiency to review funds provided by the Disaster Relief Appropriations  Act, 2013. This review was conducted by the HUD OIG and the OIGs  for seven other agencies that received funds for Hurricane Sandy and  other disasters under the act. The HUD OIG pointed out a range of  contracting issues that HUD grantees faced, including that they billed  outside the scope of work, lacked competitive procedures or full and open  competition, and had unsupported labor costs. It attributed these  challenges to HUD and the grantees (1) not understanding federal  contracting regulations and cost principles and (2) lacking internal  controls over procurement processes. As a result, the HUD OIG stated  that HUD and grantees did not know whether they received the best value  and greatest overall benefit from their various disaster relief procurement  contracts, amendments, and change orders. The OIG concluded that the  Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency should work  with HUD to ensure the agency, grantees, and contractors complied with  federal contracting requirements.", "The HUD OIG also recommended in a May 2018 report that Texas  adhere more closely to federal procurement regulations in applying for  and expending CDBG-DR grants. It recommended that HUD require  the grantee to (1) ensure that its procurement and expenditure policies  and procedures are implemented and working as designed and (2)  ensure that warnings about false statements and false claims are  included in all of its contract-related forms. Texas responded that it would  continue to strengthen its current program structure.", "Monitoring. In our June 2009 report on CDBG-DR guidance for the Gulf  Coast disaster recovery, we found that in addition to HUD\u2019s four to five  on-site monitoring and technical assistance visits per year, a number of  state officials needed clarification of federal regulations, environmental  requirements, and waivers related to the use of CDBG-DR funds in  disaster recovery. Although HUD had field offices in both Louisiana and  Mississippi, the CDBG-DR grant management responsibilities were  handled by HUD headquarters staff. Grantees in both states emphasized  that an additional onsite presence from HUD would have been beneficial  to their recovery efforts. In addition, in a May 2018 report on CPD\u2019s  monitoring of grantees\u2019 compliance with requirements contained in the  Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, the HUD OIG found a lack of  monitoring of grantees\u2019 drawdown transactions. The OIG  recommended that CPD monitor these transactions to ensure that  grantees appropriately record transactions. HUD agreed to open an  investigation to review the transactions before responding to the  recommendation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CDBG has been widely viewed as a convenient, expedient, and  accessible tool for meeting needs in disaster-impacted communities that  are not met by other federal and private sources, but CDBG-DR has  proven to be slow for HUD and grantees to implement. Over a year after  Congress first appropriated CDBG-DR funds for recovery from the 2017  hurricanes, grantees have generally not drawn down these funds to aid  disaster hurricane victims because they continue to plan and design their  activities. While it is important to provide disaster assistance promptly,  HUD also needs to ensure that grantees are well positioned to administer  the funds.", "Before expending funds, HUD required grantees to submit planning  documentation, but its review of this documentation was limited.  Specifically, HUD did not have adequate guidance for staff to use when  assessing the adequacy of grantees\u2019 financial controls, procurement  processes, and grant management procedures and of their capacity and  unmet needs assessments. HUD also did not maintain documentation to  substantiate staff\u2019s conclusions that the grantees\u2019 submissions were  sufficient. By developing additional guidance for staff to use in evaluating  the quality of grantees\u2019 financial processes and procedures and capacity  and unmet needs assessments, HUD can provide better assurance that  its reviews are thorough and consistent. Further, without documenting the  basis for its conclusions when reviewing future grantees\u2019 submissions,  stakeholders and decision makers lack information on why HUD  concluded that grantees\u2019 financial processes and procedures and  capacity and unmet needs assessments were adequate. HUD also  misses an opportunity to leverage this information later to mitigate risk  and inform its monitoring of grantees.", "HUD\u2019s monitoring of the 2017 grantees will be critical given challenges  that the HUD OIG has identified with grantees\u2019 procedures and our  concerns about HUD\u2019s reviews of grantees\u2019 initial submissions. But HUD  did not have a monitoring plan that reflected the specific risk factors of  each grantee and outlined the scope of its monitoring. A comprehensive  monitoring plan would help HUD ensure that its oversight of grantees\u2019  compliance with grant requirements focused on grantees\u2019 areas of  greatest risks. Further, HUD did not yet have the staff in place to  effectively oversee CDBG-DR funds. Without strategic workforce planning  that determines if the number of staff the agency will be able to hire is  sufficient to oversee the growing number of CDBG-DR grants, identifies  the critical skills and competencies needed, and includes strategies to  address any gaps, HUD will not be able to identify the staffing resources  necessary to oversee CDBG-DR grants.", "Finally, if the federal government continues to use the CDBG program for  federal disaster assistance, grantees will likely encounter many of the  same challenges they have in the past\u2014including lags in accessing  funding, requirements that may vary for each disaster, and difficulties  coordinating with multiple federal agencies. Establishing permanent  statutory authority for a disaster assistance program that meets verified  unmet needs in a timely manner would provide a consistent framework for  administering funds for unmet needs going forward. The program could  be administered either by HUD or another agency that had authority to  issue associated regulations. Such a statute and regulations could create  consistent requirements for grantees and specify how the program would  fit into the federal government\u2019s disaster assistance framework. The  importance of establishing permanent statutory authority for such a  program is underscored by the expected increase in the frequency and  intensity of extreme weather and climate-related events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider legislation establishing permanent statutory  authority for a disaster assistance program administered by HUD or  another agency that responds to unmet needs in a timely manner and  directing the applicable agency to issue implementing regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to HUD:  The Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development  should develop additional guidance for HUD staff to use when assessing  the adequacy of the financial controls, procurement processes, and grant  management procedures that grantees develop.

HUD disagreed that it needed to  develop standards for financial processes and procedures, stating that  such standards already exist. Specifically, HUD pointed to the February  2018 Federal Register notice, which states that a grantee has proficient  financial policies and procedures if it submitted to HUD certain  information for its review. In the draft report, we acknowledged that the  notice required grantees to submit information such as certain audits,  financial reports, and their financial standards. However, we concluded  that the notice does not describe how HUD reviewers should assess the  quality of those financial standards. HUD agreed that providing additional  guidance to staff on defining the specific conditions that must exist within  these documents would improve its proficiency determination. This was  the intent of the recommendation included in the draft report. However, to  avoid confusion, we revised the recommendation and related report  language to further clarify our intent by substituting \u201cadditional guidance\u201d  for \u201cstandards.\u201d", "HUD also partially agreed with our second recommendation to develop  standards for HUD staff to use when assessing the adequacy of grantees\u2019  capacity and unmet needs assessments. Similar to our first  recommendation, HUD stated that the standards for HUD staff to use  when assessing the adequacy of these assessments are included in the  February 2018 Federal Register notice. Specifically, HUD noted that it  states that HUD will determine the grantee\u2019s implementation plan, which  contains its capacity assessment, to be adequate if it addresses the items  required in the notice. HUD also stated that the notice directed  grantees to develop a needs assessment to understand the type and  location of community needs and to target limited resources to those  areas with the greatest need.", "In the draft report, we acknowledged that the notice required grantees to  submit (1) an implementation plan that describes, among other things,  their capacity to carry out the recovery and how they will address any  capacity gaps for HUD and (2) an action plan for disaster recovery that  includes an assessment of unmet needs to help grantees understand the  type and location of community needs and to target their CDBG-DR funds  to those areas with the greatest need. However, we concluded that the  notice does not describe how HUD reviewers should assess the  adequacy of these assessments. HUD agreed that providing additional  guidance to HUD staff on defining the specific conditions that must exist  within the documents grantees submit to HUD would improve the review  of grantee capacity. HUD also agreed that there was an opportunity to  improve the consistency of HUD\u2019s review of grantees\u2019 action plans,  including their unmet needs assessments. Because providing additional  guidance to HUD staff was the intent of the recommendation in the draft  report, we revised the recommendation and related report language to  clarify our intent by substituting \u201cadditional guidance\u201d for \u201cstandards.\u201d", "HUD generally agreed with our remaining three recommendations.", "HUD agreed with our third recommendation to document the basis for  conclusions during reviews of grantees\u2019 financial controls,  procurement processes, and grant management procedures and  capacity and unmet needs assessments, stating that it will require  staff to better document their analysis.", "HUD also agreed with our fourth recommendation to develop and  implement a comprehensive monitoring plan for the 2017 grants,  stating that such a plan is necessary to effectively manage the  growing portfolio of CDBG-DR grants. It provided a monitoring  schedule for fiscal year 2019 that it characterized as a monitoring  plan, and noted that it had begun identifying monitoring strategies for  all monitoring reviews that would occur from March 2019 through May  2019. It also said it would develop the remaining strategies after the  initial monitoring reviews. However, HUD still needs to develop a plan  that identifies the specific risk factors of each grantee and outlines the  scope of its monitoring.", "Similarly, HUD agreed with our fifth recommendation to conduct  workforce planning for the Disaster Recovery and Special Issues  Division. It stated that the division had developed a staffing plan to  address long-term oversight and management of the CDBG-DR  portfolio and, as of March 1, 2019, expected to fill 14 positions over  the next 3 months. In addition, it stated that it had identified an  approach to secure 20 additional positions to support CDBG-DR and  expected to finalize this approach in the next few weeks once it was  approved by HUD\u2019s financial and human capital officials. We added  this updated information to the report. While developing a staffing plan  is a good first step, HUD still needs to conduct workforce planning to  determine if the number of staff they will be able to hire is sufficient to  oversee the growing number of CDBG-DR grants, identify the critical  skills and competencies needed, and develop strategies for  addressing any gaps.", "HUD also provided the following comments on our findings.", "Regarding the discussion of unmet needs assessments, HUD noted  that the draft report does not acknowledge that the second  appropriation for 2017 disasters directed HUD to provide a minimum  of $11 billion for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for unmet  needs, which made HUD\u2019s standard methodology for determining the  allocation based on unmet needs data moot. HUD stated that this  information is critical to understanding the allocation of funds toward  unmet needs associated with 2017 disasters. Our review of the unmet  needs assessments focused on the first CDBG-DR appropriation of  $7.4 billion, for which HUD used its standard methodology to allocate  the funds. We focused on this initial allocation because HUD had  reviewed and approved the grantees\u2019 unmet need estimates for these  funds. In response to HUD\u2019s comment, we added language to the  report that $11 billion was to be allocated to Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands where we make reference to the second CDBG-DR  appropriation of $28 billion.", "Regarding the discussion of our prior work that found that CDBG-DR  grantees are not required to align their housing activities with the  needs of the affected communities, HUD stated the agency had  implemented requirements that directed grantees to ensure that  CDBG-DR funding allocations are reasonably proportionate to the  total remaining unmet needs for housing, infrastructure, and economic  revitalization. It also noted that the February 2018 Federal Register  notice directs grantees to propose an allocation of CDBG-DR funds  that primarily considers unmet housing needs. The focus of our  discussion was the status of our recommendation that Congress  consider providing more specific direction on the distribution of  CDBG-DR funds. Although we acknowledged in the draft report that  HUD instructed the 2017 grantees to primarily use their initial CDBG- DR allocation to meet unmet housing needs, we did not do so in the  section of the draft report that discussed this prior work. In response  to HUD\u2019s comment, we added similar language in that section.", "Regarding our discussion of prior HUD OIG reports on grantee  procurement practices, HUD said there has been a protracted  disagreement between HUD and the HUD OIG regarding the  procurement requirements that may be imposed on CDBG-DR  recipients, specifically the definition of \u201cequivalent.\u201d HUD stated that  the most recent resolution of this disagreement came in a January 10,  2017, decision memorandum from the former HUD Deputy Secretary,  supported by a legal opinion from HUD\u2019s Office of General Counsel.  According to HUD, these documents supported CPD\u2019s position that  states have the authority to follow their own procurement standards.  However, according to the HUD OIG\u2019s December 2018 semiannual  report, the HUD OIG disagreed with this assessment and referred this  issue to the Deputy Secretary on March 31, 2017. The report noted  that, as of the end of fiscal year 2018, the HUD OIG had not received  a decision. We revised the report to state that HUD and the HUD OIG  have an ongoing disagreement.", "Regarding a HUD OIG report on Florida that we cited, HUD said it  was evident that the state\u2019s financial policies and capacities were  functioning effectively because the state independently corrected a  bookkeeping error prior to the HUD OIG audit. However, the HUD  OIG noted in the report that Florida corrected the error the OIG  identified during the audit. Florida agreed with the finding and  accepted the recommendation. Therefore, we made no change to the  report. Further, HUD noted that the draft report cites  recommendations from a number of prior HUD OIG audits that had  been closed or where fundamental disagreement existed between  HUD and the HUD OIG. In the few instances where we did not  provide the status of HUD OIG recommendations to HUD, we added  their status to the report.", "Regarding our analysis of the status of 2012 and 2013 CDBG-DR  grants, HUD stated that the draft report included a simplified analysis  of CDBG-DR grant performance that dismissed HUD\u2019s determination  that disbursements from a CDBG-DR grant are substantially  completed 6 years after the effective date of the agreement. It noted  that our analysis excluded grants that were closed out and included  grants that should not have been included because they had a  contract-effective date of mid-2015 or later. However, our analysis  that HUD commented on draws from its own publicly available  monthly report entitled \u201cMonthly CDBG-DR Grant Financial Report.\u201d  Based on HUD\u2019s comments, the report appears to be missing key  information on the timing of the grants\u2014namely, some grants  identified as 2012 and 2013 grants had effective dates of 2015 or  later. Further, many of the grants that HUD said were unfairly included  in our analysis were designated as \u201cslow spenders\u201d in HUD\u2019s own  monthly report. We reviewed the additional documentation HUD  provided and updated our analysis.", "HUD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. We considered three comments to be more than technical in  nature.", "First, HUD stated that the draft report (1) was critical of grantee  capacity challenges, implying that the varying requirements in the  numerous Federal Register notices further tax a grantee\u2019s capacity,  and (2) suggested that permanent regulatory authority for CDBG-DR  would begin to address these issues. However, the draft report  identified grantee capacity as an administrative challenge that CDBG- DR grantees face that is not related to the lack of permanent statutory  authority.", "Second, HUD stated that the primary cause of the \u201cad hoc nature\u201d of  the CDBG-DR program and grantee capacity challenges is the  unpredictability of disasters and the uniqueness of each recovery  effort, not the lack of permanent statutory authority. It said that each  congressional appropriation includes unique statutory provisions  aimed at making incremental program improvements that can only be  implemented through a new Federal Register notice. We recognize  that each disaster is unique, but as our past work and that of the HUD  OIG has shown, there are certain challenges associated with meeting  customized grant requirements for each disaster\u2014such as funding  lags, varying requirements, and coordination with multiple programs\u2014 that could be addressed if Congress considered permanently  authorizing a disaster assistance program that meets unmet needs.", "Third, HUD stated that CDBG-DR funds are distinct from FEMA and  SBA response and recovery resources because FEMA and SBA  disaster programs have a narrower scope. HUD noted that CDBG-DR  funds aid in a community\u2019s long-term recovery from a catastrophic  disaster, which requires substantial time for planning the community- wide recovery effort. We recognize that long-term recovery takes time,  but we maintain that this does not prohibit Congress from considering  legislation establishing permanent statutory authority for a disaster  assistance program that responds to unmet needs.", "Because we believe the draft report adequately addressed the various  issues HUD raised, we made no changes in response to these  comments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and other  interested parties.

We focused our review on the states  of Florida and Texas and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands\u2014the states and territories most directly affected by  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and that received over $1 billion in  CDBG-DR funds to address unmet recovery needs.", "For all of our objectives, we visited Puerto Rico and Texas to interview  officials at the Puerto Rico Department of Housing and Texas General  Land Office, respectively, which are the 2017 CDBG-DR grantees in  those jurisdictions. During our visit to Puerto Rico, we also met with  Puerto Rico\u2019s Central Office of Recovery, Reconstruction and Resilience,  which was created to provide administrative oversight of all programs  related to disaster recovery. We visited these two grantees because they  were the 2017 grantees that received the largest amounts of CDBG-DR  funds.

We reviewed key documents\u2014such as  documentation on financial processes and procedures, implementation  plans, and action plans\u2014to determine when they were submitted and  approved. To determine how much CDBG-DR funding the 2017 grantees  had drawn down, we examined data from the Disaster Recovery Grant  Reporting system as of January 2019 (the most recent month available  during our review). To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed  relevant documentation on the system and interviewed officials  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting CDBG-DR draw down  information.", "To determine the steps the 2017 CDBG-DR grantees have taken to  establish financial processes and procedures, build capacity, and  estimate unmet needs, we reviewed grantees\u2019 documents, such as their  organizational charts and capacity assessments, to determine how  grantees plan to administer the CDBG-DR grants. In addition, we  identified and reviewed relevant HUD Office of the Inspector General  (OIG) reports to determine whether the office had previously identified  concerns about these grantees\u2019 financial processes and procedures and  capacity.", "To determine how grantees calculated their unmet housing needs for  homeowners and renters, we determined how HUD calculated grantees\u2019  unmet needs by reviewing the methodology outlined in the Federal  Register notices allocating the CDBG-DR funds and interviewing HUD  officials. We focused on the calculation HUD used to determine unmet  housing needs because the February 2018 Federal Register notice  required grantees to primarily use their initial CDBG-DR allocation to  address their unmet housing needs. We further focused on the housing  needs of homeowners and renters because they constituted the largest  portion (ranging from 47 percent in Texas to 99 percent in Florida) of  grantees\u2019 total estimates of housing needs. To determine how grantees  calculated the housing needs estimates of homeowners and renters and  the activities grantees planned to fund with the CDBG-DR grants, we  reviewed grantees\u2019 descriptions of their methodologies in the action plans  they were required to develop for their initial CDBG-DR allocation.  Although we did not conduct an extensive review of the grantees\u2019  methodologies for estimating the unmet housing needs of homeowners  and renters, we compared their methodologies to HUD\u2019s methodology  (described in Federal Register notices), identifying any differences.", "To examine the extent to which HUD has reviewed the steps that  grantees have taken and developed plans for future monitoring, we  reviewed HUD documents such as the completed checklists it used to  review (1) documentation grantees submitted for certification of their  financial controls, procurement processes, and grant management  procedures, (2) grantees\u2019 implementation plans, which contained a  capacity assessment, and (3) grantees\u2019 action plans for disaster recovery,  including their unmet needs assessments. We compared these  checklists against relevant statutory and regulatory requirements and  internal control standards. In addition, we reviewed examples of  unofficial working documents that HUD provided, such as a grantee\u2019s  response to HUD questions on the documentation that it had submitted.  Further, to determine HUD\u2019s monitoring of the 2017 CDBG-DR grantees,  we reviewed HUD documents such as the Office of Community Planning  and Development\u2019s monitoring handbook and monitoring schedule for  fiscal year 2019 and interviewed HUD officials. We compared HUD\u2019s  monitoring policies and procedures against relevant internal control  standards. Finally, we interviewed HUD officials about their resource  needs, hiring plans, and plans to monitor current and future CDBG-DR  grants. We compared HUD\u2019s hiring plans against relevant internal control  standards and best practices for workforce planning we have previously  identified.", "To determine the challenges that HUD and grantees have faced in  administering grants, we conducted a literature search for reports on  CDBG-DR funds used to recover from the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes  (Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) and Hurricane Sandy. We focused on these  hurricanes because Katrina, the costliest of the three Gulf Coast  hurricanes, and Sandy were among the top five costliest hurricanes on  record in the United States. We searched for GAO, HUD OIG, and Congressional Research Service reports and other literature such as  government reports, peer-reviewed journals, hearings and transcripts,  books, and association publications.", "To identify GAO reports, we used the search engine on GAO\u2019s public  website and searched for relevant terms such as \u201ccommunity  development block grant,\u201d \u201cSandy,\u201d \u201cKatrina,\u201d and \u201cGulf Coast\u201d from  August 2005 (the month of the 2005 hurricanes) to April 2018 (the  date of the search).", "To identify HUD OIG reports, we reviewed disaster-related reports the  HUD OIG made available on its public webpages titled \u201cDisaster  Oversight Highlights,\u201d \u201cSuperstorm Sandy,\u201d and \u201cHurricane Katrina.\u201d", "To identify Congressional Research Service reports, we used its  public website\u2019s search engine and searched for the terms  \u201ccommunity development block grant\u201d and \u201cdisaster.\u201d", "To identify the other literature sources, we searched the following:  ABI/INFORM\u00ae, Econ Lit, National Technical Information Service, and  20 other databases through GAO\u2019s ProQuest subscription; Nexis; and  Congressional Quarterly.

We screened out 23 based on  their abstracts and an additional 103 sources after reviewing their full  content. We excluded studies that related to the traditional CDBG  program rather than CDBG-DR and those that provided general  background on CDBG-DR. We determined that the remaining 31 sources  were relevant for our purposes and reviewed them to determine if they  identified any challenges that HUD and CDBG-DR grantees faced in  administering prior CDBG-DR funds. Specifically, we considered any  description of concerns with the administration and oversight of CDBG- DR to be a challenge. Using a standard form, one analyst reviewed each  source, identified relevant challenges, and assigned the relevant  challenges to a category. A second analyst reviewed the identification  and categorization. Where there were differences in the review of the first  and second analyst, the two conferred and entered a final decision. We  also interviewed HUD officials and the 2017 CDBG-DR grantees to obtain  their perspectives on the challenges in administering the 2017 grants.", "To determine the time it took grantees to receive CDBG-DR funds (one of  the challenges we identified through our literature review), we reviewed  information from the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting system, HUD  notices, and other sources to obtain the dates for the appropriations,  allocations, and grant agreement for the Gulf Coast hurricanes, Hurricane  Sandy, and the 2017 hurricanes. To determine the time it took grantees to  expend their CDBG-DR funds (another challenge we identified through  our literature review), we analyzed expenditure data in the Disaster  Recovery Grant Reporting system for grants made in fiscal years 2012  and 2013, as of January 1, 2019. We selected these grants because  HUD officials told us that grantees generally expend the majority of their  CDBG-DR funds within 6 years of signing a grant agreement, and the  2012 and 2013 grantees are approaching this milestone. To assess the  reliability of the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting system data, we  reviewed relevant documentation on the system and interviewed officials  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting grant agreement dates  and CDBG-DR expenditures.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to March 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
