The whistleblower claim review process takes several years to complete, and GAO found that the WO is not using available capabilities to track and monitor key dates in its claim management system. Without available information on key dates related to award review and payments, the WO is unable to assess its performance against timeliness targets and risks unnecessarily delaying award payments.", "Between fiscal year 2011 and June 30, 2015, the WO awarded over $315 million to whistleblowers\u2014the bulk of which was for the 7623(b) claims, which were first paid in fiscal year 2011, 4 years after the program started. In a review of the 17 paid 7623(b) award claim files, GAO found that the WO made errors in determining some awards, resulting in over- and underpayments totaling approximately $100,000. In response to errors, IRS began corrective actions, including ensuring total collected proceeds are verified before making award payments. However, the WO has not documented this new procedure, putting it at risk of making additional errors in award payments.", "The WO's communication with stakeholders, including whistleblowers, is limited due to delayed annual reports to Congress, incomplete data, and limited program information for whistleblowers. Delays in issuing the annual reports have resulted in last minute revisions that introduced discrepancies and inconsistent reporting periods that preclude year-over-year comparisons. The WO is addressing some data gaps and has published two fact sheets to provide more information to the whistleblower community; however, the fact sheets do not include information on key aspects of the program, such as time ranges for steps in the review process. Until changes are made to the annual report and fact sheets, the utility of these publications is limited.", "IRS and the WO take steps to protect whistleblowers and the information they submit, but GAO found gaps in IRS and WO procedures. For example, the WO did not have documented controls in place for sending mail, and at least once sent sensitive mail to an incorrect address that also had a return address indicating the letter was from the WO. This potentially compromised the identities of whistleblowers. The WO has said it has since changed how they label return addresses, but has not documented this policy. Further, tax whistleblowers do not have statutory protections against retaliation from employers. IRS and the whistleblower community support such protections, noting that inadequate protections may discourage whistleblowers from coming forward."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider providing whistleblowers with legal protections against retaliation from employers.

We refer to the original program as the 7623(a) program and  the expanded program as the 7623(b) program after the Internal Revenue  Code subsection that authorizes the different award payments. Claims  submitted under the 7623(b) program are those that allege a tax  noncompliance of over $2 million and are subject to a mandatory award  of between 15 and 30 percent of collected proceeds, to be determined by  the WO based on the extent of the whistleblower\u2019s contributions.  Whistleblowers may appeal an award determination under 7623(b),  including the denial of an award, in the Tax Court. Claims submitted  under the 7623(a) program are more discretionary: they are not subject to  statutory minimum award payments, are not eligible for judicial review of  award determinations in the Tax Court, and, prior to 2010, were not  subject to the same procedures for award determination as those claims  submitted under the 7623(b) program. However, IRS officials announced  in an update to the IRM that it would award and evaluate 7623(a) claims  received after July 1, 2010 by the same process it uses for the 7623(b)  program for claims submitted after the announcement. That is, 7623(a)  whistleblower claims received after July 1, 2010 will be paid between 15  and 30 percent of collected proceeds and will be based on the same  factors used to determine 7623(b) awards.", "The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also established the WO  within IRS, which is responsible for managing and tracking whistleblower  claims from the time IRS receives them to the time it closes them, either  through a rejection or denial letter or an award payment.

Over 95 percent of claims  closed between the start of fiscal year 2013 and August 5, 2015 did not  receive award payment. Each year most claims are closed early in  processing for a number of reasons, including the following: the  submission is nonspecific to taxpayer or tax issue, the submission is  unclear, or the claimant lacks credibility. The WO\u2019s workload includes the  initial vetting of claims and the processing of the small number of claims  that result in an award. Claims that pass the initial rounds of review have  the potential to be under review for several more years and may not result  in any award.

The process begins when  a whistleblower submits a signed Form 211, Application for Award for  Original Information, to the WO. The first stage of the process consists of  two steps. First, the WO\u2019s Initial Claim Evaluation (ICE) unit performs an  administrative review of the incoming applications. ICE examines the  submission for completeness and logs it into E-TRAK, the claims  management information system. Second, claims are generally sent to  staff from the Small Business / Self-Employed (SB/SE) operating division  (OD) where they are reviewed to determine whether the claims merit  further consideration by an OD or should be rejected or denied. Claims  that are identified as potential 7623(b) claims are sent to the WO\u2019s Case  Development and Oversight (CDO) team for further review. At this stage,  the WO may reject claims because the tax noncompliance allegation is  unclear, no taxpayer is identified, or the whistleblower is ineligible for an  award. Claims can also be denied if there is no potential noncompliance  found, among other reasons. Claims are then routed to the proper OD for  further review, including Criminal Investigation (CI) if there is the potential  for a criminal investigation, or are routed to ICE which sends the  whistleblower a rejection or denial letter. The Deputy Commissioner for  Services and Enforcement has set a 90-day target for completion of these  ICE, CDO, and SB/SE review steps. WO data shows 67 percent of  7623(b) claims are processed within this time frame. WO officials said  that cases of greater complexity are more difficult to handle and so are  more likely to experience delays. In particular, they said that claims that  need coordination across ODs because of their complexity are especially  prone to delay. Figure 3 summarizes the full claim review process for  7623(b) claims.", "OD SME review: The 7623(b) claims\u2014those that allege over $2 million in  tax noncompliance\u2014that are not rejected or denied in the initial review  are generally forwarded to OD subject matter experts (SME) for a more  rigorous review. For example, the SME may follow-up with the  whistleblower to obtain more information and will evaluate whether the  source of the information has the potential to compromise any case  developed from it. SMEs may deny claims if insufficient time remains on  the statute of limitations, among other reasons. Once claims are routed to  an OD, they leave WO control; however, throughout the claim review  process a WO analyst may monitor certain 7623(b) claims if the tax issue  involves multiple ODs or is particularly sensitive.", "The Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement has set a 90- day target for completion of SME reviews. However, these reviews may  take more than 90 days if the whistleblower\u2019s information relates to a  complex tax case or has an international component and requires  documents to be translated, among other reasons. SMEs we spoke with  generally agreed that they could meet the 90-day target for most claims.  The 90-day target is just that\u2014a target. WO and OD officials understand  there are several reasons why a SME review may take longer than 90  days. An official from one OD said that if a SME review does surpass 90  days, the WO and OD management may follow up to ensure a claim is  not sitting idle and to provide additional resources to the SME if  necessary and available. As of August 5, 2015, the WO reports that 67  percent of 7623(b) claims have met this time target since October 1,  2012.", "As part of their review, SMEs may contact (or debrief) whistleblowers to  clarify information submitted with the Form 211. Debriefings also provide  an opportunity to set expectations about communication between IRS and  the whistleblower and the length of the process. In 2012 and again in  2014, the Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement called for  SMEs to debrief whistleblowers unless there is a clear reason not to do  so. Debriefings can occur during the SME review or later, after the  taxpayer\u2019s examination has started. In both instances, the SME conducts  the debriefing. The whistleblower attorneys we spoke with varied in their  estimates of how often whistleblowers were debriefed but agreed that IRS  debriefs their clients less than 50 percent of the time.", "SMEs also determine the extent to which the whistleblower provided  unusable information: for example, information subject to attorney-client  privilege or illegally obtained information that may compromise IRS\u2019s tax  case. As warranted, IRS counsel may be involved in assessing the  limitations and the risk in using the whistleblower\u2019s information. The  SME review, including debriefings and the review for unusable  information, is a step unique to a whistleblower claim and can add time to  the whistleblower claim process.", "Claims that are not denied by the SME are added to the OD\u2019s inventory of  returns for potential selection. If the OD does not select the taxpayer(s)  identified in a whistleblower\u2019s claim for examination, the claim is returned  to the WO for denial processing. Selecting the returns largely depends on  the merits of the case. To the extent that whistleblower information  pertains to a high priority tax issue as specified in the IRS\u2019s annual plan,  ODs prioritize returns for examination based on the merit of the tax issue,  not on the source of the referral.", "ODs use whistleblower information to identify issues and to establish  leads for obtaining documents supporting tax assessments or  collections. They develop evidence independent of whistleblower  information to support any tax adjustments or collections action. To  mitigate the risk of compromising the tax case, OD guidance specifies the  contact with whistleblowers should be conducted through the SME and  counsel, as appropriate.", "Taxpayer examination and appeals: The examination, appeals, and  collection process may take several months to several years, depending  on the tax issues raised, agreement by the taxpayer, and payment. We  were able to collect data on the length of audits for twelve of the  seventeen 7623(b) claims that were paid as of June 30, 2015. The length  of this process ranged from 6 months to more than 4 years, with an  average of 2 years. Audit length can be affected by case complexity,  availability of documentation, taxpayer cooperation, and availability of IRS  resources. Taxpayer appeals also have the potential to extend the time a  claim is open. Taxpayers may pursue an appeal with the IRS Office of  Appeals, which generally takes between 90 days and 1 year to complete,  or by filing suit in Tax Court, which may take several months to over a  year to litigate. After an audit and any appeals, and if a taxpayer does not  pay the taxes owed, the case may be sent to collections, where IRS will  attempt to collect the outstanding liability from the taxpayer. Similar to  audit selection, IRS cannot pursue all outstanding collections cases, and  cases are selected based on the merits of each case and not because a  taxpayer was the subject of a whistleblower referral.", "At the conclusion of the examination process, OD staff record the  contribution made by the whistleblower on a Form 11369, Confidential  Evaluation Report on Claim for Award. The OD sends the Form 11369 to  the WO along with any supporting documentation from the OD and with  the original documentation provided by the whistleblower. According to  IRM provisions and direction from the Deputy Commissioner for Services  and Enforcement, the ODs should purge any documentation that  identifies the existence of a whistleblower from the taxpayer\u2019s file.", "Waiting period and award determination: Using information supplied  by the OD in the Form 11369, the WO analyst assesses how the  whistleblower\u2019s actions contributed to the IRS action and determines  whether to recommend an award. If an award is recommended, the WO  analyst determines an award percentage, which is applied to the total  collected proceeds to calculate the final award payment. However, the  WO only calculates the award once collected proceeds are final, which  occurs after the expiration of any remaining appeals rights of the taxpayer  and the right to request a refund. The refund statute expiration date  (RSED)\u2014which extends at least 2 years from the date of the last  payment made by the taxpayer to settle the tax liability related to the  whistleblower\u2019s claim\u2014 is the date at which IRS has what it considers to  be finalized collected proceeds. The WO does not pay awards before the  RSED to avoid paying an award on proceeds that could later be returned  to the taxpayer. In rare cases, the WO may pay an award earlier than  this, such as when IRS and the taxpayer sign a comprehensive closing  agreement waiving refund rights and immediately finalizing the collection  amount.", "Once the collected proceeds are finalized, the WO calculates the award  and sends a preliminary award package to the whistleblower. The Deputy  Commissioner for Services and Enforcement sets a 90-day target  beginning at RSED for sending the preliminary award package. This  package summarizes the award calculations and the factors used to  determine the award percentage.", "Award payment: After receipt of the awards package, whistleblowers  have the option to accept the award as calculated; submit comments to the award file; or  request a review of the full file to see how the award was  determined.", "The WO will review any comments submitted by whistleblowers before  making a final award determination and sending the award payment.  Whistleblowers who disagree with how an award is determined can  dispute the award in Tax Court if raising concerns with the WO does not  provide relief. Exercise of the review or comment options will lengthen  the time to award payment.", "In our review of the 17 paid 7623(b) claims as of June 30, 2015, we found  that claims took 4 years to 7\u00bd years from the submission of the Form 211  to the award payment. Much of this time was spent with the WO. For  example, from the time the OD completed and sent the Form 11369 to  the WO for award evaluation, it took between 1\u00bd to 4\u00bd years for claims  to be paid.", "Only a very small percentage of claims submitted have closed with an  award payment.

The WO has studied its workflow to  identify opportunities to more efficiently use staff through a consolidation  of processes. While a number of these proposals show promise, IRS has  put implementation on hold while it reconsiders staffing allocations in light  of its budget. Because the current process is dispersed across three  different units (each with their own staff allocations), any consolidation  might save staff days across the agency, but would likely require staff  increases wherever the functions were consolidated. As such, decisions  on this consolidation need to be made while considering IRS\u2019s overall  budget and agency-wide resource allocation. Not implementing these  changes has at least partially contributed to workload backlogs\u2014more  than 11,000 cases\u2014in three areas: SB/SE\u2019s initial review, the award  determination process, and processing rejection and denial letters.", "First, the WO cancelled plans late in 2014 to bring on additional staff and  take over the initial review and routing duties that were being done by  SB/SE staff; this contributed to a backlog of approximately 5,000 claims.  According to SB/SE officials, the inventory of claims being sent to them  for initial review slowed as the WO prepared to take over the work.  However, those plans were contingent on IRS\u2019s proposed fiscal year  2015 budget, which IRS did not receive. As the initial review process  returned to its original functioning, SB/SE received an influx of more than  two times the normal workload of initial review work in both the first and  second quarters of fiscal year 2015. According to SB/SE officials, they  received over 8,700 claims for initial review, which was more than the  typical amount of approximately 2,100 claims per quarter, and this  resulted in a backlog. The backlog was further exacerbated by staffing  shortfalls. According to WO officials, four to five full-time equivalent (FTE)  employees have been historically needed to complete this work.  However, according to WO officials, only 1.2 FTEs were available to do  the work at times. IRS officials told us that in the past, when staff met the  weekly time budgeted for their initial review, they set aside remaining  work until the following week.", "In early 2015, SB/SE brought on 12 revenue agents as 30-day detailees  to clear the backlog, but this effort was not entirely effective. First, the  detailees were brought on before SB/SE received the influx of claims.  These detailees helped in clearing an existing backlog, but were not  sufficient in number to clear the new claims. Second, the SB/SE initial  review and WO processes have a learning curve and because revenue  agents are assigned to the WO for only 30-day periods, they may rotate  to new assignments soon after they become proficient. According to  SB/SE officials, in June 2015, SB/SE was approved to bring on 23 120- day detailees and expects to reduce the backlog by the end of fiscal year  2015. SB/SE and the WO have not yet settled on a permanent staffing  plan for these duties, but WO officials said that they have no immediate  plans to take over these duties due to budget constraints.", "Second, a backlog exists in the award determination step for 7623(a)  claims. WO officials cited inadequate staffing resources and the volume  of small awards as the cause of this backlog.

This is the same level of  backlog reported by WO officials in March 2015. WO officials said they  brought in 120-day detailees to assist, but the detailees could not be  adequately trained within the 120-day window to clear the backlog.  Further, two permanent ARC staff left their positions. WO officials told us  they anticipate doing additional hiring to clear the backlog. On September  15, 2015, a WO official told us the office had hired six additional ARC  staff and most had already reported for duty, for a net increase in ARC  staff to four.", "Third, the WO has a backlog of approximately 2,500 denial or rejection  letters. WO officials said the backlog resulted from the low priority given  to denial letters\u2014the WO views getting whistleblower information to the  ODs and working on award payments as higher priority. Officials said  procedural changes also contributed to this backlog. In August 2014, the  final regulations on whistleblower awards became effective, detailing  procedures for the denial process. To implement the new regulations,  the WO drafted new language for denial letters. While the new language  was being developed and approved, the WO ordered a hiatus on new  denial notifications for 5 months, which contributed to the buildup of  denial letters.

Forty-six percent of all  claims (9,271 claims out of 20,264 claims) were closed between fiscal  year 2013 and August 5, 2015 because the allegations were not specific,  not credible, not clear, or did not identify a tax issue (see table 1).

This table does not  provide information for how long an average claim spends in each status;  however, readers may incorrectly interpret this table as showing the  overall average time for claims to move through the process. The table  also shows the longest and shortest days for claims in each status. This  information can be misleading; readers may interpret the shortest days  column to mean that it is possible for a claim to spend one day in a given  status when in fact the data only shows that at least one claim had been  in the status only one day when the snapshot was taken.", "IRS attributes some problems with data in the annual reports to E-TRAK,  as well as to other spreadsheets used to track whistleblower claims  information. As previously described, E-TRAK was not originally designed  as a management reporting system and therefore was not developed to  easily run certain data reports. The WO has made changes to E-TRAK  over time to allow for more robust data reporting, but the WO still has  problems reporting certain data in the annual reports. For example, the  WO has added some status fields to better describe and differentiate  where claims are in the review process; however, when these fields were  added, the WO did not always have the time or resources to update  claims that were already in process to the new status categories.

However,  WO officials also told us they did not have a formal plan for assessing  these costs and benefits. A benefit-cost analysis is the OMB\u2019s  recommended technique for a formal analysis of government projects,  and is used to aid agencies in determining whether a project is  appropriate when compared to alternative options, including the option of  not having the project. For such an analysis to be useful to decision  makers, it should include, among other elements, a comprehensive  enumeration of the different types of benefits and costs needed to identify  the full range of the project\u2019s outcomes.", "According to WO officials, the WO\u2019s initial assessment of the program  shows that it has taken 100 staff hours to send pilot letters to  approximately 180 whistleblowers updating them on approximately 360  open claims. WO officials stated that a significant portion of the time  spent on the pilot program was spent confirming data in E-TRAK. WO  staff researched each whistleblower claim in the pilot to confirm the status  and the mailing address of the whistleblower. WO management stated  that this process improved the WO\u2019s data by identifying claims that were  not properly updated in E-TRAK and by identifying incorrect addresses  through returned (undeliverable) mail. WO officials estimate that it would  take three staff years to send letters to all eligible whistleblowers, but WO  officials expect that the time needed for annual letters would decrease as  the office realizes labor efficiencies and improved E-TRAK data from  previous years\u2019 letters.", "The WO does not have plans to reach out to pilot letter recipients to  determine if they found value in receiving the letter or if they had other  feedback about the pilot program. The officials stated that sending a  survey (or otherwise reaching out to these whistleblowers) would be  counter to the intent of the program, which is to reduce the incoming calls  and correspondence. The WO plans instead to monitor the number of  phone calls and correspondence from pilot participants requesting  information about their claim to determine if the letters deterred  whistleblowers from contacting the WO. Further, WO officials said they  are monitoring press coverage and internet message board discussions  about the pilot letters. Internet postings indicate that whistleblowers are  frustrated by the lack of information in the letters. Most of the  whistleblower attorneys we spoke with\u2014at least one of whose clients  were part of the pilot sample\u2014generally did not think the pilot letters were  useful because they did not include a meaningful update on the status of  their claim. While some of the whistleblowers and attorneys we spoke  with said they appreciated IRS\u2019s attempt to improve communication with  whistleblowers, the letters did not communicate anything new, and they  already knew their claims were open because they had not received  award or denial letters.", "However, the sample of whistleblowers we spoke with (and those that  comment on the internet and in the press) may not be fully representative  of the whistleblower community\u2019s views. Whistleblowers that wish to  remain anonymous may not express their opinions of the pilot program for  fear of being identified as a whistleblower. Without attempting to hear  directly from those receiving the letters, the WO is unable to fully identify  and measure the benefits of the program. Benefit information may be  skewed toward the opinions of vocal whistleblowers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Opportunities Exist to Strengthen Whistleblower Protections", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential and Observed Errors Include Sending Sensitive Information to Incorrect Addresses and Retaining Whistleblower Information in Exam Files", "paragraphs": ["The protection of a whistleblower\u2019s identity is of utmost importance to the  success of the program. Without such protections, some whistleblowers  may not come forward to IRS out of concern or fear for their employment  or safety, according to whistleblowers and their representatives that we  interviewed. As outlined in the IRM and in Treasury regulations, IRS will  protect the identity of the whistleblower to the fullest extent permitted by  the law. In instances where revealing a whistleblower\u2019s identity is  essential to the pursuit of an examination or investigation, IRS guidance  states that it will make every effort to consult with the whistleblower  before deciding whether to proceed with the case. Also, IRS neither  confirms nor denies the existence of a whistleblower in a case if asked  directly by the taxpayer. While the WO has procedures and policies in  place to protect whistleblower identities, we found instances of  whistleblower identities being at risk for disclosure. In at least one case, a  whistleblower\u2019s identity was improperly disclosed by a former IRS  employee who later pled guilty to several charges, including some related  to the handling of the audit pertaining to the whistleblower\u2019s claim.", "First, in our review of closed claim files we found that the WO has sent  sensitive whistleblower mail to incorrect addresses. The WO maintains  whistleblower addresses separately from taxpayer addresses in the event  that the whistleblower wishes to have WO mail sent to an address other  than the one used to file their tax returns. One whistleblower attorney said  he recommends having the WO send all of his clients\u2019 mail to the  attorney\u2019s office to minimize the risk of misdirected mail. Even so, we saw  instances in our file review of the WO sending mail directly to  whistleblowers even after receiving requests to send all mail to the  attorney. Further, on at least one of these mailings, the IRS Whistleblower  Office was named on the return address. Such errors could have  consequences for whistleblowers, including having their identity as a  whistleblower disclosed. In addition, whistleblowers\u2019 rights could be  impacted because communication from the WO contains time-sensitive  material. For example, the whistleblower\u2019s right to respond to the WO on  preliminary award recommendations or the right to appeal final award  determinations with the Tax Court must occur within 30 days from the  date the notice is sent by the WO.", "WO officials told us that as of mid-2012, the office no longer identifies the  IRS Whistleblower Office on return mail labels, although there is no  written policy. WO officials recognized that whistleblowers were  uncomfortable with receiving mail that is clearly labeled as coming from  the IRS Whistleblower Office. According to these officials, mail sent from  the ICE unit in Ogden, UT (such as acknowledgement letters) lists only a  building identifier, and mail sent from other locations (such as a field  office where only one WO analyst works) is sent using the analyst\u2019s  address and last name only. Given the volume of correspondence the  WO sends as well as the recent hiring of staff and plans for additional  hires, having a written policy would strengthen the WO\u2019s protections of  whistleblowers\u2019 identities.", "The WO requests whistleblowers update their address with the WO  whenever they move, which can be a common occurrence given the  several years it can take for a claim to complete the review process.  Given that communications from the WO to whistleblowers are limited,  there are few opportunities to remind whistleblowers about this  requirement. Additionally, as of July 30, 2015, the WO\u2019s website did not  include clear instructions for whistleblowers needing to change their  address. According to WO officials, it is possible that some  whistleblowers updated their address with IRS for their personal account  and erroneously thought the WO would also update E-TRAK with their  new address information. As a matter of protecting whistleblowers, the  WO does not default to using the whistleblower\u2019s personal address. WO  officials told us they had not considered creating a change of address  form specific to whistleblowers. A change of address form specific to  whistleblowers could help alleviate some of the confusion whistleblowers  face when they change their addresses with IRS. However, according to  WO officials, such a form could create more administrative work for the  WO if it is mistakenly used by non-whistleblowers, such as if a taxpayer  wanting to update their personal account uses a whistleblower address  change form instead of the one intended for taxpayer files.", "Even in instances when a whistleblower did submit the proper address  change request to the WO, E-TRAK was not always updated accordingly.  WO officials told us that updating address change information in E-TRAK  can be challenging and time consuming. For example, if a whistleblower  submits multiple, unrelated Forms 211 alleging noncompliance by  multiple taxpayers, the WO opens a claim for each in E-TRAK. If the  whistleblower moves or requests that all correspondence be sent to an  attorney, each of the whistleblower\u2019s files in E-TRAK must be updated to  include the new address. WO officials said they were in the process of  developing an update for E-TRAK to allow for global updates to all files  for a particular whistleblower. As of July 28, 2015, an E-TRAK update has  been rolled out on a limited basis that allows for bulk updates of  addresses, among other things. According to WO officials, the new  function in E-TRAK is working well based upon initial testing with a  sample of bulk claims.", "Second, we found instances where whistleblower information was not  returned to the WO after an exam was closed. According to the IRM and  other WO guidance, information identifying the name or existence of a  whistleblower should be protected, especially from the taxpayers the  whistleblowers include on their Form 211 submissions. When the WO  sends claims to the ODs for review and examination, the file contains a  cover sheet that instructs the OD how to handle whistleblower  information. For example, whistleblower information should receive  special security protections and the exam team should never disclose to  anyone the name of the whistleblower or the fact that IRS is in  possession of whistleblower information. All information provided by the  whistleblower is to be returned to the WO at the conclusion of any audit  activity with the Form 11369. Additional instructions are included on the  Form 11369 reminding the exam team of the proper procedures for  safeguarding whistleblower information and returning it to the WO.", "Despite these procedures, we found instances where whistleblower  information (including the name and Social Security number of some  whistleblowers) was retained in exam files in breach of IRS policy. As we  reported in July 2015, three of the eleven TE/GE closed case files we  reviewed that originated from a whistleblower referral included information  identifying the whistleblower, such as by name or Social Security  number. Additionally, two others included information pointing to the  existence of a whistleblower, albeit not the identity. TE/GE officials said  that as of September 25, 2015, the five identified cases had been  redacted in accordance with the policy outlined in the IRM. WO officials  also cited other instances where they became aware of improper storage  or retention of whistleblower information and documentation in the ODs.  SB/SE officials said that as of September 1, 2015, they were in the  process of doing more training with staff on the issue. LB&I officials said  they send a memo to examiners that directs them to the LB&I website  where there is guidance and training on closing claims and protection of  whistleblower information. Because whistleblower cases have the  potential to be challenged through legal proceedings, these protections  are important. Without such file segregation, a taxpayer could potentially  identify a whistleblower in documents received during discovery for a  refund action or other tax-related suit in federal court.", "These breaches in protecting whistleblowers\u2019 identities highlight  weaknesses in IRS\u2019s internal controls over whistleblower information and  records. As a part of internal control, management should limit records  access to authorized individuals and should assign and maintain  accountability for their custody and use. Current procedures call for the  examiners to retain separate taxpayer examination and whistleblower  claim files and to return the whistleblower claim file to the WO at the  conclusion of the examination to ensure proper handling of whistleblower  information. If reviews of these files are either not occurring or are not  effective, whistleblower information and the public\u2019s trust in the program  are at risk. Additional controls\u2014such as a specific management sign off  on files before they are closed in the OD\u2014could reduce the risk of  whistleblower identities being inadvertently disclosed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Whistleblowers Do Not Have Legal Protections from Retaliation by Employers", "paragraphs": ["Unlike other whistleblower programs, there is no law protecting tax  whistleblowers against retaliation from their employers. A tax  whistleblower that is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened,  harassed, or otherwise retaliated against by their employer because they  provided information to the IRS has no cause of action to bring a lawsuit  in federal court. Other whistleblower award programs (such as those  created under the False Claims Act or Dodd-Frank Act) provide legal  recourse to such retaliatory practices. Under those statutes,  whistleblowers have a right to file a claim in U.S. district court for relief  from retaliatory actions, including reinstatement of their job, back pay, and  other damages.", "Many of the tax whistleblower attorneys we spoke with also provide legal  services to individuals bringing suit under the False Claims Act. Those  attorneys commented that not having statutory relief from retaliation for  tax whistleblowers puts these clients at risk of adverse actions by their  employers if it becomes known that they are a whistleblower. Some tax  whistleblowers we spoke with also noted that they had suffered from  negative consequences at work\u2014such as being denied a promotion or  being demoted\u2014as a result of their whistleblower status. Some level of  legal protections may provide additional assurances to potential  whistleblowers and could encourage those with high-value inside  information about tax noncompliance to come forward.", "It is the IRS and WO\u2019s goal to protect the identity of the whistleblower.  IRS officials support statutory retaliation protections for tax  whistleblowers. IRS officials told us, however, that such protections  should be remediated outside of IRS. The Secretary of the Treasury has  put forth legislative proposals for retaliation protections for whistleblowers  in IRS\u2019s fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016 Congressional Budget  Justifications, and has discussed them in recent WO annual reports to  Congress. In these proposals, Treasury estimates these protections  would not impose additional costs on IRS.

Since we last reported on the 7623(b) program in 2011, IRS  has made hundreds of millions of dollars in award payments to  whistleblowers and is in the process of evaluating thousands more claims  for potential award payments. The WO has also made several  improvements in the way it collects and reports information, making the  program more transparent. However, IRS and the WO could make  additional changes to improve timeliness, ensure the accuracy of award  payments, expand communications, and increase protections for  whistleblowers.", "Identifying and addressing inefficient processes should be a priority for  the WO, especially in the wake of recent budget cuts and curbs to the  WO\u2019s hiring plans. In order to maximize the benefits of information  provided by whistleblowers, the claim review process needs to efficiently  process useful information. Given the volume of claims received, even  small increases in efficiency can improve timeliness of claim reviews and  can free up WO resources to clear backlogs of other work, such as  issuing denial letters.", "Whistleblowers need to have confidence that their awards have been  calculated fairly and correctly. While WO officials said they have instituted  a new policy to prevent the sort of errors we found in our review,  documenting the new policy and disseminating it to all staff in the WO is  essential to ensure everyone is aware of and has access to the policy.", "Effective communication with Congress and the public is also critical to  the program\u2019s success. The annual report to Congress serves as the  WO\u2019s opportunity to provide a comprehensive overview of what the WO  accomplished and what challenges it faced in the prior fiscal year.  Presenting Congress with comprehensive, reliable, and clear data in a  timely manner will help Congress provide effective oversight. Further,  providing the public with a complete and accurate picture of how the WO  and the 7623 programs operate can bolster the public\u2019s trust in the  program.", "Finally, whistleblowers need assurances that their information and  identities are protected. Strengthening controls in areas such as mailings  and file retention can further prevent accidental disclosures of  whistleblower information that could bring them harm.

Strengthen the procedures for calculating award amounts and for the  issuance of the preliminary award recommendations and award letters  to whistleblowers. Such procedures should include, at minimum, a  documented process for: supervisory review prior to the director\u2019s concurrence, verifying collected proceeds prior to an award payment for both  the 7623(a) and 7623(b) programs, and   reviewing preliminary award recommendation and award letters to  the whistleblower prior to their issuance.  4.

Develop a comprehensive plan for evaluating the costs and benefits  of the pilot annual status letter program, including obtaining feedback  from whistleblowers in the pilot regarding the usefulness of the letter.  7.  Establish a process to ensure whistleblower addresses are being  properly updated in E-TRAK to ensure the WO does not send  whistleblower mail to outdated or incorrect addresses.
