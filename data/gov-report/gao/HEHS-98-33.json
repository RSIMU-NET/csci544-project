The aging baby boom generation will be followed by a relatively smaller work force that will have to support a relatively larger group of retirees. This trend, combined with the increasing longevity of the elderly, will significantly drive up the costs of maintaining the program.

Benefits also contained a \u201csocial adequacy\u201d component\u2014that is, they were proportionately larger, but absolutely smaller, for those with relatively low lifetime earnings. Currently, benefits are calculated using the 35 years of highest earnings, not total lifetime earnings, and benefits are provided to workers\u2019 spouses, children, and survivors, who may not have worked for pay.

Social Security uses average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) as its measure of these \u201clifetime\u201d covered earnings. Second, a progressive benefit formula is applied to these lifetime covered earnings to determine the benefit that will be payable to the worker at the normal retirement age (NRA), currently age 65. This NRA benefit, or primary insurance amount (PIA), is the basic amount used to determine the actual benefit for those receiving benefits on the basis of a worker\u2019s earnings record.

Under this type of financing structure, the payroll tax revenues collected from today\u2019s workers are used to pay the benefits of today\u2019s beneficiaries.

However, this structure required increasing contribution levels as the program matured and more beneficiaries with higher average benefits were added to the beneficiary rolls. In addition, the pay-as-you-go structure leaves the program and the federal government susceptible to financing problems when costs increase more than expected or revenues fail to meet expected levels, such as might occur with changing short-term economic conditions. Every year, Social Security\u2019s Board of Trustees estimates the financial status of the program for the next 75 years using three sets of economic and demographic assumptions about the future.

By 2013\u201415 years from now\u2014these cash revenues will be insufficient to pay all program costs. After 2013, Social Security will have to start redeeming some of its assets to obtain the cash needed to pay benefits.

This $3 trillion shortfall is based on the assumption that the Social Security program will continue under its current structure. That is, new workers will enter the system, pay payroll taxes (which will be matched by their employers), accrue benefit credits while working, and receive benefits when they retire.", "Even if revenue or expenditure adjustments necessary to reach 75-year balance were achieved, the financing problem still might not be permanently resolved. For the foreseeable future, each new 75-year projection period will have a higher long-term financing shortfall than the last. For example, suppose the payroll tax was raised sufficiently to reach balance, and the current actuarial assumptions were realized for the period 1998 through 2072. Under this scenario, the Trust Funds would have only about 1 year\u2019s worth of benefits remaining in 2072. If the same actuarial assumptions continued to be used in each of the years between 1998 and 2072, the Trust Funds would continue to be expected to be exhausted shortly after 2072, but, beginning in 1999, the 75-year projections would show a long-term revenue shortfall for the program that would grow over time.", "The program has another, higher revenue shortfall estimate\u2014about $9 trillion, as of October 1, 1997. This is the amount of the program\u2019s unfunded benefit obligations\u2014the accrued future benefit obligations that will not be able to be paid with assets currently in hand. A large unfunded liability in a government program financed primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis is generally not considered a problem because of the government\u2019s authority to tax current workers to pay current benefits. Thus, current unfunded liabilities are passed onto future generations. However, if the current Social Security program were ended or changed to an advance funded system, all $9 trillion of accrued benefit obligations would have to be paid if the government honored these obligations in full.", "Social Security does not face an immediate financing crisis because its cash revenues are expected to exceed its expenditures until 2013. However, the substantial size of the anticipated 75-year shortfall ($3 trillion if the program remains a pay-as-you-go system and $9 trillion if it is terminated or becomes a system that is funded in advance) suggests the need for reform action in the near future. Social Security is currently building up some Trust Funds reserves, which can help offset some of the revenue shortfall after 2013. Interest earnings on and redemption of these reserves, along with payroll and income tax revenues, are expected to provide sufficient resources, under the Trustees\u2019 1998 intermediate assumptions, to pay program obligations until about 2032.

The post-baby-boom generation, which resulted from the rapid decline in fertility rates from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s (see fig. 1.2), will result in relatively fewer workers to support a larger number of retirees. The number of workers whose payroll taxes will support those on Social Security will fall from today\u2019s about 3.4 per beneficiary to an anticipated 2.0 per beneficiary in 2030.", "Another factor that will raise program costs is the increase in life expectancies.

One of the three Advisory Council proposals\u2014the \u201cmaintain benefits\u201d (MB) proposal\u2014involves mainly traditional reforms that would operate within the existing structure of the program. A second proposal would significantly change the system by creating individual retirement accounts\u2014\u201cpersonal security accounts\u201d (PSA)\u2014that would be privately managed and invested as directed by the individual worker. The third proposal\u2014\u201cindividual accounts\u201d (IA)\u2014is essentially a hybrid of the other two proposals and includes both the creation of private individual accounts administered by the federal government and traditional-style reforms to the current program.", "The MB proposal would maintain most of the existing benefit structure of the program. However, since it used only traditional reforms, this proposal did not fully close the financing gap and restore actuarial balance. To achieve long-term actuarial balance, the MB group considered an option that involved investing about 40 percent of the Trust Funds\u2019 assets in private securities, such as through stock and bond mutual funds. This approach, in essence, would have expanded the extent to which the program was advance funded. In the end, the MB group simply recommended that this Trust Funds investment option be studied further.", "The other two Advisory Council proposals include systems of individual accounts. The PSA proposal would divert a portion of the existing payroll tax into accounts that would be managed privately, while the remainder of the payroll tax would go to finance a public benefit that would be smaller than current benefits are for most beneficiaries. Under this plan, 5 percentage points of the employee\u2019s share of the current OASDI tax rate would be diverted to an individual account. The accounts would be individually owned and privately managed, and individuals would choose from a variety of investments in private financial instruments. The accounts would be tax-deferred, and individuals could begin drawing from them at age 62. Any funds remaining in an account upon the death of the owner would become a part of the estate. The individual accounts would represent a second tier of benefits, with a modified version of the existing Social Security program benefits maintained as the smaller first tier.", "The IA option would essentially maintain the structure of the existing system, with adjustment, as a large first tier and add an individual account component as a supplemental second tier. Under this proposal, workers would be required to contribute an additional 1.6 percentage points of taxable payroll to fund the individual accounts. The accounts would be invested in private securities, and workers could choose among such investments as stock and bond mutual funds and government securities. However, these accounts would be administered largely through the existing Social Security program. The account accumulation would also be required to be annuitized through Social Security, a feature not included under the PSA plan.", "While these three Advisory Council options tend to dominate the current debate, numerous other proposals and options have also been advanced by various organizations, academics, and members of the Congress. For example, in the 104th Congress, proposals were advanced by Senators Kerrey and Simpson (S. 824, S. 825, and S. 2176) and Representative Nick Smith (H.R. 3758) and, in the 105th Congress, by Senator Judd Gregg (S. 321), Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (S. 1792), Representative Mark Sanford (H.R. 2768 and H.R. 2782), Representative John Porter (H.R. 2929), and Representative Nick Smith (H.R. 3082). Numerous other proposals have been offered recently by organizations such as the National Taxpayers\u2019 Union Foundation and the Committee on Economic Development, as well as by various economists and analysts (see bibliography).", "Although the Board of Trustees has indicated the program is expected to have sufficient assets and revenues (including interest on the Trust Funds) to pay all benefit obligations for the next 3 decades with no changes to the program, most analysts believe early action to reduce the actuarial imbalance is important for a number of reasons. First, the longer action to address the program\u2019s financing problem is delayed, the larger the per-year cost of the solution because the shortfall in revenues will still have to be addressed, but over a shorter period of time. Second, some of the possible solutions to the solvency problem\u2014such as raising the program\u2019s NRA, reducing benefits for future beneficiaries, or increasing the program\u2019s advance funding\u2014will take time to implement or phase in, once enacted. Third, if certain changes, especially those that reduce benefits, are made, workers will need time to adjust their saving and retirement goals to help mitigate the personal impacts of these changes.

Some historians of Social Security point out that prior to the Great Depression there was considerable resistance to involving the federal government in providing economic security and creating a federal social insurance program. Despite this view, there was also a developing realization that individual and voluntary actions were not adequate to address poverty among the elderly, and a number of state programs to assist the elderly were instituted. With the coming of the Great Depression and as various social movements gained attention, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed the Committee on Economic Security to devise what came to be the Social Security program. Throughout the legislative deliberations leading to passage of the Social Security Act in 1935, the theme of attaining a consensus on the balance between government and individual responsibility was prevalent.", "Over the years, the debate about the role of government has largely centered around three models: the social insurance model, the tax-transfer model, and the annuity-welfare model. Given the structure of the program as it emerged in the 1930s, the social insurance model (and, to a lesser degree, the tax-transfer model) has provided the most frequently used framework for analyzing the program. Some analysts, however, view the annuity-welfare model as a more appropriate approach for reform."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Social Insurance Model", "paragraphs": ["Workers face a variety of risks arising from the loss of earnings that can result from retirement, disability, or death. Consistent with the social insurance model, Social Security represents a way for workers to pool these risks; it offers a package of benefits that can be obtained for a given price in the form of taxes. Since the risk primarily involves the loss of earnings the taxes to finance such a program are earnings-related, as are the benefits received. In general, because such a package of benefits may not easily be obtained in private markets, the government is involved in providing the benefits. In addition to this market failure rationale for involving the government in administering such a pooling of risks, related rationales include reducing uncertainty about individuals\u2019 future retirement income; alleviating insurance market failures, such as adverse selection; addressing social concerns about income redistribution; reducing the social burden imposed by nonsavers and the short-sighted; and institutionalizing the compact between generations (filialism).", "In constructing the program along the lines of the social insurance model, two important\u2014and apparently conflicting\u2014objectives were addressed: individual equity and social adequacy. Linking benefits directly to the tax price paid, or to contributions, invokes the standard of a market return, or an \u201cactuarially fair return,\u201d and demonstrates the individual equity principle. But pooling risks against earnings loss also involves the concept of need or a desired minimum level of benefits. Thus, the program is designed to also embody the principle of social adequacy, which involves redistribution among participants within the program. Balancing these seemingly conflicting objectives through the political process has resulted in the design of the current Social Security program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Annuity-Welfare Model", "paragraphs": ["Some analysts advocate an alternative approach for restructuring Social Security: the annuity-welfare framework. The emergence of this model is linked with the debate that took place in the 1930s and with various economic critiques that have emerged since the 1960s. The fundamental basis of this model is the view that the different components of Social Security\u2014individual equity and social adequacy\u2014should be addressed separately; that is, the part of Social Security that pays benefits related to contributions by workers should be separated from the part of Social Security that relates to adequacy, or maintaining a minimum level of income to alleviate poverty. This view generally leads to a rather different approach to providing retirement income.", "Several key points about the annuity-welfare model and its relation to Social Security are worthy of note. First, while the individual is required to participate in Social Security, the annuity-welfare model emphasizes maximizing voluntary arrangements whenever possible. Nevertheless, the annuity-welfare model generally recognizes that because some individuals may choose to \u201cfree ride\u201d on society by not saving adequately, and others may experience conditions during their lifetime that leave them without adequate resources, a role for government involvement may be justified. Second, Social Security is not advance funded in the manner of private pensions and does not grant contractual rights to individuals as does, for example, a pension trust arrangement. Rather, the pay-as-you-go financing structure means that current workers pay for the benefits of current retirees and that benefits are promised largely on the basis of the ability of the government to pay them in the future. Third, the connection under Social Security between benefits and contributions is loose, mainly because of the redistributive nature of the system. As a result, some individuals will receive less than a market return for their contributions, which has raised concerns among proponents of the annuity-welfare model about the value provided by the program.", "There is an important fourth issue. Some see the existing Social Security structure as leading to further difficulties because decisions about the program and its impact on individuals are made through the political process. This is known as \u201cpolitical risk.\u201d According to this view, the design of Social Security creates the potential for program expansion because there will always be political incentives to promise higher benefits, which will be paid for disproportionately by certain groups, such as high earners or future generations. In addition, higher benefits that may need to be paid for by future workers can be promised in the near term, even though the ability of the government to raise funds in the future to make good on these promises may be dependent on the political situation at the time.", "Proponents of the annuity-welfare model view obtaining adequate retirement income as a matter of individual responsibility and believe that this private decision should be separate from the social decision about providing an adequate or minimum level of retirement income for those who otherwise would fall into poverty in old age. Thus, under this model, the individual may have greater control, through the political process, of the level of minimum or basic income to be provided by society because he or she is not required to participate in a larger program of social insurance that is subject to legislative and political actions.", "The emergence of privatization and individual account plans as an element of the current Social Security financing debate can in large part be tied to the annuity-welfare model. Two key features of this framework are its emphasis on advance funding and on a more direct linkage between the contributions made to the system and the benefits received from it. While proponents of both the social insurance and annuity-welfare approaches agree that those who contribute more to the system should receive more from it, the existence of income redistribution in the current Social Security program weakens this linkage. Individual account proposals could strengthen the program\u2019s equity goal by establishing a system in which the returns on investments would accrue to individuals themselves."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role for Government in the Two Models Differs by Degree", "paragraphs": ["In general, the frameworks discussed here reflect differences in philosophies about the appropriate balance between individual and government responsibility. While both frameworks include a role for government in providing retirement income and some mandatory contribution toward it, the degree of support to be provided through government is a major source of contention.", "Concerning the issue of linking benefits to contributions, supporters of the current Social Security program structure argue that redistribution is a desirable goal and a major reason for a social insurance program. They object to the separation of the individual equity and social adequacy elements, as this holds the potential, in their view, for undermining the consensus for redistribution and support of the less fortunate elderly. Further, they assert, the commitment of government under a social insurance system precludes the need for contractual arrangements and, because risks are borne collectively, reduces many of the risks that would otherwise be faced individually. Supporters of the current system also argue that a primarily pay-as-you-go system is an appropriate way to finance transfers intergenerationally.

As a result, current workers would need to be asked to \u201cpay twice\u201d\u2014once for the accrued benefits of current and future retirees and again for their own retirement benefits. In subsequent generations, workers would have to pay to fund only their own benefits. Although advance funding is generally associated with individual accounts, advance funding could be introduced without them. The system is already partially advance funded, and government\u2019s investing a part of the Trust Funds in the stock market would represent an increase in advance funding.", "If the current program was terminated and a new fully advance funded one that included all current and future workers was started, the amount necessary to pay the accrued benefit obligations under the current Social Security system would be about $9 trillion. In principle, transition costs do not pose any greater cost than already exists under Social Security. Concerns about transition costs arise primarily because of the timing of paying for benefit entitlements. Under pay-as-you-go, the costs of paying accrued benefits occur in the future and represent an unfunded promise\u2014a type of implicit debt. In moving to an advance funded system, the future benefits, which would need to be paid for eventually, would be recognized today. Paying these benefits could involve significant payroll tax increases or a sizable increase in government debt.", "Making a transition to an advance funded system would also present political difficulties. Reneging on benefit obligations or requiring current workers to \u201cpay twice\u201d could significantly disadvantage many individuals, and showing that a funded system was superior to pay-as-you-go would do little to ease the pain. It has been suggested that the current pay-as-you-go program has created a \u201clock-in\u201d effect that was largely intended when the program was designed. That is, transition costs could prevent individuals from supporting a potentially superior alternative that offers higher benefits or returns until the benefits under the existing system become considerably worse than they would be under the alternative. Voters could continue to support the current program structure, which could increase the political costs of making a transition, and the existence of strong interest groups could add further to the political costs and difficulty of making such a transition.", "Nonetheless, the problem of \u201cpaying twice\u201d could be mitigated in several ways. One way would be to reduce accrued benefits for the current retired generation. The IA plan attempts to address the long-term financing problem, for the most part, by reducing future benefits, including those already accrued, for current workers. Another way to mitigate the economic and political costs of transition for a particular generation of workers would be to push the costs of accrued benefits into the future. This would be similar to what a pay-as-you-go system does. Two ways to avoid putting responsibility for all of the transition costs on one generation of workers would be to levy special taxes on the entire population or to finance the transition through borrowing.", "Under the first approach, the accrued obligations of the Social Security system that came due, and that were in excess of the financing available, could be financed by levying an array of taxes. Each type of tax that could be used would have different impacts on individuals and the economy. A payroll tax would be consistent with the current financing of the program, but because of its regressive impact on lower earners, it might not be seen as desirable. Income taxes could reduce the impact on lower-earning workers and families but could have undesirable effects, such as increasing taxes on savings. Levying taxes to pay the accrued benefits, moreover, could still leave a substantial burden on the current generation of workers.", "Another way of financing the accrued obligations in transition to an advance funded system would be to use government borrowing. The government would issue bonds to finance the payment of benefits, and the bonds would be paid off in the future, which would spread the cost to future generations. Because the interest and principle on the bonds would be paid with future taxes, the use of bond financing would be a more effective way of spreading the cost of the transition than taxation. There are a number of ways to implement bond financing. One of the earliest ideas was to issue \u201crecognition bonds,\u201d which could be issued to individuals in recognition of the government\u2019s intention to honor its benefit obligations.

Depending on the plan design, an individual\u2019s account accumulation could be converted to an annuity, taken as a lump sum, left in place, or used for any purpose desired. While this approach offers greater freedom of choice, it also raises several concerns.", "One concern is whether the account accumulation would be intended to constitute a source of retirement income as opposed to simply a savings accumulation device that might not be fully used for retirement income. Another concern is the process of annuitization itself. Obtaining annuities individually or on a group basis in the private market could be more costly than having the government provide them. Related to this issue is the question of whether an individual could obtain an annuity that provided features similar to those currently provided by Social Security.", "One of the major goals of proponents of individual account plans is to ensure that individuals have as much freedom as possible in choosing how to allocate their own resources. Individual accounts can offer a large amount of freedom and choice and, in principle, there is no inherent reason why individuals should be required to receive their retirement income through an annuity. Thus, a fundamental issue of retirement income policy is how much the individual\u2019s choice should be restricted in order to ensure that he or she does not become a burden on society in old age.", "The social insurance approach seeks to provide a \u201csocially adequate\u201d benefit, not a minimal benefit, that protects a substantial portion of the preretirement living standard. This perspective suggests that restricting an individual\u2019s choice is justified to achieve a more socially desirable outcome. This perspective is embodied in proposals that restrict the individual to investing through the government and require annuitization of the account accumulations so that there is more certainty that an adequate retirement living standard will be achieved.", "An additional complication arises when individual borrowing provisions are considered as a feature of the individual account plans. This is an important issue with private pensions, particularly with 401(k) plans. Restricting borrowing from the accounts helps ensure that the funds constitute retirement income. Allowing borrowing provides more freedom of choice but does not ensure that the accounts will be used for retirement. In this case, the accounts of many might represent more of a tax-deferred saving vehicle than a retirement saving vehicle.", "A second major concern is whether those individuals who chose to convert their account accumulations to retirement income by purchasing an annuity would actually be able to do so. One of the major advantages of Social Security is the provision of a lifetime annuity. Private pension plans also provide an advantage because they are able to offer annuities through group arrangements. But those who have an individual account plan might have to obtain annuities in the individual annuity market. While individual annuities are available, they can be costly, especially relative to annuities provided through Social Security. This issue is compounded, since private annuities might not generally contain the same features as a Social Security annuity\u2014features such as dependents\u2019 benefits, inflation protection, and the use of unisex life tables (that is, the same assumed mortality rates for both men and women).", "It is difficult to predict, however, what would occur if an individual account system were put in place. Some retirees would prefer individual annuities over other payment options, and competition among financial institutions to provide such annuities would ensue. This could be a positive force in driving down the cost of annuities, but the possibility remains that firms would compete for what they perceived to be the best risks, which in this case could be those who are likely to have shorter lifetimes. Competition directed at avoiding adverse selection problems could result in market imperfections wherein certain individuals might not be able to obtain annuities at reasonable cost, and this might lead to calls for legislation or regulation restricting the ability of financial institutions to deny individuals an annuity contract.
