These agencies followed similar processes for approving telework agreements. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance recommends managers complete telework training prior to approving telework agreements, but three of the four agencies did not have a mechanism to help ensure managers have completed this training before approving employee telework agreements. Because managers in these agencies may not have completed the training before entering into agreements, they may not be familiar with telework policies. Further, three of the four agencies did not require a periodic documented review of telework agreements. By not requiring regular review of telework agreements, these agencies cannot be assured that the agreements reflect and support their current business needs. Consistent with the act, all four agencies described efforts to encourage telework participation and provide for the technology to enable it. However, GAO's focus groups with teleworkers provided some examples of how supervisors may discourage telework participation and reported that some level of managerial resistance to telework remains. Managerial resistance to telework can undermine reviewed agencies' ability to meet telework participation goals. In its leadership role for telework matters, OPM can assist agencies with tools to assess and resolve these types of concerns.", "Consistent with the act, all four case study agencies have controls to help ensure that telework does not diminish employee and organizational performance. These four agencies' policies followed the act's requirement that teleworkers be treated the same as nonteleworkers for the purposes of work requirements, performance appraisals, and other managerial decisions. Agency officials and focus groups reported that telework status did not impact performance expectations. Focus groups with supervisors described numerous strategies and resources they use to supervise and stay connected with teleworking employees.", "The four agencies used varied methods to collect and report telework data to be included in OPM's annual telework reports, but all cited challenges to ensuring that employee-reported telework data were accurate because employees may not know or follow policies for recording telework. While three of these agencies use electronic systems to track telework agreements, the Department of Labor (Labor) uses a manual system which limits its ability to access accurate, real-time telework agreement data that management uses to assess compliance and for resource allocation decisions. Further, GAO found that the Department of Education (Education) had not been reporting telework eligibility data compliant with the act. OPM also faced challenges in reporting accurate agency telework data and GAO identified errors in OPM's annual reports to Congress. For example, OPM's report cited Education's fiscal year 2016 telework participation goal as 5 percent, reflecting Education's goal for increasing its participation rate, instead of its overall participation goal of 90 percent. OPM may be missing opportunities to improve its data because it does not always follow up with agencies on significant data differences or outliers. The errors and invalid data in OPM's annual reports to Congress reduce the usefulness of these reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes recommendations to each of the case study agencies, including ensuring supervisors complete telework training in a timely manner and improving telework data.

In  contrast, situational telework is approved on a case-by-case basis, and  occurs outside of a routine telework schedule. Situational telework often  occurs in response to a specific event such as inclement weather.  Situational telework is also referred to as ad hoc, episodic, intermittent,  and unscheduled telework. Situational telework may be approved for 1  day or a number of days. For example, short-term telework is situational  telework that occurs continuously for a finite number of days. Employees  participating in short-term arrangements (e.g., because recuperating from  surgery, maternity reasons, etc.) typically do not have in-office days; they  work a full or part-time schedule from their homes.

Table 4 provides examples of how supervisors reportedly  demonstrated this support and discouragement at our case study  agencies. Officials at three of our four case study agencies and two focus  groups with teleworkers and supervisors reported that some managers do  not support telework because they believe it contributes to poorer  performance, as compared to the performance of in-office employees.", "Agency and union officials said the frequency of telework varied across  the agencies and supervisors. All four agencies noted in their telework  policies that some supervisor discretion should be used when approving  and monitoring telework agreements, but some agency and union officials  said the resulting variation in telework usage contributed to a perception  that the agency was inconsistently implementing the telework program.  We heard from some union officials and focus groups with teleworkers  that employees sometimes assumed that supervisors were approving  telework based on favoritism or other reasons not supported by agency  policy. Agency and union officials did not characterize the extent to which  supervisors or managers were discouraging telework, partly because  none of our case study agencies had conducted any recent agency-wide  surveys on telework. We also heard at one focus group with teleworkers  that employees did not always feel comfortable voicing concerns publicly  for fear of negative consequences for their careers. However, if  employees are not provided an opportunity to voice their concerns without  concern for negative consequences to their jobs, agencies may be  missing an opportunity to better identify and address barriers to telework,  including managerial resistance. Addressing managerial resistance could  help increase telework participation rates by reducing inconsistencies in  how agency telework policy is applied.", "According to federal standards for internal control, management, along  with oversight from the oversight body, should determine through an  evaluation process the extent to which deviations are occurring that would  prevent the organization from achieving its objectives.

Seven of these focus groups discussed how network  connectivity or access was a challenge, including having to repeatedly log  on to the agency network after being disconnected and spending time  getting assistance from their respective agencies\u2019 IT help desks. One  focus group with supervisors reported that when IT challenges arose,  supervisors may have to cover teleworking employees\u2019 daily tasks while  the employee resolved the IT issues. We also heard at some of the focus  groups that teleworkers and supervisors discussed what resources and  tools the teleworker would need to perform work activities while  teleworking, and how to address any telework technology-related  problems.

Three of our case study  agencies use an electronic telework agreement management system, but  Labor\u2019s manual system creates challenges in tracking the number of  telework agreements. GSA and SEC use electronic systems for storing  and tracking telework agreements. Education transitioned to an electronic  system in 2016. The electronic telework agreement systems allow  Education, GSA, and SEC to integrate certain internal controls into the  telework agreement and data collection process.

They can also show supervisors their  employees\u2019 approved telework schedule when approving employee  timesheets.", "In 2016, Education transitioned from tracking telework agreements on  paper to using an electronic system where employees request telework  agreements electronically. As part of this conversion, Education  employees created new telework agreements in the electronic system.  Education officials said this process will serve two key functions: first, it  will convert telework agreements from paper files to electronic  agreements; second, it will require all agreements to be renewed annually  to ensure they continue to fit the needs of the employee or the agency  unit. The electronic system will generate annual reminders to employees  to renew their telework agreements.", "Unlike the three other case study agencies, Labor uses a manual, largely  paper-based system. Labor officials said budget limitations had prevented  them from procuring an electronic telework management system. Labor  employees submit a written request for telework to their supervisor, either  on paper or an electronic document. If approved and signed by the  supervisor, the telework agreement is then forwarded to a telework point- of-contact (POC) in the employee\u2019s division or region. The POC then logs  the agreement into a spreadsheet and scans the agreement if it is  submitted on paper. POCs supply telework data for their respective  divisions or regions to the TMO quarterly via a spreadsheet; the TMO  aggregates the data for management reporting and for inclusion in OPM\u2019s  annual reports.", "Labor officials said their data on telework agreements may be inaccurate  due, in part, to this manual process and some individuals not following  policy. For example, an employee is allowed to telework as soon as a  supervisor signs the agreement. However, if the agreement is not  forwarded on to the POC, it is not included in the telework data the POC  transmits to the telework coordinator and TMO. Thus it may not be  included in the telework data used by senior department leadership for  decision-making and reporting purposes. Further, Labor officials said that  they began collecting information on scheduled telework hours quarterly  beginning in October 2015, but they did not yet routinely use the data  because they are known to not reflect actual telework hours. Additionally,  Labor officials said that many employees have situational telework  agreements and use them to telework fairly regularly. Such situational  telework would not be part of the scheduled telework hours reported.  These officials also said they are working towards improving telework  data quality to use more data to manage and expand the telework  program.", "Because employees may adjust their telework agreement throughout the  year, Labor\u2019s manual process may prevent the agency from being able to  have accurate real-time data on the total number of employees  authorized to telework or accurate expectations for levels of scheduled  telework.

Some case study agency officials said  they continue to field questions from employees about how to properly  code for telework hours. This shows that confusion remains about how to  report telework hours correctly. Case study agency officials also said they  sometimes identify instances of incorrect telework time coding in periodic  reviews of telework data. The case study agencies may require  timesheets be corrected when discrepancies are identified.", "To address issues with improper recording of telework hours, telework  officials at our case study agencies took a variety of training and  communication approaches. For example, they said they stress the need  for telework data accuracy in communications to supervisors, send  frequent reminders to both teleworkers and supervisors on how to  properly code for telework hours, and offer training and provide job aids to  both teleworkers and supervisors on how to properly code telework time.", "Supervisors in our focus groups identified some tools they use to help  ensure their employees\u2019 timesheets properly reflect their telework hours.  For example, supervisors in one focus group said they refer to shared  calendars to verify telework hours before certifying timesheets. At SEC,  electronic timesheets are pre-filled with an employee\u2019s telework schedule,  so employees need only to change the telework time coding if there is a  change to their telework schedule for the pay period, such as for  situational telework. Supervisors at SEC can also run reports from their  telework agreement system showing the telework schedule for all  employees reporting to them.", "All four of our case study agencies periodically reviewed telework data to  identify and address trends and outliers, as well as to assess compliance.  Officials at the four case study agencies said they compare lists of  individuals charging telework codes against a list of individuals with valid  telework agreements on file. This helps ensure that everyone who  teleworks is authorized to do so. Agency officials said that when they  identify discrepancies, they notify the individual charging telework and  potentially others, such as the supervisor and local telework coordinator,  of the need for a valid agreement. For example, SEC officials said they  identified 66 individuals teleworking without an agreement in their most  recent review. They then followed up with the individuals to get a telework  agreement in place. SEC officials said they also review situational  telework hours to determine if employees are teleworking routinely and  need a continuing telework agreement. According to agency officials at  our four case study agencies, incorrectly coding work time and  teleworking without a valid agreement were the most common types of  telework data errors.", "The case study agencies varied in how they collect and report telework  data.

Officials at Education and Labor said they had some difficulty reporting  certain telework data. As previously discussed, Labor\u2019s telework  management process relies on manual quarterly reporting from  subagencies which does not allow for a real-time assessment of some  telework data. Education officials also said they have had difficulty with  reporting annualized numbers of telework days per employee, as  originally requested by OPM.

For the purposes of this report, we refer to the two most  recent reports as the 2014 report and the 2016 report.", "To gather data for these annual reports, OPM requests that telework  officials at executive branch agencies and subagencies complete a data  call that includes a series of questions on participation rates and telework  goals, among other topics. OPM updated data standards in March 2012  to assist agencies in reporting telework data properly. It aggregates and  analyzes the data in a spreadsheet and compiles them into the annual  report. OPM officials said that to issue the report, they work within a tight  timeframe and with limited staff resources. They stated, however, that  data accuracy in these reports is a priority. Consistent with federal  internal control standards, OPM provides agencies with a chance to  review their data to help ensure they are accurate before completing the  report. Specifically, these internal control standards state that agency  management should communicate with and obtain quality information  from external parties, and also use quality information (data that are  relevant and from reliable sources) to meet agency objectives. However,  despite this step, we identified some instances of inaccurate agency data  being included in both the 2014 and the 2016 reports. Examples include  the following:   In the 2016 report, Education\u2019s telework participation goals are listed  as 5 percent (the lowest percentage goal for agencies reporting one).  This sharply contrasts with prior fiscal year goals of 85 percent.  Education officials said that they interpreted the question in the data  call as asking for the increase in the telework participation rate goal,  and provided 5 percent as the agency response. The overall  participation goal for fiscal year 2016 should have been 90 percent.  Education officials also said that the data call instructions for this item  and others are not always clear.", "In the 2014 report, OPM erroneously reported Labor\u2019s participation  goal. Labor officials said that when OPM provided them with a chance  to review the data to be included in the 2014 report, Labor identified  an error in its reported telework participation goal. Labor officials  notified OPM of the error and supplied the corrected goal information.  However, the published report did not include this corrected goal  information.", "In the 2014 report, OPM highlighted the fact that Labor reported  having varying telework eligibility criteria among its subagencies.  However, Labor\u2019s actual telework eligibility criteria are uniform across  the entire department, as had been reported in the prior annual report.  Labor officials said that they had mistakenly supplied incorrect  information to OPM on eligibility criteria for four subagencies. They  added that they did not recognize the error until the final report was  issued.", "Education officials said that although OPM sometimes follows up on data  supplied in the data call, they believe it would be helpful if OPM reviewed  agencies\u2019 year-to-year data and followed up on any unexpected or large  changes. For example, OPM did not contact Education to clarify why its  overall telework participation goal dropped from 85 percent to 5 percent.  Had OPM done so, Education officials could have clarified their response.  We have previously found that OPM may be missing opportunities to  improve upon data it reports by not following up with agencies on data  differences.", "OPM officials, however, said that they do some data verification, but that  they rely on the agencies to submit the correct data compliant with OPM\u2019s  data standards. OPM holds training sessions for each data call to answer  questions telework officials may have about completing the data call.  OPM officials also said that given the sheer volume of data that they  receive, it is unrealistic for OPM to catch all reporting errors. However,  given that OPM has aggregated data call responses into spreadsheets, it  would be feasible to automate some comparisons of numeric data across  these spreadsheets to identify changes in year-to-year data, and follow  up with agencies on changes above a given threshold.", "We also identified instances where the agencies failed to properly report  data on telework eligibility. For example, in the 2014 report, Labor  reported the number of individuals eligible to participate in telework as  higher than the number of total employees for several subagencies, with  the difference sometimes as high as 32 percent. Labor officials explained  that at the time of the 2013 data call\u2014which provided the data used in the  2014 report\u2014they counted the number of positions eligible to telework,  regardless of whether the positions were filled or not. This resulted in  some subagencies reporting a higher number of eligible teleworkers than  total employees. Labor officials said they have since changed the way  they count the number of individuals eligible to telework. They included  this adjusted methodology when providing data for the 2016 report.", "In the 2014 report, Education also reported the number of individuals  eligible to participate in telework as higher than the number of total  employees for several of its offices. According to Education officials, they  last determined telework eligibility by position in 2011 and have reported  the same number of eligible positions for all data calls since, including in  the 2016 report. Education officials said that they interpreted the  instruction on the data call as allowing for such static data reporting. OPM  officials said that for the 2016 report they systematically compared the  reported number of employees, eligible employees, and teleworking  employees to identify situations in which the number of eligible  employees exceeded the number of employees or when the number of  teleworkers exceeded the number of eligible employees. They then  contacted every agency where they found inconsistent data, including  Education. According to OPM officials, they discussed with Education  officials OPM\u2019s expectation that agencies update their eligibility records  regularly. However, OPM officials said they deferred to Education\u2019s  decision regarding what eligibility information it wanted to provide and  published Education\u2019s static eligibility data despite the accuracy issues  identified.", "Agencies reporting on position eligibility and not individual eligibility  overstate telework eligibility. As a result, they also understate other data  points calculated from eligibility data, such as total participation rates.  Further, the methodology of counting eligible positions does not take into  account the additional telework eligibility requirements of the act at the  individual level, such as personal conduct and performance history.  Accounting for these requirements may further reduce the total number of  employees eligible for telework. The methodology Education officials  described using for counting and reporting eligibility indicates that the  data Education has been reporting to OPM do not comply with the act.", "In the 2016 report, OPM recognized that some agencies have not  revisited eligibility determinations since early implementation of telework.  However, it concluded that this may result in agencies understating, not  overstating, eligibility because more individuals may become eligible as  agency telework policies and capacities expand. OPM officials said this is  a reasonable conclusion because as agency telework programs mature,  more individuals should become eligible. Furthermore, Federal Employee  Viewpoint Survey data show that both self-reported eligibility and telework  participation have been increasing over time. The version of the 2016  report issued to Congress in September 2016 did not explain why some  agencies report a higher number of eligible employees than total  employees. However, OPM included some discussion of this data  discrepancy in an updated version of the report posted on  www.telework.gov in November 2016.", "Agencies are responsible for providing OPM with telework data that  comply with OPM\u2019s data standards, but OPM\u2019s responsibility for reporting  telework data annually is not limited to aggregating and reporting data  directly from agencies without verifying its reliability. Consistent with  federal internal control standards, OPM is responsible for taking  reasonable measures to help ensure the accuracy of the information it  reports and, where necessary, indicating in the report where data may be  of questionable accuracy. Although OPM has taken some steps over  the years to improve the accuracy of the telework data it reports, in  reviewing OPM\u2019s two most recent telework reports we found that the  report included some inaccurate data for two of our four case study  agencies.

While this will not eliminate the annual  telework data call, according to the memorandum, it will reduce the  manual reporting burden for agencies. OPM stated that it will continue to  administer an annual data call to collect telework program information not  available in EHRI, such as agency progress towards reaching telework  goals and best practices for telework programs.", "Although we have previously reported that EHRI data are sometimes  incomplete or inaccurate, using these data could be helpful in identifying  and addressing data quality issues. Further, OPM officials told us there  are known problems with some telework data because agencies vary in  how they report them. To address these limitations and help ensure  agencies are following data standards, OPM set a timeline for testing and  assessing the accuracy of telework data in EHRI over the course of fiscal  year 2017. This process includes as a first step having agency TMOs and  human resources staff examine telework data pulled from EHRI for one  pay period to assess the accuracy of the data and determine any  potential issues affecting data accuracy. OPM then plans to hold a series  of meetings with agency TMOs, human resources directors, and payroll  providers to discuss the steps and assistance needed to ensure telework  data in EHRI are reported accurately. OPM officials said they plan to  pursue an iterative process with agencies to verify the accuracy of  telework data in EHRI.", "OPM\u2019s plan to use EHRI data for future telework data reporting is a  positive step toward improving the accuracy of telework data and OPM\u2019s  ability to compare data year to year. For prior data calls, agencies  supplied telework data from their own systems, which may have differed  from data reported to EHRI. OPM officials told us they were unsure how  much, if at all, agencies were adjusting their telework data across various  data sources before responding to data calls. OPM did not compare these  data to payroll data aggregated in EHRI because, according to OPM  officials, doing so would have been inappropriate given the known  limitations of the EHRI data at the time. According to OPM officials,  reporting telework data directly from EHRI going forward will reinforce to  agencies the importance of recording and certifying telework data  regularly through payroll reporting.

As technology and the nature of work in  the federal government evolve, incorporating telework into agency  operations and expanding telework participation could help agencies  continue normal operations during adverse weather or other COOP  events, as well as attract and retain employees. But to have a telework  program that can achieve these benefits and comply with the act\u2019s  requirements, the four case study agencies we reviewed must ensure that  their telework policies, procedures, and other controls are implemented  appropriately, and that the technology needed for employees to telework  functions as it should. Documenting that those responsible for  implementing agency telework policy are trained before doing so and  reviewing telework agreements regularly can help these agencies ensure  that they are applying their telework policies consistently, and improve  telework data accuracy. Identifying pain points for teleworkers can also  help agencies prioritize ways to improve and investments in their  programs.", "Because telework data are used across the government, such as by  Congress for oversight, and by agencies for decision-making purposes,  the four agencies and OPM need to ensure that the data they report  accurately reflect the status of telework at federal agencies. Reporting  and using data that either do not comply with the act or are known to be  of questionable quality compromises these agencies\u2019 abilities to  effectively manage their telework programs, and limits the usefulness of  OPM\u2019s annual reports to Congress. OPM\u2019s plans to use data in EHRI and  a shorter data call instrument could improve telework data accuracy.  However, OPM and agencies must also take steps to help ensure that  these annual reports include only accurate data or clearly explain why this  is not possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To support the consistent application of agency telework policy  throughout the agency, the Secretaries of the Departments of Education  and Labor and the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission  should implement controls to verify that supervisors have completed  telework training prior to entering into telework agreements with their  employees and that completion of this training is documented.", "To help ensure that telework agreements accurately reflect telework  participation, and to further ensure the accuracy of telework data reported  internally and externally, the Secretary of the Department of Labor, the  Administrator of the General Services Administration, and the Chair of the  Securities and Exchange Commission should require documentation of  regular or periodic reviews of all telework agreements in agency telework  policies.", "To improve the accuracy of telework data transmitted to OPM, the  Secretary of the Department of Labor should direct the Chief Human  Capital Officer to work with the Telework Managing Officer to develop and  implement a plan to modernize Labor\u2019s telework agreement tracking  system to enable more timely access to accurate telework data.", "To help ensure the employee eligibility data transmitted to OPM comport  with what OPM is required to report under the Telework Enhancement Act  of 2010 and accurately reflect the current number of employees eligible to  telework, the Secretary of the Department of Education should direct the  Telework Managing Officer to take the steps necessary to regularly  update employees\u2019 eligibility status.", "To provide additional guidance to agencies and encourage the elimination  of barriers to increased telework opportunities consistent with the act, and  to ensure the accuracy of telework information OPM annually reports to  Congress, the Director of OPM should: develop tools to help agencies assess and analyze persistent barriers  to telework, including managerial resistance, such as a survey or  other feedback mechanism; and  strengthen controls for reviewing, validating, and reporting telework  data in annual Status of Telework in the Federal Government reports.  Specifically, OPM should follow up with agency officials on data  outliers, including significant changes in year-to-year data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education, GSA, Labor, SEC, and  OPM for review and comment. We received written comments from  Education, GSA, SEC, and OPM which are reprinted in appendixes II, III,  IV and V, respectively. Education, Labor, and OPM also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as  appropriate. Labor also commented on the recommendations addressed  to it, which we summarize and discuss below.", "Education, GSA, and SEC agreed with the recommendations in our  report. GSA and SEC stated they are making changes to require a  periodic and documented review of telework agreements. Education and  SEC stated they will implement controls to help ensure supervisors  complete telework training before entering into telework agreements with  employees. Education also agreed to take steps necessary to regularly  update employees\u2019 eligibility status and report data that meet the criteria  in the act.", "Labor neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendations but  provided comments on the report\u2019s recommendations. Labor stated that  budgetary constraints have prevented it from employing an automated  telework agreement system, as we noted in the report. We recognize this  in our recommendation by stating Labor should modernize its telework  agreement tracking system to allow for more timely access to accurate  data, which can include changes other than implementing an automated  system. Labor also stated that it has controls to monitor manager  telework training and telework agreement review. We agree that Labor  takes steps to monitor manager training and has a process for regularly  reviewing telework agreements. However, these processes could be  strengthened by requiring additional documentation.", "OPM did not concur with the two recommendations directed to it. For the  first recommendation on creating tools to help agencies assess and  analyze persistent barriers to telework, OPM agreed with our assessment  of the value of such tools and their ability to help agencies increase  participation rates. However, OPM stated it has fulfilled its responsibilities  under the act through training, policy guidance, and tools for program  evaluation and management, and that, given limited resources, it is not in  a position to expand upon materials and tools for an area not required by  the act. We agree that OPM has provided resources to agencies to help  identify barriers to telework and are encouraged that it is developing  additional tools. However, we disagree with OPM\u2019s assertion that  developing tools to address persistent barriers is not related to internal  controls. Federal internal control standards state that to help ensure an  agency is meeting its objectives management should identify, analyze,  and respond to risks related to achieving objectives, such as by  addressing deviations from established policies. Barriers to telework  reflect a risk to an agency\u2019s ability to meet the goals they have  established for increasing telework participation, as directed in the act.  And as noted in our report, some managers\u2019 decisions to limit or deny  employees\u2019 ability to telework may be for reasons other than those  outlined in the agencies\u2019 policies, suggesting deviations from established  policy that should be addressed. Because agencies and OPM continue to  identify persistent barriers to telework participation, as did responses in  our focus groups and discussions with agency officials, we continue to  believe that OPM should play a key role in aiding agencies in assessing  and analyzing, not just identifying, barriers to telework participation.", "For the second recommendation, OPM said it recognizes the importance  of data accuracy and states it takes reasonable steps to follow up with  agencies to resolve possible reporting errors, but that agencies are  ultimately responsible for providing complete and accurate data. OPM  further states that the act does not obligate OPM to spend significant  resources to independently validate agency telework data. We agree that  OPM should not independently validate agency data, but OPM should  take the steps necessary to identify and explain data outliers and  limitations. Because OPM is the agency responsible for reporting telework  data, OPM should ensure its annual reports to Congress include a clear  discussion of data reliability limitations, as we have previously  recommended. Following up on data outliers and large year-to-year  changes can help OPM identify data errors that could be corrected by  agencies and provide OPM with the opportunity to discuss data limitations  with agencies. Including such information clearly in the annual telework  reports to Congress can make them more useful to Congress and to  others.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We also interviewed key OPM officials from  Employee Services and Senior Executive Service and Performance  Management as well as the Executive Director of the Chief Human  Capital Officers (CHCO) Council.", "To address all of our objectives, we selected the Department of Education  (Education), General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of  Labor (Labor), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as  case study agencies for our review. Because a case study approach does  not allow for generalizable results, we limited our case study agencies to  four to compare telework programs across agencies of varying sizes. We  selected these agencies using size and telework participation rates as  criteria. We reviewed OPM\u2019s 2014 Status of Telework in the Federal  Government Report to Congress (Fiscal Year 2013) and created a list of  all of the agencies that reported telework data that year. To ensure that  our case study agencies would have a sufficient number of active  teleworkers, we limited this list to agencies with more than 2,500  employees. Using data from OPM\u2019s report, the most recent available at  the time of our analysis, we compiled a list containing data on each  agency\u2019s number of employees, number of employees eligible to  telework, number of employees with telework agreements, percentage of  employees with telework agreements, and percentage of employees who  teleworked in fiscal year 2013. We also reviewed data from the 2015  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), the most recent data  available at the time of our analysis, and incorporated data on telework  frequency rates into our list of agencies. After building this universe of  agencies and their associated telework data, we applied 3 filters to the  list: agencies where the percent of employees eligible to telework is  greater than or equal to 50 percent;  the percent of eligible employees with telework agreements is greater  than or equal to 50 percent; and  the percent of employees teleworking at least once per week is  greater than or equal to 25 percent.", "These filters produced a list of seven agencies. To compare and contrast  telework programs of different sizes, we divided the remaining agencies  into 2 groups: 1 of agencies with more than 10,000 employees and the  other with fewer than 10,000 employees. We eliminated one large agency  because it was negotiating its telework program with relevant labor  unions, and had been the subject of recent reports on telework internal  controls. For the smaller agencies, we rank ordered the agencies by the  number of teleworkers as of February 2014, the most recent data  available across the agencies. These filters produced GSA and Labor as  the large agencies, and Education and SEC as the smaller agencies for  inclusion as our case study agencies.", "To address all of our objectives, we conducted a series of focus groups at  our four case study agencies with groups of supervisors of teleworkers  and groups of teleworkers. When discussing these focus groups  throughout the report, we use the word some to mean more than two but  fewer than six focus groups. To determine supervisor focus group  participants, the agencies sent us lists of all supervisors and the agency,  office, or division where they worked. We randomized the list using a  random number generator and sorted the list in rank order. To avoid  inviting individuals who work closely with each other to the focus groups,  we chose from the list the first individual from each agency, office, or  division, and created a list of alternates in the event the first individual  could not participate. We then confirmed with the agencies that these  supervisors on our invite and alternates lists met the following criteria: (1)  they were not senior executives and (2) they supervised at least one  employee with a regular telework agreement. We sent invitations to  participate in the focus groups to the first 10 individuals who met our  criteria. We then invited alternates for individuals who could not attend.  Each focus group had between 6 and 8 participants.", "To determine focus group participants for teleworkers, agencies sent us  lists of employees, which included, at a minimum, the employee\u2019s name,  location, and whether they had a telework agreement. To ensure we  could gather information from nonsupervisory employees, we removed  from the lists, as necessary, any individuals who were supervisors or  otherwise not covered by a collective bargaining unit. We also excluded  individuals from the Offices of Inspector General. We additionally  excluded individuals with only a situational telework agreement. We  randomized the list using a random number generator and sorted the lists  in rank order. Similar to supervisors, to avoid inviting individuals who work  closely together, we chose from the list the first individual from each  agency, office, or division. Also, to determine if employees similarly  experienced telework in the field as in headquarters, we created two lists  of potential focus group participants\u2014one for employees who work in  Washington, D.C., and one for employees who work in a regional or field  office. For field employees, we chose the first individual from each  location from the ranked list to participate. Because telework experiences  can be influenced by an employee\u2019s supervisor, we then requested from  the agencies the name of the supervisor for those on our preliminary  invitation list, and eliminated individuals from the invitation list if someone  higher on the list worked for the same supervisor. For Education, Labor,  and SEC, we held two focus groups for teleworkers, each with between  four and six participants. For GSA, due to scheduling difficulties, we held  one combined focus group of seven teleworkers from headquarters and  the field.", "To determine how case study agencies establish and monitor telework  eligibility and compliance with requirements and expectations of telework  agreements, we reviewed the act, OPM guidance, telework policies,  telework training materials, blank telework agreements, and collective  bargaining agreements. We interviewed agency officials responsible for  telework policy and program implementation, including the Telework  Managing Officer or the telework coordinator, to discuss telework policy,  program implementation, internal controls, and OPM guidance on  telework. We then compared agency policies to act requirements, OPM  guidance, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  to assess compliance. We discussed telework eligibility and notification at  our focus groups with teleworkers and discussed reasons for denying  telework agreement applications with supervisors. We also interviewed  OPM officials about OPM\u2019s role in providing telework guidance to federal  agencies.", "To determine how supervisors at case study agencies manage for results  in a telework environment and hold employees who routinely telework  accountable for achieving results, we reviewed requirements of the act  and agency policies, reviewed OPM and agency specific training  materials on telework and performance management, and discussed  agency performance management policy with case study agency officials.  We also asked supervisors participating in our focus groups what  strategies and resources they use to manage their teleworking  employees, and what steps they take to help ensure telework does not  diminish their employees\u2019 performance. We asked participants at our  teleworkers focus groups about how telework has affected their ability to  meet performance goals, how their supervisor holds them accountable for  achieving results while teleworking, and how the agency supports  telework. We also spoke with representatives from the unions that  represent employees at the four case study agencies to discuss any  concerns the unions have heard about telework.", "To assess the challenges the four case study agencies and OPM face in  collecting and reporting telework data, we reviewed our prior work on  OPM telework data reporting. We also reviewed OPM\u2019s Status of  Telework in the Federal Government Report to Congress (Fiscal Year  2013) and OPM\u2019s Status of Telework in the Federal Government Report  to Congress (Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015). We requested case study  agencies\u2019 original telework data call submissions to OPM for fiscal years  2013, 2014, and 2015, and compared these data to what OPM included  in the final reports to Congress to identify any discrepancies. To report  data on numbers of teleworkers and the average number of hours  employees telework per pay period, we analyzed telework data from each  of the case study agencies. We reviewed the data for outliers, reviewed  agency documentation on how the agencies enter and maintain telework  data, and interviewed agency officials. We determined these data to be  reliable for the purposes of reporting reported telework hours and the  number of individuals teleworking for a 9-month period between  September 2015 and June 2016. We interviewed OPM and case study  agency officials about the steps they take to collect, validate, and report  telework data, and any challenges they may face in doing so. We also  asked teleworkers in our focus groups how they record their telework  hours. In addition, we asked supervisors what challenges they may face  to ensuring these telework hours are recorded and reported accurately.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2015 to February  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
