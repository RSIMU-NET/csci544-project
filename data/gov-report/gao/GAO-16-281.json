The majority of wastewater from oil and gas production is injected into underground wells known as class II wells. These wells are regulated to protect drinking water sources under EPA's UIC class II well program and approved state class II programs. EPA oversees state programs, and EPA regions manage programs in states without approval.", "GAO was asked to review EPA's oversight of programs' inspection and enforcement information and activities. This report examines the extent to which EPA has collected inspection and enforcement information and conducted oversight activities needed to assess that class II programs protect underground sources of drinking water. GAO reviewed federal and state laws and regulations and EPA guidance and analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of significant violations. GAO interviewed EPA and state officials from programs in a nongeneralizable sample of eight states selected based on shale oil and gas regions, among other factors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not collected specific inspection and complete or consistent enforcement information, or consistently conducted oversight activities, to assess whether state and EPA-managed Underground Injection Control (UIC) class II programs are protecting underground sources of drinking water. EPA guidance calls for states and EPA regions to report certain information and for EPA to assess whether programs are effectively protecting underground sources of drinking water, but the agency does not. Specifically:", "EPA annually collects summary data from state and EPA-managed programs on the types of inspections they conduct. However, these data are not specific enough to determine the number of different types of inspections that states and EPA regions are to conduct to meet their annual goals. Such goals are specified at the well level (e.g., to inspect 100 percent of wells associated with emergency responses). Under federal internal control standards, managers are to compare actual performance to planned or expected results and analyze significant differences. Without well-specific data on inspections, EPA cannot assess whether state and EPA-managed programs are meeting annual inspection goals.", "EPA collects information on unresolved significant violations of state and EPA-managed programs to determine if the agency needs to take action to enforce applicable program requirements. However, GAO's analysis of a nongeneralizable sample of 93 significant violations for fiscal years 2008 through 2013 found that state and EPA-managed programs did not report data on such violations completely or consistently. For example, of 29 such violations that had not been enforced after 90 days as required, programs reported 7 to EPA. According to EPA and state officials, the cause was inconsistent interpretations of EPA's reporting guidance. EPA officials said they are aware that the data reported on such violations are not complete or consistent, but the agency has not clarified in guidance what data programs should report. Until it does so, EPA does not have reasonable assurance that it has the data needed to assess if it must take enforcement action.", "EPA has not consistently conducted oversight activities necessary to assess whether state and EPA-managed programs are protecting underground sources of drinking water. For example, GAO found in June 2014 that EPA does not consistently conduct oversight activities, such as annual on-site program evaluations. According to EPA guidance, such evaluations should include a review of permitting and inspection files or activities to assess whether the state is protecting underground water. In California, for example, EPA did not regularly review permitting, and in July 2014, after a state review of permitting, EPA determined that the program was out of compliance with state and EPA requirements. EPA officials said that they have few resources to oversee UIC class II programs, but EPA has not conducted a workforce analysis consistent with GAO's work on strategic human capital management to identify the resources needed for such oversight. Without conducting such an analysis, EPA will not be able identify the human capital or other resources needed to carry out oversight of the UIC class II programs to help ensure that they protect underground sources of drinking water."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, among other things, EPA require programs to report well-specific inspections data, clarify guidance on enforcement data reporting, and analyze the resources needed to oversee programs. EPA generally agreed with GAO's findings, but does not plan to require well-specific data and analyze needed resources. GAO continues to believe that EPA should take both actions to better assess if programs protect underground sources of drinking water."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 2000s, increased oil and gas production across the nation  has resulted in a corresponding increase in wastewater that must be  managed, reused, or disposed of properly, according to a June 2015  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) draft report. According to the  same report, the growth in domestic oil and gas production has also  raised concerns about potential effects to human health and the  environment, including the potential contamination of underground  drinking water sources by injecting wastewater associated with the  production of oil and gas. In particular, the hydraulic fracturing process\u2014 in which water, sand, and chemical additives are injected under high  pressure to create and maintain fractures in underground formations\u2014 allows oil and natural gas from unconventional sources, such as shales,  tight sandstones, and coalbed formations, to be developed and can  produce large volumes of wastewater. Underground wells used for  injecting wastewater and other fluids associated with the extraction of oil  and gas resources are known as class II injection wells. The fluids  injected into class II wells are composed mostly of saltwater and may  contain pollutants such as chlorides, hydrocarbons, and naturally  occurring radioactive materials originating from geologic formations  containing oil and gas.", "EPA and states regulate three types of class II wells associated with oil  and gas production: (1) enhanced recovery wells into which brine, water,  steam, carbon dioxide, or other fluids and gases are injected into oil- or  gas-bearing formations to increase the recovery of residual oil and gas;  (2) disposal wells into which brines and other fluids brought to the surface  during oil and gas production activities are injected for disposal; and (3)  storage wells into which liquid petroleum products are injected, generally  as part of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As of 2013, there were  over 176,000 class II injection wells in the United States, located in states  as geographically dispersed as California, New Mexico, Oklahoma,  Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. As the volume of wastewater  generated from oil and gas production has increased, the demand for  underground injection wells for disposal of fluids has increased,  particularly in states with limited injection capacity, such as Pennsylvania.  In addition, some operators have violated federal regulations and  disposed of fluids illegally, such as a Kentucky company that in 2013 pled  guilty to illegally injecting fluids into sinkholes and an unpermitted well.", "To protect underground sources of drinking water, class II injection wells  are subject to regulation by the Underground Injection Control (UIC)  program overseen by EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The act  includes provisions for states to request approval from EPA to manage  the class II program in their respective state boundaries. States with  approved programs have primary responsibility, or primacy, for managing  and enforcing their programs, and EPA has responsibility for managing  and enforcing programs in states without primacy. We refer to programs  managed by states as state programs and those managed by EPA  regional offices as EPA-managed programs. EPA has approved a total of  40 states (26 with class II wells) to manage their programs. Many of  these states were approved by EPA in the 1980s, soon after the  program\u2019s inception. An additional 10 states (7 with class II injection  wells) do not have program approval, and the programs in these states  are managed by five EPA regional offices. (See app. I for a list of state  programs and EPA-managed programs.)", "The Safe Drinking Water Act establishes general minimum requirements  for programs in each state. Applicants for a permit for underground  injection must satisfy the state that the injection will not endanger drinking  water sources, among other requirements. EPA and states rely on more  detailed regulatory and policy safeguards to prevent fluids from migrating  into aquifers that can be used as underground sources of drinking water.  These safeguards require well operators to meet technical standards for  constructing, operating, testing, and monitoring injection wells, among  other requirements. In addition, if certain conditions are met, aquifers can  be exempted from protection under the act and used for injection. An  aquifer may be exempted if (1) it does not currently serve as a source of  drinking water and (2) it will not in the future serve as a source of drinking  water. If the state has primacy, well operators may request an exemption  for injecting fluids into a particular aquifer or portion of an aquifer. The  state must submit a request for the aquifer exemption to EPA for review  and approval, and if EPA approves, operators may be permitted to inject  fluids into the aquifer.", "Given the increase in oil and gas production and wastewater disposal,  EPA\u2019s oversight and enforcement of the UIC class II program is important  to ensure that state and EPA-managed programs are protecting  underground sources of drinking water. In June 2014, we reported on  EPA and state roles, responsibilities, and resources for managing the  class II program; EPA and selected state safeguards to protect  underground sources of drinking water; EPA\u2019s oversight and enforcement  of class II programs; and the reliability of data to report on the class II  program nationwide. In our June 2014 report, we did not review EPA  oversight of state and EPA-managed inspections and enforcement  information and activities, which you requested that we review.", "This report examines EPA\u2019s UIC class II program to determine the extent  to which EPA has collected the inspection and enforcement information  needed, and conducted the oversight activities necessary, to assess that  state and EPA-managed programs are protecting underground sources of  drinking water.", "To perform this work, we reviewed and analyzed the Safe Drinking Water  Act and EPA regulations and guidance on the UIC class II program. We  interviewed EPA UIC program officials in the eight regional offices with  the highest number of class II wells. To understand the class II program  at the state level, we interviewed state officials and reviewed state  program documentation for the same sample of states from our June  2014 report on the UIC program. Specifically, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of eight states with class II programs. Two of  these states are managed by EPA regions\u2014Kentucky and  Pennsylvania\u2014and the remaining six\u2014California, Colorado, North  Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas\u2014are state programs. We selected  these states from the six shale oil and gas regions defined by the Energy  Information Administration. For each of the six oil and gas shale  regions, we selected at least one state that had among the highest  number of class II injection wells. In July 2014, after we issued our June  2014 report and before we started the work on this review, EPA  determined that one of the state programs in the eight states we  reviewed, California\u2019s class II program, was not in compliance with state  and EPA requirements. EPA Region 9 officials and California\u2019s UIC  program officials have since agreed to a plan to improve the California  program over the next several years. We interviewed EPA headquarters,  EPA Region 9, and California officials regarding the deficiencies in  California\u2019s program, the agreed-upon improvement plan, and EPA  oversight of California\u2019s progress. A summary of the deficiencies found by  EPA and California, and California\u2019s plans to improve its program, can be  found in appendix II. Because EPA determined in July 2014 that  California\u2019s program was not in compliance with state and EPA  requirements, we chose not to include California in our detailed analysis  of inspection and enforcement information from the states. Thus, the  results of our review of inspection and enforcement information reflect the  seven remaining states in our sample.", "To analyze the information EPA needs and oversight activities necessary  to assess whether state and EPA-managed programs are protecting  underground sources of drinking water, particularly inspection and  enforcement information, we reviewed EPA regulations and guidance and  obtained and analyzed data collected by EPA from the states and regions  on forms called 7520-3 and 7520-4 forms for fiscal years 2008 through  2013, the most recent years of data available when we began our audit  work. We interviewed EPA officials about the collection of these data and  determined that they were sufficiently reliable for purposes of reporting  data for individual states. To determine if EPA collects information it  needs on inspections, we used EPA\u2019s 1987 Underground Injection  Control Program Compliance Strategy for Primacy and Direct  Implementation Jurisdictions (Strategy), which lays out minimum  inspection goals that state and EPA-managed programs should set. We  then analyzed inspection data from 7520-3 forms for fiscal year 2013, the  most current data available, for the seven states to determine the extent  to which they provide information to assess inspection goals set by states  and EPA regions.", "To determine if EPA collects information it needs on enforcement actions,  we used EPA\u2019s Strategy, which directs states and EPA-managed  programs to ensure that timely and appropriate enforcement actions are  taken, and EPA\u2019s 1986 Reporting Requirements\u2014Underground Injection  Control Program Guidance, which provides guidance on what information  on violations and enforcement actions should be reported by state and  EPA-managed programs on 7520-4 forms. We then selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 134 notices of violation, from fiscal years  2008 through 2013 from the seven state and EPA-managed programs we  reviewed and compared the information collected on each violation and  any related enforcement action to the enforcement data provided to EPA  on the 7520-4 forms for that period. We selected a nongeneralizable  sample of at least six notices of violation in each of the seven states in  our sample. We selected violations on the basis of their significance, the  type of enforcement action taken, and the number of days from when the  operator was notified to when the violation was resolved, termed returning  to compliance with EPA and state requirements. We analyzed the number  of days that each of 93 significant violations (of 134) in our sample had  been open and compared this to the number of days (90) established by  EPA as timely for resolving significant violations; we also analyzed each  significant violation to determine if an appropriate enforcement action was  taken. The Strategy specifies the appropriate enforcement action for  significant violations as a formal enforcement action, which among other  things, is legally enforceable, explicitly requires the well owner to take  corrective action, and specifies a timetable for completion.", "Finally, to assess the oversight activities that EPA has conducted to  ensure that programs are protecting underground sources of drinking  water, we reviewed findings and recommendations from our June 2014  report and interviewed EPA officials on what the agency has done to  implement our recommendations.

Starting in 2007, EPA had been working to develop a voluntary national  UIC database to provide well-specific data from state and EPA-managed  programs; however, according to EPA officials in December 2015,  Montana was the only participating state program, and the agency plans  to complete the national database with Montana and the seven EPA- managed programs currently participating. EPA officials said that they  do not have well-specific information because they do not require it and  most state programs have not provided it voluntarily through the national  UIC database. However, EPA\u2019s MOA guidance says that EPA may  request and should be given access to all files necessary for evaluating  the administration of the state program. Until EPA requires and collects  well-specific data on inspections from state and EPA-managed programs,  including the types of inspections conducted at each well, when the  inspections were conducted, and the results of the inspections, the  agency cannot assess whether the programs are meeting their annual  inspection goals to protect underground sources of drinking water. EPA  officials said that EPA will also have access to another voluntary  database being compiled by the Department of Energy that contains  additional data from state programs on injection wells.

The  Strategy defines a timely and appropriate response taken by a state or  EPA-managed program as resolving the violation or initiating a formal  enforcement action within 90 days of the identification of the violation. To  help ensure that violations are addressed in a timely and appropriate way,  EPA\u2019s 1987 Strategy and 1986 Program Reporting guidance call for state  and EPA-managed programs to report information to EPA on significant  violations that were not resolved within 90 days of discovery and also did  not have a formal enforcement action taken against the well operator. The  act requires EPA to enforce state program requirements within 30 days  after the agency becomes aware that the state has not taken appropriate  enforcement action.", "However, our review of data collected by EPA on significant violations  demonstrated that EPA\u2019s ability to take action may be limited by  incomplete and inconsistent enforcement data reported by state and  EPA-managed programs. Specifically, our analysis of 93 significant  violations for fiscal years 2008 thru 2013 for the seven state and EPA- managed programs we reviewed found that there were 29 that were not  resolved within 90 days of operator notification and for which formal  action had not been taken within that time. According to the Strategy,  each of these violations should have been reported on the 7520-4 form by  the state to the appropriate EPA region or by the EPA-managed program  to EPA headquarters. However, our analysis of the 7520-4 form data  showed that state and EPA-managed programs reported 7 of these 29  violations to the agency. Table 2 shows the results of our analysis of the  7520-4 forms (see app. V for additional information on our analysis and  app. VI for the full list of violations and enforcement actions taken).", "According to EPA headquarters, regional, and state officials we  interviewed, state and EPA-managed programs used different  interpretations of the Strategy and Program Reporting guidance to fill out  the forms, resulting in incomplete, and potentially inconsistent,  information across the programs. EPA headquarters officials told us that  all significant violations that were not resolved within 90 days from the  date the violation was discovered should be reported on the 7520-4 form  quarterly until they are resolved, regardless of whether the program had  already initiated enforcement action against the well operator. However,  EPA\u2019s Strategy and Program Reporting guidance call for programs to  report, on the 7520-4 form, information on significant violations that (1)  were not resolved within 90 days from the date the violation was  discovered and (2) had not had a formal enforcement action taken  against the well operator. In addition, according to the Program Reporting  guidance, significant violations reported on the 7520-4 form should  continue to be reported quarterly on subsequent 7420-4 forms until they  are resolved. State and EPA officials we interviewed provided different  interpretations of what they were to put on the 7520-4 form, which would  result in some programs reporting significant violations and some not.  Consistent with EPA\u2019s Strategy and Program Reporting guidance, officials  we interviewed from Ohio and EPA Region 4 (Kentucky) told us that they  only report significant violations on the 7520-4 form that were not  resolved within 90 days and for which a formal enforcement action had  not been taken against the well operator. However, officials we  interviewed from North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, and EPA Region 3  (Pennsylvania), told us that they report all unresolved significant  violations regardless of whether they have taken a formal enforcement  action. According to the officials, the information that ultimately gets  reported on the 7520-4 form is based on a quarterly calculation of how  long the well has been out of compliance; however, according to the  officials, EPA only requires state and EPA-managed programs to submit  7520-4 forms to EPA semiannually. In addition, officials in North Dakota  and Oklahoma told us that they only report significant violations once and  not in subsequent quarters, even if the violations have not been resolved.", "EPA headquarters officials told us they are aware that the information  reported by states and EPA regions is not complete or consistent, but  they have not clarified, in guidance or otherwise, what information should  be reported.

EPA  regulations and guidance establish a process for EPA and its regions to  review and approve state programs, as well as changes to state  programs. Under its regulations, EPA can only enforce state program  requirements that it has incorporated into federal regulations through a  rulemaking process. Where it has not done so, EPA is not able to  enforce state program requirements if needed. In June 2014, we found  that EPA had not yet incorporated changes to some state program  requirements into federal regulations and therefore did not have the ability  to enforce these state program requirements if necessary. We concluded  that until it conducts a rulemaking to incorporate the backlog of state  program requirements and changes to state program requirements that  have been approved, EPA would not be able to enforce some state  program requirements, hindering its ability to protect underground  sources of drinking water. To ensure that EPA maintained enforcement  authority of state program requirements, we recommended that EPA  conduct a rulemaking to incorporate state program requirements, and  changes to state program requirements, into federal regulations. We also  recommended that at the same time, EPA evaluate and consider  alternative processes to more efficiently incorporate future changes to  state program requirements into federal regulations without a rulemaking.", "In comments responding to our June 2014 report, EPA disagreed with our  recommendation to conduct a rulemaking and said that a single  rulemaking would be impractical because the process would take many  years to complete and would still not ensure that all program changes  were incorporated into federal regulations, as other states could make  changes to their programs during this time. In lieu of a single  rulemaking, EPA said in its comments that it was conducting an ongoing  process of individual rulemakings to approve and codify state program  revisions in collaboration with states, EPA regions, and EPA\u2019s Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. However, as stated in our June  2014 report, according to an analysis conducted by EPA in 2010, EPA  estimated that it would take 2 to 3 years, dedicated EPA personnel, and  $150,000 in outside contractor support to identify, approve, and conduct a  single rulemaking to incorporate all state program changes made since  1991 into federal regulations. By EPA\u2019s own estimate, the targeted state- by-state approach will take much longer than a single rulemaking and will  face greater challenges with states continuing to make changes in the  interim, leaving EPA without the ability to enforce state programs to  protect underground sources of drinking water if needed. EPA provided  no evidence in its comments that individual rulemakings would be any  less costly or any more efficient than the approach it assessed in 2010.

According to EPA officials, regional  offices generally maintain the most comprehensive and up-to-date data  on aquifer exemption approvals. Since 2003, EPA has worked to compile  comprehensive information on aquifer exemptions, including data on the  aquifers\u2019 sizes and locations.

Instead, California discovered that it had  authorized injection into nonexempt aquifers. Specifically, EPA requested  additional information on aquifer exemptions from California in 2012 as a  part of EPA\u2019s review of historical data on aquifer exemptions nationwide.  At that time, the state reviewed supporting documentation for the aquifer  exemptions and the associated injection wells and determined that it had  permitted operators to inject into nonexempt aquifers that the state  believed were exempted in the 1980s, when EPA granted primacy to  California to manage the class II program.", "In July 2014, after identifying water supply wells in the vicinity of some of  these injection wells and informing EPA Region 9, California ordered  operators of those injection wells to cease injection into certain  nonexempt aquifers, and to submit data to California so the threat to  underground sources of drinking water and human health could be  assessed. In July 2014, as a result of this issue, EPA determined that  California\u2019s program was not in compliance with state and EPA  requirements and supported California\u2019s plan to review injection wells that  were permitted to inject into nonexempt aquifers. As of October 2015,  California had identified over 500 wells injecting into 11 nonexempt  aquifers with the potential to threaten underground sources of drinking  water, and 23 of those wells had been shut-in, or ceased injecting fluids.  In November 2015, California shut-in an additional 33 injection wells  injecting into nonexempt aquifers. As of October 2015, California officials  said that they are continuing to collect information on wells injecting into  nonexempt aquifers to determine if additional wells should be shut-in to  protect underground sources of drinking water and are working with EPA  Region 9 to collect additional information on aquifer exemptions to help  complete EPA\u2019s database.", "As of December 2015, EPA officials told us that the majority of aquifers in  its database of approved exemptions have complete size and location  data and that headquarters continues to collect information from the  regions and state programs to fill in the remaining data gaps and ensure  that the database is complete and accurate. The officials told us that for  this reason, it is unlikely that they will discover deficiencies in  recordkeeping for approved aquifer exemptions similar to those identified  in California.

In addition, the database only has  aquifer exemption data through 2011 and is missing data on aquifer  exemptions approved over the past 4 years. According to EPA officials,  the database is a headquarters-based spreadsheet and updates with new  approvals on aquifer exemptions will need to be collected from EPA  regions and entered manually. The officials also said that EPA will  complete the database using 2011 data and only plan to add updated  data if sufficient resources are available.

According to EPA\u2019s  Program Oversight guidance, EPA regions should perform at least one  on-site evaluation of each state program each year to assess whether the  state is managing the program consistent with state regulations, setting  program objectives consistent with national and regional program  priorities, and implementing recommendations from previous evaluations,  among other activities. According to the Program Oversight guidance,  annual on-site evaluations of state programs should also include a review  of permitting and inspection files or activities to assess whether the state  program is protecting underground sources of drinking water.

EPA  said that it is mindful of the need to think carefully about requiring  information from states, and it will continue to work with its state partners  to improve both the collection and the quality of the data currently  required and to expand EPA\u2019s access to additional state data.  Specifically, EPA stated that it had taken steps to address the gaps in the  summary data collected on 7520 forms identified in GAO\u2019s June 2014  report, including developing standard operating procedures for  submission and review of the data forms, and revising instructions to  increase consistency in reporting the data to EPA.

Specifically, EPA stated that the draft report  presents incomplete information as to which materials are held at the  EPA headquarters and regional levels, and the roles and objectives that  EPA headquarters and regions play regarding aquifer exemptions and the  use of data. EPA said that our statement that the agency does not have  sufficient information to oversee state and EPA-managed programs is  incorrect because its regions have the most comprehensive and current  data on aquifer exemptions as they conduct the final review of exemption  requests and must approve all exemptions. According to EPA, it initiated  the effort to collect data from the regional offices to better understand the  number, locations, and nature and quality of aquifers exempted by the  UIC program and expects to release a public data set by the end of 2016,  which will include data current through 2015 with the exception of Region  9\u2019s data for the State of California. EPA stated that it anticipates adding  Region 9's aquifer exemption data for California as the region works with  the state to clarify the boundaries of the agency's historic approvals and  takes action on the state's requests for new exemptions. Further, EPA  said it plans to update the data set annually and that the regions will  continue to hold the most current data. We commend EPA\u2019s efforts to  develop an up-to-date data set of aquifer exemptions and note that the  updated information is important for overseeing whether the regions have  current information on aquifer exemptions.

Specifically, EPA stated  that the form is a tool for obtaining important information used in  assessing enforcement activities and that providing guidance on the  7520-4 form could be valuable to improve the quality of information the  agency receives. EPA also said that the 7520 standard operating  procedures that it created in response to our June 2014 report reminds  reviewers that wells with significant violations for two or more quarters  should remain listed on the 7520-4 until the issue is resolved.  In addition,  EPA said that it will provide further materials to UIC data submitters to  improve completeness and consistency of the data that programs report  on the 7520-4 form within 6 months of this final report. As these standard  operating procedures have not yet been finalized, we have not assessed  them to determine whether they meet the intent of our recommendation.", "In response to our fourth recommendation that EPA should conduct a  workforce analysis to identify the resources it needs to conduct effective  program oversight, EPA agreed that oversight is an important aspect of  ensuring an effective UIC program, but stated that a workforce analysis  was not necessary to better assess the resources needed to oversee the  implementation of the UIC class II program. EPA stated that it is working  with program managers to evaluate the effectiveness of EPA\u2019s oversight  activities in response to our June 2014 report, and would expand the  evaluation to include elements of inspection and enforcement activities if  necessary. Upon completion of its evaluation, EPA said that it would look  to improve the effectiveness of state and EPA oversight of the UIC  programs, if needed. EPA may, for example, pilot a project to explore the  potential to ensure program implementation by use of remote  approaches, such as data collection, data analysis, targeting and priority  ranking, and public transparency, as a viable option for increased  oversight. While we recognize EPA\u2019s commitment to assess whether it  should expand its evaluation of oversight activities to include inspections  and enforcement, we still believe it is critical for EPA to identify the  resources necessary, including human capital resources, to oversee state  and EPA-managed programs and that without doing so, EPA may not  have reasonable assurance that it can effectively collect information or  conduct activities to ensure protection of underground sources of drinking  water.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Below is a summary of the deficiencies  identified in California\u2019s UIC class II program and the plans California and  EPA Region 9 agreed on to resolve these deficiencies, including actions  taken by EPA and California before and after the determination of  noncompliance in 2014.", "In 2011, EPA requested a third-party audit of the state\u2019s UIC class II  program. The audit made recommendations to improve California\u2019s  class II program, including recommendations regarding the program\u2019s  definition of underground sources of drinking water, area of review  calculations, well construction practices, inspection and enforcement  practices, and staff qualifications.", "In November 2012, the Division developed an action plan to address  each of the recommendations from EPA\u2019s audit. To address a number  of recommendations necessitating regulatory updates, the Division  committed to update its class II program regulations beginning in  2013.", "In response to an EPA inquiry initiated in 2012, California reviewed  program records to ensure that injection wells the state authorized  aligned with EPA-approved aquifer exemptions. In doing so, in 2014  the Division discovered that it authorized operators to inject class II  wastewater into 11 nonexempt aquifers in the vicinity of water supply  wells, and EPA determined that the program was not in compliance  with state and EPA requirements.", "In October 2015, the Division issued the first report from its Monitoring  and Compliance Unit, which was created in 2011. The report  identified a number of program deficiencies, including insufficient  staffing to address increasing regulatory workload and significant  remedial programmatic work; poor recordkeeping on mostly paper  forms and a lack of modern data tools and systems; outdated  regulations that in some cases do not address the modern oil and gas  extraction environment; inconsistent and understaffed program  leadership; insufficient breadth and depth of technical talent;  insufficient coordination among district and state offices; and lack of  consistent, regular, high-quality technical training.", "Division officials also identified deficiencies with the enforcement of class  II requirements. Division officials said that the state office receives  violation information from districts and is responsible for pursuing  enforcement actions against operators and collecting penalties assessed  by the Division. However, according to Division officials, California has  historically had difficulties enforcing regulations for both production and  class II wells in the state. In particular, the Division identified many  examples of enforcement actions that were not pursued and wells that  were not being returned to compliance in a timely manner. For example,  in 2010, the Division hired a contractor to review its accounts receivable  to identify outstanding penalties that the Division had not collected.  According to Division officials, there were over $5 million in unpaid  penalties that the Division had assessed but did not collect.

In letters between California  (the Division and the Board) and EPA, the three-agency group agreed to  a plan for the Division to shut down wells permitted to inject into  nonexempt aquifers and improve and modernize its UIC practices.  Specifically, the plan consists of four major components to be completed  concurrently:", "New regulations and program revisions. The Division determined  that many state regulations that govern underground injection control  are obsolete, deficient, or unable to address current industry practice.  According to agency documents, the Division plans to undertake a  series of rulemakings to improve California\u2019s regulatory framework to  address these issues, including isolation of injected fluids, quality of  water to be protected, well construction practices, cyclic steam  operations, project review, and idle well standards and testing. In  July 2015, the Division stated that it planned to update its class II  regulations in two phases, with the first phase starting with the  informal circulation of draft regulations in the fall of 2015 and the  second phase beginning in 2016.", "Well review and aquifer exemptions. The Division and the Board  have been systematically reviewing injection wells that may have  been permitted to inject into nonexempt aquifers. The Division has  proposed a schedule for reviewing and ceasing injection into these  aquifers. As of October 2015, the Division shut down 23 wells  injecting wastewater into underground sources of drinking water that  may have posed an immediate risk to waters of beneficial use. Over  the next 2 years, through 2017, according to agency documents, the  Division will review additional injection wells to determine whether  they should be shut down or continue operating. The Division is  collecting information from operators interested in pursuing  exemptions and will review each exemption application to determine  whether exemption criteria have been sufficiently met. If the Division  approves the aquifer exemption, it will forward it to EPA for review and  approval or disapproval. EPA has final authority to declare an aquifer  exempt. The Division has issued regulations to ensure that injection  activity ends by specified deadlines unless aquifer exemptions are  approved.", "Project-by-project review of injection project approvals.

To perform this work, we  reviewed and analyzed the Safe Drinking Water Act, and EPA regulations  and guidance applicable to the UIC class II program. We also interviewed  EPA UIC program officials in the eight regional offices with class II wells.  To understand the class II program at the state level, we interviewed state  officials and reviewed state program documentation for the same sample  of states from our June 2014 report on the UIC program. Specifically, we  selected a nongeneralizable sample of eight states with class II programs.  Two of these states are managed by EPA regions\u2014Kentucky and  Pennsylvania\u2014and the remaining six\u2014California, Colorado, North  Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas\u2014are managed under provisions of  the act that allow them to have primary responsibility to manage the  program in their states. We selected these states from the six shale oil  and gas regions defined by the Energy Information Administration. For  each of the six shale regions, we selected at least one state that had  among the highest number of class II injection wells.", "In July 2014, after we issued our June 2014 report and before we started  the work on this review, EPA determined that one of the programs in the  eight states we reviewed, California\u2019s class II program, was not in  compliance with state or EPA requirements. EPA Region 9 officials and  California\u2019s UIC program officials have since agreed to a plan to improve  the California program over the next several years. We interviewed EPA  headquarters, EPA Region 9, and California officials regarding the  deficiencies in California\u2019s program, the agreed-upon improvement plan,  and EPA oversight of California\u2019s progress. A summary of the deficiencies  found by EPA and California, and California\u2019s plans to improve its  program, can be found in appendix II. Because of the deficiencies in  California\u2019s program, we chose not to include California in our detailed  analysis of inspection and enforcement information from the states. Thus,  the results of our review of inspection and enforcement reflect the seven  states remaining in our sample. Because the sample is a  nongeneralizable sample, our results cannot be generalized to other  states but do provide detailed examples of EPA\u2019s and states\u2019  management of class II programs.", "To analyze whether EPA collects the information it needs to assess  whether state and EPA-managed programs are protecting underground  sources of drinking water, particularly inspection and enforcement  information, we first reviewed EPA regulations and guidance on UIC  inspections and enforcement to determine what information EPA needs to  assess the programs and their ability to protect underground sources of  drinking water. EPA\u2019s 1987 guidance document Underground Injection  Control Program Compliance Strategy for Primacy and Direct  Implementation Jurisdictions (Strategy) establishes minimum goals for  inspections of class II wells. We obtained and summarized inspections  data collected by EPA from each program we reviewed for fiscal year  2013, the most current year of data available at the beginning of this  review. The state and EPA-managed programs are directed to report  these data to EPA quarterly on the 7520-3 form. To assess the reliability  of these data, we interviewed EPA and state officials about their  processes for managing the data collected on the 7520-3 forms and  tested the data for completeness. We found that the data were not  comparable across states but were sufficiently reliable for reporting on a  state-by-state basis. To understand EPA\u2019s use of the data to assess state  and EPA-managed programs, we interviewed officials from EPA  headquarters about their use of the information to oversee EPA-managed  programs and from EPA regions about their oversight of inspections  conducted by state programs. We also interviewed selected state  program officials about how they manage class II inspections, and we  requested information on annual inspection goals and inspection  strategies. Similarly, we interviewed regional office staff responsible for  managing the programs in Kentucky and Pennsylvania about their  management of the class II programs in these states, including any  inspection goals and strategies they have.", "To analyze whether EPA has the enforcement information to assess  whether state and EPA-managed programs are protecting underground  sources of drinking water, we reviewed EPA\u2019s Strategy, which also  establishes enforcement expectations for both state and EPA-managed  programs. In particular, the Strategy identifies the need for state and  EPA-managed programs to conduct timely and appropriate enforcement  actions. Specifically, state and EPA-managed programs are expected to  resolve significant violations within 90 days of discovery or take a formal  enforcement action against the well operator. According to the Strategy, a  formal enforcement action, among other things, is legally enforceable,  explicitly requires the well owner to take corrective action, and specifies a  timetable for completion. Under the act, EPA is to intervene and take  enforcement action once it is notified that a violation has occurred and  that the state has not taken appropriate action after 30 days. Similarly,  EPA regions should take timely and appropriate enforcement actions in  states with EPA-managed programs. According to EPA\u2019s 1987 Reporting  Requirements\u2014Underground Injection Control Program Guidance  (Program Reporting), EPA uses the 7520-4 forms to evaluate the  timeliness and appropriateness of a state or EPA-managed program\u2019s  enforcement response; EPA regions receive 7520-4 forms from their state  programs, and EPA headquarters collects information on the 7520-4  forms from programs managed by EPA regions.", "We then assessed a sample of violations, using EPA\u2019s definition of timely  and appropriate resolution from its Strategy and Program Reporting  guidance, to determine if EPA receives information on individual  significant violations that may have the potential to threaten underground  sources of drinking water. We selected a nongeneralizable sample of 134  notices of violation, issued from 2008 through 2013 (the most recent  years of data available when we began our audit work), from the seven  state and EPA-programs we reviewed and compared the data to  enforcement data provided to EPA on the 7520-4 forms. We selected a  nongeneralizable sample of at least six notices of violation in each of the  seven states in our sample based on the significance of the violation; the  type of enforcement action taken; and the number of days between when  the operator was notified and when the violation was resolved, termed  returning to compliance with applicable requirements. We also obtained  the 7520-4 forms for fiscal years 2008 through 2013 to identify what  violations had been reported on these forms. We analyzed the number of  days that each significant violation in our sample had been open and  compared this to the number of days (90) established by EPA as timely.  We then analyzed each violation to determine if a formal action had been  taken. We identified 93 violations that were open for more than 90 days  and compared these to the information reported on the 7520-4 form by  the appropriate state. We then interviewed EPA, regional, and state  officials to determine how they reported the information on the 7520-4  form.", "Because our sample of violations is nongeneralizable, our results cannot  be generalized to other states and violations; however, they do provide  detailed information on the violations that should have been reported by  state and EPA-managed programs. To assess the reliability of the  violation and enforcement information we obtained, we interviewed EPA  headquarters officials about their processes for collecting and managing  the information and tested the information for completeness by looking for  missing information. We determined that the information from EPA\u2019s  reporting forms was reliable for purposes of reporting individual state  results.", "To analyze the activities EPA conducts to assess whether state and EPA- managed programs protect underground sources of drinking water, we  reviewed several EPA guidance documents that describe activities EPA is  to take to oversee state and EPA-managed programs. EPA\u2019s 1983  guidance document, Interim Guidance for Overview of the Underground  Injection Control Program, states that EPA is supposed to conduct annual  on-site evaluations of state and EPA-managed programs. EPA\u2019s UIC  regulations describe activities that EPA is supposed to conduct to ensure  that it can enforce state program requirements, if necessary. EPA\u2019s 1984  guidance, Guidance for Review and Approval of State Underground  Injection Control Programs and Revisions to Approved State Programs,  describes the activities that EPA is to conduct to review changes to state  program requirements.

To analyze the extent  to which EPA applied best practices for workforce planning and strategic  human capital management to the management of the UIC program, we  reviewed GAO reports specifying best practices for strategic human  capital management. We then interviewed EPA\u2019s headquarters officials  about EPA\u2019s efforts to apply those best practices to the UIC program.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In a 1987 document titled Underground  Injection Control Program Compliance Strategy for Primacy and Direct  Implementation Jurisdictions (Strategy), the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) provides guidance on the types of inspections and the  frequency at which they should be conducted. The types of inspections  include routine inspections, well construction inspections, mechanical  integrity tests witnessed, emergency and complaint response,  enforcement follow-up, and plugging and abandonment verification.", "According to the Strategy, the goal of an inspection program is to  determine that a well is in compliance with applicable requirements and to  detect any violations of those requirements. It directs programs to adopt  minimum priority standards for each type of inspection and gives the  programs discretion to consider additional priorities, such as  environmental risks, population risks, and well construction, when  determining which wells to inspect. The Strategy ranks inspection types,  including those for class II wells, by priority, as shown in table 4.", "The seven state and EPA-managed programs we reviewed establish  goals for each of the inspection types identified in the Strategy based on  program priorities and available inspection resources. Table 5 shows  state and EPA-managed program inspection goals by inspection type.  Some states have goals to inspect all of their wells monthly or quarterly.  For example, North Dakota program officials told us that their goal is to  conduct routine inspections at all class II injection wells monthly, and  Ohio has a goal of inspecting 100 percent of its wells quarterly, according  to program officials. Other programs we reviewed do not set specific  annual goals for individual types of well inspections. For example,  according to EPA Region 4 officials, EPA Region 4 has a goal of  conducting routine inspections of all of the class II wells in Kentucky at  least once every 5 years and does not set inspection goals for observing  well plugging and well construction. Some state and EPA program  officials told us that when states do not have the resources to inspect all  wells annually, type and frequency of inspections are prioritized based on  risk factors such as the operator\u2019s history of compliance with state or EPA  requirements or danger to the general public. For example, Oklahoma  officials told us that inspectors will inspect an operator more frequently if  the inspector determines the well operator is violating state requirements  and will also prioritize inspections in areas of the state where there is a  history of illegal disposal activity. Similarly, EPA Region 3 officials told us  that they do not set annual inspection goals by inspection type, but  prioritize inspections based on factors such as danger to the general  public, emergency response, and the availability of inspection staff.", "Generally, according to state officials, state inspection staff in the five  state programs we reviewed are responsible for inspecting both  production and class II injection wells in the state. According to state  officials, staff may inspect only class II or production wells or may inspect  both. For example, of the 47 staff members conducting inspections in  Ohio, 4 conduct inspections on class II wells full-time and 8 to 10 split  responsibilities between production and class II wells. Similarly,  inspection staff in EPA regions we reviewed are responsible for  inspecting all classes of injection wells managed by the region. For  example, according to EPA Region 4 officials, Region 4 has  approximately 3 program staff members and 2 contractors to conduct  inspections of all classes of injection wells in the region.", "State agencies and EPA regional offices responsible for managing or  overseeing programs in the seven states we selected vary in the  inventory of wells they manage and the staffing resources dedicated to  inspect those wells. For example, according to North Dakota officials,  North Dakota has 35 staff members to inspect 14,158 production and  class II injection wells in the state. According to Oklahoma officials,  Oklahoma has 62 staff members to inspect the state\u2019s almost 190,000  production and class II wells. EPA regions managing programs in states  we selected have comparatively fewer inspection staff to inspect the  injection wells they manage.

The  enforcement action taken can depend on a number of factors, including  the severity of the violation and its potential to contaminate underground  sources of drinking water. Our analysis of enforcement actions taken by  select state and EPA-managed programs found that the programs have  generally similar enforcement processes to respond to class II  Underground Injection Control (UIC) violations.", "A violation can be discovered a number of ways, including through an  inspection, administrative review of a well file, or reports by citizens or  others. According to EPA and state officials, the enforcement process  generally begins when program officials notify a well operator that the well  is in violation of applicable requirements. Six of the seven programs we  reviewed generally issue a written notice of the violation to the well  operator, but North Dakota program officials told us that they instead give  a verbal notification and then, depending on the severity of the violation,  will allow a 30-day grace period before initiating a formal enforcement  action. For the state and EPA-managed programs we reviewed, notices  of violation can include one or more violations in a single notice. If the  operator does not take action to resolve a significant violation\u2014that is,  return the well to compliance with all state and federal regulations\u2014in a  timely manner, EPA\u2019s 1987 Strategy directs state and EPA-managed  programs to take formal enforcement actions to ensure that compliance is  achieved. Formal enforcement actions can include the following:  Administrative orders. Administrative orders are legally enforceable  orders, the terms of which can either be dictated by the program or  negotiated with the well operator in violation (which may be referred to as  a consent order or consent agreement). Administrative orders may  enjoin the well operator from taking certain actions, may require the well  operator to take corrective action, and may impose monetary penalties.", "Civil judicial action. Civil judicial actions are lawsuits filed against an  operator that has failed to comply with, for example, statutory or  regulatory requirements or an administrative order. Civil actions are  generally taken when administrative enforcement actions have been  unsuccessful in achieving compliance and resolving the violation,  according to EPA officials.", "Criminal judicial action. A program may also refer a case to the criminal  justice system if an action is willfully committed. A criminal court  conviction can result in fines or imprisonment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement Tools Available to State and EPA-Managed Programs", "paragraphs": ["State and EPA-managed programs have various tools available to  facilitate a return to compliance with applicable requirements and deter  future violations.

Table 6 details the types of administrative, civil, and criminal  monetary penalty authority available at the state and federal levels for the  selected states in our review.", "While six of the seven programs we reviewed have the legal authority to  assess monetary penalties, some do not regularly use these authorities  for various reasons. For example, North Dakota\u2019s program has  administrative authority to assess a monetary penalty, but the state  prefers to employ a more cooperative approach to get operators to bring  wells back into compliance, according to North Dakota officials. According  to Colorado officials, Colorado\u2019s program has also historically employed a  cooperative approach, but the state recently revised its regulations to  require a more prescriptive approach to enforcement. Ohio program  officials told us that they do not have an administrative process for  assessing a monetary penalty, and the penalty must instead be pursued  through the civil judicial process. In turn, Ohio officials told us that they  consider the advantages and disadvantages of resolving a violation  through negotiated consent agreement before referring the case to the  state\u2019s attorney general to pursue civil penalties.", "Other tools available to selected state and EPA-managed programs to  enforce program requirements may include the following:  Well shut-in. Some programs we reviewed may temporarily close down a  well until a violation is resolved. For example, Oklahoma officials can  shut-in a well if an operator is out of compliance with its financial  assurance requirements.", "Pipeline severance. A program may also have the authority to sever an  operator\u2019s access to oil and gas pipelines. For example, if an operator  uses a well that has been shut-in for violations, Texas may take the  further step of refusing to renew certain documents the operator needs to  do business in the state. If the disposal well operator also has production  wells in the state, this would prevent the operator from producing oil and  gas. According to EPA officials, this can be an effective enforcement tool  given that a company\u2019s income is generated on the production side.", "Permit revocation or temporary suspension. A program may have the  authority to revoke or temporarily suspend existing UIC permits, thereby  making it illegal for an operator to continue injecting into a well or group of  wells covered under the permit. For example, North Dakota may revoke  permits after notice and hearing if the well operator fails to comply with  the terms and conditions of its permit or any applicable rule or law, and  the state may suspend permits for good cause.", "Moratorium on new or renewed permits. A program may be able to  refuse to issue new permits to an operator with a history of  noncompliance. For example, Oklahoma program officials can seek an  order denying a permit to an operator with an unsatisfactory compliance  history.", "Bond forfeiture. A program may require well operators to post a bond to  ensure compliance with requirements applicable to the well. If an operator  fails to comply with these terms, a state may be able to seize the bond to  cover the costs of returning the well to compliance.
