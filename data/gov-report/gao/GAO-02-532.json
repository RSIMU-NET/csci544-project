However, the greatest losses in capacity have come in rural counties. In all, 121 counties, most of them rural, have experienced a drop of more than 25 percent in the number of mammography machines in the last three years. Officials from 37 of these counties reported that the decrease had not had a measurable adverse effect on the availability of mammography services. By contrast, in 18 metropolitan counties that lost a smaller percentage of their total capacity, officials in half of the counties reported service disruptions. Officials from six other urban areas, including Houston and Los Angeles, reported that public health facilities serving low income women had long waiting times.

Based on  the Bureau of the Census\u2019 population projections, the number of women  age 40 and older who need mammography services will increase by more  than 1 million each year. Concerned about recent media reports of long  waiting times for appointments at some locations and closures of  mammography facilities due to financial difficulty in others, you asked us  to examine several capacity issues in more detail. Specifically, you asked  us to    determine if the nation\u2019s capacity to provide mammography services is  adequate to meet the growing need for these services, and  identify geographic areas where the capacity to perform mammography  services has decreased and assess the effect of these decreases on access  to services.", "To assess the adequacy of the nation\u2019s capacity, we compared the most  recent trend data on use of mammography services with the most recent  data on trends in facilities, equipment, and personnel available to deliver  these services. We generated data on utilization of services\u2014that is, the  number of mammograms provided\u2014from the Behavioral Risk Factor  Surveillance System, a data system administered by the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The most recent data available in  the system were for 2000. Within this database, we compared 1998 and  2000 screening rates for women age 40 and above and used these rates to  estimate changes in the number of women receiving mammography  services during these 2 years. To measure changes in the number of  facilities, machines, and radiologic technologists, we used the latest data  available from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency with  regulatory authority over mammography facilities. We compared data on  characteristics of facilities operating on October 1, 1998, with those  operating 3 years later on October 1, 2001. We analyzed these capacity  changes at the national, state, and county levels. Because data were not  available to measure the effect of changes in capacity on mammography  utilization rates at the county level, we selected 61 metropolitan and rural  geographic locations where FDA data or other reports showed a sizable  decrease in capacity and interviewed state and local officials to obtain  information on local conditions. In addition, we interviewed officials in  several professional organizations, such as the American College of  Radiology and the American Cancer Society, along with officials of FDA,  CDC, NCI, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

However, subsequent to the  Danish report and the NCI panel\u2019s statement, both NCI and the U.S  Preventive Services Task Force reiterated their recommendations for  regular mammography screening. While acknowledging the  methodological limitations in these trials, the U.S. Preventive Services  Task Force concluded that the flaws in these studies were unlikely to  negate the reasonable consistent and significant mortality reductions  observed in these trials.", "The effectiveness of mammography as a cancer detection technique is  directly tied to the quality of mammography procedures. Concerned about  the quality of mammography procedures provided by the nation\u2019s  mammography facilities, the Congress enacted the Mammography Quality  Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992, which imposed standards effective  October 1, 1994.", "FDA has major oversight responsibilities, including establishing quality  standards for mammography equipment and personnel and certifying and  inspecting each facility to ensure it provides quality services. For  mammography personnel, such as radiologic technologists and  interpreting physicians, FDA specifies detailed qualifications and  continuing training requirements. Mammography technologists are  required to be licensed by a state or certified by the American Registry of  Radiologic Technologists in general radiography, and meet additional  mammography-specific training and continuing education and experience  requirements. Similarly, FDA specifies that all interpreting physicians be  licensed in a state and certified in the specialty by an appropriate board,  such as the American Board of Radiology, and meet certain  mammography-specific medical training, as well as continuing education  and experience requirements.", "FDA collects detailed information about each facility when a facility is  initially certified. FDA has established a database that incorporates data  from the certification process and from its annual inspection program.

Beginning in 1991, Medicare provided coverage of annual mammography  screening for women beneficiaries. Medicare is administered by CMS.

During this same period, the total number of mammography facilities  decreased about 5 percent, indicating that facilities were consolidating or  becoming somewhat larger. The average number of mammograms  performed per machine increased slightly but was considerably below  estimates of full capacity.

These screening rate increases, coupled with the  growth of this population, have resulted in significant increases in the  number of mammograms provided each year. Based on CDC\u2019s data on  screening rates and Bureau of Census population data, we estimate that  the total number of mammograms received by women 40 and above  nationwide has increased nearly 15 percent, from about 35 million in 1998  to more than 40 million in 2000.", "These increases in mammography utilization extended across nearly every  state.

Using CDC\u2019s data on mammography  screening rates, Bureau of Census data on the population of women age 40  and older, and FDA\u2019s data on the number of machines, we computed the  average number of mammograms performed per machine. At the national  level, the average number of mammograms per machine was 2,759 in 1998.  While this average number of mammograms per machine had increased to  2,840 in 2001, it was still well under 4,000, the lower end range of  estimated full capacity.

Data from  ARRT show the rate of increase for certified mammography technologists  through 2000 has slowed down substantially in recent years.

As we did for the rural counties, we contacted state and  local officials and asked them to assess the impact of the loss of machines  on women\u2019s access to services. These officials reported wide variations in  availability of services. While no problems were reported in nine counties,  officials in the other nine counties reported a variety of problems. The  nine counties with problems are concentrated in five metropolitan areas\u2014 Baltimore, Boston, the District of Columbia, and San Antonio and Wichita  Falls, Texas. For example, officials in three counties surrounding the  Baltimore metropolitan area reported an average waiting time of up to   3 months for screening mammograms and 2 to 3 weeks for follow-up  diagnostic mammograms. Similarly, a survey conducted by Massachusetts  officials in April 2001 found that, in the Boston metropolitan area,  appointment waiting time for screening mammograms ranged from   1 to 20 weeks, depending on facilities. In the District of Columbia, officials  reported that the only facility available in one part of the city had up to an  8-week backlog of appointments, while the rest of the city generally did  not have significant problems.", "In addition to contacting these 18 counties, we also contacted state and  local officials to inquire about six other urban areas\u2014Buffalo, Chicago,  Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and Tallahassee\u2014where no significant  number of machines was lost but problems were cited by state and local  officials or media reports. Officials familiar with situations in these cities  reported that most of the problems were limited to certain facilities. For  example, an official in Buffalo said that one well-known facility there had  a 3-month waiting list for appointments while others could accommodate  appointments within 2 weeks. In Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles, long  waiting time problems were concentrated in public health facilities that  served low income populations. In New York and Tallahassee, long  waiting times of 5 to 6 months were reported in 2000, but our recent  interviews with officials found no significant problem. In almost all cases  where some problems were reported, officials said that women who  needed a diagnostic mammogram generally were able to get appointments  within 1 to 3 weeks.", "Several factors have contributed to the waiting time problems in the nine  metropolitan counties and the six urban areas that we identified. Among  the reasons provided by state and local officials were the following:    Demand for services grew while capacity declined. In the Baltimore area,  for example, officials said that a shortage of technologists and financial  difficulty caused many facilities to consolidate or shut down, resulting in a  net decrease in capacity, while the demand for services continued to grow.", "High demand for services at some facilities. In cities such as Buffalo,  Boston, Houston, and Los Angeles, where variation was more on a facility- by-facility basis, officials provided various reasons for the high demand at  some facilities. For example, such factors as facilities\u2019 reputations,  physicians\u2019 referral patterns, and large patient workload from public  assistance programs cause some facilities to have a large backlog of  appointments. Some women may experience waiting time problems  because they are restricted by insurance coverage as to where they can go  for services.", "Inability to meet FDA\u2019s quality requirements. Several officials told us that  many small facilities with old machines had shut down because they could  not meet FDA quality requirements. For example, an official from Los  Angeles said that one provider had shut down three mobile units during  the last 2 years because of quality problems.", "Temporary interruptions in availability. The waiting time problems may  also be caused by the closure of one or more large facilities\u2014a temporary  problem that often resolves itself when new facilities open or existing  facilities expand in the area. For example, lengthy waiting problems in  Tallahassee in 2000 were largely generated by the closure of one large  mammography facility but a local public assistance program official told  us in March 2002 that women in her program could get appointments  within 2 weeks as the result of a recent opening of one new facility.", "In addition to these factors, state and local officials also frequently raised  concerns about the adequacy of the Medicare reimbursement rate,  particularly in the high cost metropolitan areas. However, during the  course of our work, CMS implemented a statutory change to the method  for determining the Medicare reimbursement rate for screening  mammography.

If this reversal occurs, more  personnel shortage problems could arise in the future.", "Some instances of long waiting times for services are occurring.  Consolidation of facilities and increases in demand can create a strain on  service availability in specific communities.
