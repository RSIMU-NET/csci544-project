Further, agencies were not routinely assessing operational systems to determine if they were duplicative. GAO recommended that OMB require federal agencies to report the steps they were taking to ensure that their IT investments were not duplicative as part of their annual budget and IT investment submissions. OMB agreed with the recommendation.", "In addition, GAO reported on potentially duplicative investments at selected federal agencies. More specifically, although the Departments of Defense and Energy used various investment review processes to identify duplicative investments, GAO found that 37 of its sample of 810 investments were potentially duplicative. These investments accounted for about $1.2 billion in total IT spending for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. For example, GAO identified four Department of the Navy personnel assignment investments--one system for officers, one for enlisted personnel, one for reservists, and a general assignment system--each of which is responsible for managing similar functions. GAO recommended that the agencies report on the progress of efforts to identify and eliminate duplication, where appropriate; the agencies agreed with the recommendations.", "In part to address duplicative IT investments, in March 2012 OMB launched PortfolioStat. Specifically, PortfolioStat is designed to assist agencies in assessing the current maturity of their IT portfolio management process, making decisions on eliminating duplication, and moving to shared solutions in order to maximize the return on IT investments across the portfolio. In March 2013, OMB reported that through this effort, agencies had identified and committed to nearly 100 opportunities to consolidate or eliminate commodity IT investments. OMB also believes that PortfolioStat may save the government $2.5 billion by 2015. GAO has ongoing work looking at PortfolioStat, including determining whether agencies are completing key actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has issued numerous recommendations to OMB and selected agencies to utilize existing transparency mechanisms and report the steps taken to avoid making duplicative investments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss duplicative information  technology (IT) investments and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) PortfolioStat initiative.

However, according to OMB, despite spending more  than $600 billion on IT over the past decade, the federal government has  achieved little of the productivity improvements that private industry has  realized from IT.Too often, federal IT projects run over budget, behind  schedule, or fail to deliver promised functionality. In combating this  problem, proper oversight is critical. Both OMB and federal agencies have  key roles and responsibilities for overseeing IT investment management.  OMB is responsible for working with agencies to ensure investments are  appropriately planned and justified. Additionally, each year, OMB and  federal agencies work together to determine how much the government  plans to spend on IT projects and how these funds are to be allocated. As  reported to OMB, federal agencies plan to spend more than $82 billion on  IT investments in fiscal year 2014, which is the total expenditure for not  only acquiring such investments, but also to operate and maintain them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opportunities to Reduce Duplication and Achieve Cost Savings Exist in Critical IT-related Areas", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, we have reported that overlap and  fragmentation among government programs or activities could be  harbingers of unnecessary duplication.of duplication, overlap, or fragmentation could potentially save billions of  tax dollars annually and help agencies provide more efficient and  effective services.

Given the importance of transparency, oversight, and  management of the government\u2019s IT investments, in June 2009 OMB  established a public web site, referred to as the IT Dashboard, that  provides detailed information on approximately 700 major IT  investments at 27 federal agencies, including ratings of their  performance against cost and schedule targets. The public  dissemination of this information is intended to allow OMB; other  oversight bodies, including Congress; and the general public to hold  agencies accountable for results and performance. As of August  2012, 190 of the federal government\u2019s approximately 700 major IT  investments\u2014totaling almost $12.5 billion\u2014were in need of  management attention.", "Federal data centers. As federal agencies have modernized their  operations, put more of their services online, and increased their  information security profiles, they have demanded more computing  power and data storage resources. According to OMB, the number of  federal data centers grew from 432 in 1998 to more than 2,000 in  2010. The growth in the number of federal data centers, many offering  similar services and resources, has resulted in overlap and duplication  among the centers. In addition, according to OMB, in August 2009 the  average utilization rate for servers ranged from 5 percent to 15  percent.", "IT investment management. OMB and agencies need to address  potentially duplicative IT investments to avoid investing in  unnecessary systems. In fiscal year 2011, there were approximately  7,200 reported investments (includes major and nonmajor  investments) totaling at least $79 billion. The Department of Defense  (Defense) reported the largest number of IT investments (2,383  investments at $37 billion), followed by the Department of Energy  (Energy) (876 investments and $2 billion).", "Geospatial investments. The federal government collects, maintains,  and uses geospatial information\u2014information linked to specific  geographic locations\u2014to help in decision making and to support  many functions, including national security, law enforcement, health  care, and environmental protection. Many activities, such as  maintaining roads and responding to natural disasters\u2014floods,  hurricanes, and fires\u2014can depend on critical analysis of geospatial  information. Multiple federal agencies may provide services at the  same geographic locations and may independently collect similar  geospatial information about those locations. In August 2012, the  Department of the Interior estimated that the federal government  invests billions of dollars in geospatial data annually and reported that  duplication among investments is common. Better coordination  among these agencies could help reduce duplication of geospatial  investments and provide the opportunity for potential savings of  millions of dollars.", "Cloud computing. As an emerging approach to delivering IT services,  cloud computing provides on-demand access to a shared pool of  scalable computing resources. According to OMB, cloud computing  has the potential to address IT inefficiencies by providing services  both more quickly and at a lower cost. OMB further noted that IT  services costing billions of dollars annually could potentially be  migrated to cloud computing. Accordingly, agencies have reported  saving millions of dollars from implementing cloud-based solutions. In  particular, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that  its implementation of enterprise content delivery services avoids an  estimated $5 million in costs annually.", "Enterprise architecture.

Subsequently, OMB empowered agency CIOs to hold  their own TechStat sessions within their respective agencies. As of  April 2013, OMB reported that it had led 79 sessions that resulted in  improvements to or termination of IT investments with performance  problems.

Specifically, the agency had  executed 30 of the 38 key practices identified by GAO\u2019s Information  Technology Investment Management frameworksuccessful IT investment management, including all the practices needed  to provide investment oversight and capture investment information. For   as foundational for  instance, IRS had defined and implemented a tiered governance structure  to oversee its projects and had several mechanisms for the boards to  regularly review IT investments\u2019 performance. However, we reported that,  despite these strengths, IRS could improve its investment management  process in two key areas. First, IRS did not have an enterprisewide IT  investment board with sufficient representation from IT and business units  that was responsible for the entire investment management process, and  as a result may not have been optimizing its decision-making process.  Second, IRS did not have a process, including defined criteria, for  reselecting (i.e., deciding whether to continue funding) ongoing projects.  We concluded that, given the size of its IT budget, IRS could be spending  millions of dollars with no assurance that the funds are being used wisely.

Instead, OMB stated that all cost savings  goals previously associated with the Federal Data Center Consolidation  Initiative would be integrated into broader agency efforts to reshape their  IT portfolios, but did not provide a revised savings estimate. We concluded that the lack of a new cost savings goal would limit OMB\u2019s  ability to determine whether or not the new combined initiative is on  course toward achieving its planned objectives.
