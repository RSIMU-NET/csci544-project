GAO reviewed approval documents for new, extended, or amended section 1115 demonstrations approved by HHS in all 25 states with approvals between June 2012 and October 2013, and interviewed HHS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authorized expenditures not otherwise allowed under Medicaid for a range of coverage-related purposes. HHS approved expenditure authorities to expand coverage to previously uncovered populations in most of the 25 states' demonstrations that GAO reviewed; however, it also modified existing expenditure authorities to end or limit coverage under states' demonstrations as new coverage became available in 2014 under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).", "In the 25 reviewed states, HHS approved expenditure authorities for a broad range of purposes beyond Medicaid coverage. Two types of noncoverage-related expenditure authorities were significant in terms of approved spending amounts. In 5 states, HHS approved expenditure authorities allowing the states to spend $9.5 billion in Medicaid funding during their current demonstration approval periods (about 2 to 5 years) to support about 150 state programs that would not otherwise have been eligible for federal Medicaid funding. The state programs included those providing health services, insurance subsidies, and workforce training. They were operated or funded by a wide range of state agencies, such as state departments of mental health, aging, and developmental disabilities that may be receiving non-Medicaid federal grants and funds. HHS also approved expenditure authorities in 8 states allowing states to spend more than $26 billion during their current demonstration approval periods (about 15 months to over 5 years) for new types of supplemental payments to hospitals and other providers through capped funding pools for a range of purposes, which included payments to incentivize delivery system or infrastructure improvements.", "Although section 1115 of the Social Security Act provides HHS with broad authority to approve expenditure authorities that, in the Secretary's judgment, are likely to promote Medicaid objectives, HHS has not issued specific criteria for making these determinations. Further, HHS's approval documents are not always clear as to what, precisely, approved expenditures are for and how they will promote Medicaid objectives. For example, HHS's approvals in three states authorizing the use of federal Medicaid funds for more than half of the state programs GAO reviewed lacked clear information on how the programs would promote Medicaid objectives, such as how they would benefit low-income populations. In addition, HHS's approvals authorizing funding pools for incentive payments did not always provide clear explanations of how payments to hospitals would promote Medicaid objectives. Finally, approval documentation for some but not all approvals provided assurances that Medicaid funds would not be used for purposes addressed by other federal funding streams. Without clear criteria for assessing how proposed expenditure authorities states are seeking will promote Medicaid objectives, and without clear documentation of the application of those criteria, the bases for HHS's decisions involving tens of billions of Medicaid dollars are not transparent to Congress, states, or the public.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS partially concurred with the recommendation on issuing criteria, listing the general criteria it uses.

Under the  program, states claim federal matching funds for Medicaid expenditures  from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which  oversees the program at the federal level. Section 1115 of the Social  Security Act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  waive certain federal Medicaid requirements and allow costs that would  not otherwise be eligible for federal matching funds for experimental, pilot,  or demonstration projects that, in the Secretary\u2019s judgment, are likely to  assist in promoting Medicaid objectives.approved in these section 1115 demonstrations allow states to receive   Expenditure authorities  federal funds for costs that would not otherwise be matchable under  Medicaid. The demonstrations, including their associated expenditure  authorities, provide a way for states to test and evaluate new approaches  for delivering Medicaid services. Section 1115 demonstrations account for  a significant and growing proportion of federal Medicaid expenditures. In  fiscal year 2014, section 1115 demonstrations accounted for close to one- third of total Medicaid expenditures.", "Expenditure authorities approved in section 1115 demonstrations can  allow states to extend Medicaid coverage to populations or services that  would not otherwise be eligible under traditional Medicaid programs. For  example, an approved expenditure authority might allow a state to claim  federal matching funds for coverage of adults who would not otherwise  qualify under Medicaid eligibility criteria, or to alter the state\u2019s Medicaid  benefit package for certain covered populations, for example, by covering  services that otherwise would not be eligible for federal matching funds.  Beyond expanding Medicaid coverage to populations or benefits not  covered under traditional Medicaid, HHS has also approved expenditure  authorities for a variety of other purposes. For example, we previously  reported on states that had obtained approval under their section 1115  demonstrations to claim federal matching funds for supplemental  payments made to providers to help cover their uncompensated care  costs.", "We have had long-standing concerns with HHS\u2019s policy, process, and  criteria for reviewing and approving Medicaid section 1115  demonstrations. These concerns have centered on HHS\u2019s implementation  of its policy requiring that section 1115 demonstrations be budget-neutral  to the federal government, that is, that the federal government\u2019s  expenditures under a state\u2019s Medicaid program with a demonstration  should be no higher than they would have been without the  demonstration. The budget neutrality requirement applies to all costs  under the demonstration, including those permitted under expenditure  authorities. In several reports issued between 2002 and 2013, we  reported that by not following its own budget neutrality policy and not  providing clear support for its decisions to fund certain demonstrations,  HHS approved spending limits that were billions of dollars higher than  what the federal spending would have been if the states\u2019 existing  Medicaid programs had continued. While the budget neutrality  requirement conceptually sets a limit on costs authorized under  expenditure authorities, our concerns about HHS\u2019s ability to ensure that  demonstrations remain budget neutral provide reason to examine the  authorities approved.", "Given the potential for increasing federal Medicaid spending through  Medicaid demonstrations, you asked us for information on the  expenditure authorities in demonstrations that HHS has recently  approved. For recently approved expenditure authorities in new,  amended, or extended demonstrations, this report examines   (1) expenditure authorities for purposes related to Medicaid coverage;   (2) expenditure authorities for purposes other than Medicaid coverage;  and (3) the criteria HHS uses to determine whether expenditure  authorities for purposes other than Medicaid coverage are likely to  promote Medicaid\u2019s objectives and how the agency documents the basis  for its approvals.", "To examine expenditure authorities approved for purposes related to  Medicaid coverage and other purposes, we reviewed new section 1115  demonstrations, as well as extensions or amendments to existing  demonstrations, approved by HHS from June 2012 through mid-October  2013, to ensure we captured the most recent approvals available at the  time we implemented our review. Specifically, using HHS\u2019s online  database of approved section 1115 demonstrations, we identified a list of  demonstrations that included approved expenditure authorities and asked  HHS to confirm this list. We also asked HHS for information on any  additional demonstrations that the agency had approved within that time.  Through this process we identified 25 states that received approval for  new demonstrations, extensions of expiring demonstrations, or  amendments to ongoing demonstrations during our review period. For  each such approval, we examined the list of expenditure authorities and  the demonstration\u2019s relevant special terms and conditions, which set forth  HHS\u2019s conditions and limitations on the expenditure authorities. For new  and extended demonstrations, we included all expenditure authorities  listed in the demonstrations in our scope; for amendments to ongoing  demonstrations, we included any new or modified expenditure authorities  in our scope. We did not review any approvals issued prior to June  2012, even if they pertained to ongoing demonstrations. Once we  identified all the new and modified expenditure authorities approved by  HHS, we categorized them as either relating to Medicaid coverage, such  as those allowing states to cover new populations, or relating to other  purposes, such as those allowing states to receive federal matching funds  for state programs, that is, programs that were primarily funded by the  state before the demonstration. For the expenditure authorities that  allowed states to claim funds for state programs, we developed a list of  the specific state programs using information in the approval documents,  which HHS verified. We also identified any spending caps associated with  certain expenditure authorities to the extent that information was  available. To supplement our document review, we interviewed HHS  officials and obtained additional information and documentation as  needed, such as prior approval documents, to discern whether  expenditure authorities in our review were new or were extensions or  modifications of existing expenditure authorities.", "To examine the criteria HHS uses to approve expenditure authorities for  purposes other than Medicaid coverage and how the agency documents  that the expenditures would likely further Medicaid program objectives,  we reviewed expenditure authorities and relevant special terms and  conditions for the demonstrations, interviewed HHS officials, and obtained  additional documentation from HHS to identify the criteria used for  approval and how the department documented that states\u2019 1115  demonstrations met such criteria. Our work focused on an analysis of  HHS\u2019s approvals of demonstrations and did not examine the extent to  which states spent the funds that were approved.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2013 to April 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, states generally must  cover certain \u201cmandatory\u201d populations and benefits, such as low-income  children and pregnant women and inpatient and outpatient hospital  services, but they also have the option of covering \u201coptional\u201d categories of  individuals and benefits such as children with higher family incomes.

In addition  to payments for covered services, states often make Medicaid  supplemental payments to providers, which are typically lump sum  payments that are separate from and in addition to payments made to  providers using regular Medicaid payment rates. One type of  supplemental payment states may make to hospitals is Disproportionate  Share Hospital (DSH) payments. Congress created the DSH program to  help hospitals serving Medicaid and uninsured patients offset their  uncompensated care costs, within facility-specific and state-specific caps,  or limits. States may also make other supplemental payments under their  state plan, sometimes referred to as \u201cUpper Payment Limit (UPL)  payments,\u201d to providers such as hospitals and nursing homes.

Twelve of the 20  states had covered low-income adults not eligible for Medicaid prior to  2014 under demonstrations and then had opted to expand Medicaid  coverage to low-income individuals starting January 1, 2014, as allowed  under PPACA.

For example, while Vermont\u2019s  demonstration is effective until December 2016, the state was approved  to end premium assistance for employer-sponsored insurance on  December 31, 2013, for several different populations. Idaho received approval to offer premium assistance for individuals with incomes above  100 percent of the FPL through December 31, 2013, after which time  these individuals can purchase coverage through the exchange and may  be eligible for federal subsidies for this coverage if they meet certain  criteria.

In our view, the criteria HHS uses for approving  expenditure authorities for state programs and funding pools would be  subject to such a communication requirement. However, HHS officials  informed us that the agency has not communicated specific criteria for  assessing these expenditure authorities. For example, HHS\u2019s website  identifies different policy approaches that states may seek to test through  demonstrations\u2014such as the use of innovative service delivery systems  to improve care, increase efficiency, and reduce costs\u2014but does not  specify how HHS will evaluate states\u2019 proposals to determine whether the  proposed demonstration expenditures are likely to promote Medicaid  objectives. In particular, HHS officials said that they have not issued  specific written criteria that by themselves would require HHS to approve  or disapprove expenditure authorities for specific state programs or  funding pools. HHS officials also told us that for a demonstration to be  approved, its goals and purposes must provide an important benefit to the  Medicaid program, but they did not provide more explicit criteria for  determining whether approved demonstration expenditures would provide  an important benefit or promote Medicaid objectives.", "In the absence of explicit, written criteria, HHS officials described using  other approaches for assessing expenditure authorities for state  programs and funding pools for alignment with Medicaid objectives. HHS  officials said that HHS considers each proposed demonstration on its own  merits. Further, HHS officials said they consider how the programs or  pools relate to and are connected with overall Medicaid program  objectives and other aspects of the demonstration. In assessing  expenditure authorities for state programs previously funded by the  states, HHS officials said they consider two criteria. First, HHS considers  whether the proposal supports a compelling demonstration purpose.  Second, HHS considers how the proposed state programs are suitable  candidates for federal participation that align with the objectives of the  Medicaid statute. HHS officials said they have told states that HHS is less  open to approving Medicaid matching funds for state programs in certain  categories, such as prisons and corrections, bricks and mortar, and debt  relief or restructuring, although at least one state received approval for a  program that builds housing for the homeless. HHS officials said that  funding pools for uncompensated care must provide necessary support to  providers whose continued operation and participation are essential to the  delivery of health care to low-income populations. Officials also said that  funding pools for incentive payments are assessed in terms of the health  care quality improvement and system redesign objectives proposed, their  relevance to Medicaid beneficiaries, the inclusion of the most appropriate  providers, and whether the incentives are appropriate. In discussing why  HHS has not made these considerations public, HHS officials said that it  is not in the agency\u2019s interest to issue guidelines that might limit its  flexibility in determining which demonstrations promote Medicaid  objectives. However, without such guidance, the rationale for the  agency\u2019s approvals of expenditure authorities is not transparent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approval Documents Did Not Always Specify What Expenditures Were for and How They Would Promote Medicaid Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Demonstration approval documents in the states we reviewed with  expenditure authorities for state programs or funding pools did not  consistently include information indicating what, specifically, the approved  expenditures were for and, therefore, how they would likely promote  Medicaid objectives. Federal standards for internal control provide that all  decisions, such as demonstration approvals, must be clearly documented  and such documentation should be promptly and accurately recorded and  available for review.", "Among the five states with approved expenditure authorities for state  programs, two had approvals that included detailed information about the  programs\u2014including program descriptions and target populations\u2014in  what the agency refers to as \u201cclaiming protocols.\u201d HHS officials explained  that claiming protocols for state programs outline the methods by which  the state will identify appropriate expenditures and other revenues  supporting the programs. HHS required the two states (California and  Oregon) to submit and receive approval for the claiming protocols as a  condition for claiming federal Medicaid matching funds. It included the  claiming protocols as attachments to the special terms and conditions of  the states\u2019 approvals, which lay out the state\u2019s obligations under the  demonstration. The information provided in the claiming protocols can  help explain how the programs may promote Medicaid objectives.  However, even when claiming protocols were included, HHS\u2019s basis for  approving expenditure authorities for some state programs was not clear.  For example, one state received approval for an expenditure authority for  a state program that issues licenses and approves certifications of  hospitals and certain other providers in the state. The state\u2019s claiming  protocol delineated the program\u2019s mission and funding limits but did not  explicitly address how the program related to the purposes of the  demonstration or to Medicaid objectives.", "The approvals for the other three states (Massachusetts, New York, and  Vermont), authorizing nearly half of the state programs in our review, did  not include claiming protocols for most state programs and otherwise  lacked clear information on how the state programs would promote  Medicaid objectives, such as how they would benefit low-income  populations. Several state programs approved for federal Medicaid  funds in these states appeared, on their face, to be only tangentially  related to improving health coverage for low-income individuals and  lacked documentation explaining how their approval was likely to promote  Medicaid objectives. For example, among the programs approved were a  program that funds insurance for fishermen and their families at a  reduced rate; a program that constructs supportive housing for the  homeless; and a program that recruits and aims to retain health care  workers. Overall, state programs that were approved for federal Medicaid  funds appeared to be wide ranging in nature. Table 4 shows the state  programs approved by HHS during our review period, which were  generally listed by program name in the special terms and conditions of  each state\u2019s approval, but often without any further detailed information.", "HHS officials stated that, beginning in 2012, the agency required all  states to develop claiming protocols for state programs with more-specific  information on their purposes. In its approval of amendments to New  York\u2019s demonstration in 2013, HHS required the state to develop a  claiming protocol for 20 new state programs but did not require a claiming  protocol for any of the 26 existing state programs approved for continued  funding. Similarly, in its 2013 approval of amendments to  Massachusetts\u2019s demonstration, HHS did not require the state to submit a  claiming protocol for 49 existing state programs. In the case of Vermont,  HHS officials said that a claiming protocol was not needed to support  funding for one program because it was modeled closely on a previously  approved demonstration program. HHS officials also said that during the  time of our review, they began requesting that states proposing that  Medicaid cover certain state programs under demonstration expenditure  authorities complete a spreadsheet tool that, among other things, helps to  identify and exclude the costs of services for which Medicaid should  already be paying.", "As with approvals of expenditure authorities for state programs, HHS\u2019s  approvals of expenditure authorities for funding pools also did not  consistently document how expenditures would likely promote Medicaid  objectives. The approvals of incentive payment funding pools we  reviewed (California, Kansas, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Texas)  established a structure for planning, reporting on, and getting paid for  general, system-wide improvements\u2014for example, increasing primary  care capacity or lowering admission rates for certain diseases\u2014but most  provided little or no detail on how the initiatives related to Medicaid  objectives, such as their potential impact on Medicaid beneficiaries or  low-income populations. One exception is New Mexico, which was  required to select outcome measures that reflected areas of high need for  Medicaid and uninsured patients. Further, the criteria for selecting  providers eligible to participate in incentive pools were not apparent in  most of the approvals we reviewed. HHS officials said that the hospitals  that are identified as eligible for incentive payments are those that are  expected to have the most impact on efficiency and quality of care for  Medicaid populations and that often the hospitals selected are those that  have historically received the most supplemental payments, which are  generally allocated to providers serving Medicaid populations. However,  such selection criteria were not apparent in HHS\u2019s approvals, which listed  eligible providers but with no additional information about their role in  providing services to Medicaid populations. For example, none of the  terms and conditions for the five states\u2019 demonstrations established a  minimum threshold of Medicaid or low-income patient volume as the  basis for participation; however, three states\u2019 approvals (New Jersey,  New Mexico, and Texas) required that the payment allocations be  weighted in part on measures of Medicaid or low-income patient  workload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approval Documents Did Not Always Specify How States Were to Avoid Duplication with Other Sources of Federal Funding", "paragraphs": ["HHS\u2019s approvals also varied in the extent to which they provided  assurances that Medicaid funding approved for state programs would be  claimed appropriately and would not duplicate any other potential sources  of non-Medicaid federal funding. In two of the five states reviewed\u2014 California and Oregon\u2014the claiming protocols attached to the terms and  conditions clearly identified all other federal and nonfederal funding  sources for each state program. These protocols also included specific  instructions on how the states should \u201coffset\u201d other revenues received by  the state programs related to eligible expenditures and how to determine  the appropriate federal match based on net expenditures exclusive of any   In  Medicaid beneficiaries receiving services through the same program.a third state, Massachusetts, HHS\u2019s approval included a general program  integrity provision that required the state to have processes in place to  ensure that there would be no duplication of federal funding, but the state  was not required to develop a claiming protocol accounting for other  federal funding sources for its 49 state programs. Further, our review of  the expenditure authorities for state programs in two states\u2014New York  and Vermont\u2014found that the approvals for 25 state programs did not  require claiming protocols or otherwise lacked language expressly  prohibiting the states\u2019 use of federal funding for the same purpose.  Combined, the state programs in Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont  accounted for 74 state programs approved for about $4 billion in total  spending. As previously discussed, HHS officials said they started using  claiming protocols after 2012; however, at the time of our review, these  practices were not applied to previously approved state programs. In  addition, in 2012, HHS established an optional application template to  assist states in the development of their section 1115 demonstration  proposals that included a financing form with instruction for states to  identify other federal funds used for the demonstration. The form notes  that this information will help HHS identify potential areas of duplicative  efforts.", "Regarding funding pools for incentive payments, only one state\u2019s terms  and conditions required the state (Kansas) to demonstrate that its funding  pool was not duplicating any other existing or future federal funding  streams for the same purpose, and two other state\u2019s terms and conditions  (New Jersey, Texas) required hospitals to demonstrate that incentive  projects do not duplicate other HHS initiatives. Apart from including  explicit protections against duplication in the terms and conditions, HHS  officials said they ask providers to disclose other federal funding they may  be receiving or expect to receive that could represent duplicative funding  and that they also search federal funding databases to identify potentially  duplicative funding.", "The extent to which approvals for uncompensated care pools included  protections against potential duplication of federal funds was somewhat  mixed. The approvals placed some limits on the overlap between  payments from the uncompensated care pool and the DSH program but  generally did not address all other federal sources of funding. In the five  approvals we reviewed with expenditure authorities for hospital  uncompensated care pools (California, Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico,  Tennessee), HHS consistently included a requirement that when states  calculate their hospitals\u2019 DSH payment limits, they include as offsetting  revenue payments received from the uncompensated care pool for  inpatient or outpatient services. In the aggregate, however, if states  establish uncompensated care pools under demonstrations alongside  their state DSH programs, total Medicaid uncompensated care spending  within a state\u2014that is, DSH and uncompensated care pool payments  combined\u2014could result in the use of section 1115 funds to fill  requirements already addressed by statewide DSH allotments. In two of  the six states we reviewed with uncompensated care pools (Hawaii and  Missouri), HHS imposed an overall limit on total uncompensated care  payments (pool payments plus DSH payments) equal to the statewide  DSH allotments authorized by Congress. In the other four states, HHS did  not impose such a limit, such that total payments for uncompensated care  could result in the use of section 1115 funds to fulfill a purpose otherwise  limited by statewide DSH allotments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Section 1115 demonstrations account for a significant and growing  proportion of expenditures under the Medicaid program. Ensuring the  long-term sustainability of the program is important for the tens of millions  of low-income beneficiaries who depend on Medicaid to cover their  medical costs. Section 1115 Medicaid demonstrations provide a way for  states to test and evaluate new approaches for delivering Medicaid  services to beneficiaries. Under these demonstrations, the Secretary of  Health and Human Services has broad authority to waive certain  Medicaid requirements and approve expenditures for which states would  not otherwise be able to receive matching funds. In doing so, the  Secretary has responsibility for ensuring the prudent use of federal  Medicaid resources, including ensuring that Medicaid expenditures under  a demonstration will not significantly increase federal costs for Medicaid  above what they would have been without the demonstration. Given the  breadth of the Secretary\u2019s authority under section 1115\u2014the exercise of  which may result in billions of dollars of federal expenditures for costs not  otherwise allowed under Medicaid\u2014explicit criteria are needed to  illuminate how HHS determines that new demonstration spending  promotes Medicaid objectives. Without explicit criteria, HHS\u2019s decision- making will remain obscure to internal and external stakeholders,  including Congress, the states, and the public, and opportunities for  effective communication on this subject will remain elusive.", "In addition, without documenting the basis for its approvals, HHS cannot  provide reasonable assurance that it is consistently applying its criteria for  determining whether demonstration expenditures promote Medicaid  objectives. Based on our review, some of the Secretary\u2019s approvals of  1115 demonstrations included information that documented how new  expenditure authorities would promote Medicaid\u2019s objectives, for  example, by including information on how the demonstration related to  health coverage for low-income populations. However, other approvals  did not. For example, some of the demonstrations were for programs  related to health care for the general population without an articulated link  to low-income individuals or only tangentially related to improving their  health coverage, while others were for funding pools for incentive  payments made for a broad array of infrastructure improvements and  other broad purposes. Given the amount of money involved and the  broad array of purposes for which expenditure authorities have been  approved, it is important that HHS document the basis for its decisions  that approved expenditure authorities are likely to promote Medicaid\u2019s  objectives.

HHS  said that all section 1115 demonstrations are reviewed against  \u201cgeneral criteria\u201d to determine whether Medicaid objectives are met,  including whether the demonstration will (1) increase and strengthen  coverage of low-income individuals; (2) increase access to, stabilize,  and strengthen providers and provider networks available to serve  Medicaid and low-income populations; (3) improve health outcomes for  Medicaid and other low-income populations; and (4) increase the  efficiency and quality of care for Medicaid and other low-income  populations through initiatives to transform service delivery networks.  HHS also said that at times, it has issued what it considered to be  criteria for certain types of demonstrations, such as those focused on  substance-use delivery system reform or on services to individuals with  HIV, through an informational bulletin or State Medicaid Director\u2019s  Letter. HHS committed to taking additional steps in the future to require  that demonstration approval documents more clearly articulate how  section 1115 authority is being used to help states address evolving  trends or needs in their Medicaid programs.", "HHS\u2019s response was silent, however, as to whether it planned to issue  written guidance on the general criteria noted in its response. Further, we  maintain that the general criteria are not sufficiently specific to allow a  clear understanding of what HHS considers to be approvable Medicaid  purposes. During the course of our review, HHS officials said that it is not  in the agency\u2019s best interest to issue guidelines that might limit the  agency\u2019s flexibility in determining which demonstrations promoted  Medicaid objectives. Based on HHS\u2019s response to our recommendation,  we remain concerned that the agency has not altered its position. Even if  HHS were planning to issue the four criteria noted in its response, they  are no more specific than the broad policy approaches currently  described on HHS\u2019s website and therefore would be insufficient to inform  stakeholders of the agency\u2019s interpretation of its section 1115 authority.  For example, although each of HHS\u2019s four general criteria relates to  serving low-income or Medicaid populations, HHS does not define low- income or what it means to serve these individuals. Several state  programs that were approved for Medicaid spending that we reviewed  appeared, on their face, to be only tangentially related to improving health  coverage for low-income individuals. Similarly, investments in broad  delivery system reforms that were approved for Medicaid spending would  seemingly benefit all patients served by these systems, not necessarily  only or mostly those with low incomes. Unless HHS issues written  guidance that more precisely explains how such demonstrations must  relate to serving low-income and Medicaid populations, the rationale for  the agency\u2019s approvals of expenditure authorities that can amount to  billions of dollars in federal funding is not transparent.", "HHS concurred with our other two recommendations, saying that it will   (1) ensure that all future section 1115 demonstration approval documents  (including those for new demonstrations, renewals, and amendments) will  identify how each approved expenditure authority promotes Medicaid  objectives, and (2) take steps to ensure that section 1115 demonstration  approval documentation for state programs, uncompensated care pools,  and incentive pools consistently provides assurances that states will  avoid duplication of federal spending.
