DOD requires its officials in certain positions to fly on military aircraft, including OSA executive aircraft.

We analyzed the use of OSA executive aircraft during 2014 and 2015\u2014the latest years for which data were available\u2014and found that of the 19,752 executive flights conducted, 31 percent supported required users and 69 percent supported other authorized users. The Vice President, the First Lady, and other cabinet-level officials on White House support mission trips accounted for about 12 percent of the flights, and members of congress and congressional employees accounted for about 5 percent of the flights. DOD guidance requires documentation for each flight request including the rank or position of the traveler, itinerary, and in some cases, cost data. While not generalizable beyond these flights, our review of 53 flight request packages found that the packages generally contained most required documentation. Although some packages were missing items, we discussed those items with DOD officials, and we did not find evidence to suggest the requested flight should have been disapproved.", "In recent years, DOD has implemented a consistent process to validate the size of its OSA fleet and to have a risk assessment of the fleet's ability to meet requirements all 365 days per year.

The services do not generally use the validation process determinations as a basis for OSA aircraft procurement and divestment decisions.

OSA missions can be  performed by a wide variety of aircraft, but DOD generally describes its  OSA aircraft fleet in terms of two groups, its executive aircraft and its  nonexecutive aircraft. Executive aircraft provide air transportation for  federal and DOD-approved senior leaders, and are configured to support  travel when other aircraft do not provide the timeliness, security,  communications capability, or workspace required. Executive aircraft  missions include transporting the Vice President, senior DOD officials  such as the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, cabinet, other high-ranking executive branch officials, and members  of Congress.

We received flight information from the services that  indicated departure and arrival dates, departure and arrival locations, tiers  of travelers, and service of travelers. Based on this, we compiled a unique  list of flights, organized by flight type (Joint Staff or service secretary  aircraft) and tier (tiers one, two, three, and four; below tier 2;  congressional delegation; White House; and other). We then created 9  sampling strata as described in table 13, and distributed a sample of 100  flights proportionally across the strata where the sample was designed to  achieve overall 95 percent confidence intervals within +/- 10 percentage  points of an attribute estimate.", "In February 2017, we delivered the selected sample of 100 flights to the  respective services with a request for the associated flight packages.  However, we ultimately restricted our analyses to a select subset of 53  nongeneralizable flight packages for several reasons. Specifically, upon  requesting flight packages, we learned that certain types of flights, for  example, congressional user and combatant command flights were not  collected by the services. As a result, it was determined the delivered  select set of 53 flight packages could not be generalized to all flights in  calendar years 2014-2015 due to the limited scope of the sampled flights  with available packages and due to the small sample size, which would  not provide precise estimates. We concluded that the data provided by  the Joint Staff and the military services were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objectives by interviewing each of the services  and the Joint Staff about their databases used to enter and maintain flight  data.", "To examine the process DOD uses to validate its OSA fleet size and the  extent to which the process results have influenced force structure  decisions, we gathered documentation on DOD\u2019s annual OSA validation  process. The documentation we reviewed included DOD guidance,  meeting minutes, briefings, and a methodology paper. We also analyzed  the results of the OSA fleet validation process. Since 2014, the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has presented these results to the Secretary of  Defense in an annual OSA fleet validation memorandum. We also  interviewed officials from the military services, Joint Staff, the U.S.  Transportation Command, and a private contractor who supported the  OSA validation process, to determine their roles in the annual validation  process and to identify how the process results are used. We also  discussed the basis for OSA force structure decisions with officials from  the military services.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2016 to June 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Description and Pictures of Operational Support Airlift (OSA) Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["Tables 14 through 22 show some key facts about DOD\u2019s different types of  OSA aircraft, along with a picture of each type of aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following staff members  made key contributions to this report: Michael Ferren, Assistant Director,  Brenda M.
