GAO observed significant variation in the type and quality of information entered in JTIMS. Combatant command and Joint Staff officials stated that information in JTIMS lacked consistency in the level of detail provided, sometimes making it difficult to coordinate training with other combatant commands or extract pertinent information about exercises from the system that would be helpful in planning other exercises.

We did not review or  evaluate the quality of any assessments that DOD has conducted for its  joint exercises. Further, we interviewed senior officials from the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, including the Joint  Assessment and Enabling Capability office, the Office of the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as officials from the following four  combatant commands that we visited: NORTHCOM, U.S. Pacific  Command (PACOM), U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), and U.S.  Transportation Command (TRANSCOM). We selected these four  combatant commands for our site visits to achieve a mix of geographical  and functional commands.

The fourth  combatant command, PACOM, did not upload supporting  documentation for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015, but began  uploading supporting documentation in August 2016 for fiscal year  2016 after we informed an official in the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Readiness that the command had not been  uploading supporting documentation in accordance with the Execution  Management System guidance. TRANSCOM and PACOM officials  stated that one of the reasons they did not upload supporting  documentation, as required by guidance, was due to the volume of  travel and other related documents generated in executing joint  training exercises. Officials stated that it was overly burdensome to  upload all of these documents. Nonetheless, an official from the Office  of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness stated the  combatant commands need to do their due diligence in uploading  supporting documentation in order to ensure proper accountability of  Combatant Commanders Exercise Engagement and Training  Transformation funds. This official further stated that efforts are  underway, that includes establishing a new method for how funds are  distributed to stakeholders, to identify approaches that will reduce the  data entry burden at the stakeholder level.", "Documentation for expenditures uploaded into the Execution  Management System did not match reported total expenditures  for any of the four combatant commands we visited. Based on our  review of a nongeneralizable sample of supporting documentation  for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 that was uploaded into the  Execution Management System, we found that the sum of the  individual expenditures reported in supporting documentation did not  match the corresponding total expenditures entered in the system for  any of the four combatant commands we visited. According to one  combatant command official familiar with this system, individual  expenditures reported in supporting documents should be  reconcilable to yearly cumulative totals for expenditures. However,  when we attempted to link the sum of individual expenditures reported  in uploaded supporting documentation to total expenditures data  entered into the Execution Management System by combatant  command officials, we were unable to do so for three of the four  combatant commands we visited. For example, in fiscal year 2015,  NORTHCOM uploaded more than 100 documents that supported how  funds were obligated or committed. Our review found that the  uploaded documentation supported approximately $12.7 million in  funds that were committed. However, the figure entered in the  Execution Management System was about $11.9 million. Similarly, in  fiscal year 2014, TRANSCOM supporting documentation showed that  commitments totaled approximately $66.8 million while the figure  entered in the Execution Management System was approximately  $4.6 million. Officials stated that the reason that the supporting  documentation does not match the figures entered in the Execution  Management System is that some supporting documentation had not  been uploaded. Nonetheless, the inability to reconcile supporting  documentation with the expenditures entered in the Execution  Management System undermines the quality of the data in the system  and inhibits DOD decision makers, particularly those in the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, from providing  adequate oversight of how funds are being expended in support of the  Joint Exercise Program goals. Moreover, the inconsistent uploading of the required supporting documentation and difficulty in reconciling  individually reported transactions with cumulative values entered into  the system suggests that weaknesses exist in the Execution  Management System data entry procedures, which impacts the  quality of the data entered in the system. Therefore, it calls into  question the use of the Engagement Management System which,  according to DOD officials, had been established to provide real-time,  accurate information on the execution of Joint Exercise Program  funds to decision makers.", "DOD has not implemented key processes to help ensure that the  Execution Management System produces quality information.  Further weakening the quality of the reporting, tracking, and  reconciliation of data recorded in the Execution Management System  is that none of the four combatant commands we visited, the Office of  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness had instituted key  systemic processes to help ensure that the data entered in the  Execution Management System produce quality information\u2014that is,  information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate,  accessible, and timely. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that a variety of control activities should be used  for information systems to support the completeness, accuracy, and  validity of information processing, and the production of quality  information. In addition, management should evaluate information  processing to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and valid. Further,  these standards state that appropriate documentation of transactions  should be readily available for examination. Using these internal  controls could reduce to an acceptable level the risk that a significant  mistake could occur and remain undetected and uncorrected.  Individuals from all four of the combatant commands we visited stated  that only one person at their combatant command was responsible for  entering data into the Execution Management System for their  respective command and that, although they believed their entries  were reliable, no quality assurance oversight was conducted on their  work. An official from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Readiness stated that periodic reviews are conducted on data  entered in the Execution Management System but that these reviews  are mainly focused on the execution rates of funds and not on  whether the data entered produces quality information. Further,  according to an official from the Office of the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, the checks they perform on the data entered in the  Execution Management System are similar to those conducted by the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, in that  they are focused on whether or not monthly expenditures have been  entered into the system in order to ensure that monthly benchmarks  are met and less on whether or not the data entered produces quality  information. According to officials from two of the four combatant  commands we visited, sometimes they receive phone calls from the  Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness to validate certain data  entries because they seemed erroneous based on an informal review.  However, no officials at the combatant commands we visited, the  Office of the Chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness could demonstrate  systemic processes for ensuring that the Execution Management  System produced quality information. The absence of quality  assurance processes can affect the quality of the information  produced by the system that DOD uses to determine its most recent  execution rates and defend the Joint Exercise Program\u2019s budget.", "As previously discussed, the combatant commands are not following  guidance requiring them to upload supporting documentation, and DOD  lacks effective internal controls to help ensure the reliability of the data in  the system. DOD officials acknowledged the issues we identified  regarding inadequate supporting documentation and data reliability within  the Execution Management System. A senior DOD official from the Office  of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Readiness (Resources) stated that  DOD plans to address these control weaknesses with respect to the  Combatant Commander Exercise Engagement and Training  Transformation account for the Joint Exercise Program as part of its  implementation of DOD\u2019s FIAR Guidance beginning in fiscal year 2018 to  ensure that the account is audit ready. DOD established the FIAR Plan  as its strategic plan and management tool for guiding, monitoring, and  reporting on the department\u2019s ongoing financial management  improvement efforts and for communicating the department\u2019s approach to  addressing its financial management weaknesses and achieving financial  statement audit readiness. To implement the FIAR Plan, the DOD  Comptroller issued the FIAR Guidance, which provides a standard  methodology for DOD components to follow to assess their financial  management processes and controls and to develop and implement  financial improvement plans. These plans, in turn, are intended to provide  a framework for planning, executing, and tracking essential steps and  related supporting documentation needed to achieve auditability. We  believe that if DOD appropriately follows the steps outlined in FIAR  guidance when executing the Combatant Commander Exercise  Engagement and Training Transformation account, it may help improve  the quality of funds execution data from this account and make the  account audit ready.", "However, as previously stated, FIAR guidance will not be implemented  with the Joint Exercise Program until fiscal year 2018 and the  effectiveness of the guidance cannot be fully determined until after that  time. In the meanwhile, according to a senior DOD official, DOD plans to  continue using the Execution Management System which is intended to  capture the most recent data for the Joint Exercise Program and inform  management decision-making regarding joint exercise investments.  Without ensuring the required supporting documentation is uploaded and  implementing effective internal controls to ensure that data entered in the  Execution Management System produces quality information, DOD and  other key decision makers may not have the correct financial execution  information to defend the Joint Exercise Program\u2019s budget."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has developed a body of guidance for the Joint Exercise Program.

The Execution Management  System is used to oversee and report on most recent execution  performance data for Joint Exercise Program funding. However, not all of  the combatant commands were following guidance requiring them to  upload supporting documentation, making it difficult for DOD to have  oversight on expenditures for the Joint Exercise Program. Finally, DOD  and the combatant commands lack systemic processes for ensuring that  the Execution Management System produces quality information.

Additionally, we  acknowledge that DOD issued guidance for the Execution Management  System in April 2016, but our work found that the guidance was not  routinely reinforced. For example, as we identified in our report, two of the  four combatant commands we visited had not, in fact, uploaded  supporting documentation, as required by the Execution Management  System guidance, for fiscal years 2013-2016. While the Execution  Management System may not be funded beyond fiscal year 2017, we  continue to believe that as long as the Execution Management System  remains in use and for the reasons discussed in the report, combatant  commanders should take the necessary steps to comply with existing  guidance that requires the uploading of supporting documentation into the  Execution Management System so that when DOD managers make  decisions regarding the Joint Exercise Program funding, they use  information from a financial data system that is reconcilable and  auditable.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that states that as the  department implements financial improvement plans in accordance with  the FIAR guidance, it should include specific internal control steps and  procedures to address and ensure the completeness and accuracy of  information captured for the Joint Exercise Program\u2019s Combatant  Commanders Exercise Engagement and Training Transformation  account. In its comments, DOD described OASD(R) as having a  supporting role in the execution of FIAR plans, which are implemented by  Washington Headquarters Services and the Office of Secretary of  Defense-Comptroller, and that these agencies provide specific internal  controls, processes and procedures for ensuring completeness and  accuracy of obligation and execution data. DOD also stated that the  Execution Management System is not a component of FIAR and may not  be funded after fiscal year 2017, and that moving toward audit readiness,  necessary steps and procedures will be put into place to strengthen  auditability.", "As we stated in the report, the FIAR guidance provides a standard  methodology and framework for assessing and developing a system of  internal controls to achieve auditability.
