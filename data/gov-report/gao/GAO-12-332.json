As part of this process, AHRQ used its standard criteria to evaluate grant applications, as well as additional requirements that were specific to each funding opportunity. To select contractors who would receive Recovery Act funds, AHRQ used its standard contracting processes and criteria that are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which establishes uniform policies for acquisition of supplies and services by executive agencies, and the Public Health Service Act. These processes included an evaluation of all contract proposals using standard criteria adapted to the specific needs of each project. Between February 2009 and September 2010, AHRQ awarded $311 million of its $474 million in Recovery Act CER funds through 110 grants. AHRQ also awarded $161 million of its Recovery Act CER funding through 34 contracts. The contracts and grants AHRQ awarded supported both AHRQ\u0092s agency-specific and HHS\u0092s departmentwide CER priority areas. In an effort to avoid unnecessary duplication of CER awards, AHRQ participated in HHS working groups, developed a CER spending plan, and queried HHS databases to check for duplicative awards.", "According to AHRQ officials, the agency plans to disseminate the results of Recovery Act-funded CER using a range of existing mechanisms. These mechanisms include written products, training programs, social media tools, and AHRQ\u0092s website. AHRQ is also developing additional strategies to disseminate CER results.

The mechanisms AHRQ plans to use to disseminate Recovery  Act-funded CER include written products, training programs, social media  tools, learning networks, and AHRQ\u2019s website. The different types of  written products that AHRQ develops for CER results and other research  include comprehensive research reviews that summarize existing  research on a CER topic; original research reports that introduce new  CER results; and plain language publications that summarize the findings  of research on the benefits and harms of different treatment options and  which are tailored to clinicians, consumers, or policymakers. AHRQ\u2019s  training programs include web-based conferences that feature  presentations by experts accompanied by instructional slides for  clinicians. In addition, the agency employs social media tools to  disseminate notices of CER results including electronic newsletters, audio  podcasts, and Twitter. AHRQ is also drawing on an existing agency  learning network for Medicaid medical directors that was created in 2005.  This group convenes periodically to discuss ways to advance the health  of Medicaid beneficiaries, including how evidence-based research   AHRQ\u2019s website  findings can be used to improve quality of care.provides access to CER results through search tools and links to its  written and social media formats.

AHRQ then  develops a marketing plan that identifies key messages, target  audiences, and the mechanisms to be used to disseminate CER to those  audiences. For example, AHRQ\u2019s marketing plan for a CER project that  examines certain treatments for type 2 diabetes targeted consumers as  well as primary care clinicians and certain specialist clinicians and other  health professionals. While this CER project was not funded with  Recovery Act funds, AHRQ officials confirmed that the process they use  to customize the dissemination for this project is the same process the  agency will follow for disseminating Recovery Act-funded CER results. To  disseminate the CER results of this project to consumers, AHRQ  developed a consumer guide and a series of audio podcasts. To reach  clinicians, AHRQ developed a clinician\u2019s guide and a webcast program  with educational slides. These products were targeted to be distributed  through multiple channels including AHRQ\u2019s website, as well as its  newsletters and list-servs. Notices about these products were also sent  directly to a range of general media news services; consumer health and  advocacy publications; and a wide range of key national organizations  that included those representing primary care, specialty clinicians, and  payers.

Specifically, in September 2010, AHRQ awarded four  Recovery Act-funded contracts to develop and implement innovative  approaches for disseminating CER results, including Recovery Act- funded CER. The specific purpose of each of the four contracts is  described below.", "Academic Detailing. Academic detailing involves face-to-face  educational sessions by trained clinicians, including physicians,  nurses, pharmacists, and others, who visit health professionals in their  practice settings. The goal of these sessions is to share evidence- based information and facilitate use of that information to improve  patient care. AHRQ awarded a contract in the amount of $11,680,060  for the purpose of implementing academic detailing for CER from  2011 through 2013. The plan under this contract calls for academic  detailing to 1,300 primary care providers and 200 health care system  practice sites. Each provider or site will receive one face-to-face visit  every 6 months plus follow-up e-mail communications and supporting  materials. The academic detailing will focus on six CER topics over  the 3-year period. Between February 2011 and October 2011, work  completed under this contract resulted in over 1,562 visits to providers  and practice sites. These visits involved the discussion of AHRQ\u2019s  CER results related to the treatment of type 2 diabetes.", "Continuing Education Modules. AHRQ awarded a contract in the  amount of $3,981,168 for the purpose of developing and  disseminating 45 accredited online continuing education programs for  health care professionals, including physicians, physician assistants,  pharmacists, nurses, nurse practitioners, medical assistants, and  other health professionals. These programs translate CER results into  a variety of formats, for example, videos featuring case studies and  journal supplements.

For example, under the contract,  partnerships have been established with such organizations as the  National Rural Health Association, the National Alliance for  Caregiving, the American College of Cardiology, and the American  Medical Student Association.", "Along with its efforts to develop additional strategies for disseminating  CER results, AHRQ is taking steps to evaluate the effectiveness of these  strategies. Specifically, using its Recovery Act funds AHRQ awarded a  contract in the amount of $2,371,179 for the purpose of evaluating some  of AHRQ\u2019s dissemination strategies by collecting data about  dissemination. Under the contract, information will be collected about  changes over time in the level of awareness, understanding, use, and  perceived benefits of CER . This information will be gathered from  clinicians, patients, consumers, health system decision makers,  purchasers, and policymakers. In addition, this evaluation includes plans  to collect process and outcomes data for each of the additional  dissemination strategies being developed under Recovery Act-funded  contracts including academic detailing, continuing education, regional  dissemination, and the national publicity center.", "AHRQ officials noted that evaluating the impact of dissemination of its  CER results is important but also challenging. They noted that clinician  practice behavior often changes slowly and is affected by many variables,  thereby making it difficult to directly attribute changes to information  AHRQ has disseminated. In addition, once CER results are disseminated  to target audiences through, for example, AHRQ\u2019s website or one of its  educational programs, it is often not feasible to track secondary  dissemination from those audiences to others."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "AHRQ Has Begun to Monitor PCORI and Identify Resources That Could Enable It to Fulfill Its PPACA Responsibilities Related to PCORI", "paragraphs": ["While PCORI is in the early stages of development, AHRQ has begun to  monitor PCORI\u2019s needs to determine what resources might be needed by  AHRQ to fulfill its PPACA responsibilities related to PCORI and identify  existing resources that the agency can use to fulfill these  responsibilities.
