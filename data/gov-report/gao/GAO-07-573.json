Almost all states allow households to submit applications, report changes, and submit recertifications through the mail, and 26 states have implemented or are developing systems for households to perform these tasks on-line. Almost half of the states are using or developing call centers and states also are allowing households to participate in telephone interviews instead of an in-office interview. States have taken a variety of actions to help households use on-line services and call centers, such as sending informational mailings, holding community meetings, and using community partners. Insufficient information is available to determine the results of using alternative methods. Few evaluations have been conducted identifying the effect of alternative methods on program access, decision accuracy, or administrative costs. Evaluating the effectiveness of alternative methods is challenging in part because limited data are available, states are using a combination of methods, and studies can be costly to conduct. Federal and state officials reported that while they believe alternative methods can help households in several ways, such as increasing flexibility and efficiency in the application process, certain types of households may have difficulty using or accessing alternative methods. In addition, technology and staffing challenges may hinder the use of alternative methods. To maintain program integrity while implementing alternative methods, the states GAO reviewed used a variety of strategies, such as using software to verify the information households submit, communicating with other states to detect fraud, or using finger imaging. Although there has been some concern that without frequent in-person interaction with caseworkers, households may not submit required documents on time and thus be denied benefits on procedural grounds (\"procedural denials\"), GAO's limited analysis of FNS data found no considerable fluctuations in the rate of procedural denials in the five states between fiscal years 2000 and 2005.

In some cases, this caused participants to  believe they were no longer eligible for food stamps when TANF benefits  were ended. Since 2000, that downward trend has reversed, and experts  believe that the downturn in the U.S. economy, coupled with changes in  the Food Stamp Program\u2019s rules and administration, has led to an increase  in the number of food stamp participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determination of Eligibility and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Eligibility for participation in the Food Stamp Program is based primarily  on a household\u2019s income and assets.

Applicants may need to make more than one  visit to the assistance office to complete the application process. After  eligibility is established, households are certified eligible for food stamps  for periods ranging from 1 to 24 months, depending on household  circumstances and state policy. While households are receiving benefits,  they must report changes in household circumstances that may affect  eligibility or benefit amounts. States may choose to require households to  report changes within 10 days of occurrence (incident reporting) or at  specified intervals (periodic reporting). States also have the option to  adopt a simplified system, which further reduces the burden of periodic  reporting by requiring households to report changes that happen during a  certification period only when their income rises above 130 percent of the  federal poverty level. Once the certification period ends, households must  reapply for benefits, at which time eligibility and benefit levels are  redetermined. The recertification process is similar to the application  process. Households can be denied benefits or have their benefits end at  any point during the process if they are determined ineligible under  program rules or for procedural reasons, such as missing a scheduled  interview or failing to provide the required documentation.", "While applying for and maintaining food stamp benefits has traditionally  involved visiting a local assistance office, states have the flexibility to give  households alternatives to visiting the office, such as using the mail, the  telephone, and on-line services to complete the certification and  recertification process. Alternative methods may be used to support other  programs, such as Medicaid or TANF, since some food stamp participants  receive benefits from multiple programs.

The food stamp payment error rate is  calculated by FNS for the entire program, as well as every state, by adding  overpayments (including payments higher than the amounts households  are eligible for or payments to those who are not eligible for any benefit),  and underpayments (payments lower than the amounts households are  eligible for). The national payment error rate has declined by about 40  percent between 1999 and 2005, from 9.86 percent to a record low of 5.84  percent. FSP payment errors are caused primarily by caseworkers, usually  when they fail to keep up with new information, and by participants when  they fail to report needed information. Another type of error measured by  FNS is the negative error rate, defined as the rate of cases denied,  suspended, or terminated incorrectly. An example of incorrectly denying a  case would be if a caseworker denied a household participation in the  program because of excess income, but there was a calculation error and  the household was actually eligible for benefits.

Telephone interviews are  conducted by caseworkers in the local assistance office.", "Telephone Interviews. Many states are using the flexibility provided  by FNS to increase the use of the telephone as an alternative to  households visiting the local assistance office. For example, FNS has  approved administrative waivers for 20 states that allow states to  substitute a telephone interview for the face-to-face interview for all  households at recertification without documenting that visiting the  assistance office would be a hardship for the household. In addition to  making it easier on households, this flexibility can reduce the  administrative burden on the state to document hardship. FNS also  allows certain states implementing demonstration projects to waive the  interview requirement altogether for certain households. States we  reviewed varied in terms of the proportion of interviews conducted  over the phone. For example, Florida state and local officials estimated  that about 90 percent of the interviews conducted in the state are  completed over the telephone. Washington state officials estimated  that 10 percent of application interviews and 30 percent of  recertification interviews are conducted by phone.

FNS also monitors major changes to food stamp  systems using a process where FNS officials review and approve plans  submitted by states related to system development and implementation,  including major upgrades. States like Texas, Florida, and Indiana that have  implemented major changes to their food stamp system, such as moving  from a local assistance office service delivery model to call centers and on- line services, have worked with FNS through this process.

For example, in Florida a household may submit an  application or recertification through any one of the following access  points -- on-line, mail, fax, community partner site, or in-person at the  local assistance office. Additionally, in certain areas of Texas, it is  possible for households to apply for food stamps without ever visiting a  local assistance office because the state has made available phone  interviews and on-line services. Reducing the number of required visits  can be helpful for all households, according to state officials or  community partner representatives in two of the states we reviewed.", "Easier access to case information and ability to report changes.", "According to officials in the five states we reviewed, alternative  methods, such as call centers, automated voice response systems, or  electronic case records, make it easier for households to access  information about their benefits and report changes to household  circumstances. For example, in Washington, a household may call the  automated voice response system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to  immediately access case information, such as appointment times or  whether their application has been received or is being processed. If  the household has additional questions, they can call the call center  where a call center agent can view their electronic case record and  provide information on the status of their application, make decisions  based on changes in household circumstances reported to them, inform  them of what verification documents are needed or have been received,  or perform other services.", "Increased efficiency. State or local officials from four of the states  we reviewed said that implementation of document  management/imaging systems improves application processing times,  while local officials in two of the states said that call centers help  caseworkers complete tasks more quickly. Furthermore, about half of  the states in our survey that have call centers reported that increasing  timeliness of application processing and reducing administrative costs  were reasons for implementing them. State officials in Florida said that  the document management/imaging system allows a caseworker to  retrieve an electronic case record in seconds compared to retrieving  paper case files that previously took up to 24 hours, allowing  caseworkers to make eligibility decisions more quickly on a case.  Additionally, a call center agent can process a change in household  circumstances instantly while on the phone. Caseworkers in  Pennsylvania said that implementation of a change reporting call  center has reduced the number of calls to caseworkers at the local  assistance office, which allows them to focus on interviewing  households and processing applications more quickly. Officials from  four states we reviewed also said that use of a document  management/imaging system has resulted in fewer lost documents,  which can reduce the burden on households of having to resubmit  information.", "According to some of the state officials and community partners we  interviewed, the availability of alternative methods can be especially  beneficial for working families or the elderly because it reduces barriers  from transportation, child care or work responsibilities. For example,  state officials in Florida explained that a working individual can complete  a phone interview during their lunch break without taking time off of work  to wait in line at the assistance office. In addition, state officials from three  of the states we reviewed that have implemented CAP projects told us that  they had experienced an increase in participation among SSI recipients  and FNS and officials from two states said that households benefited from  the simplified application process. In addition, state officials in Florida  said that on-line services help elderly households that have designated  representatives to complete the application on their behalf. For example,  an elderly individual\u2019s adult child who is the appointed designated  representative but lives out-of-state can apply and recertify for food stamp  benefits for their parent without traveling to Florida.", "However, some state and local officials and community partners we  interviewed said certain types of households may have difficulty using  certain alternative methods. For example, community partner  representatives in two states that we reviewed said that those with limited  English proficiency, elderly, immigrants, or those with mental disabilities  may have difficulty using on-line applications. Local officials from  Philadelphia said that the elderly and households with very low incomes  may have trouble accessing computers to use on-line services and may not  have someone helping them. A community partner in Florida told us that  sometimes the elderly, illiterate, or those with limited English proficiency  need a staff person to help them complete the on-line application. In  addition, those with limited English proficiency, elderly, or those with  mental disabilities may have difficulty navigating the call center phone  system, according to officials from two states and community partners  from another state that we reviewed. A community partner representative  in Texas said that sometimes he calls the call center on behalf of the  applicant because a household may have experienced difficulty or  frustration in navigating the phone system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Using Alternative Methods", "paragraphs": ["Although officials told us that alternative methods are helpful to many  households, challenges from inadequate technology or staffing may limit  the advantages of alternative methods. For example, state officials from  Texas explained that on-line applications without electronic signature  capability have limited benefit because households are still required to  submit an actual signature through mail, fax, or in person after completing  the on-line application. Texas state officials and community partner  representatives told us that the lack of this capability limited its use and  benefit to households. By contrast, Florida\u2019s application has electronic  signature capability and Florida officials reported that, as of December  2006, about 93 percent of their applications are submitted on-line.", "Call centers that do not have access to electronic records may not be as  effective at answering callers\u2019 questions. Officials from Washington state  and federal officials from an FNS regional office view the use of a  document management/imaging system as a vital part of the call center  system. Florida advocates said that households have received wrong  information from call center agents and attribute the complaints in part to  call center agents not having access to real-time electronic case records.", "Florida recently expanded its document imaging system statewide, which  they believe will help address these concerns.", "Further, while four of the five states we reviewed implemented alternative  methods in part to better manage increasing numbers of participants with  reduced numbers of staff, the staffing challenges certain states  experienced also limited the advantages of alternative methods. For  example, inadequate numbers of staff or unskilled call center staff may  reduce the level of service provided and limit the advantages to  households of having a call center available to them. Texas and Florida  have experienced significant staff reductions at a time of increased  participation, which has affected implementation of alternative methods  (see figs. 10 and 11).", "While some states face challenges implementing alternative methods, Utah  state officials said that they have successful call centers because they have  implemented technology incrementally over time and because they use  state caseworkers experienced in program rules. Utah state officials also  reported having relatively low caseloads (180 per worker) compared with  Texas (815 per worker, in 2005)."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "States Report Taking Actions to Maintain Food Stamp Program Integrity While Using Alternative Methods", "paragraphs": ["To maintain program integrity while implementing alternative methods for  applying and recertifying for food stamps, officials from the states we  reviewed reported using a variety of strategies, some of which were in  place long before implementation of the alternative access methods. Some  states used finger imaging, electronic signatures, and special verification  techniques to validate the identity of households using call centers or on- line services. In addition, states use databases to verify information  provided by households and to follow up on discrepancies between  information reported by the household and information obtained from  other sources. Officials in the five states we reviewed did not believe that  the use of alternative methods had increased fraud in the program.  Further, despite concern that a lack of face-to-face interaction with  caseworkers would lead to more households being denied benefits for  procedural reasons, such as missing a scheduled interview, our limited  analysis indicated no considerable fluctuations in the rate of procedural  denials and officials from the states we reviewed reported taking actions  to prevent them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Actions to Prevent Improper Food Stamp Payments and Fraud", "paragraphs": ["Some states have taken several actions to prevent improper food stamp  payments and fraud while implementing alternative methods. Nationally,  states have systems in place to protect program integrity and the states we  reviewed described how they prevent improper payments and fraud as  they implement alternative access methods.", "Finger imaging. Nationwide, four states currently use finger imaging  of food stamp applicants to prevent households from applying more  than once for benefits. FNS officials commented that the agency has  not concluded that finger imaging enhances program integrity and that  it may have a negative effect on program access by deterring certain  households from applying.", "Electronic signatures. FNS reported in October 2006 that nine states  use electronic signatures to validate the identity of on-line users of  their systems. For example, Florida\u2019s on-line application asks  applicants to click a button signifying that they are signing the  application. Of the states we reviewed, Pennsylvania, Florida, and  Washington have on-line services with electronic signatures.", "In-depth interview for high-risk cases. In Florida, a case that is  considered to have a greater potential for error or fraud is flagged as a  \u201cred track\u201d case, and it receives an in-depth interview to more fully  explore eligibility factors. FNS officials commented that Florida uses  an abbreviated interview with most households and that their in-depth  interview for red track cases may be equivalent to the standard  interview process used in other states.", "Special training for call center agents. Call center agents in the five  states we reviewed are trained to verify callers\u2019 identities by asking for  specific personal information available in the file or in the states\u2019  records. Pennsylvania has developed specialized interview training,  including a video, for eligibility workers on conducting telephone  interviews of households applying or recertifying for the Food Stamp  Program. One element of the training is how to detect misinformation  being provided by a household. For example, if records indicate that a  household member is currently incarcerated and benefits are being  claimed for that person, call center agents are trained to probe for  additional information. Similarly, Utah trains telephone interviewers to  request more information if needed to clarify discrepancies in the case,  such as a household reporting rent payments too high to be covered by  the household\u2019s reported income.", "Data matching. States have used data matching systems for many  years and all five states we reviewed used software either developed by  the state or obtained through a third-party vendor to help with  verification of household circumstances. For example, data matching  software can match state food stamp caseloads against wage reporting  systems and other databases to identify unreported household income  and assets. Utah and Washington have developed software that  automatically compares information provided by applicants and  recipients with information contained in state databases, such as  income and employment information. State officials told us that using  this software greatly reduces the burden on caseworkers, who would  otherwise have to search multiple databases one at a time. In addition  to requiring case workers to access state and federal data sources to  verify information, Texas contracts with a private data vendor to obtain  financial and other background information on food stamp applicants  and recipients. After a household has started receiving benefits, states  conduct additional data matching, and their systems generate a notice  to the caseworker if there is a conflict between what the household  reported and information obtained from another source. The  information in these notices is investigated to ensure that recipients  receive the proper level of benefits. Finally, about half of all states  participate in the voluntary quarterly matching of their food stamp rolls  with those of other states to detect individuals receiving food stamp  benefits in more than one state at a time.", "Food stamp officials in four of the states we reviewed said that they did  not believe the use of alternative methods has increased the frequency of  fraud and abuse in the program and officials in one state were unsure and  collecting data to help determine whether the frequency of fraud had  increased. Texas caseworkers, for example, told us they did not think  telephone interviews increased fraud because they believed the  verification conducted by caseworkers and the states\u2019 data matching  system was sufficient. However, we have previously reported on the risk  of improper payments and fraud in the food stamp program and since  there is always risk of fraud and improper payments, particularly given the  high volume of cases and the complexity of the program, it is important  that states include additional controls when changing their processes and  that states continually assess the adequacy of those controls for  preventing fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Actions to Limit Procedural Denials", "paragraphs": ["Some program experts have expressed concern that households would be  denied for procedural reasons more frequently if they had less face-to-face  interaction with caseworkers, although data have not borne out these  concerns and states are taking actions to limit procedural denials. During  our site visits, some officials reported examples of procedural denials  resulting from alternative methods. For example, community group  representatives in Florida said that some households were denied benefits  because they could not get through to a call center agent to provide  required verification in time. However, they also acknowledged that  procedural denials due to not providing verification were frequent prior to  the state implementing these methods. In addition, Texas officials said that  some households were denied benefits for missing scheduled interviews  when the private contractor was late in mailing notices of the interview  appointments.", "Our limited analysis of FNS data for the five states we reviewed found no  considerable fluctuations in the rate of procedural denials between fiscal  years 2000 and 2005. However, a household\u2019s failure to provide verification  documents was the most common procedural reason for denial,  suspension, or termination of benefits in the five states we reviewed.  States we visited described their efforts to help households use alternative  methods and prevent procedural denials for households that are not seen  in person by case workers. Examples of actions the states we reviewed  took to prevent procedural denials include: reviewing actions taken for  cases that are denied, training caseworkers on preventing improper  denials, routinely correcting addresses from returned mail, and developing  automated system changes to prevent caseworkers from prematurely  denying a case. For example, Utah trains its caseworkers to inform  households of all deadlines, and their application tracking software  automatically generates a list of households that have not scheduled an  interview. This list is used by caseworkers to send notices to the  households. Washington uses its document imaging center staff to process  case actions associated with returned mail, including quickly correcting  addresses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the last several years and for a variety of reasons, many states have  changed their food stamp certification and recertification processes to  enable households to make fewer visits to the local assistance office.  Given our findings, it is important for states to consider the needs of all  types of households when developing alternative ways of accessing food  stamp benefits. Despite making major changes in their systems, FNS and  the states have little information on the effects of the alternative methods  on the Food Stamp Program, including what factors contribute to  successful implementation, whether these methods are improving access  to benefits for target groups, and how best to ensure program integrity.  Without up-to-date information about what methods states are using and  the factors that contribute to successful implementation of alternative  methods, states and the federal government most likely will continue to  invest in large-scale changes to their certification and recertification  processes without knowing what works and in what contexts. Although  FNS is beginning to study state efforts in this regard, these studies are not  designed to systematically evaluate whether specific methods contributed  to achieving positive outcomes. In addition, FNS has not thoroughly  analyzed the data received from states implementing waivers of the face- to-face interview to determine, for example, whether it should allow states  to use telephone interviews in lieu of face-to-face interviews for all types  of households without a waiver. Further, while FNS is using its Website to  disseminate information about promising practices, the information  available is not up-to-date, making it difficult to easily locate current  information about specific practices.

Such projects would reliably identify the  alternative methods that are effective and the factors that contribute to  their success; and    direct FNS to conduct analyses of data received from states  implementing waivers or demonstration projects waiving the face-to- face interview and require states implementing waivers or  demonstration projects to collect and report data that would facilitate  such analyses. Such analyses would identify the effect of the waivers  on outcomes such as payment accuracy and could help determine  whether the use of the waiver should be further expanded or inform  whether regulations should be changed to allow telephone interviews  for all households without documenting hardship.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture help states  implement alternative methods to provide access to the Food Stamp  Program by directing FNS to disseminate and regularly update information  on practices states are using to implement alternative access methods to  the traditional application and recertification process.

They discussed the  complexity and variability of state modernization efforts and the related  challenges of researching the effects of these efforts.  For example, policy  changes, organizational restructuring, and the engagement of community  organizations in the application process may occur simultaneously with  implementation of alternative methods and play a significant role in state  and client experiences. Having multiple interrelated factors creates  challenges for researching the effects of modernization efforts.  Nonetheless, the officials highlighted steps the agency is taking to monitor  and evaluate state implementation of alternative access methods.  First,  the officials commented that as modernization evolves, FNS is using its  administrative reporting system to consistently and routinely track  changes in state program performance in the areas of application  timeliness, food stamp participation by subgroups, payment accuracy, and  administrative costs.  Second, they stated that the two related FNS-funded  studies currently underway will be comparing performance data from the  case study states with data from similar states; however, this analysis will  not determine whether certain modernization efforts caused changes in  performance. Third, they stated that FNS plans to analyze data they are  collecting from states as part of the administrative waiver process to  determine the effect of telephone interviews on payment accuracy.   Finally, ERS officials noted that Food Stamp Program access is an area in  which the agency continues to solicit research from the private sector as  well as other government agencies and that ERS makes data available to  support these research efforts.

However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors, such as variations in how respondents interpret  questions and their willingness to offer accurate responses. We took steps  to minimize nonsampling errors, including pre-testing draft instruments  and using a Web-based administration system. Specifically, during survey  development, we pre-tested draft instruments with officials in Washington,  Arizona, Utah, and Wisconsin in October and November 2006. In the pre- tests, we were generally interested in the clarity of the questions and the  flow and layout of the survey. For example, we wanted to ensure  definitions used in the surveys were clear and known to the respondents,  categories provided in closed-ended questions were complete and  exclusive, and the ordering of survey sections and the questions within  each section was appropriate. We also used in-depth interviewing  techniques to evaluate the answers of pretest participants, and  interviewers judged that all the respondents\u2019 answers to the questions  were based on reliable information.", "On the basis of the pre-tests, the Web instrument underwent some slight  revisions.
