IRS did not estimate the portion of this gap from securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, and mutual fund capital gains distributions). GAO was asked for information on (1) the extent and types of noncompliance for individual taxpayers that misreport securities capital gains, (2) actions IRS takes to reduce the securities tax gap, and (3) options with the potential to improve taxpayer voluntary compliance and IRS's ability to address noncompliant taxpayers. For estimates of noncompliance, GAO analyzed a probability sample of examination cases for tax year 2001 from the most recent IRS study of individual tax compliance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO estimates that 38 percent of individual taxpayers with securities transactions misreported their capital gains or losses in tax year 2001. A greater estimated percentage of taxpayers misreported gains or losses from securities sales (36 percent) than capital gain distributions from mutual funds (13 percent). This may be because taxpayers must determine the taxable portion of securities sales' income whereas they need only add up their capital gain distributions. Among individual taxpayers who misreported securities sales, roughly two-thirds underreported and roughly one-third overreported. Furthermore, about half of these taxpayers who misreported failed to accurately report the securities' cost, or basis, sometimes because they did not know the basis or failed to adjust the basis appropriately. IRS attempts to reduce the securities' tax gap through enforcement and taxpayer service programs, but challenges limit their impact. Through enforcement programs, IRS contacts taxpayers who may have misreported capital gains or losses and seeks to secure the correct tax amount. IRS also offers services to help taxpayers comply with capital gains tax obligations, such as guidance on how to determine securities' gains and losses. Challenges that limit these programs' impact include the lack of information on basis, which IRS needs to verify most gains and losses, and uncertainty as to whether taxpayers use or understand the guidance. Expanding the information brokers report on securities sales to include adjusted cost basis has the potential to improve taxpayers' compliance and help IRS find noncompliant taxpayers. IRS research shows that taxpayers report their income much more accurately when it is reported to them and IRS. Basis reporting also would reduce taxpayers' burden. For IRS, basis reporting would provide information to verify securities gains or losses and to better target enforcement resources on noncompliant taxpayers. However, basis reporting would raise challenges that would need to be addressed. For instance, brokers would incur costs and burdens--even as taxpayers' costs and burdens decrease somewhat--and many issues would arise about how to calculate adjusted basis, which securities would be covered, and how information would be transferred among brokers. However, industry representatives said that many brokers already provide some basis information to many of their clients and some use an existing system to track and transfer basis and other information about securities. Many of the challenges to implementing basis reporting also could be mitigated. For example, many of the challenges could be addressed by only requiring adjusted basis reporting for future purchases, and by developing consistent rules to be used by all brokers. To the extent that actions to mitigate the challenges to basis reporting delay its implementation or limit coverage to only certain types of securities, the resulting improvements to taxpayers' voluntary reporting compliance would be somewhat constrained."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Every year, a gap arises between the tax amount that taxpayers pay  voluntarily and on time and the amount they should pay under the law. For  tax year 2001, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated a gross tax gap  of $345 billion. IRS estimated that it would eventually recover $55 billion  of the gross tax gap through late payments and IRS enforcement efforts,  leaving a net tax gap of $290 billion. The tax gap arises when taxpayers fail  to comply with the tax laws, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  Because of their noncompliance, the burden of funding the nation\u2019s  commitments falls more heavily on taxpayers who voluntarily and  accurately pay their taxes. In light of the size of the tax gap and the nation\u2019s  budget deficit, Congress has held several hearings seeking to identify how  the gap can be reduced. Given its size, even small or moderate reductions  in the net tax gap could yield substantial returns.", "One type of noncompliance that contributes to the tax gap occurs when  individual taxpayers do not accurately report gains or losses from  transactions involving capital assets, which generally refers to property  owned for investment or personal purposes, on their tax returns. Taxpayers  generally determine their capital gains or losses by subtracting the basis,  which is generally the price they paid for an asset, from the gross amount  of proceeds they received from its sale. IRS estimated that for 2001,  individual taxpayers\u2019 failure to accurately report their capital gains income accounted for at least $11 billion of the gross tax gap for that year. This  amount is due to taxpayers understating their capital gains or overstating  their capital losses, both of which reduced the amount of taxable income  they reported. Although IRS has not estimated the amount of the capital  gains tax gap attributed to specific types of capital assets, it has estimated  that in recent years, securities transactions have accounted for the majority  of individuals\u2019 capital gains and losses. Securities transactions include the  sale of securities\u2014stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and options\u2014and capital  gain distributions from mutual funds. Securities transactions may be  executed through third parties, such as brokers.", "To address your long-standing concerns about the tax gap, and particular  concern about the tax gap from individual capital gains tax noncompliance  for securities, this report responds to your request for information on  (1) the extent of and primary types of noncompliance that cause individual  taxpayers to misreport capital gains from securities, (2) actions IRS takes  in attempting to reduce the individual capital gains tax gap for securities  and any challenges that IRS faces with these actions, and (3) options with  the potential to improve taxpayers\u2019 voluntary compliance for reporting  securities gains and losses and IRS\u2019s ability to find noncompliance related  to the individual capital gains tax gap for securities.", "To provide information on the extent of and primary types of  noncompliance that cause individual taxpayers to misreport capital gains  from securities, we reviewed a probability sample of case files selected  from the nearly 46,000 randomly selected individual tax returns from tax  year 2001 that IRS reviewed or examined through the National Research  Program (NRP), IRS\u2019s most recent study of individual taxpayer compliance.  We used the results of our case file review along with data from IRS\u2019s  examinations of the tax returns from NRP to make estimates for the entire  population of individual taxpayers. We present information on the extent of  noncompliance by estimating the percent of noncompliant taxpayers. We  did not estimate the portion of the capital gains tax gap specific to  securities. We could not provide a meaningful estimate of the tax gap for  securities because (1) of the 1,017 cases in our sample, we only received  849 complete cases by the time we completed our review, (2) the cases we  received included too few taxpayers who misreported securities  transactions (when selecting our sample, we could not determine which  cases included misreported gains and losses from securities as compared  to other types of capital assets), and (3) taxpayers misreported a wide  range of dollar amounts from the transactions. Since our estimates are  based on a sample, we express our confidence in our estimates as a 95  percent confidence interval, plus or minus the margin of error indicated  along with each estimate in the report, which is the interval that would  contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could  have selected. To address the question of what actions IRS takes in  attempting to reduce the individual capital gains tax gap for securities and  related challenges, we reviewed documents from IRS\u2019s enforcement  programs and IRS publications that address capital gains. We also  interviewed IRS officials knowledgeable about the subject. To identify  options with the potential to improve taxpayers\u2019 voluntary compliance for  reporting securities gains and losses and IRS\u2019s ability to find  noncompliance related to the individual capital gains tax gap for securities,  we reviewed our prior reports, documents from IRS\u2019s enforcement  programs, IRS publications that address capital gains, and industry reports  on securities holdings and information reporting.

In recent years, IRS studies show that the majority of capital  asset transactions and capital gains and losses were for securities  transactions, including sales of corporate stock, mutual funds, bonds,  options, and capital gain distributions from mutual funds. For example, in  1999, the latest year for which IRS published data on capital assets sales, an  estimated 91 percent of capital asset transactions, 62 percent of capital  gains, and 79 percent of capital losses were from securities transactions.  Also, over the past two decades, individual ownership of securities assets  held outside of retirement accounts has increased. According to the  Federal Reserve Board, the percentage of families that own stock, mutual  funds, and bonds outside of retirement accounts increased from 25 percent  in 1983 to a high of 42 percent in 2001, before falling to 38 percent in 2004.", "When taxpayers sell or otherwise receive income from securities, they  must report the transactions on their federal income tax returns.

Taxpayers are to report this information separately  for short-term transactions and long-term transactions. Taxpayers also are  to report the total amount of their capital gain distributions from mutual  funds, which are always considered to be long-term transactions.  Taxpayers are to report their overall gains or losses from securities sales,  capital gain distributions, and other capital gains on the Form 1040 tax  return itself.", "Generally, a taxpayer\u2019s gain or loss from a securities sale is simply the  difference between the gross proceeds from the sale and the original  purchase price, or original cost basis. However, before taxpayers can  determine any gains or losses from securities sales, they must determine if  and how the original cost basis of the securities must be adjusted to reflect  certain events, such as stock splits, nontaxable dividends, or nondividend  distributions. For example, figure 1 shows how a taxpayer would need to  adjust the basis of a stock following a stock split to accurately determine  the resulting capital gain or loss when the stock is sold. In this example, if  the taxpayer fails to properly adjust the basis of the stock to account for  the split, he or she will incorrectly report a capital loss from the sale.", "Taxpayers who buy and sell the same stock or mutual fund shares at  various times can determine basis in a number of ways. Taxpayers can  specifically identify the groups of shares they want to sell. For example, if a  taxpayer buys a group of 10 shares of stock in one year for $1 per share and  another group of 10 shares of the same stock in the next year for $2 per  share, and then sells 10 shares of the stock, the taxpayer can choose to sell  the stocks with either the $1 or $2 cost basis. If taxpayers cannot identify  which shares they sold among many they bought on varying occasions,  they must report the basis of the securities they purchased first as the basis  of the sold shares. Except for mutual fund shares, taxpayers cannot use the  average cost of securities they purchased at various times to determine  basis.", "When taxpayers sell securities through a broker, that broker is required to  file Form 1099-B with IRS and the taxpayers to report a description of the  security, sales date, number of shares sold, and gross proceeds from the  sale, along with other information.

Securities assets sold after being held for 1 year or less are  considered short-term and taxed at the taxpayers\u2019 regular income tax rates.  Assets sold after being held for more than 1 year are considered to be long- term and are generally taxed at maximum rates of 5 percent or 15 percent,  depending on the taxpayer\u2019s regular income tax rates. Capital gain  distributions from mutual funds are always taxed as long-term gains.  Taxpayers can deduct capital losses against their capital gains, and any  excess losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to a limit of  $3,000 ($1,500 for married taxpayers filing separately), beyond which the  losses can be carried over to offset capital gains or ordinary income in  future tax years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual Taxpayers Frequently Misreported Their Capital Gains or Losses from Securities Sales, Often Because They Misreported the Securities\u2019 Basis", "paragraphs": ["Thirty-eight percent of individual taxpayers who had securities  transactions misreported their securities gains or losses for tax year 2001.

Likewise, basis reporting would allow IRS to verify taxpayers\u2019  securities gains and losses through its automated enforcement programs  and take more efficient enforcement actions to address noncompliant  taxpayers, according to IRS compliance officials. The likely increase in  taxpayers\u2019 voluntary compliance and in the productiveness of IRS  enforcement actions resulting from basis reporting would likely  substantially reduce the capital gains tax gap for securities.", "Taxpayers would benefit from basis reporting because, in many cases, they  would not have to track and compute the adjusted basis of the securities  they sold. Therefore, basis reporting would likely reduce the chance that  taxpayers who had not been tracking their adjusted basis would misreport  it for securities they sold. Also, if taxpayers received basis information  from their brokers for the securities they sold, they would enjoy a reduced  burden in filing Schedule D with their tax returns because, in many cases,  they would not need to make basis calculations on their own.", "For taxpayers, the greater accuracy and reduced burden of reporting basis  that would result from basis reporting would likely improve their voluntary  compliance. As shown in figure 2, taxpayers tend to accurately report  income that third parties report on information returns because the income  is transparent to taxpayers as well as to IRS. For example, individual  taxpayers misreport nearly twice the percentage of their income from  sources subject only to some information reporting, which is the case with  income from securities sales now, compared to income subject to  substantial information reporting, such as income from dividends and  interest, and which would be close to the case for securities sales if basis  were consistently reported, according to an IRS research official. Also, as  discussed previously, based on our file review, taxpayers were much less  likely to misreport capital gain distributions (13 percent), which are similar  to dividends and are subject to substantial information reporting,  compared to income from securities sales (36 percent), for which  information reporting only covers gross proceeds but not cost basis. The  smallest percentage of misreporting is for wage and salary income, for  which substantial information reporting exists and taxes are withheld by  taxpayers\u2019 employers.", "Cost basis reporting would also benefit IRS, to the extent the reporting was  complete and accurate. IRS could use basis information to verify securities  gains and losses through its automated enforcement programs and could  more effectively allocate its enforcement resources to focus on the most  noncompliant taxpayers. For AUR and ASFR, IRS officials told us that basis  information would allow it to more precisely determine taxpayers\u2019 income  for securities sales and would allow it to identify which taxpayers who  misreported securities income have the greatest potential for additional tax  assessments. IRS\u2019s examination program could similarly benefit.  Specifically, IRS officials told us that receiving cost basis information might  enable IRS to examine noncompliant taxpayers through correspondence  because it could productively select tax returns to examine. Also, having  cost basis information could help IRS identify the best cases to examine  face-to-face, making the examinations more productive while  simultaneously reducing the burden imposed on compliant taxpayers who  otherwise would be selected for examination. As a result of all these  benefits, basis reporting would allow IRS to better allocate its resources  that focus on securities misreporting across its enforcement programs.", "IRS has endorsed the concept of matching information returns to tax  returns for the purpose of identifying unreported income since the 1960s  and Congress has created a number of statutes requiring information  reporting for various types of income or taxpayer information. The  related GAO products section at the end of this report provides references  to selected GAO reports related to information reporting.", "We previously discussed the notion of basis reporting to help reduce capital  gains tax noncompliance in our May 1994 report on the tax gap. Also,  based on discussions we had with officials from IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Advocate  Service when we initiated our review, the National Taxpayer Advocate  recommended that brokers be required to track and report cost basis for  stocks and mutual funds in her 2005 Annual Report to Congress. In  March 2006 a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate and in April and May  2006 bills were introduced in the House of Representatives that would  require brokers to report taxpayers\u2019 basis for their securities transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expanding Basis Reporting Involves Implementation Challenges That Would Need to Be Addressed", "paragraphs": ["Expanding information reporting on securities sales to include basis  information would involve challenges for brokers and IRS. There are  various ways to mitigate each challenge. Tables 7 and 8 list some major  challenges for brokers and IRS, respectively, as well as some ways to start  mitigating the challenges. Discussion after the tables covers some issues to  consider when evaluating these mitigation strategies.", "Although not all inclusive, the strategies discussed above could help  mitigate many of the challenges facing brokers and IRS if information  reporting were expanded to include cost basis. However, the strategies also  involve a number of trade-offs that would need to be considered in terms of  the costs and burdens associated with basis reporting for taxpayers, IRS,  and brokers, and the impact on reducing the capital gains tax gap for  securities.", "Representatives from the securities industry we interviewed said that  brokers would incur additional costs to develop and maintain systems to  track and report basis, although they did not provide precise costs.  However, we were also told that almost all of the largest brokers directly  provide basis information to a significant portion of their clients, and many  smaller brokers provide basis to a significant portion of their clients  through outsourcing. Also, representatives of the mutual fund industry  estimated that 80 to 90 percent of mutual funds provide average cost basis  information to their shareholders. Likewise, from a societal perspective,  the cost that brokers would incur in reporting basis information would be  offset to some extent by the reduced costs to taxpayers in researching,  calculating, and reporting basis, or paying a return preparer to perform  such services. However, some brokers may pass on the costs of reporting  basis information to their customers. Further, decisions about the scope  and details of basis reporting, as further discussed below, could constrain  how much brokers\u2019 costs would increase.", "Also, representatives from the securities industry told us that their ability  to provide taxpayers and IRS with accurate basis information would be  challenged when taxpayers move their securities holdings from one broker  to another. Some brokers use a system to transfer basis among one another,  but the system is not used by all brokers. In addition, brokers do not always  track and transfer basis in a consistent manner; that is, some track original  cost basis while others track adjusted cost basis. Without a system through  which all brokers transfer standardized basis information, the effectiveness  of basis reporting would be limited.", "Additionally, brokers do not always know or may be challenged in  determining the basis of taxpayers\u2019 holdings. For example, some taxpayers  may hold securities that they purchased long ago or received as a gift, for  which neither they nor their brokers know the original purchase dates. In  these cases, brokers cannot know the basis of the securities. However, this  challenge could be mitigated to a large extent if brokers were to track and  report basis prospectively, that is, only for securities purchased after a  specified future date. The trade-off to prospective basis reporting, however,  is that it would not help some taxpayers report basis for securities they  owned before brokers began to report basis, which for a period of time  would limit the impact basis reporting would have on reducing the tax gap.  Also, prospective reporting would be complicated in cases where a  taxpayer held a security prior to the specified date and then purchased  additional shares of the same security after the specified date. Brokers  would likely incur some additional costs to separately account for shares of  stock purchased before and after the specified date for prospective  reporting on information returns.", "Likewise, it is difficult for brokers to determine basis for some complicated  securities transactions, according to representatives of the securities  industry. For example, when taxpayers sell stock for a loss and then buy  shares of the same stock within 30 days, they are prohibited from claiming  a loss on the original sale. For these sales, known as wash sales, basis is  difficult for the broker to determine because the taxpayer is required to add  the disallowed loss from the wash sale to the basis of the subsequently  purchased stock. The difficulty in determining basis for wash sales is  compounded when taxpayers sell a stock at a loss through one broker and  then buy the same stock within 30 days from another broker. In this case,  the second broker would not know of the wash sale the taxpayer executed  through the first broker and would not know to adjust the taxpayer\u2019s basis  accordingly. We only found two cases through our file review where  taxpayers had misreported basis because of wash sales. Regardless,  transactions such as wash sales may be too complex for brokers to feasibly  report basis. Excluding these transactions from basis reporting, however,  would further reduce the impact of basis reporting on closing the securities  tax gap.", "For IRS, having basis information, along with gross proceeds information,  for each of a taxpayer\u2019s securities sales would best enable the agency to  check whether taxpayers properly reported their capital gains and losses.  However, storing and making use of such information would be challenging  because of the costs and difficulty involved in storing and computer  matching the large volume of information that transactional reporting  would entail. However, if brokers were to report only aggregate basis  amounts to IRS for all of a taxpayer\u2019s transactions, the costs and difficulties  of storing and using the information for matching would be reduced.  Aggregate reporting would also reduce the costs to brokers of reporting  basis to IRS, although they could still report basis for all transactions to  taxpayers.", "Another complication for IRS and brokers is that taxpayers can choose  among various methods for reporting basis in cases where they sell some of  their shares of a security they purchased on multiple occasions. Taxpayers  may choose to report basis in a different way than brokers would otherwise  choose because taxpayers can (1) specifically identify which shares they  sell among many they hold and report basis for those shares; (2) use the  basis of the first shares they bought; or (3) in the case of mutual funds, use  the average cost of the shares they own. Taxpayers could indicate the  method they chose to determine basis when they sell their securities, and  brokers then could report the method selected and the related basis  amount on information returns. However, this additional layer of tracking  would likely add to costs to taxpayers, brokers, and IRS. Although this  challenge could be alleviated if taxpayers were required to report basis in a  consistent manner, this requirement would end taxpayers\u2019 ability to  determine basis in the most advantageous manner for their particular tax  situations.", "Given the number of decisions that would need to be made in conjunction  with basis reporting, IRS may not be able to require such reporting given its  current authority. Although IRS has long had the authority to require  information reporting related to securities, an official from IRS\u2019s Office of  Chief Counsel told us that IRS may not have the authority to require all of  the actions that would be needed to implement cost basis information  reporting, such as regulating a system through which brokers transfer  standardized basis information. Therefore, it may be difficult for IRS to  implement cost basis information reporting without further statutory  authority.", "Representatives from the securities industry told us that in order to  implement basis reporting, a set of rules would need to be developed to  clearly establish, for example, what types of securities transactions would  be covered by any requirement and how a system to transfer basis would  be standardized. These representatives thought their input could be helpful  in designing any set of rules."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Although neither IRS nor we know the size of the tax gap related to  securities sales, tens of millions of taxpayers hold securities outside of  their retirement accounts and, according to our analysis of IRS data, an  estimated 36 percent of taxpayers who sold securities in 2001 erred in  reporting their gains and losses (an estimated 7.3 million out of an  estimated 20.3 million taxpayers). Of those erring, an estimated 64 percent  underreported their income and 33 percent overreported income. Also, an  estimated 9 percent of individual taxpayers who sold securities  misclassified their holding periods, either reporting short-term holdings as  long-term, or vice versa. Enhancing IRS\u2019s current enforcement and service  efforts is an option for addressing these compliance problems, but the most  effective tool for improving taxpayers\u2019 compliance levels has long been  information reporting and tax withholding. Individual taxpayers misreport  nearly twice the percentage of their income from sources subject only to  some information reporting\u2014which is the case for securities income  now\u2014compared to income subject to substantial information reporting.  Also, given that the tax consequences associated with the holding period of  securities are significant, broker reporting on this specific issue, whether  as part of basis reporting or separately, would help taxpayers apply the  proper tax rules to their gains or losses and help IRS in identifying  compliance problems.", "Extending information reporting for securities sales to include basis  information is not a simple and straightforward proposition. The manner in  which basis reporting is designed would affect how the costs of basis  reporting are distributed among taxpayers, brokers, and IRS, and the  extent to which basis reporting would close the securities-related tax gap.  In addition, although IRS has the general authority to require basis  reporting, IRS officials were not certain the agency had sufficient authority  to regulate how such reporting is implemented, such as regulating a system  through which brokers transfer standardized basis information.", "In the event that brokers were required to report basis for securities  purchased as of a specific future date, some taxpayers may continue to  misreport their gains and losses from the securities holdings they currently  hold. For these taxpayers, additional guidance on reporting basis and gains  or losses for securities sales could be a low cost way to help them  voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. For example, an estimated 28  percent of taxpayers who failed to report their securities sales had losses.  Clarification of IRS\u2019s instructions for Schedule D on the appropriate use of  capital losses to offset capital gains or other income could be a means to  help ensure that taxpayers do not disadvantage themselves when they  experience losses from their investments. Also, given the complexity  involved in determining some securities\u2019 basis because of events such as  stock splits, guidance on the resources available to taxpayers on  determining basis, such as utilizing brokers, or services offered by  companies that issue stocks or other information available on Web sites,  could help improve taxpayers\u2019 ability to determine their securities\u2019 basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In order to reduce the capital gains tax gap for securities, Congress may  want to consider requiring brokers to report to both taxpayers and IRS the  adjusted basis of securities that taxpayers sell and ensuring that IRS has  sufficient regulatory authority to implement the requirement.

Through NRP, IRS selected  and reviewed a stratified random sample of 45,925 individual income tax  returns from tax year 2001. The NRP sample is divided across 30 strata by  the type of individual tax return filed and income levels. IRS accepted as  filed some of the NRP returns, accepted others with minor adjustments,  and examined the remainder of returns either through correspondence or  face-to-face meetings with taxpayers. If IRS examiners determined that  taxpayers misreported income for any aspect of the selected tax returns,  they adjusted the taxpayers\u2019 income accordingly and assessed additional  taxes.", "IRS captured data from taxpayer returns and examination results in the  NRP database, including capital gains income. However, the data on capital  gains do not indicate the type of capital asset for which taxpayers reported  gains or losses or for which examiners made income adjustments.  Therefore, to obtain information on the extent and primary types of capital  gains tax noncompliance specific to securities, we selected a statistical  sample of NRP examination files to review.", "The sample we selected contained 1,017 cases spread across 90 substrata,  defined by replicating each of the 30 NRP strata across 3 GAO substrata.  The first GAO substratum consisted of examination cases for which the  adjustments to capital gain income the examiners made had the largest  impact on the total amount of these adjustments for all taxpayers when  weighted for the entire population of individual taxpayers. We focused on  cases with the largest adjustments, in weighted terms, because including  these cases would improve the level of confidence of any estimates of the  total amount of capital gains income adjustments for securities. Because  our sample is a subsample of the NRP sample and is subject to sampling  error, we added cases, when applicable, to ensure that each of the 30 NRP  strata in this GAO substratum contained a minimum of 5 cases. In total, we  selected 290 cases for the first GAO substratum, and these cases accounted  for around 75 percent of the total capital gains adjustments in NRP when  weighted for the population of individual taxpayers.", "The second substratum consisted of 187 cases for which IRS did not  identify misreported capital gains income when it reviewed or examined  the tax returns. We included these returns as part of our sample to verify  that the NRP examinations had correctly recorded when taxpayers were  compliant with respect to reporting capital gains and losses. We selected  these cases at random and in proportion to the NRP sample through an  iterative process, ensuring that a minimum of 5 cases and a maximum of 15  cases was included in each of the 30 NRP strata.", "The remaining 540 cases that constitute the third GAO substratum were  selected from cases for which IRS examined taxpayers\u2019 capital gain  income. We selected these cases at random and in proportion to the  number of NRP returns for which IRS examined capital gains income,  ensuring that we selected a minimum of 5 cases for each NRP stratum. For  one stratum, we only included 2 cases because they were the only cases in  the corresponding NRP stratum.", "Of the 1,017 cases we selected for our sample, we reviewed 849 cases. We  did not review the remaining 168 cases because either IRS did not provide  the files in time to include in our review (164 cases) or the files did not  contain examination workpapers essential to determining if examiners  made adjustments to taxpayers income from securities (4 cases). Based on  an analysis of the response rates by the 90 GAO substrata, we concluded  that the missing cases did not bias our analyses. We requested the cases at  two points, in late-December 2005 and late-January 2006, and periodically  checked on the status of our requests with IRS. We were only able to  review cases that arrived by April 21, 2006 in order to meet our agreed upon  issue date for the report.", "We reviewed each selected case file to determine if the taxpayers reported  securities transactions on their returns or if examiners discovered any  misreported securities transactions. For returns where examiners  discovered misreported income from securities transactions, we  determined, when possible, the related security type, holding period,  adjustment amount, and reason for the adjustment, along with other  information. We recorded all determinations on a data collection  instrument (DCI) that we developed.", "To ensure that our data collection efforts conformed to GAO\u2019s data quality  standards, each DCI that a GAO analyst completed was reviewed by  another GAO analyst. The reviewers compared the data recorded on the  DCI to the data in the corresponding case file to determine whether they  concurred with how the data were recorded. When the analysts differed on  how the data were recorded, they met to reconcile any differences.", "We input the data we recorded on the DCIs into a computer data collection  program. To ensure the accuracy of the transcribed data, each electronic  DCI entry was compared to its corresponding paper DCI by analysts other  that those that electronically entered the data. If the reviewers found any  errors, changes were made to the electronic entries, and the entries were  reviewed again to ensure that all data were transcribed accurately.", "The estimates we included in this report were based on the NRP database  and the data we collected through our file review and were generated using  statistical software. All computer programming for the resulting statistical  analyses were checked by a second, independent analyst. Our final sample  size was large enough to generalize the results of our review or had margins  of error small enough to produce meaningful estimates in terms of  percentages of taxpayers who were noncompliant in reporting capital gains  from securities transactions. However, we could not produce meaningful  estimates of the total amount of net misreported capital gain income from  securities or determine the securities tax gap, in part because (1) in  selecting our sample, we could not distinguish which cases included  misreported securities transactions as opposed to misreported  transactions for other types of capital assets, (2) some cases with large  amounts of misreported capital gains or losses were due to noncompliance  for assets other than securities, (3) 53 of the cases we requested from IRS  from our first substratum, which represented a large percentage of the total  amounts of misreported capital gains or losses, were not provided in time  to include in our review, and (4) taxpayers misreported a wide range of  dollar amounts from the transactions. We discussed our estimates with  IRS officials to obtain their perspectives on the results of our analysis.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selection,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  selected. Since each sample could have resulted in different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as  a 95 percent confidence interval, plus or minus the margin of error  indicated along with each estimate in the report.
