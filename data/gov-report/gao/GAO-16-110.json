OMB issued guidance to agencies to clarify how agencies were to satisfy the law and otherwise implement IQA. The guidance required agencies to develop and post IQA guidelines and related information on their websites. GAO reported in 2006 that expanded oversight and clearer guidance by OMB could improve agencies' implementation of IQA. GAO was asked to conduct an updated study on IQA. This report (1) identifies the number, source, and final disposition of IQA correction requests received by the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act and other agencies for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 and (2) assesses the extent to which the 24 CFO Act and other agencies that received correction requests made IQA information publicly available, among other objectives. GAO obtained data on IQA guidelines and other IQA-related information from the 24 CFO Act agencies and 6 additional agencies that reported receiving IQA correction requests for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. GAO also reviewed agency websites and interviewed OMB and agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the 30 agencies in GAO's review, 16 reported on their respective websites receiving a total of 87 Information Quality Act (IQA) correction requests from fiscal years 2010 through 2014, while 14 agencies did not post any requests during this time. Three agencies\u2014the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Interior\u2014reported receiving 61 of the 87 requests. Agencies are required to post all IQA correspondence, including a copy of each correction request and the agencies' formal response on their websites. However, 8 agencies who reported receiving IQA correction requests did not post on their website the same number of IQA correction requests that they reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In most cases, agencies indicated that the discrepancies were due to the time frames for posting information to their respective websites. OMB officials said they are communicating with agencies to address these discrepancies. GAO found that trade associations and advocacy organizations (50 of 87) submitted the most IQA correction requests, followed by private citizens (16), and businesses (13). GAO also found that IQA correction requests either (1) questioned agencies' use of or agencies' interpretation of data used or (2) cited administrative errors. For example, a trade association questioned the accuracy of data used in public service advertising on childhood lead poisoning prevention. Agencies did not make the requested corrections in 59 of the 87 IQA correction requests. IQA is one of several processes available to the public for requesting corrections of agency information. In one-fourth (15 of 59) of the requests where agencies determined that no change should be made, agencies addressed those requests through an administrative mechanism other than the dedicated IQA request for correction process.", "OMB posts IQA information online, including links to agency-specific IQA guidelines; however, there is no central location on OMB's website where a user could access all IQA data, making specific IQA data more difficult to find and hindering transparency of the process. Twenty-eight of the 30 agencies in GAO's review posted the required IQA information online as of November 2015. The Department of Defense's (DOD) posted IQA information did not include the administrative mechanisms needed to submit a correction request to the agency as required. The Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA) online information did not include its required IQA guidance. Without this information, the public may be unaware of the steps the agencies would take upon receiving a correction request, or even how to submit a correction request. OMB staff stated they would work with the agencies to improve the information on their websites, but as of December 2015, they had not completed that process. Ensuring that online content is accurate is one of the guidelines for federal digital services. These guidelines are aimed at helping federal agencies improve their communications and interactions with customers through websites. GAO found at least five agencies did not include any information regarding correction requests and other agencies' posts included outdated information or contained broken hyperlinks. The Department of Energy's web page includes a link to its IQA processes but as of November 2015 the page to submit correction requests online was under construction. OMB requires agencies to post information quality correspondence on agency websites to increase the transparency of the process but has not provided specific guidance to agencies for posting accessible, user-oriented information, including specific time frames for posting information, explanations of and links to other available correction processes, and other suggestions for improving website usability. Providing such guidance will help increase transparency and allow the public to view all IQA related information including correction requests, appeal requests, and agency responses to those requests."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB (1) consolidate and centralize on its website a summary of IQA correction requests, (2) work with DOD and FHFA to help ensure they post required IQA administrative mechanisms and guidance online, and (3) provide additional guidance to help improve the transparency and usability of IQA websites to ensure the public can easily find and access online information. OMB agreed with these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies publicly disseminate a wide range of information that is  critical to government, businesses, and individuals. The open and efficient  exchange of scientific and technical government information, subject to  applicable national security controls and the proprietary rights of others,  helps to foster excellence in scientific research and the effective use of  federal research and developmental funds. Given the widespread use of  federal information by the public and private sectors, it is important that  this information be accurate.", "The Information Quality Act (IQA or the Act)\u2014section 515 of the Treasury  and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001\u2014 required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue  government-wide guidelines to ensure and maximize \u201cthe quality,  objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical  information) disseminated by Federal agencies.\u201d On February 22, 2002,  OMB finalized the government-wide guidelines. In addition, IQA required  agencies to issue their own guidelines, set up administrative mechanisms  to allow affected parties to seek the correction of information they  considered erroneous, and report periodically to OMB information on the  number of IQA correction requests and how the agencies addressed  them. In keeping with the goal of improving the quality of government  information, on December 16, 2004, OMB issued the Final Information  Quality Bulletin for Peer Review which required executive agencies to  ensure that all \u201cinfluential scientific information\u201d they disseminated after  June 16, 2005, was reviewed by independent subject matter experts.", "We reported in 2006 that although OMB had taken steps to implement  IQA, IQA guidelines and information for many agencies were neither  available nor easily accessible. Thus, we concluded that users of  information from these agencies may not have known whether agencies  had guidelines or known how to request correction of agency information.", "You requested that we conduct an updated study on IQA and agency  implementation of the Act. This report (1) identifies the number, source,  and final disposition of IQA correction requests received by the 24 Chief  Financial Officer (CFO) Act and other agencies for fiscal years 2010  through 2014; (2) assesses the extent to which the 24 CFO Act and other  agencies that received correction requests made IQA information publicly  available; and (3) identifies how selected agencies have implemented  IQA.", "To address the first objective, we searched the websites of the 24 CFO  Act agencies and identified those that had posted correction requests and  responses online for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. We selected 2014  as an ending point for a 5-year analysis because 2014 was the most  recent fiscal year of data available. To identify other agencies that had  received correction requests during the same time frame, we reviewed  IQA data reported by agencies in OMB\u2019s annual reports to Congress. We  reviewed relevant OMB and agency documents, including IQA guidelines  and agencies\u2019 annual reports to OMB, examined requests and appeals to  correct agency information, and reviewed OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019 websites.  To supplement the documentary evidence obtained, we interviewed  agency officials responsible for IQA in their respective agencies. We also  interviewed current and former OMB staff to provide additional context on  IQA. During the course of our review, we compared agency IQA data  posted on their websites with IQA data agencies reported to OMB and  identified discrepancies. We discussed the discrepancies with OMB staff  and agency officials and included their responses in the report. We  determined that OMB and agency data were sufficiently reliable to  provide a general indication of the numbers of correction requests  received. Although agencies have other processes to correct agency  disseminated information, we evaluated only information related to the  IQA correction process.", "To address the second objective, we conducted an analysis of the  websites of the 24 CFO Act agencies, as well as the other 6 agencies  identified in objective one as having received IQA correction requests  during our selected time frame. We reviewed agency websites using  internal site search engines to determine whether they had posted  required IQA information online. We compared the information found on  the websites to IQA requirements in OMB guidance to agencies on  posting IQA documents. We also used OMB\u2019s Open Government  Directive in assessing IQA documents. To identify IQA processes and  challenges agencies face in implementing IQA, we selected a non- generalizable sample of six agencies\u2014the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, Health and Human Services, Interior, and Transportation,  and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2014to obtain illustrative examples  of how they approached and implemented IQA. We selected these  agencies based in part on the number (both high and low to include a  range) of IQA correction requests the agencies had received from fiscal  years 2010 through 2014. We also included one agency (Department of  Transportation) based on the relatively high number of peer reviews  conducted during the same time frame. We interviewed OMB and agency  officials responsible for addressing IQA correction requests to gather their  perceptions on the overall IQA process. For a more detailed description of  our scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to December  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IQA establishes a process that allows the public to help ensure the quality  of information disseminated by federal agencies. IQA consists of two  major elements. The first element of IQA required OMB to develop and  issue government-wide guidelines by the end of fiscal year 2001. These  guidelines were to provide policies and procedures for federal agencies to  use for \u201censuring and maximizing quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity  of information (including statistical information),\u201d that they disseminate.  The second element required covered federal agencies to develop IQA  guidelines by the end of fiscal year 2002. These guidelines were to  establish administrative mechanisms allowing \u201caffected persons to seek  and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated\u201d by the  agencies. The guidelines were to also require agencies to periodically  report to the Director of OMB on the number and nature of IQA  complaints and how such complaints were handled.", "IQA builds on previous federal efforts to improve the quality of  information, including OMB Circular A-130 and the Paperwork Reduction  Act of 1980, as amended. OMB Circular A-130 establishes a policy for the  management of federal information resources. Two of the purposes of  the Paperwork Reduction Act were to improve quality and use of federal  information and provide for the dissemination of public information in a  manner that promotes the utility of the information to the public and  makes effective use of information technology.", "OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) develops and  oversees the implementation of government-wide policies in the areas of  information technology, privacy, and statistics. In this capacity, OIRA  developed the government-wide IQA guidelines and helped agencies to  meet the Act\u2019s requirement that the agencies develop their own  guidelines. OMB issued guidance to agencies to clarify how agencies  were to satisfy the law and otherwise implement IQA. The guidance  required agencies to develop and post IQA guidelines and related  information on their websites. An October 2002 OMB memorandum  describing the implementation of IQA guidelines noted that it represented  the first time that the executive branch has developed a government-wide  set of information quality guidelines, including agency-specific guidelines  tailored to each agency\u2019s unique programs and information. Agencies\u2019  guidelines, which were to follow OMB\u2019s model, were to include  administrative mechanisms that allow \u201caffected persons\u201d to request  correction of information that they did not consider correct.", "We reported in August 2006 that expanded oversight and clearer  guidance by OMB could improve agencies\u2019 implementation of the Act.  We found that OMB had issued government-wide guidelines that were the  basis for other agencies\u2019 own IQA guidelines. We also reported that OMB  required agencies to post guidelines and other IQA information to their  websites and required agencies to provide information to OMB on the  number and nature of correction requests they received and how such  correction requests were resolved. We found that 14 of the 15 cabinet  agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 4 other  independent agencies we reviewed had developed IQA guidelines and  posted them on their websites. Of these 19 cabinet and independent  agencies with guidelines, we found that 4 had information quality links on  their home pages while other agencies\u2019 IQA information was difficult to  locate online. Moreover, 44 of 86 additional independent agencies that we  examined had not posted their guidelines and may not have had them in  place at the time. Consequently, users of information from those agencies  may not have known whether agencies had guidelines or how to request  correction of agency information. OMB also had not clarified guidance to  agencies about posting IQA-related information, including guidelines to  make that information more accessible.", "We also found in our 2006 report that in fiscal year 2003, the Federal  Emergency Management Agency and two other agencies used IQA to  address flood insurance rate maps, website addresses, photo captions,  and other administrative matters. However, in fiscal year 2004, these  agencies changed their classification of these requests from being IQA  requests. Instead they processed them using other administrative  processes that were in place prior to IQA implementation. As a result, we  found that the total number of all IQA requests dropped from more than  24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004. We recommended  that OMB (1) identify agencies without IQA guidelines and work with them  to develop and implement IQA requirements and (2) clarify guidance to  agencies on improving the public\u2019s access to online IQA information. In  response to our report, OMB stated it would work with agencies as they  develop and implement information quality measures and would also  continue to work with agencies to improve their dissemination of IQA  information. Further, in December 2009, OMB, in an executive  memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies, issued  an Open Government Directive (1) establishing deadlines for action that,  among other things, encouraged agencies to advance their open  government initiatives (including IQA) ahead of those deadlines and (2)  calling for each agency to take prompt steps to expand access to  information by making it available online in open formats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Agencies in Our Review Reported Receiving Relatively Few IQA Correction Requests; the Majority of Requests Questioned Data Use and Resulted in No Corrections Agencies\u2019 Websites Show a Total of 87 IQA Correction Requests from Fiscal Years 2010 through 2014", "paragraphs": ["According to IQA information posted on the 30 agency websites in our  review, 16 agencies reported receiving 87 IQA correction requests from  fiscal years 2010 through 2014 (see table 1). The other 14 agencies in  our review did not post any IQA correction requests during the period.  Agencies reported receiving the highest number of correction requests  (26) in fiscal year 2010, with the lowest number (13) coming in fiscal year  2014. Several agencies, including the Departments of Education, Housing  and Urban Development, and Labor, the Federal Reserve Board, and the  Office of Science and Technology Policy, reported receiving 1 correction  request during the 5-year period.", "Three agencies\u2014 the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS)  and Interior (Interior) and EPA\u2014received 70 percent (61 of 87) of the  correction requests during fiscal years 2010 through 2014. These three  agencies were also the only ones that reported receiving IQA correction  requests during each of the 5 fiscal years. For the entire period, Interior  received the highest number of correction requests (26), followed by EPA  (21), and HHS (14).", "IQA officials at several agencies told us that they receive relatively few  IQA requests and provided a number of reasons. For example, EPA  officials stated that the quality of data EPA disseminates is currently more  robust due to the consideration of the diversity of viewpoints provided by  the public and EPA\u2019s opportunity to review pertinent information that may  not have been previously considered during the pre-dissemination  process. Department of Commerce (Commerce) officials attributed their  agency\u2019s low number of IQA requests to the fact that the agency has few  highly influential scientific assessment projects and that most of its  research is relatively noncontroversial, with the exception of research  related to climate change. HHS officials said that it is not surprising that  IQA administrative corrective mechanisms are not resulting in a large  number of IQA correction requests because many correction requests are  for minor edits to agency information. A former OIRA administrator opined  that when several federal courts held that the IQA is not subject to judicial  review, most of the momentum behind IQA was lost, and that, as a result  of these rulings, outside parties do not submit very many IQA correction  requests.", "In August 2004, the OIRA Administrator issued a memorandum to the  President\u2019s Management Council directing that agencies post all  information quality correspondence, including a copy of each correction  request, the agency\u2019s formal response(s), and any communications  regarding appeals on agency web pages to increase the transparency of  the process. The memorandum also directed agencies to provide a few  sentences describing the request and any subsequent responses. Finally,  the memorandum stated that agencies also needed to establish  processes for updating their information quality web pages regularly. In  addition to posting copies of the IQA correction requests on their  websites, agencies are required to report the number and nature of  correction requests the agency receives to the Director of OMB and how  such requests were resolved. OMB has provided a summary of this  agency-reported IQA data since its implementation in annual reports to  Congress since 2003.", "We found discrepancies between the IQA data we found on agency  websites and the IQA data reported to OMB by agencies. Eight  agencies who reported receiving IQA correction requests did not post on  their website the same number of IQA correction requests that they  reported to OMB. In most instances where we identified discrepancies,  the number of IQA correction requests agencies posted on their websites  was lower than the number of IQA correction requests they reported to  OMB. Table 2 provides specific numbers of discrepancies in IQA  correction requests received for fiscal years 2010 through 2014.", "One CFO Act agency, the Department of Transportation, reported to  OMB that it had received an IQA correction request, but did not post the  IQA correction request on its website as of November 2015. As stated  earlier, OMB guidance requires agencies to post correction requests and  agency responses on their websites. OMB staff told us that they issue an  annual data call to agencies requesting information on IQA correction  requests received. According to OMB, agencies are expected to  accurately report their IQA activities, including the number of requests  received. OMB staff stated that if there are discrepancies between what  OMB received from agencies and what the agencies post on their  websites, then there is a miscount or a disconnect on the agency side.  Although OMB\u2019s guidance is not prescriptive on the time frames for  agencies to post this information, it states that agencies need to establish  \u201cprocesses for updating their information quality web pages on a regular  basis.\u201d OMB staff told us that some agencies posted correction requests  and responses online soon after sending out the agency responses. For  example, HHS officials told us that they post correction requests soon  after they are received and do not wait until a response is prepared.  According to OMB staff, other agencies waited until the end of the fiscal  year to post all relevant documents at the same time. In addition, they told  us that agencies often have changes in the staff assigned to report IQA  data to OMB that may contribute to late postings, and although the data  are eventually posted online, they are sometimes provided months after  the request was received and responded to.", "Agency officials from the six agencies that we selected for further review  offered various explanations concerning their data discrepancies,  including the time frames for online postings of IQA data. For example,  officials from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) stated that the  agency does not specify time frames for posting correction requests.  However, USDA officials stated that, in response to our inquiries, moving  forward the agency will require its component agencies and staff offices  to post all correction requests and their responses to their component  agency\u2019s website no later than 60 days after the correction requests are  received. USDA officials stated that each component agency maintains its  own website and updates it accordingly. Since we initially contacted  USDA concerning the data discrepancies, USDA officials have informed  us that the Food and Nutrition Service and Rural Development  component agencies have updated their websites to reflect the number of  correction requests received. In addition, the officials stated that the  Forest Service, the Office of the Inspector General, and the Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service are in the process of making the  necessary updates to their websites.", "Officials from EPA stated that their discrepancy we identified was a result  of a joint correction request sent to both OMB and EPA where OMB  served as the lead agency. Thus, OMB posted the correction request on  its website rather than EPA, but EPA included the correction request in its  total IQA request number for fiscal year 2013 to OMB. Interior officials  told us that they have not designated specific time frames for posting  correction requests online. They explained, however, that one of their  component agencies recently split into two separate agencies and as a  result, one of these agencies is in the process of developing its own  information quality program. According to agency officials, this component  agency received and responded to a 2014 IQA correction request, but as  of October 2015 had not posted the information on its website. Interior  officials stated they expected the data discrepancy issue we identified to  be resolved by the end of this fiscal year. OMB staff agreed that agencies  sometimes have challenges in accurately and timely reporting and  posting IQA corrections requests received and that they are  communicating with agencies to address any discrepancies.", "A 2009 OMB memorandum on open government states that, the \u201ctimely  publication of information is an essential component of transparency.\u201d  The memorandum adds that \u201cdelays should not be viewed as an  inevitable and insurmountable consequence of high demand.\u201d However,  the memo does not provide guidance on what is considered timely  publication. We found that 3 of the 9 agencies that reported fiscal year  2014 correction requests to OMB had not posted IQA correction requests  and responses a year or more after the end of the fiscal year. Timely  reporting of IQA data would increase the transparency of the process and  allow the public to view all current correction requests, agency responses  to those requests, and any appeals. Doing so would also allow the public  to track the status of correction requests that may be of particular interest."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sources of IQA Correction Requests Varied", "paragraphs": ["In our review of the written correction requests received by the agencies,  we found that most requesters who submitted IQA correction requests  self-identified as part of the submission process. As shown in table 3, we  found that during fiscal years 2010 through 2014, 58 percent (50 of 87) of  the correction requests originated from trade associations and advocacy  organizations. Trade associations that submitted correction requests  represented several different types of industries including, for example,  the Western Energy Alliance which represents more than 450 companies  engaged in exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the West,  and the Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association whose membership  is composed of shellfish growers in California, Oregon, Washington,  Alaska and Hawaii. Advocacy organizations represented several different  interests, including the San Juan Citizens Alliance, which is concerned  with public land issues, and the Washington Area Bicyclist Association,  whose mission is to create a healthy, more livable region by, among other  things, promoting bicycling for fun, fitness, and affordable transportation.  Private citizens submitted the next largest number of correction requests  at 18 percent (16 of 87). We found that each of the 4 IQA correction  requests submitted to the Federal Communications Commission  originated from private citizens. Businesses, such as electricity producer  PacifiCorp, submitted 15 percent (13) of the IQA correction requests.  Local governments, such as California\u2019s County of Siskiyou Board of  Supervisors submitted 7 percent (6) of the correction requests.

For example, we reported that the Federal  Emergency Management Agency no longer classified requests to correct  flood insurance rate maps as IQA requests. Instead, the agency  addressed flood insurance rate map correction requests by using a  correction process it had implemented prior to the enactment of IQA.", "In this review, we found that one-fourth (15 of 59) of the IQA correction  requests that resulted in no corrections were processed through an  administrative mechanism other than the dedicated IQA request for  correction process. According to OMB staff, agencies may respond to  correction requests through the applicable administrative process. For  example, agencies may process correction requests using notice-and- comment for rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act in  instances where the request concerns a proposed rule and the comment  process is still open. Processing such requests under IQA, as we  reported in 2006, could impact rulemaking outside of the rulemaking  process by affecting when or if an agency initiates a rulemaking.

According to the strategy, the  federal government must fundamentally shift how it thinks about digital  information. To drive this shift, agencies must, among other things, be  customer-centric to focus on customer needs. This means that quality  information should be accessible, current, and accurate at any time.  Federal digital services guidelines direct agencies to publish digital  information so that it is easy to find and access. These guidelines are  aimed at helping federal agencies improve their communications and  interactions with customers through websites.

Department of Transportation officials told us it has  been a challenge to retain IQA institutional knowledge amidst staff  turnover. EPA and Interior officials both stated that allocating the  necessary time to properly respond to IQA correction requests was  challenging. For example, EPA officials said that the amount of time it  takes to respond to a correction request can take an appreciable part of a  full-time employee\u2019s efforts during busy periods. EPA officials said  additional review time and attention are required because responses to  corrections must be reviewed through EPA\u2019s internal processes for  concurrence, as well as with OMB. Interior officials also told us they  spend a considerable amount of time addressing the often complex  and/or lengthy IQA requests as well as obtaining the necessary reviews  and concurrence of the agency response.", "We found that agency responses to IQA requests and an appeal have  taken 2 years or longer to resolve. Although both EPA and Interior  officials cited time spent in addressing correction requests to be a  challenge, neither agency was able to provide estimates of agency or  employee hours spent in the process. Further, none of our selected  agencies had information about the actual workload or the number of staff  days for responding to IQA correction requests. As a result, the impact of  the IQA correction process on the selected agencies could not be  accurately measured because the agencies do not have mechanisms in  place to track the effects of implementing IQA. We previously reported  that agency IQA officials believe addressing IQA requests is considered  to be part of their agencies\u2019 day-to-day business, and because of the  multifaceted nature of some requests, allocating time and resources on  specific issues or linking work exclusively to IQA requests would be  difficult.", "According to OMB staff, there is not a specific amount of time that is  considered too long for agency responses to correction requests.

However, we found that OMB  had not consolidated all IQA data in one centralized location on its  website. We also found instances where IQA required information was  missing from agency websites or where information was outdated or  incomplete. To be effective, guidance documents should be accessible to  their intended audiences and corrective processes should be transparent.  This is consistent with guidelines for federal digital services. OMB has the  opportunity to build on its efforts to improve the transparency of the IQA  process.

We selected 2014 as an ending point for a 5-year analysis  because 2014 was the most recent, complete fiscal year of data  available. To identify other agencies that had received correction requests  during the same time frame, we reviewed the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s (OMB) annual reports to Congress for fiscal year 2010 through  fiscal year 2013 and identified those agencies outside of the 24 CFO Act  agencies that reported receiving Information Quality Act (IQA) correction  requests.

Moreover, to better understand specific aspects of IQA requests and how  agencies addressed them, as well as to illustrate specific points, we  reviewed in detail all of the correction requests posted on agency  websites to the extent such information was available online. Two  analysts independently assessed each agency\u2019s correction request and  final agency response to determine requester type, request category,  agency response and justification for response, and resolved all  discrepancies. To categorize the sources of the requests by type of entity,  such as business, trade association, or advocacy organization, we relied  on information and descriptions the requester provided in the correction  requests. Specifically, the majority of requesters self-identified as one of  the following types of requesters\u2014trade association/advocacy  organization, business, private citizen, local government, or anonymous\u2014 in their correction requests to the agencies. However, when such  information was not available, we searched the requester\u2019s name online  and used the descriptions found therein to make our determination as to  the type of entity. To determine the final disposition of IQA requests and  any appeals, we reviewed related agency documents, including interim  agency correspondence, to determine whether or not the agency  committed to make a correction(s) in response to the request. We  determined a correction was a partial correction if the agency made at  least one change based on the request, for example adding clarifying  language or additional references.", "To address the second objective, we conducted an analysis of the 24  CFO Act agencies\u2019 websites, as well as the six other agencies identified  in objective one as having received IQA correction requests during our  selected timeframe, using internal site search engines and search terms,  such as \u201cinformation quality,\u201d \u201ccorrection request,\u201d and \u201cIQA guidelines,\u201d  to determine whether they had IQA guidelines and other IQA information  online.
