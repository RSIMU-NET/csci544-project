As of fiscal year 2005, the latest year for which data are available, SCHIP covered approximately 6 million enrollees, including about 639,000 adults, with about 4 million enrollees in June of that year. Many states adopted innovative outreach strategies and simplified and streamlined their enrollment processes in order to reach as many eligible children as possible. States' SCHIP programs reflect the flexibility federal law allows in structuring approaches to providing health care coverage. As of July 2006, states had opted for the following from among their choices of program structures allowed: a separate child health program (18 states), an expansion of a state's Medicaid program (11), or a combination of the two (21). In addition, 41 states opted to cover children in families with incomes at 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) or higher, with 7 of these states covering children in families with incomes at 300 percent of FPL or higher. Thirty-nine states required families to contribute to the cost of their children's care in SCHIP programs through a cost-sharing requirement, such as a premium or copayment; 11 states charged no cost-sharing. As of February 2007, GAO identified 14 states that had waivers in place to cover adults in their programs; these included parents and caretaker relatives of eligible Medicaid and SCHIP children, pregnant women, and childless adults. SCHIP spending was initially low, but now threatens to exceed available funding. Since 1998, some states have consistently spent more than their allotments, while others spent consistently less. States that earlier overspent their annual allotments over the 3-year period of availability could rely on other states' unspent SCHIP funds, a portion of which were redistributed to cover other states' excess expenditures. By fiscal year 2002, however, states' aggregate annual spending began to exceed annual allotments. As spending has grown, the pool of funds available for redistribution has shrunk. As a result, 18 states were projected to have \"shortfalls\" of SCHIP funds--meaning they had exhausted all available funds--in at least one of the final 3 years of the program. To cover projected shortfalls faced by several states, Congress appropriated an additional $283 million for fiscal year 2006. SCHIP reauthorization occurs in the context of debate on broader national health care reform and competing budgetary priorities, highlighting the tension between the desire to provide affordable health insurance coverage to uninsured individuals, including low-income children, and the recognition of the growing strain of health care coverage on federal and state budgets. As Congress addresses reauthorization, issues to consider include (1) maintaining flexibility within the program without compromising the primary goal to cover children, (2) considering the program's financing strategy, including the financial sustainability of public commitments, and (3) assessing issues associated with equity, including better targeting SCHIP funds to achieve certain policy goals more consistently nationwide."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you address the reauthorization of the  State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).

Prior to SCHIP, approximately  19 million Medicaid beneficiaries were children, and combined federal and  state expenditures on their behalf totaled $32 billion. However, there  remained an estimated 9 million to 11.6 million children who were  uninsured at some time during 1997. SCHIP was established to provide  health coverage to uninsured children in families whose incomes  exceeded the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. Without health  insurance coverage, children are less likely to obtain routine medical or  dental care, establish a relationship with a primary care physician, and  receive immunizations or treatment for injuries and chronic illnesses.", "SCHIP offers states flexibility in how they provide health insurance  coverage to children. States implementing SCHIP have three choices in  designing their programs: (1) a Medicaid expansion, which affords SCHIP- eligible children the same benefits and services that a state\u2019s Medicaid  program provides; (2) a separate child health program distinct from  Medicaid that uses, for example, specified public or private insurance  plans; or (3) a combination program, which has a Medicaid expansion and  a separate child health program.

Additional  flexibility regarding eligibility levels is available, however, as Medicaid and  SCHIP provide some flexibility in how a state defines income for purposes  of eligibility determinations. Congress appropriated approximately   $40 billion over 10 years (from fiscal years 1998 through 2007) for  distribution among states with approved SCHIP plans. Allocations to  states are based on a formula that takes into account the number of low- income children in a state.

Under federal SCHIP law and subject  to certain exceptions, states have 3 years to use each fiscal year\u2019s  allocation, after which any remaining funds are redistributed among the  states that had used all of that fiscal year\u2019s allocation. Federal law does  not specify a redistribution formula but leaves it to the Secretary of Health  and Human Services (HHS) to determine an appropriate procedure for  redistribution of unused allocations. Absent congressional action, states  are generally provided 1 year to spend any redistributed funds, after which  time funds may revert to the U.S. Treasury. Each state\u2019s SCHIP allotment  is available as a federal match based on state expenditures. SCHIP offers a  strong incentive for states to participate by providing an enhanced federal  matching rate that is based on the federal matching rate for a state\u2019s  Medicaid program\u2014for example, the federal government will reimburse at  a 65 percent match under SCHIP for a state receiving a 50 percent match  under Medicaid.", "There are different formulas for allocating funds to states, depending on  the fiscal year.

Initially, states had until   September 30, 1998, to select a design approach, submit their SCHIP plans,  and obtain HHS approval in order to qualify for their fiscal year 1998  allotment. With an approved state child health plan, a state could begin to  enroll children and draw down its SCHIP funds.", "The design approach a state chooses has important financial and  programmatic consequences, as shown below.", "Expenditures. In separate child health programs, federal matching funds  cease after a state expends its allotment, and non-benefit-related expenses  (for administration, direct services, and outreach) are limited to 10 percent  of claims for services delivered to beneficiaries. In contrast, Medicaid  expansion programs may continue to receive federal funds for benefits  and for non-benefit-related expenses at the Medicaid matching rate after  states exhaust their SCHIP allotments.", "Enrollment. Separate child health programs may establish separate  eligibility rules and establish enrollment caps. In addition, a separate child  health program may limit its own annual contribution, create waiting lists,  or stop enrollment once the funds it budgeted for SCHIP are exhausted. A  Medicaid expansion must follow Medicaid eligibility rules regarding  income, residency, and disability status, and thus generally cannot limit  enrollment.", "Benefits. Separate child health programs must use, for example,  benchmark benefit standards that use specified private or public insurance  plans as the basis for coverage. However, Medicaid\u2014and therefore a  Medicaid expansion\u2014must provide coverage of all benefits available to  the Medicaid population, including certain services for children.

The cost- effectiveness test requires the states to demonstrate that covering both  adults and children in a family under SCHIP is no more expensive than  covering only the children. The states may also elect to cover children  whose parents have access to employer-based or private health insurance  coverage by using SCHIP funding to subsidize the cost.", "Second, under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, states may receive  approval to waive certain Medicaid or SCHIP requirements or authorize  Medicaid or SCHIP expenditures. The Secretary of Health and Human  Services may approve waivers of statutory requirements or authorize  expenditures in the case of experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects  that are likely to promote program objectives. In August 2001, HHS  indicated that it would allow states greater latitude in using section 1115  demonstration projects (or waivers) to modify their Medicaid and SCHIP  programs and that it would expedite consideration of state proposals.

For example, Alabama reported a net  increase of approximately 121,000 children in Medicaid since its SCHIP  program began in 1998. New York reported that, for fiscal year 2005,  approximately 204,000 children were enrolled in Medicaid as a result of  outreach activities, compared with 618,973 children enrolled in SCHIP.

In particular, those working part- time, for small firms, or in certain industries such as agriculture or  construction, were among the most likely to be uninsured. Additionally,  states with high uninsured rates and those with low rates often were  distinct with regard to several characteristics. For example, states with  higher than average uninsured rates tended to have higher unemployment  and proportionally fewer employers offering coverage to their workers.

Combined federal and state spending was   $180 million in 1998 and $1.3 billion in 1999. However, by the end of the  program\u2019s third fiscal year (2000), all 50 states and the District of  Columbia had implemented their programs and were drawing down their  federal allotments.

Generally, states were able to draw on unused funds from prior  years\u2019 allotments to cover expenditures incurred in a given year that were  in excess of their allotment for that year, because, as discussed earlier, the  federal SCHIP law gave states 3 years to spend each annual allotment. In  certain circumstances, states also retained a portion of unused allotments.", "States that have outspent their annual allotments over the 3-year period of  availability have also relied on redistributed SCHIP funds to cover excess  expenditures. But as overall spending has grown, the pool of funds  available for redistribution has shrunk from a high of $2.82 billion in  unused funds from fiscal year 1999 to $0.17 billion in unused funds from  fiscal year 2003.

In fiscal years 2000 and 2003, Congress amended  statutory provisions for the redistribution and availability of unused  SCHIP allotments from fiscal years 1998 through 2001, reducing the  amounts available for redistribution and allowing states that had not  exhausted their allotments by the end of the 3-year period of availability to  retain some of these funds for additional years. Despite these steps,   $1.4 billion in unused SCHIP funds reverted to the U.S. Treasury by the  end of fiscal year 2005.", "Congress has also appropriated additional funds to cover states\u2019 projected  SCHIP program shortfalls.

It is unclear,  however, to what extent these characteristics contributed to states\u2019 overall  spending experiences with the program, as many other factors have also  affected states\u2019 program balances, including prior coverage of children  under Medicaid, and SCHIP eligibility criteria, benefit packages,  enrollment policies, outreach efforts, and payment rates to providers. In  addition, we and others have noted that the formula for allocating funds to  states has flaws that led to underestimates of the number of eligible  children in some states and thus underfunding. Fifteen of the 18 shortfall  states (83 percent) had Medicaid expansion programs or combination  programs that included Medicaid expansions, which generally follow  Medicaid rules, such as providing the full Medicaid benefit package and  continuing to provide coverage to all eligible individuals even after the  states\u2019 SCHIP allotments are exhausted. The shortfall states tended to  have a broader eligibility corridor in their SCHIP programs, indicating that,  on average, the shortfall states covered children in SCHIP from lower  income levels, from higher income levels, or both. For example,   33 percent of the shortfall states covered children in their SCHIP programs  above 200 percent of FPL, compared with 25 percent of the nonshortfall  states. Finally, 6 of the 18 shortfall states (33 percent) were covering  adults in SCHIP under section 1115 waivers by the end of fiscal year 2006,  compared with 6 of the 32 nonshortfall states (19 percent).", "On average, the shortfall states that covered adults began covering them  earlier than nonshortfall states and enrolled a higher proportion of adults.  At the end of fiscal year 2006, 12 states covered adults under section 1115  waivers using SCHIP funds. Five of these 12 states began covering adults  before fiscal year 2003, and all 5 states faced shortfalls in at least 1 of the  final 3 years of the program. In contrast, none of the 4 states that began  covering adults with SCHIP funds in the period from fiscal year 2004  through 2006 faced shortfalls. On average, the shortfall states covered  adults more than twice as long as nonshortfall states (5.1 years compared  with 2.3 years by the end of fiscal year 2006).", "Shortfall states also enrolled a higher proportion of adults. Nine states,  including six shortfall states, covered adults using SCHIP funds  throughout fiscal year 2005. In these nine states, adults accounted for an  average of 45 percent of total enrollment. However, in the shortfall states,  the average proportion was more than twice as high as in nonshortfall  states. Adults accounted for an average of 55 percent of enrollees in the  shortfall states, compared with 24 percent in the nonshortfall states. (See  table 5.)", "While analyses of states as a group reveal some broad characteristics of  states\u2019 programs, examining the experiences of individual states offers  insights into other factors that have influenced states\u2019 program balances.  States themselves have offered a variety of reasons for shortfalls and  surpluses. These examples, while not exhaustive, highlight additional  factors that have shaped states\u2019 financial circumstances under SCHIP.", "Inaccuracies in the CPS-based estimates on which states\u2019  allotments were based. North Carolina, a shortfall state, offers a case in  point. In 2004, the state had more low-income children enrolled in the  program than CPS estimates indicated were eligible. To curb spending,  North Carolina shifted children through age 5 from the state\u2019s separate  child health program to a Medicaid expansion, reduced provider  payments, and limited enrollment growth.", "Annual funding levels that did not reflect enrollment growth. Iowa,  another shortfall state, noted that annual allocations provided too many  funds in the early years of the program and too few in the later years. Iowa  did not use all its allocations in the first 4 years and thus the state\u2019s funds  were redistributed to other states. Subsequently, however, the state has  faced shortfalls as its program matured.", "Impact of policies designed to curb or expand program growth.", "Some states have attempted to manage program growth through ongoing  adjustments to program parameters and outreach efforts. For example,  when Florida\u2019s enrollment exceeded a predetermined target in 2003, the  state implemented a waiting list and eliminated outreach funding. When  enrollment began to decline, the state reinstituted open enrollment and  outreach. Similarly, Texas\u23afcommensurate with its budget constraints and  projected surpluses\u23afhas tightened and loosened eligibility requirements  and limited and expanded benefits over time in order to manage  enrollment and spending."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Considerations for SCHIP Reauthorization", "paragraphs": ["Children without health insurance are at increased risk of foregoing  routine medical and dental care, immunizations, treatment for injuries,  and treatment for chronic illnesses. Yet, the states and the federal  government face challenges in their efforts to continue to finance health  care coverage for children. As health care consumes a growing share of  state general fund or operating budgets, slowdowns in economic growth  can affect states\u2019 abilities\u2014and efforts\u2014to address the demand for public  financing of health services. Moreover, without substantive programmatic  or revenue changes, the federal government faces near- and long-term  fiscal challenges as the U.S. population ages because spending for  retirement and health care programs will grow dramatically. Given these  circumstances, we would like to suggest several issues for consideration  as Congress addresses the reauthorization of SCHIP. These include the  following:    Maintaining flexibility without compromising the goals of SCHIP.", "The federal-state SCHIP partnership has provided an important  opportunity for innovation on the part of states for the overall benefit of  children\u2019s health. Providing three design choices for states\u2014Medicaid  expansions, separate child health programs, or a combination of both  approaches\u2014affords them the opportunity to focus on their own unique  and specific priorities. For example, expansions of Medicaid offer  Medicaid\u2019s comprehensive benefits and administrative structures and  ensure children\u2019s coverage if states exhaust their SCHIP allotments.  However, this entitlement status also increases financial risk to states. In  contrast, SCHIP separate child health programs offer a \u201cblock grant\u201d  approach to covering children. As long as the states meet statutory  requirements, they have the flexibility to structure coverage on an  employer-based health plan model and can better control program  spending than they can with a Medicaid expansion.", "However, flexibility within the SCHIP program, such as that available  through section 1115 waivers, may also result in consequences that can  run counter to SCHIP\u2019s goal\u2014covering children. For example, we  identified 15 states that have authority to cover adults with their federal  SCHIP funds, with several states covering more adults than children.  States\u2019 rationale is that covering low-income parents in public programs  such as SCHIP and Medicaid increases the enrollment of eligible children  as well, with the result that fewer children go uninsured. Federal SCHIP  law provides that families may be covered only if such coverage is cost- effective; that is, covering families costs no more than covering the SCHIP- eligible children. We earlier reported that HHS had approved state  proposals for section 1115 waivers to use SCHIP funds to cover parents of  SCHIP- and Medicaid-eligible children without regard to cost- effectiveness. We also reported that HHS approved state proposals for  section 1115 waivers to use SCHIP funds to cover childless adults, which  in our view was inconsistent with federal SCHIP law and allowed SCHIP  funds to be diverted from the needs of low-income children. We  suggested that Congress consider amending the SCHIP statute to specify  that SCHIP funds were not available to provide health insurance coverage  for childless adults. Under the DRA, Congress prohibited the Secretary of  Health and Human Services from approving any new section 1115 waivers  to cover nonpregnant childless adults after October 1, 2005, but allowed  waivers approved prior to that date to continue.", "It is important to consider the implications of states\u2019 use of allowable  flexibility for other aspects of their programs. For example, what  assurances exist that SCHIP funds are being spent in the most cost- effective manner, as required under federal law? In view of current federal  fiscal constraints, to what extent should SCHIP funds be available for  adult coverage? How has states\u2019 use of available flexibility to establish  expanded financial eligibility categories and covered populations affected  their ability to operate their SCHIP programs within the original  allotments provided to them?", "Considering the federal financing strategy, including the financial  sustainability of public commitments. As SCHIP programs have  matured, states\u2019 spending experience can help inform future federal  financing decisions. CRS testified in July 2006 that 40 states were now  spending more annually than they received in their annual original SCHIP  allotments. While many of them did not face shortfalls in 2006 because of  available prior-year balances, redistributed funds, and the supplemental  DRA appropriation, 14 states are currently projected to face shortfalls in  2007. With the pool of funds available for redistribution virtually  exhausted, the continued potential for funding shortfalls for many states  raises some fundamental questions about SCHIP financing. If SCHIP is  indeed a capped grant program, to what extent does the federal  government have a responsibility to address shortfalls in individual states,  especially those that have chosen to expand their programs beyond  certain parameters? In contrast, if the policy goal is to ensure that states  do not exhaust their federal SCHIP allotments, by providing for the  continuing redistribution of funds or additional federal appropriations,  does the program begin to take on the characteristics of an entitlement  similar to Medicaid? What overall implications does this have for the  federal budget?", "Assessing issues associated with equity. The 10 years of SCHIP  experience that states now have could help inform any policy decisions  with respect to equity as part of the SCHIP reauthorization process.  Although SCHIP generally targets children in families with incomes at or  below 200 percent of FPL, 9 states are relatively more restrictive with their  eligibility levels, while 14 states are more expansive, ranging as high as   350 percent of FPL. Given the policy goal of reducing the rate of uninsured  among the nation\u2019s children, to what extent should SCHIP funds be  targeted to those states that have not yet achieved certain minimum  coverage levels? Given current and future federal fiscal constraints, to  what extent should the federal government provide federal financial  participation above certain thresholds? What broader implications might  this have for flexibility, choice, and equity across state programs?", "Another consideration is whether the formulas used in SCHIP\u2014both the  formula to determine the federal matching rate and the formula to allocate  funds to states\u2014could be refined to better target funding to certain states  for the benefit of covering uninsured children. Because the SCHIP formula  is based on the Medicaid formula for federal matching funds, it has some  inherent shortcomings that are likely beyond the scope of consideration  for SCHIP reauthorization.", "For the allocation formula that determines the amount of funds a state will  receive each year, several analysts, including CRS, have noted alternatives  that could be considered. These include altering the methods for  estimating the number of children at the state level, adjusting the extent to  which the SCHIP formula for allocating funds to states includes the  number of uninsured versus low-income children, and incorporating  states\u2019 actual spending experiences to date into the formula. Considering  the effects of any one or combination of these\u2014or other\u2014policy options  would likely entail iterative analysis and thoughtful consideration of  relevant trade-offs.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks.
