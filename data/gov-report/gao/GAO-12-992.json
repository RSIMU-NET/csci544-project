Officials cited several reasons for this, including not wanting to overburden sites with measures and monitoring requirements. Although VA and DOD require some limited performance information--such as the return on investment for pilot projects--without comprehensive performance measures, they lack information that could help decision makers assess collaboration sites' overall progress in meeting the departments' shared goals of improved health care access, quality, and costs; identify areas for improvement; and make informed decisions. Also, the departments cannot document the overall cost effectiveness of their collaboration efforts. In the absence of required measures for all sites, some have developed their own, but these fragmented efforts do not provide sufficient information about the overall results of collaborations.", "The departments face a number of key barriers that hinder collaboration efforts. In particular, GAO identified incompatible policies and practices in four areas:", "Information technology (IT) systems . Because VA and DOD collect, store, and process health information in different IT systems, providing access to information needed to best treat patients has proved problematic.", "Business and administrative processes . Different billing practices, difficulties capturing patient workload information, and overlapping efforts in credentialing providers and computer security training reduce efficiency.", "Access to military bases . Balancing base security needs with veterans' needs to access medical facilities on base creates some difficulties.", "Medical facility construction . Misaligned construction planning processes hinder efforts to jointly plan facilities to serve both VA and DOD beneficiaries.", "Although VA and DOD officials have taken some steps to address these areas, such as efforts to improve data sharing, without additional department-level actions, barriers will continue to hinder collaboration and lead to inefficiencies.", "VA and DOD do not have a fully developed process for systematically identifying all opportunities for new or enhanced collaboration. Instead, the identification of those collaboration opportunities is largely left to local medical facility leadership. Although the departments have a process for jointly identifying a select number of sites with opportunities for new or expanded collaboration, that process does not address all opportunities for collaboration across both health care systems and there is no requirement that sites identified by that process move forward to implement collaboration. Without a fully developed process to systematically identify and select additional collaboration opportunities, the departments may miss opportunities to achieve their shared goals and reduce duplication of services, such as through additional sharing agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends several actions, including that VA and DOD: require collaboration sites to develop performance measures related to access, quality, and costs; address barriers hindering collaboration; and develop a process to more systematically identify new or expanded collaboration opportunities.

Although the two  departments have different missions, both provide health care services  and have been authorized to exchange health care resources since the  1982 enactment of the Veterans\u2019 Administration and Department of  Defense Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act.  Specifically, VA and DOD were authorized by the act to enter into  contracts or sharing agreements to improve access to, and the quality  and cost-effectiveness of, health care provided by the two departments.  Subsequently, the departments have instituted a policy that allows VA  and DOD to charge one another at least 10 percent less for clinical  services than they would in locations without sharing agreements.", "Since the 1980s, VA and DOD have entered into many types of  collaborations to provide health care services\u2014including emergency,  specialty, inpatient, and outpatient care\u2014to VA and DOD beneficiaries,  reimbursing each other for the services provided. These collaborations  vary in scope, ranging from agreements to jointly provide a single type of  service to more coordinated \u201cjoint ventures,\u201d which encompass multiple  health care services and facilities and focus on mutual benefit, shared  risk, and joint operations in specific clinical areas. The departments also  have collaborated on the joint construction of medical facilities and have  jointly funded pilot projects related to VA and DOD collaboration activities.

We have previously reported that reducing or eliminating  government-wide duplication could potentially save billions of tax dollars  annually and help agencies provide more efficient and effective services.  This is especially important for VA and DOD given that the departments  have experienced and continue to experience rising health care costs.  Specifically, both VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget requests  reflect anticipated medical care expenses that are more than double their  2001 costs. Duplication and overlap can occur for a variety of reasons,  including that agencies lack information on the effectiveness of programs  that could help decision makers prioritize resources among programs. We  have previously identified the need for improvement in the evaluation of  current and potential VA/DOD collaboration efforts, as well as challenges  VA and DOD face in their efforts to share health care resources.

For example, although VA and DOD  department-level officials believe that some savings occur when  collaboration sites adopt sharing agreements in which partners pay each  other less for care than they would otherwise pay community providers,  the overall savings are unclear because sites are not required to develop  performance measures to assess the extent of their savings. The  importance of performance measures regarding costs is highlighted by  our prior work on the consolidation and integration of federal facilities\u2014in  particular, how such activities can result in unexpected costs that may  affect overall results. For example, the North Chicago Federal Health  Care Center joint venture experienced unanticipated costs associated  with its integration of VA and DOD services, such as hiring the equivalent  of 23 full-time staff to manually perform work that was originally expected  to be automated. The impact of these additional costs on that integration  overall, however, is unknown, because VA and DOD have not established  cost-related performance measures.

Officials from  both departments cited several reasons why VA and DOD do not require  all collaboration sites to develop and use performance measures related  to the departments\u2019 shared goals. In particular, VA officials told us they do  not want to overburden sites with performance measures and monitoring  requirements, which they said may discourage future collaborations. VA  officials also told us that department-level VA and DOD collaboration  offices do not have direct control over medical facilities and are not  required to provide oversight or monitoring of performance. Finally, DOD  officials said that because each collaboration is unique, performance  measures appropriate for one location might not be appropriate for  another location.", "Although VA and DOD do not require all collaboration sites to develop  and use performance measures, the departments do require some limited  performance information for certain collaboration options. For example, to  receive JIF project funding, sites must estimate the return on investment  and propose performance measures related to that estimate and other  projected benefits, such as improved access or quality of care. Sites that  receive such funding must then periodically use and report on those  performance measures during and at the conclusion of the project. In  addition, beginning in fiscal year 2013, joint ventures and other selected  collaboration sites will be required to report on performance measures to  indicate areas where sites have achieved at least a 5 percent reduction in  costs or other improvements in efficiency that result from health care  collaborations. VA officials told us these measures are not meant to  represent overall savings achieved as a result of collaborating, but rather  savings from specific, self-selected areas the collaboration sites choose  to measure. Although these efforts represent initial steps toward better  understanding of the performance and progress of collaboration sites,  officials acknowledged that more work remains to be done. VA and DOD  officials told us that both departments are working to develop criteria to  determine the success of the 10 joint ventures, which they anticipate will  be based on the departments\u2019 shared goals. As of July 2012, VA  department-level officials told us that a set of proposed criteria were still  being reviewed internally. They noted that the time frame for  implementing those criteria would still need to be determined, in part  because the departments would need to resolve data collection and  analysis issues\u2014such as ensuring that collaboration partners had access  to reliable and timely information\u2014before any resulting measures could  be developed and used to assess sites\u2019 progress.", "In the absence of a department-level requirement for performance  measures for all collaboration sites, some sites we reviewed have  developed their own performance measures.

We have previously reported that federal agencies  can facilitate and enhance their collaboration efforts by establishing  compatible policies, procedures, and other ways of operating across  boundaries. Some problems VA and DOD face are inherent to the  differing missions of the two departments. However, we also identified  several important areas where VA and DOD\u2019s lack of compatible policies  and practices at the department level and at local collaboration sites  hinders collaboration efforts. These incompatible policies and practices  fall into four areas: (1) IT systems\u2019 ability to share health information,   (2) business and administrative processes in place at current  collaboration sites, (3) procedures for veterans to access medical facilities  on military bases, and (4) joint VA and DOD planning for construction of  medical facilities. Although VA and DOD officials at the department and  local levels have taken some steps to address issues in these areas,  significant barriers remain. Without additional department-level actions to  address incompatible policies and practices, those barriers will continue  to hinder collaboration efforts and lead to inefficiencies at the local level."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IT Systems\u2019 Ability to Share Health Information", "paragraphs": ["As we have reported for over a decade, VA and DOD lack IT systems that  permit the electronic exchange of comprehensive patient health   Access to  information, a significant barrier in their collaboration efforts.comprehensive health information is important to providing optimal care  to patients who receive health care services from both VA and DOD.  However, because VA and DOD collect, store, and process health  information in different IT systems, providing access to the information  needed to best treat those patients has proved problematic.", "At collaboration sites, the departments\u2019 IT barriers hinder ongoing efforts  in many ways. As we have previously reported, a health care provider  who lacks access to comprehensive health information about a patient  may be challenged to make the most informed treatment decisions,  potentially putting the patient\u2019s health at risk. The provider also might  unknowingly order diagnostic tests that have already been performed,  leading to added health care costs. In addition, providers\u2019 inability to use  their own facility\u2019s IT system to easily view the health care records of their  collaboration partner\u2019s patients can lead to costly inefficiencies. For  example, the North Chicago Federal Health Care Center joint venture  hired five full-time pharmacists specifically to conduct manual checks of  patient records to reconcile allergy information and identify possible  interactions between drugs prescribed by providers in both VA and DOD  systems. Similarly, Biloxi joint venture officials reported having to rely on  inefficient and time-consuming approaches to share information, including  manually copying or transferring medical information such as diagnostic  images between VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s IT systems, or faxing information to  their collaboration partner, where it must be entered into the partner\u2019s IT  system.", "Collaboration sites have taken steps to facilitate information sharing, but  officials noted that those efforts had limitations and that IT barriers  remained. For example, Honolulu joint venture officials developed an IT  tool\u2014called \u201cJanus\u201d\u2014that allows providers to view their patients\u2019 VA and  DOD health care records on a single screen. Officials said this tool has  helped providers treating shared patients in a number of ways, providing  clinical benefits and allowing providers to work more efficiently. Officials  said, for example, that Janus gives providers a more efficient way to view  and share diagnostic images taken by collaboration partners and to  compare clinical information in both partners\u2019 systems, such as patients\u2019  medication allergies and laboratory results. However, they noted that it is  a \u201cread only\u201d tool that doesn\u2019t allow providers to enter data into the other  department\u2019s IT system; as a result, there are some inefficiencies when  providers must take time to separately perform data entry steps outside of  their Janus IT tool. At the Biloxi joint venture, staff in some clinical areas  use side-by-side dual computers: one to access VA health care records  and another to access DOD health care records. (See fig. 3.) Biloxi  officials reported that although this approach helps, it is time-consuming  and costly, and does not allow staff to share information as efficiently as  they would like; for example, there are costs to set up the dual computers  and it takes providers extra time to access both IT systems to review  information and share information with their collaboration partners. Biloxi  officials also are working with VA and DOD at the department level to test  a way of electronically sharing diagnostic images between facilities.", "At the department level, VA and DOD have worked for many years to  improve the ability of their IT systems to share medical information, and  have spent millions of dollars on those efforts, but those efforts have not  yet led to a comprehensive solution. As we have reported, VA and DOD  have increased their ability to electronically share information through a  patchwork of initiatives. In April 2009, the President announced that the  departments would define and build the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record  to streamline the transition of electronic medical, benefits, and  administrative information between the departments. Over the past few  years, the departments also began working to develop IT capabilities to  facilitate information sharing at the North Chicago Federal Health Care  Center joint venture that were intended to be \u201cexportable\u201d for use at other  VA and DOD collaboration sites. However, those efforts have been  delayed, in some cases indefinitely, resulting in costly and inefficient  workarounds.", "Most recently, the departments began work on a new common integrated  electronic health record (iEHR) that both VA and DOD would use for their  beneficiaries. In March 2011, the Secretaries of VA and Defense  committed the two departments to developing this new health record and  in May 2012 announced their goal of implementing it across the  departments by 2017. Officials from the joint DOD/VA Interagency  Program Office (IPO), which is leading the iEHR effort, told us they have substantial financial resources for the iEHR effort, reporting funding of  nearly $550 million across both VA and DOD for iEHR in fiscal year 2012  alone. They also said they have made some key decisions about the  project. For example, IPO officials plan to begin work at the Honolulu joint  venture in September 2012 on IT tools that would be part of the larger  iEHR effort, and test initial elements of iEHR at two pilot sites in 2014.", "However, the implementation time frame for the new iEHR effort is  uncertain. IPO officials told us in April 2012 that they planned to  implement elements of iEHR in a phased approach over time, but that full  implementation may not occur for at least 4 to 6 years, and that this  estimated time frame was both optimistic and uncertain. They said the  IPO office was not yet fully staffed, nor did they have final plans for how  iEHR would be developed and implemented given that many decisions  had yet to be made. For example, they had not yet determined what  clinical applications iEHR would include, the time frame for implementing  different elements of iEHR across all VA and DOD sites, or the order in  which they would implement iEHR at collaboration sites. IPO officials  noted that once they complete their work at the iEHR pilot sites they will  have a better sense of how the project would proceed. They added that  they might select a limited number of other sites to use elements of iEHR  as part of their early work on the project; they noted that although they  had not yet developed criteria for selecting those additional sites, the joint  venture sites would be among those considered.", "Overall, given the uncertainty about when and how iEHR will be  implemented, it is not clear when collaboration sites could expect to see  benefits from this new effort. Although local officials have expressed  interest in obtaining IT tools from the departments in the short term to  help address their IT barriers, IPO officials said their focus is on  developing iEHR rather than implementing separate IT tools at individual  facilities. In their view, separate interim efforts to improve the  interoperability of facilities\u2019 existing health IT systems would take time and  resources away from the larger effort to replace those existing systems  with iEHR, and it might only be beneficial to invest in local IT efforts that  inform the IPO\u2019s iEHR work. Until collaboration sites receive IT support  from the departments, they will continue to face IT barriers. In addition,  sites will continue to rely\u2014and expend resources on\u2014their own solutions  to address those barriers. Without information from the departments  regarding the plans for iEHR\u2014specifically, the time frame for when joint  ventures and other collaboration sites might begin to have iEHR solutions  implemented\u2014local officials will not know when they could begin to see  changes due to this new effort and be able to plan accordingly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration Sites\u2019 Business and Administrative Processes", "paragraphs": ["VA and DOD collaboration sites face a number of barriers with business  and administrative processes that hinder collaboration and are important  to their daily operations: reimbursement, capturing information on care  provided to patients, credentialing of providers, and computer security  training.", "Reimbursement for services provided to patients. Aspects of the  reimbursement process\u2014such as assigning diagnostic and procedure  codes to episodes of care (coding), and authorizing and paying for  services\u2014can pose problems, particularly when VA and DOD practices  differ. These problems can result in inefficient workarounds at the local  level, and difficulties such as backlogs of unpaid bills. Honolulu joint  venture officials shared several examples of reimbursement-related  difficulties including that the collaboration partners do not use the same  coding and billing standards, which can lead to discrepancies that can be  difficult to quickly resolve. Staff at DOD\u2019s Tripler Army Medical Center  code and bill care provided to veterans based on Military Health System standards, while VA staff reviewing those bills apply VA\u2019s standards,which can lead to difficulties reconciling the two approaches. Honolulu  officials said that differences in how VA and DOD treat same-day  surgeries, for example\u2014VA considers them outpatient services while  DOD considers them inpatient services\u2014lead to the need to manually  handle those bills, which takes time.", "Honolulu VA and DOD officials agreed that reimbursement difficulties  have had a substantial impact on their collaboration efforts, including on  their finances. A January 2012 Army review of billing issues at this  collaboration site found that there was more than $20 million in bills from  Tripler unpaid by VA for fiscal years 2009 through 2011, which included  bills that had not yet been processed or had been denied by VA. A July  2011 VA coding audit of bills submitted by Tripler Army Medical Center  stated that, as compared to VA\u2019s coding standards, DOD\u2019s coding was  accurate for about 80 percent of the codes used in the sample of bills  reviewed. The audit made recommendations to reduce the number of bills  needing manual review and expedite VA\u2019s payment of bills submitted by  Tripler. However, Honolulu VA and DOD officials did not always agree  with each other on the specific extent or the causes of their  reimbursement difficulties.", "Biloxi officials also shared examples of reimbursement issues. They  noted that differences in VA and DOD coding practices temporarily led to  delays in VA paying bills for care provided at Keesler Air Force Base,  because some VA and Air Force staff involved with billing and paying for  care were not initially familiar with the other collaboration partner\u2019s  reimbursement practices. In addition, they sometimes have needed to  negotiate solutions when VA and DOD\u2019s reimbursement practices differ.

Honolulu officials said  implementing an IT tool called \u201ceDR\u201dtheir business processes and that bills are now submitted in a faster  automated way rather than through the time-consuming manual method   has improved several aspects of  previously used.

Officials reported that this office facilitates communication  about issues such as coding and billing and helps resolve any difficulties  that arise.", "At the department level, VA and DOD officials said VA and DOD have  taken some steps to address reimbursement issues, but that sites will still  need to find ways to bridge VA and DOD\u2019s differences. VA and DOD  department-level officials have worked with Honolulu officials to address  their difficulties. For example, a group of VA, Army, and other DOD  officials began meeting in September 2011 to address coding issues at  the Honolulu joint venture; as of June 2012 their work was still ongoing. In addition, the departments supported the eDR effort at the Honolulu  joint venture by providing more than $3 million through JIF project  funding. Also, VA officials told us that VA has been working since 2009 to  implement the Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection System\u2014a  federal government effort to provide a standardized interagency fund  transfer mechanism for federal agencies\u2014which should help streamline  how VA receives and pays bills from DOD, although it would not  specifically address coding. Officials noted, however, that work on this  system has been halted or delayed several times, due in part to a lack of  funding; as of June 2012 VA officials were discussing when and how to  proceed but no final decisions had been made. Honolulu VA officials said  that this system would help improve their reimbursement process.", "DOD officials told us that while some coding difficulties occur at collaboration sites other  than at the Honolulu joint venture, the extent of the problem in Honolulu is unique and is in  part due to the large volume of care that the Army provides to VA at that location. evaluate and to justify the resources needed for their collaboration efforts.  These officials also noted that workload information can affect facilities\u2019  future funding. For example, leaders may be reluctant to support new JIF  project funding for additional providers if a collaboration site\u2019s current  providers seem underutilized due to the lack of workload information.", "Among the collaboration sites\u2019 difficulties collecting workload information,  Biloxi VA officials said that, until recently, they were unable to capture  workload information when Biloxi VA surgeons treated veterans at one of  their DOD collaboration partners\u2014Naval Hospital Pensacola\u2014because  that information was not captured through the billing process or in VA\u2019s IT  systems. DOD has faced similar problems when its providers care for  patients at the Biloxi VA facility. In addition, Honolulu VA officials said  reimbursement difficulties have led to delays in getting and paying bills  from Tripler, which has hindered their ability to capture workload  information through the billing process in a timely way.", "Biloxi and Honolulu officials have taken some steps to better collect  workload information. Biloxi officials reported a recent approach in which  Biloxi VA staff already located at Naval Hospital Pensacola collect  information about the care VA surgeons provide there; that information is  later entered into VA\u2019s IT system. Officials said this new solution seems to  work well, but takes time and resources, and is not as efficient as if their  IT systems allowed an easier way to collect this information. In addition,  some DOD providers who treat patients at the Biloxi VA facility now  separately enter workload information into DOD\u2019s IT system. Biloxi DOD  officials said this solution is a work in progress, but it would be preferable  if the IT systems allowed them to capture workload information, as some  clinical staff have said they don\u2019t have time for this extra data entry step.  Honolulu officials said that while they still have difficulties capturing  workload information as quickly as they would like, that their eDR IT tool  improved their ability to capture workload information in a more timely  way by automating aspects of the reimbursement process.", "At the department level, VA officials told us that the Intra-Governmental  Payment and Collection System effort related to bill payment would help  VA capture information when its providers deliver care at DOD facilities,  so that those providers and the VA facilities can get credit for the  workload. Honolulu VA officials said this system would improve their  ability to collect workload information because that information would  automatically be captured when they paid bills from DOD. As of June  2012, there had been no DOD-wide efforts to deal with workload capture  issues.", "Dual credentialing of providers. Providers who deliver care in both VA  and DOD facilities as part of collaboration efforts must be \u201ccredentialed\u201d  by both facilities. Credentialing is a process in which health care providers  are systematically screened and evaluated for their qualifications and  other credentials, including their licensure, education, training, and  current competence. Biloxi and Honolulu joint venture officials said that  the credentialing process is time-intensive and that dual credentialing  creates some duplication of effort as staff members repeat many  credentialing steps already completed by their collaboration partner.  Honolulu VA officials added that dual credentialing also can create delays  between the time new providers join their facility and when they can begin  clinical work at their collaboration partner\u2019s facility, because the extra  credentialing steps must first be completed. They said that it also  complicates staffing. For example, if a dually credentialed VA social  worker who works at Tripler Army Medical Center is on vacation or is ill,  VA cannot send a non-dually credentialed social worker to take that  person\u2019s place.", "At the department level, to address concerns about dual credentialing, a  Health Executive Council review resulted in a December 2010  memorandum of understanding between VA and DOD that was intended  to facilitate credentialing and reduce the time and costs associated with  dual credentialing. The memorandum established guidelines for how  credentialing information collected and verified by one department can be  shared with the other department. Under these guidelines, VA and DOD  facilities can share a range of information about providers as part of the  credentialing process, such as details about providers\u2019 education and  training. However, VA and DOD facilities must still independently verify  information that can expire or go out of date, such as providers\u2019 licensure  and board certification status. Biloxi officials told us that the ability to  use credentialing information collected by their collaboration partner has  helped facilitate the credentialing process, but noted that there is still a  fair amount of overlapping credentialing work to conduct. VA and DOD  department-level officials told us, in their view, the departments have  done all they can to streamline dual credentialing.", "Overlapping computer security training. According to VA and DOD,  staff involved with collaboration efforts have to complete both VA and  DOD computer security training to access both departments\u2019 IT systems,  which leads to some overlap in effort and loss of productivity because of  the time it takes staff to complete the dual training. The Health Executive  Council began work in June 2009 on a demonstration project examining  how to reduce the overlapping mandatory training taken by VA and DOD  staff, and selected computer security training as one of four high priority  focus areas.", "In August 2011, VA formally accepted three of the four DOD courses  reviewed as part of this demonstration, and as a result, will grant  reciprocity when DOD staff complete those courses and will not require  DOD staff to take VA\u2019s corresponding training courses. Although VA  developed a strategy for implementing this decision, as of May 2012 the  department had not made any progress in implementing the strategy,  according to VA officials. They cited a number of delays and said that VA  training of management staff would begin work on this effort once a  separate VA computer security initiative had been fully implemented;  however, they did not have an expected time frame for when  implementation would occur. In contrast to VA, DOD decided not to grant  reciprocity to VA staff for their VA computer security courses because,  according to DOD, officials decided that VA\u2019s courses were not similar  enough to DOD\u2019s to warrant reciprocity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accessing Medical Facilities on Military Bases", "paragraphs": ["According to VA and DOD officials, the procedures DOD uses to maintain  security at military base entrances can hinder access to medical facilities  located on bases for veterans and those accompanying them.

The need to ensure base  security may add some complexity and time for veterans and their escorts  accessing care on the base, as DOD personnel perform security checks  as part of their base access procedures. Such procedures may include  determining whether veterans and their escorts have sufficient  identification, and proof of vehicle insurance and registration; as well as  inspecting the vehicles transporting the veterans. (See fig. 4.) In some  cases, base personnel may require veterans to provide documentation of  their health care appointment or may conduct background screening in  which the veteran is vetted against government databases, such as the  National Crime Information Center. Access procedures can change over  time because of changes in local military leadership, guidance, and other  factors such as security threat levels.", "Officials told us these base access procedures can take time and in some  cases\u2014such as during specific episodes of heightened security\u2014may  prevent veterans from accessing care in a timely manner. Veterans who  are late to health care appointments due to access difficulties might be  unable to receive care and have to return for rescheduled appointments.  Such missed appointments can lead to lost revenue for the military  treatment facility, which will not receive reimbursement as expected, as  well as inefficiencies, when staff time allotted for seeing patients goes  unused. In addition, VA department-level officials told us that base access  issues could dissuade some local VA officials from partnering with DOD  medical facilities.

For example, VA\u2019s outpatient clinic is on the perimeter of the Navy  base that houses Naval Hospital Pensacola, and is separated from  the rest of the base by a security fence, which Biloxi VA and Navy  officials said facilitates easy public access for both veterans and Navy  personnel. Officials implemented a similar approach at Eglin Air Force  Base, also in Florida, where a VA clinic on Air Force property is  separated from the rest of the base by a gate that requires fingerprint  verification to allow entry. Officials noted that while these approaches  improve veterans\u2019 access to these VA outpatient facilities located on  DOD property, difficulties can still arise when veterans seek  emergency, inpatient, or other care from the military facilities located  on base.", "Biloxi officials started a shuttle service to transport veterans from the  VA medical center to Keesler Air Force Base to facilitate access for  veterans and their escorts, including those who may not otherwise  meet certain requirements for base entry; for example, veterans and  their escorts avoid the need to meet vehicle registration and  inspection requirements. This shuttle, however, requires added staff  and resources. According to officials, as a separate effort, staff call to  remind patients of the documentation needed to access the base;  however, patients still sometimes fail to bring the required  documentation, which can result in extra time needed to access the  base and sometimes lead to missed health care appointments.", "In Honolulu, Army officials decided to accept VA\u2019s Veteran  Identification Card as a valid form of identification for veterans going  to Tripler Army Medical Center for health care services, which officials  said improved access for veterans although not their escorts. Despite  this action, it can still take a lengthy amount of time for veterans and  their escorts to access the base because there is only one entry point  for all individuals entering the base, including VA and DOD staff, and  as a result long lines at the gate are common.

Specifically, the Joint Chiefs of Staff initiated a  new workgroup composed of VA and DOD officials to assess the military  services\u2019 current base security guidance and determine potential actions  that could facilitate veterans\u2019 access. As of July 2012, this workgroup had  met once to discuss the issues and to begin its review of relevant  guidance. One potential action the workgroup is considering is addressing  how military bases treat the Veteran Identification Card as part of base  access procedures. Currently, the military services have different  guidance regarding the use of the card by veterans for base access  purposes. VA department-level officials said that broader, more uniform  acceptance of the card across the military services would be a useful step  in facilitating access for veterans, but noted that it would not be a  comprehensive solution, because it would not apply to people  accompanying veterans to their appointments.", "VA and DOD could face some difficulties identifying base access  solutions that meet the security needs of military leadership, given the  varied and changing security needs at the local level.

The processes occur on different timelines and use  different criteria to rate and rank proposed projects, and in the past there  has been no formal mechanism for the departments to systematically  share information to identify opportunities for joint projects, according to  officials. As a result, a potential joint project may not move forward if it is  not deemed high priority by both departments,departments cannot secure approval and funding for it in the same time  frame.

Benning in Georgia illustrate some of the  difficulties VA and DOD have experienced in jointly planning for  construction of new medical facilities. Although VA and DOD officials saw  benefits\u2014including the opportunity to potentially save costs and improve  patient care\u2014to building a VA clinic that would either be part of the new  Army hospital currently under construction at Ft. Benning or on Army  property near the new hospital, the departments\u2019 misaligned construction  planning and funding processes were barriers to this effort, according to  VA and DOD officials.

Local VA and DOD officials noted that the inability to  build a VA clinic at the new Army hospital site or to colocate the clinics in  the community likely reduced some opportunities to avoid costs and  improve access to care. For example, VA officials said having a VA clinic  at the new hospital site likely would have allowed VA and DOD to share  the same laboratory and radiology services and could have improved  access by having VA and DOD resources on one campus.

Specifically, officials said they changed their plans after learning that  combining VA and Navy funds for a single joint clinic would have  exceeded VA\u2019s statutory limit for minor construction projects because the  total funding amount\u2014not just VA\u2019s contribution\u2014would count toward the  statutory limit. Officials said if they had reduced the project\u2019s scope to fall within VA\u2019s minor construction limit, it would not have met their needs  for clinical care, so they instead opted to build two separate clinics.  Officials were not certain of the cost impact of providing services in two  clinics rather than one, but believed doing so would be less efficient and  potentially more costly. For example, they said a single clinic would have  allowed for some logistical streamlining and avoided the need to duplicate  building services like electrical utilities. The departments could have  pursued this project as a major construction project rather than as a minor  construction project, but would have needed to obtain congressional  authorization to do so, since major construction projects generally must  be specifically authorized by Congress. VA and DOD department-level  officials added that potential major construction projects must compete  internally for approval; as a result, the departments would not necessarily  have approved this joint project to proceed as a proposed major  construction project.", "VA and DOD have taken several steps that have the potential to help  overcome some of the departments\u2019 differences and improve joint  planning for medical facility construction. For example, VA and DOD  officials participate in each other\u2019s construction planning processes, so  they can provide insight on each department\u2019s projects under  consideration and on other potential collaboration projects; officials said  that doing so has helped their collaboration efforts. The departments have  also worked together on legislative proposals that, in their view, could  enhance their ability to collaborate on joint efforts. For example, VA, in its  fiscal year 2013 congressional budget submission, stated that it would  propose legislative changes that would allow VA to transfer funds to\u2014and  receive funds from\u2014another federal agency to use for the planning,  design, or construction of a shared or joint medical facility, or to lease  space for such a facility; in June 2012, VA department-level officials told  us they were working on VA\u2019s legislative proposal. DOD is exploring  similar legislative changes. In addition, the departments are improving  their information sharing to better inform their planning processes. As an  initial step, VA and DOD department-level officials identified several types  of data to be shared between the departments to help identify  collaboration opportunities early in the construction planning process. As  a result, as part of the most recent round of VA\u2019s planning process, local  VA officials had access to information such as DOD population and  workload information to help them identify opportunities for joint  construction and leasing. Department-level DOD officials said they would  share VA population and workload data with the military services during  the next round of DOD\u2019s planning process as well. Officials from both  departments said they plan to build on these initial efforts by refining their  data sharing processes. For example, officials are exploring sharing  additional types of data to inform their departments\u2019 construction planning  processes and have identified the need to institute a more formalized  process for sharing data with local officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA and DOD Do Not Have a Fully Developed Process for Systematically Identifying New and Enhanced Collaboration Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["VA and DOD do not have a fully developed process for systematically  identifying opportunities for new or enhanced collaboration that could  facilitate the departments\u2019 shared goals of improving access, quality, and  costs. Instead, the identification of new or enhanced collaboration  opportunities is largely left to local medical facility leadership. Although  the departments do have a process for jointly identifying a select number  of sites where there are opportunities for new or expanded collaboration,  that process does not address all options for collaboration across both  health care systems, nor is there a requirement that the sites identified by  that process move forward with collaboration. Until VA and DOD fully  develop a joint process to systematically identify and pursue potential  collaboration opportunities, the departments may miss opportunities to  improve patients\u2019 access to and quality of care, and to reduce costs, such  as by addressing overlap and duplication of services that may exist  between the two health care systems.   we reported on ways  In our previous work on interagency collaboration,for agencies to facilitate and enhance their collaboration efforts, including  ways to reduce the costly government duplication and overlap that can  cost taxpayers billions of dollars each year. Our prior work has found that  strategic direction is required as the basis for collaboration.

In addition, agencies can facilitate and enhance their  collaboration efforts by establishing compatible ways of working together  across agency boundaries.", "However, VA and DOD do not have a fully developed process and a  sufficient strategic direction to work across agency boundaries to fully  identify collaboration opportunities. Specifically, the departments have not  fully developed and formalized a systematic process to review all  possibilities for new and expanded collaboration, but instead largely leave  the identification of new or enhanced collaboration opportunities to  leaders at local VA and DOD medical facilities. For example, the  decisions to pursue sharing agreements, JIF project funding, and joint  venture status are at the discretion of local leadership. Neither  departmental or joint VA and DOD guidance describe a systematic  department-level process for the identification of all potential collaboration  opportunities that may exist between the departments. DOD\u2019s instruction  that governs health care collaboration with VA states that the leaders of  DOD\u2019s military treatment facilities are to monitor emerging opportunities  for collaboration and to conduct financial analyses and negotiate sharing  agreements with local VA medical facilities, among other things. Similarly, VA\u2019s handbook that defines procedures for health care  collaboration with DOD medical facilities states that leadership of VA  medical centers may decide to pursue collaboration options with DOD  such as sharing agreements, JIF project funding, and joint venture  status.said these decisions are largely left to local leaders because they do not  have authority over local facilities; rather they can only offer guidance.  Further, officials said local-level officials have more direct knowledge of  their locations, and as such, are better positioned to assess their unique  circumstances and determine what types of collaboration make the most  sense.", "DOD, DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Resource Sharing  Program, DOD Instruction 6010.23 (Jan. 23, 2012). departments acknowledged that collaboration is dependent on local  leaders\u2019 personalities and willingness to collaborate; some leaders may  be greatly interested in exploring collaboration opportunities, while others  may not. Moreover, given the regular changes in military treatment facility  leadership, local leaders\u2019 interest and commitment to collaborating can  change over time. One additional difficulty with decisions made outside of  a broader systematic process is that local medical facility leadership may  not have readily available access to information necessary to examine  what health care services could benefit from collaboration. For example,  local leaders may not know when providing certain health care services  through collaboration efforts rather than by purchasing care from non-VA  or non-DOD providers would be likely to result in significant cost savings.  Without comprehensive information on such purchased care, officials may  be hindered in their efforts to identify areas or services that could be  purchased from or provided to a partner facility at a lower negotiated rate,  thus reducing costs to the federal government and possibly providing  additional nonfinancial benefits. Some local officials we spoke with said  they encountered difficulties obtaining purchased care information from  their collaboration partner, and in one case encountered some resistance  internally regarding sharing such information with their partner.", "In an effort to facilitate more department-level direction and systemize the  identification of collaboration opportunities, the departments implemented  a process to identify a select number of sites where there are  opportunities for new or enhanced collaboration, and designate them as  Joint Market Opportunities (JMO) sites. However this process has  limitations, because it does not identify all opportunities; is not formalized  in guidance; and is not enforceable, as local officials still have discretion  about which opportunities to pursue.

VA  and DOD officials define JMO sites as areas that have opportunities for  sharing resources and risk that should be explored. Currently, the  departments have identified 15 JMO sites. Several JMO sites have  resulted in new or enhanced sharing agreements as an example of  improved collaboration, according to VA and DOD officials. For example,  the Charleston, South Carolina, area was designated as a JMO, and in  subsequent years after designation, medical facility partners within that  JMO jointly constructed a new facility and obtained joint venture status.", "However, the JMO process is limited as it does not involve a systematic  approach to reviewing and identifying all new or enhanced collaboration  opportunities that exist. Given that only a few JMOs are identified each  year, the departments may be missing opportunities to encourage  collaboration at other locations.

The work group does not have the authority to  require\u2014or provide oversight of\u2014implementation of their  recommendations regarding collaboration; rather, it serves in an advisory  and support function only. For example, Columbus, Georgia, was  previously considered a JMO site because of potential joint construction  between VA and the Army at Ft. Benning. An official from VA stated that  the work group performed a site visit to examine options for collaboration  and provide support and advice to local medical facility leadership, but  VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s construction planning processes did not align and, as we  noted earlier, proved to be barriers to joint construction at this location.

In  particular, the departments have not taken sufficient actions to: develop  and use performance measures to assess the effectiveness and  efficiency of collaboration, overcome key barriers to collaboration, and  identify new or enhanced collaboration opportunities. Specifically, the lack  of comprehensive department-wide performance measures related to  access, quality, and costs related to collaboration efforts may limit key  decision makers\u2019 ability to adequately assess the effectiveness of those  or other future health care collaborations.
