U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported that it does not expect to collect most of that debt. GAO found that most AD/CV duty bills were paid and that unpaid bills were concentrated among a small number of importers, with 20 accounting for about 50 percent of the $2.3 billion uncollected. CBP data show that most of those importers stopped importing before receiving their first AD/CV duty bill. As GAO has previously reported, the U.S. AD/CV duty system involves the retrospective assessment of duties, such that the final amount of AD/CV duties an importer owes can significantly exceed the initial amount paid at the estimated duty rate when the goods entered the country.", "CBP has undertaken efforts to improve its collection of AD/CV duties or to protect against the risk of unpaid final duty bills through bonding, but these efforts have yielded limited results. For example, CBP launched an initiative to reduce processing errors that result in CBP closing duty bills at the initial duty rate rather than the final duty rate, such that the initial duty paid may be significantly higher or lower than the final duty amount owed. Though the initiative has shown positive results, as of May 2016, its application had been limited. In addition, CBP had not collected and analyzed data systematically to help it monitor and minimize these duty processing errors. As a result, CBP does not know the extent of these errors and cannot take timely or effective action and avoid the potential revenue loss they may represent.", "CBP's limited analysis of the risk to revenue from potentially uncollectible AD/CV duties (nonpayment risk) misses opportunities to identify and mitigate nonpayment risk. The standard definition of risk with regard to some negative event that could occur includes both the likelihood of the event and the significance of the consequences if the event occurs; however, CBP does not attempt to assess either of these risk components for any given entry of goods subject to AD/CV duties. GAO's analysis, applying standard statistical methods, demonstrates that a more comprehensive analysis of CBP data related to AD/CV duties is feasible and could help CBP better identify key factors associated with nonpayment risk and take steps to mitigate it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CBP (1) issue guidance to collect and analyze data on a regular basis to find and address the causes of AD/CV duty liquidation errors and track progress; (2) regularly conduct a comprehensive risk analysis that considers likelihood as well as significance of risk factors related to duty nonpayment; and (3) take steps to use its data and risk assessment strategically to mitigate AD/CV duty nonpayment consistent with U.S. law and international trade obligations.

U.S. law authorizes  the assessment of antidumping (AD) duties on products exported to the  United States at unfairly low prices (i.e., dumped) and countervailing (CV)  duties on products exported to the United States that are subsidized by  foreign governments. The Department of Commerce (Commerce) sets  an initial estimated AD/CV duty rate, based on the estimated margin of  dumping or amount of the subsidy, and later determines a final duty rate  based on actual imports. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is  then responsible for collecting the duty amount owed. According to an  October 2015 CBP report to Congress, CBP identified the accumulated  AD/CV duty revenue uncollected as of the time of the report to be $3  billion, including principal and interest.", "According to that CBP report, the vast majority of manufacturers,  exporters, importers, customs brokers, and other parties involved in  shipments of goods subject to AD/CV duties lawfully pay the duties  owed. However, as the CBP report notes, elements of the U.S. system  for determining and collecting AD/CV duties create an inherent risk that  some importers will not pay the full amount they owe in AD/CV duties. As  we have previously reported, three related factors create a heightened  risk of AD/CV duty nonpayment: (1) The U.S. system for determining  such duties involves the setting of an initial estimated duty rate upon the  entry of goods, followed by the retrospective assessment of a final duty  rate; (2) the amount of AD/CV duties for which an importer may be  ultimately billed can significantly exceed what the importer pays when the  goods enter the country; and (3) the assessment of final AD/CV duties  can occur up to several years after an importer enters goods into the  United States, during which time the importer may cease operations or  become unable to pay additional duties.", "The persistently large and growing amount of uncollected AD/CV duties  has raised concerns in Congress and among domestic industries affected  by dumped or subsidized imports. You asked us to conduct a follow-up  review to provide an update on our 2008 report, which identified key  factors contributing to uncollected AD/CV duties and the steps CBP had  taken to address those factors. This report (1) examines the status and  composition of uncollected AD/CV duties, (2) the extent to which CBP has  taken steps to improve its billing and collection of AD/CV duties, and (3)  the extent to which CBP assesses and mitigates the risk to revenue from  potentially uncollectible AD/CV duties.", "To examine the status and composition of uncollected AD/CV duties, we  analyzed CBP data on all open, delinquent duty bills for entries from  fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2014, as of May 12, 2015. For this  purpose, we combined three datasets from CBP\u2019s Automated  Commercial System (ACS) containing information on entries and billed  amounts associated with entries. ACS is used by CBP to track, control,  and process all goods entering the United States. The first ACS dataset  contained AD/CV duty entry data; the second contained final assessed  AD/CV duty rate data; and the third contained importer AD/CV duty billing  data. As part of our examination of the status and composition of  uncollected AD/CV duties, we analyzed the extent to which CBP writes off  uncollectible bills. In addition to analyzing data to determine the status  and composition of uncollected AD/CV duties, we reviewed relevant  statutes, regulations, and agency reports, and interviewed CBP and  Commerce officials.", "To examine the extent to which CBP has taken steps to improve its billing  and collection of AD/CV duties, we obtained and analyzed ACS data;  reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and agency reports; and we  interviewed CBP, Commerce, and Department of the Treasury (Treasury)  officials. Customs bonds are used to safeguard revenue, and, according  to CBP officials, these bonds play an important role in CBP\u2019s efforts to  improve AD/CV duty collections. For that reason, we met with three of  the major associations that represent the companies that issue customs  bonds.", "To examine the extent to which CBP assesses and mitigates the risk to  revenue from potentially uncollectible AD/CV duties, we analyzed ACS  data on all open, delinquent duty bills for entries from fiscal year 2001  through fiscal year 2014, as of May 12, 2015. We also reviewed CBP\u2019s  risk assessment and interviewed cognizant CBP officials to determine  what risk factors these officials identify in their analysis of AD/CV debts  and discuss in CBP reports to Congress. We assessed CBP\u2019s risk  management efforts with regard to potentially uncollectible AD/CV duties  against federal internal control standards, which state that agency  managers should comprehensively identify risks and analyze them for  their possible effects. We also developed two regression models to  estimate the likelihood of nonpayment for any given entry as well as the  size of loss if nonpayment occurred; mathematically, these are the two  components of expected loss. We did this to show how a statistical model  could be constructed that addresses the association between potential  risk factors and the potential for nonpayment. Our regression models do  not establish whether a given factor causes nonpayment or is merely  correlated with this risk. To be useful for risk management, such a model  would need to be able to predict future nonpayment risk. As a result, to  assess the ability of the model to predict future losses, we repeatedly  tested its ability to identify nonpayment risk in data not used to construct  the model. We further analyzed the data for two separate 5-year periods  and conducted qualitative assessments of parameter stability. We  presented the results of our analysis to CBP officials on two occasions  and made adjustments to the methodology based on their feedback. The  models provide an example of how CBP data could be systematically  analyzed to provide insights into bill delinquency patterns, but we do not  intend them to be prescriptive.", "In conducting our review, we assessed the reliability of the ACS and  Commerce data we used. We did this by (1) performing electronic testing  of required data elements, (2) reviewing existing information about the  data and the systems that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data and the systems that produced the  data. We identified a number of limitations to the data. As a result, we  excluded certain portions of the data from our analysis and included  several assumptions. After making these exclusions and assumptions, we  further tested the data and found it to be generally reliable for the  purposes of our analysis.

The U.S. AD/CV duty collection process typically involves  the five steps summarized below and illustrated in figure 1.  1.  Commerce communicates the initial estimated duty rate to CBP:  Commerce issues an AD/CV duty order that specifies the products for  which importers must pay AD/CV duties. The order communicates  the initial estimated duty rates applicable to one or more specific  exporters, producers, or both, as well as a catchall rate or, if  appropriate, a countrywide rate for all other exporters and producers  that were not individually investigated and that did not receive a  specific rate. The order also instructs CBP to collect cash deposits  at the time of importation for estimated duties owed on all entries of  the applicable products. These duty rates represent Commerce\u2019s  initial estimates of the level of dumping or subsidization. Commerce  typically communicates to the public the initial estimated duty rate that  must be applied in the Federal Register.  2.  CBP reviews importers\u2019 assessments of duties owed and  collects the initial estimated duty from the importer: The importer  determines the value of estimated duties owed by applying the initial  rate set in the applicable AD/CV duty order to its imports. CBP  reviews the importer\u2019s assertions for correctness and collects the  required cash deposits or bonds from the importer. According to CBP  officials, estimated duties are usually due within 10 days after CBP  has released the product for entry into the United States.  3.  Commerce determines and communicates the final duty rate to  CBP: Each year, during the anniversary month of the publication of an  AD or CV duty order, an interested party may ask Commerce to  conduct an administrative review to determine the actual amount of  dumping or subsidization and calculate a final duty rate. This can  occur if the party believes that the initial estimated rate is too high or  too low. During the administrative review, Commerce analyzes  previous imports to determine the actual level of dumping or  subsidization for those imports during the period under review. At the  conclusion of the administrative review (typically about 12\u201318 months  after the review began), Commerce establishes the final duty rate  (also known as the liquidation rate) for the goods. If an  administrative review is not requested, then the final duty rate is  generally the same as the initial estimated duty rate. Commerce  typically communicates to the public the final duty rate that must be  applied in the Federal Register. Commerce sends CBP liquidation  instructions communicating the final duty rate and designating the  importers, producers, or both that are associated with the entries to  which the rate must be applied. According to CBP officials, the  liquidation instructions are communicated first to the AD/CV Division,  a headquarters unit within CBP\u2019s Office of Trade.  4.  CBP instructs ports to apply the final duty rate and calculate final  duties: CBP instructs staff at each applicable U.S. port of entry to  assess the final duties on all relevant goods (i.e., applying the final  rate to the value of applicable goods that have entered since the order  was issued).  5.  CBP liquidates the import entry and may issue a refund or a bill:  CBP liquidates the entry, which can result in CBP\u2019s issuing a bill to the  importer (if the liquidation rate is higher than the initial estimated rate)  or refunding money (if the initial estimated rate is higher than the  liquidation rate). If the initial estimated and final duty rates are the  same, CBP liquidates the entry without issuing a bill or refund. CBP  must liquidate these entries within a 6-month time limit that begins  when CBP receives a notice, such as final duty rate instructions from  Commerce or notification from a court or another agency that the  suspension of liquidation that was placed on those entries has been  lifted. Otherwise, the entry will be liquidated by operation of law at  the initial estimated duty rate regardless of whether the final rate has  changed.

The bond is like an insurance policy protecting the U.S.  government against revenue loss if an importer defaults on its financial  obligations. CBP allows importers to provide two types of basic  importation and entry customs bonds\u2014a continuous entry bond and a  single transaction bond\u2014to secure the duties, taxes, and fees associated  with the import of goods into the United States. Continuous entry bonds  are used to secure financial obligations for one or more entries for a  period of up to 365 days; single transaction bonds are used to secure  financial obligations related to a specific entry. If an importer fails to pay  the full amount owed on a final duty bill for an AD/CV duty entry, CBP will  attempt to collect payment from the company that underwrote the bond  for the entry (referred to as the \u201csurety\u201d). The amount CBP may be able to  collect from the surety depends on how much the bond covers. In some  cases, the bond issued by the surety may cover the entire amount owed;  in other cases, it may only cover a small portion of the debt\u2014depending  on the size of the bond and size of the additional duties resulting from a  higher final duty rate.

CBP will send the  importer monthly bills. According to CBP officials, if CBP does not receive  full payment of the bill for additional duties within approximately 8 months  of sending the bill and the importer does not file a protest, CBP sanctions  the delinquent importer by requiring full payment of all estimated duties,  taxes, and fees before any products subsequently imported by that  importer can be released by CBP into U.S. commerce. Separately, if the  bill has not been paid 60 days after it was issued, CBP will also request  payment from the surety that underwrote the bond that the importer  provided when the goods entered the United States. After CBP has  requested payment from a surety, that surety has 180 days to pay the  bond amount or protest the bill. Importers are responsible for the full  amount of additional duties owed; sureties will generally cover the cost of  a bill only up to the value of the bond. The AD/CV duty collection process  is completed when and if the importer, the surety, or the two together pay  the full amount of the duty and interest owed or the duty is written off.", "CBP\u2019s ports generally handle the bill creation process, including collecting  payments for duties that are not delinquent from importers. However, if a  bill becomes delinquent, the Revenue Division within CBP\u2019s Office of  Finance takes the primary responsibility for collecting payment from either  the importer or the surety or both. In general, if CBP does not receive full  payment of duties and interest owed, CBP\u2019s Revenue Division researches  the account and recommends next steps to CBP\u2019s Office of Chief  Counsel, which determines whether options for collection are available  through the legal process. The Office of Chief Counsel in turn can refer  the matter to the Department of Justice for prosecution. When CBP  determines that a bill for additional AD/CV duties is uncollectible, the  Revenue Division and the Office of Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction  with the Office of Chief Counsel, can take steps to write off the bill.

Our analysis  of CBP data on AD/CV duty bills for entries occurring in fiscal years 2001  through 2014 shows that, of the approximately 41,000 unpaid bills, the  average age was about 4 years, and the median age was 4.5 years. In  addition, 977 unpaid bills were issued between 10 and 13 years ago;  based on CBP\u2019s reporting on challenges to collection, then, it seems that  CBP would have an extremely low likelihood of collecting those bills.  Figure 9 shows the distribution of delinquent AD/CV duty bills by age.", "Once CBP has exhausted its collection efforts, the next step is for CBP  staff to prepare the bill for write-off by documenting what was found  during the investigation of the debt and submitting this documentation to  the Office of Chief Counsel and the Chief Financial Officer for review and  approval. CBP provides staff guidance on steps and documentation  required to prepare an unpaid bill for write-off but does not set specific  time frames for writing off uncollectible debt. While CBP staff may begin  the write-off process for uncollectible bills as they are identified, according  to agency officials, preparing bills for write-off is generally a lower priority  than pursuing debt considered collectible. As a result, CBP does not  consistently write off bills. Figure 10 shows the dollar amount of AD/CV  duty bills written off each year since 2001. As of October 2015, CBP had  written off about $252 million in AD/CV duties from 2001 through 2014.  CBP officials stated that the high dollar amount of write-offs in 2013 was  not attributable to a specific cause.", "Currently, according to agency officials, CBP is considering the feasibility  of contracting with private collection agencies to pursue debts for which  the agency has exhausted all administrative collection efforts, including  claims against applicable surety bonds.

We developed the following  examples to illustrate the comparative risk of entries according to this  definition of risk as a total of uncollected dollars.", "An entry of product C, which is associated with a 1.1 percent overall  nonpayment rate and has imports of $100 million per year ($1.1  million total unpaid), would be considered a greater risk to revenue  than an entry of product D, which is associated with a 50 percent  nonpayment rate and has imports of $2 million per year ($1 million  total unpaid), even though a given entry of product D is statistically far  likelier to become associated with an uncollected bill.", "An entry of product E, a product for which all uncollected duties date  from entries occurring 10 years ago, would be considered as  presenting a similar risk to revenue as an entry of product F, for which  the same amount of uncollected duties exists but from entries  occurring 1 or 2 years ago\u2014even if all entries of product E have had  duties paid on time over the past 9 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Comprehensive Analysis Could Help CBP Better Identify Key Risk Factors", "paragraphs": ["Analyzing data on entries subject to AD/CV duties provided by CBP, we  applied standard statistical methods to explore nonpayment risk and  found that controlling for a range of country, product, and other entry  characteristics explains much of the risk of AD/CV duty nonpayment for  the time periods we evaluated. While we used a number of diagnostic  tests to assess the stability and predictive power of the risk factors  estimated by our model, additional data and alternative modeling  approaches could produce different results. Specifically, among other  things, our analysis shows the following:", "Entries of products from countries other than China were estimated to  be likelier to be associated with AD/CV duty nonpayments. These risk  levels vary over time, meaning that some past risks are not  contemporary risks.", "Products other than the five from China associated with cases that  CBP identifies as presenting the highest risk of nonpayment of AD/CV  duties were both estimated to be likelier to be associated with  nonpayments of such duties and to represent greater losses when  nonpayment occurs. These risks also vary over time.", "Other entry characteristics, such as the dollar value of the importer\u2019s  goods subject to duties, the use of a bond instead of cash to pay initial  estimated duties, and the size of the final duty bill increase over the  initial estimated duties were each estimated to be significantly  associated with the entry\u2019s overall risk level for uncollected duties.

Our  analysis estimates that imports of products from China present a risk in  terms of the likelihood of nonpayment, as well as the dollar loss of  nonpayment, but it also estimates that imports of products from other  countries may actually pose a greater risk in some cases\u2014all other entry  characteristics being equal. Our analysis also shows that risk factors,  including the risk associated with country of origin, vary over time.", "While controlling for other entry characteristics, we computed the  additional expected loss associated with the country of origin of an  entry.

To investigate whether  estimated risks change over time, we divided the dataset into two 5-year  periods.", "For 2009\u20132013, entries of imports from China accounted for the vast  majority of uncollected bills.

Specifically, our analysis estimates the following for the time  periods we evaluated:", "For many types of products, entries of imports from China are not  likelier to result in unpaid duties than otherwise identical entries of  imports from other countries. While imports from China account for  about 84 percent of unpaid AD/CV duties associated with entries  during fiscal years 2009 through 2013, as of May 12, 2015, some of  the apparent risk from these entries can be explained by the large  volume of imports from China subject to AD/CV duties. In addition,  certain products imported in large volume from China in 2009\u20132013,  such as preserved mushrooms, are associated with increased  probability of nonpayment. Controlling for such high-risk product  types, in addition to the other shipment characteristics discussed  below, shows that relatively little risk is associated directly with an  entry\u2019s being from China.", "While the average unpaid AD/CV duty bill associated with imports  from China was more than 23 times larger than the average such bill  associated with imports from Mexico in 2009\u20132013, the estimated  likelihood of nonpayment was somewhat lower for imports from China,  and the estimated dollar loss per nonpayment was identical for  imports from the two countries (see fig. 13). In other words, an entry  from Mexico with the same characteristics as a given entry from  China, such as entry size and product type, had slightly greater  estimated risk. However, this result is not apparent without a  comprehensive analysis of data, such as the regression model we  developed, because the typical entry from Mexico had very different  characteristics than the typical entry from China.", "Figure 13 shows how entries from certain countries have greater  estimated risk than those from China in terms of probability of  nonpayment. As shown in the chart, otherwise identical entries of  products from Denmark, Mexico, Japan, India, Thailand, and Vietnam  are associated with a greater probability of nonpayment than entries  of products from China in the 2009\u20132013 period.", "Our analysis further shows that the estimated nonpayment risk  associated with the country of origin of an import can change  considerably over time. As figure 13 demonstrates, the nonpayment risks  associated with country of origin in the two periods we examined were  significantly different. In 2004\u20132008 the estimated nonpayment risks  associated with imports from the United Arab Emirates were nearly  identical to the estimated risks associated with imports from China. In this  earlier period, estimated losses per nonpayment were much lower for  imports from India and Denmark than for imports from China in 2004\u2013 2008; in addition, while the estimated probabilities of nonpayment for  imports from Thailand and Vietnam remained higher, entries of products  from these countries were associated with lower estimated losses per  nonpayment. India, Thailand, and Vietnam all had equal loss per  nonpayment and greater probability of nonpayment than China in 2009\u2013 2013.

Using data  provided by CBP, we identified a group of entry characteristics other than  country of origin or product type associated with nonpayment risk, such  as the length of an importer\u2019s entry history and number of previous  delinquencies. Because these other entry characteristics correlate with  both nonpayment risk and certain product types and countries of origin,  controlling for these other characteristics is necessary to avoid incorrectly  overstating or understating the risks associated with the characteristics  country of origin and product type.", "Our analysis suggests that, for products entered between 2009 and 2013,  six entry characteristics, in addition to country of origin and product type,  were significantly associated with either estimated likelihood of  nonpayment or estimated size of the loss per nonpayment, or both.

When a risk is identified through this process, these officials said that  CBP can increase the bonding requirements for an entry, which reduces  CBP\u2019s exposure to potential losses from unpaid duties.", "As previously noted, federal internal control standards state that agency  managers should comprehensively identify risks and analyze them for  their possible effects, as well as design responses to these risks as  necessary to mitigate these risks. Because governmental, economic,  industry, regulatory, and operating conditions continually change, the  standards also note that risk management efforts should include  mechanisms to identify and deal with ongoing changes in the likelihood or  significance of risk factors.", "To date, however, CBP has undertaken a few limited efforts to use its  data to help identify and mitigate the risk of uncollected AD/CV duties. For  example, as discussed previously, CBP\u2019s AD/CV Collections Team  initiated Operation Lost and Found in April 2015 to take advantage of  specialized databases and information maintained by the National  Targeting Center and the AD/CV National Targeting and Analysis Group  to identify active importers with ties to inactive, delinquent AD/CV debtors.", "In 2015, CBP also briefly utilized a Department of Defense contract with  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Johns Hopkins University to examine  the use of systematic data analysis techniques to reduce AD/CV duty  evasion. CBP officials said a 3-week trial resulted in significant findings  and has determined that systematic data analysis techniques may be  useful for identifying importers attempting to evade AD/CV duties;  however, CBP has not yet determined whether and how such analysis  might be used to improve AD/CV duty collection.", "Implementing a more comprehensive risk analysis system, using  standard statistical methods such as those we used in building our proof- of-concept model, CBP could better assess nonpayment risk with its  current data. Doing so would enable CBP to identify a more complete list  of risk factors ranked in order of priority. Such analysis would support a  decision-making process enabling CBP to take more effective actions to  mitigate the nonpayment risk. Any such actions would also need to take  into consideration U.S. international trade obligations as well as relevant  U.S. court rulings. Most of the factors we identified that explain  nonpayment risk are known to CBP at the time an entry arrives when  CBP collects initial AD/CV duties, such as the importer\u2019s history and the  entry size. The remaining factors are known to CBP at the time it issues  the final AD/CV duty bill, such as the increase in final billed amount  relative to initial estimated duties. We determined that these entry  characteristics predict nonpayment risk well when using 4 or more years  of historical data and could be used to predict payment outcomes on  future bills. Therefore, as figure 16 illustrates, CBP could use regression  models similar to what we developed as an empirical tool for weighting  the importance of risk factors for AD/CV entries and importers. For  example, for newly arriving entries, these weighted risk factors, updated  periodically, would be multiplied by the observed characteristics of the  entry to yield estimated values for (1) probability of nonpayment and (2)  dollar loss if nonpayment occurs. Further multiplying these two  estimated values would yield expected loss\u2014an estimate of the risk of  uncollected duties constituting a concise risk score that is comparable  across all entries of goods subject to AD/CV duties.", "CBP could use such a risk score strategically to mitigate nonpayment risk  in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the following four ways:", "Triggering the need for an entry review by officials. As described  above, when a newly arriving entry\u2019s estimated risk score exceeds a  predetermined threshold, CBP could begin a process of qualitative  review by officials with appropriate expertise to determine whether a  larger bonding requirement is appropriate and would be consistent  with U.S. international trade obligations and relevant U.S. court  rulings. Our analysis shows that a substantial proportion of risk  associated with the likelihood of nonpayment and some of the risk  associated with the size of the loss can be explained with information  available to CBP at the time an entry arrives, even with our limited  dataset. More sophisticated models that could further incorporate  CBP\u2019s institutional expertise would likely be able to predict risk even  more effectively. Such predictive modeling as described above\u2014or a  similar approach\u2014has the potential to be a valuable tool because, as  CBP officials noted, the time of entry is when CBP has the best  opportunity to enforce collection of the duties owed to the U.S.  government.", "Targeting high-risk duty bills. When final duties are assessed for an  entry and a bill is issued, CBP may be able to enhance its collection  efforts by targeting high-risk bills using additional data available at that  time, recalculating the risk score assigned at time of entry. As  mentioned earlier, these additional data include, for example, risk  factors such as the length of the review process and the amount of  any increase over the initial estimated duties paid when the entry first  arrived.", "Assessing ongoing aggregate risk posed by specific importers.  As we discussed earlier, many of the importers with the largest total  unpaid AD/CV duty bills imported 200 or more entries over a period  longer than a year. CBP may be able to use a predictive model to  assess the ongoing aggregate risk posed by an importer, even if final  bills have not yet been issued and, if applied in a manner consistent  with U.S. international trade obligations and relevant U.S. court  rulings, use this information to adjust the importer\u2019s continuous entry  bond requirements. This may be particularly useful to mitigate risk  from high-volume importers from whom individual entries do not  present large expected losses.", "Assessing the effectiveness of policy changes intended to  mitigate risk. CBP could use regression models such as the one we  developed\u2014or similar approaches\u2014to examine its data  retrospectively to assess the impact of policy changes intended to  mitigate the risk of uncollected AD/CV duties. For example, CBP  could assess whether there is a meaningful change in this risk for a  specific group of interest, such as bond users, associated with a  particular policy intervention, such as the changes to restrict access to  bonds used in lieu of cash to pay initial estimated tariffs in 2006 and  2011.", "CBP officials cited limited staff resources and data systems as obstacles  to systematically model and predict risk of AD/CV duty nonpayment.  These officials said that CBP may not have the staff and resources that  would be required to engage in such an effort. They noted that CBP\u2019s  recent efforts to use data more strategically have been limited and  depend on leveraging expertise from different units of CBP. In addition,  these CBP officials said that their data systems store information in a  manner that is difficult to access and analyze and that it may be missing  certain data necessary to undertake predictive modeling. Moreover,  CBP\u2019s current information systems make it difficult to do large-scale data  runs and cannot generate real-time output. Nonetheless, we found that  standard statistical methods were sufficient to predict nonpayment risk,  and we were able to combine all necessary data pulled from CBP  databases using a commercial computer workstation and software; such  analysis would not necessarily require CBP to invest in special computing  systems or prohibitively expensive software. Finally, the risk-score  method described above would not require real-time data\u2014only periodic  checks to update risk-factor weighting.", "As discussed previously, CBP officials said that a past ruling by the WTO  has constrained CBP\u2019s use of bonds because the WTO determined that  CBP\u2019s application of an enhanced bonding policy on all shrimp importers  from certain countries was inconsistent with U.S. obligations at the  WTO. CBP officials explained that as a result of the WTO\u2019s ruling, CBP  now determines the requirement for an importer to obtain a bond on a  case-by-case basis. However, CBP officials told us that targeting  analytics they currently perform, an analysis that is specifically tailored to  the individual shipment, would not be a blanket approach like past  enhanced bonding efforts on shrimp. Specifically, CBP officials explained  that although the WTO previously found the manner in which CBP applied  its enhanced bonding requirement to be inconsistent with WTO principles,  the WTO did not disagree with the concept of appropriately addressing  risk through revised bonding requirements. CBP officials stated that CBP  might be able to make good use of the statistical analysis methods GAO  presented. For example, such an analysis could be used to assess a  requirement for additional security in the form of bonds as part of an  enhanced bonding requirement, according to these officials. However,  they cautioned that the use of bonding in this way would have to be  carefully tailored in order to avoid a legal challenge."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We estimate the amount of uncollected duties on entries from fiscal year  2001 through 2014 to be $2.3 billion. While CBP collects on most AD/CV  duty bills it issues, it only collects, on average, about 31 percent of the  dollar amount owed. The large amount of uncollected duties is due in part  to the long lag time between entry and billing in the U.S. retrospective  AD/CV duty collection system, with an average of about 2-and-a-half  years between the time goods enter the United States and the date a bill  may be issued. Large differences between the initial estimated duty rate  and the final duty rate assessed also contribute to unpaid bills, as  importers receiving a large bill long after an entry is made may be  unwilling or unable to pay. In 2015, CBP estimated that about $1.6 billion  in duties owed was uncollectible. By not fully collecting unpaid AD/CV  duty bills, the U.S. government loses a substantial amount of revenue and  compromises its efforts to deter and remedy unfair and injurious trade  practices.", "CBP faces a number of challenges in its efforts to improve its collection of  AD/CV duties. CBP does not know the extent to which it liquidates entries  in an untimely manner, nor does it know the effects such liquidations have  on revenue. To mitigate the number of entries liquidated at the initial  estimated duty rate instead of the final duty rate set by Commerce, CBP  has begun an initiative to centralize and improve oversight of liquidation  processing at the ports; however, CBP does not systematically collect  and analyze data from this effort or assess impact on revenue. CBP says  it has plans to collect and analyze data for management use once the  initiative is fully implemented in the beginning of fiscal year 2017 but as of  May 2016 had not issued guidance to this effect. Without systematically  collecting and analyzing data on a regular basis to ascertain liquidation  trends at ports of entry and offices, CBP cannot determine the extent to  which premature and deemed liquidations are taking place or take timely  and effective action to avoid premature or deemed liquidations and the  potential revenue loss they represent. In separate but related efforts, CBP  has created an AD/CV duty collections team, plans to collect more  information about importers, and has taken steps to centralize the  management of bonds\u2014after revising its bonding formulas to better  enable it to protect AD/CV duty revenue. These efforts, however, have  yielded limited results to date.", "Though its institutional knowledge about the nature of this risk is deep,  CBP has not used its extensive relevant data to conduct a comprehensive  risk assessment. The risk analysis it has presented in reports on AD/CV  duties is not useful for mitigating AD/CV duty nonpayment risk because it  merely examines a tally of the total dollars in AD/CV duties owed but  does not consider factors related to the likelihood of nonpayment for any  given entry and the size of revenue loss if nonpayment occurs.  Mathematically, the likelihood of nonpayment and the size of the loss if  nonpayment occurs are the two components of expected loss. Our  analysis shows that a substantial proportion of nonpayment risk can be  explained with information available to CBP at the time an entry arrives,  and even more could be explained at the time a final bill is issued.  Further, we found that CBP\u2019s data are suitable for conducting such  analyses for risk predictions on future entries. More sophisticated models  that CBP could develop, incorporating its institutional expertise, would  likely be able to predict risk even more effectively than ours. As our  analysis demonstrates, a more comprehensive analysis of CBP data  related to AD/CV duties is feasible and could help CBP better identify key  risk factors associated with nonpayment risk.

To improve risk management in the collection of AD/CV duties and to  identify new or changing risks, CBP should regularly conduct a  comprehensive risk analysis that assesses both the likelihood and the  significance of risk factors related to AD/CV duty collection. For  example, CBP could construct statistical models that explore the  associations between potential risk factors and both the probability of  nonpayment and the size of nonpayment when it occurs.  3.  To improve risk management in the collection of AD/CV duties, CBP  should, consistent with U.S. law and international obligations, take  steps to use its data and risk assessment strategically to mitigate  AD/CV duty nonpayment, such as by using predictive risk analysis to  identify entries that pose heightened risk and taking appropriate action  to mitigate the risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to CBP,  Commerce, Treasury, and the United States International Trade  Commission.

CBP also identified  several actions it intends to take in response to the recommendations.  For example, in response to our first recommendation, CBP said that its  Offices of Trade and Field Operations will be employing its annual self- inspection program to identify the causes of premature and deemed  AD/CV duty liquidations. CBP set forth two dates for completing both an  initial and expanded analysis of incorrect liquidations and addressing the  results of its analysis: September 30, 2016, to complete the initial  analysis, and September 30, 2017, to complete the expanded analysis. In  response to our second and third recommendations, CBP said that it has  initiated a comprehensive statistical risk analysis that assesses both the  likelihood and significance of risk factors related to AD/CV duty collection  and will use this risk analysis to develop a predictive model to identify,  and take appropriate action to mitigate, the risk from specific entries that  pose a higher likelihood of nonpayment of final AD/CV duties.", "While concurring with our second and third recommendations, CBP  expressed concern that the statistical methodology we used may have  produced results that understate the impact of the duty evasion issues  relating to high-risk imports from China. However, CBP did not identify  any specific limitations in our methodology. CBP said that it will conduct  its own analysis using statistical methods based on country of origin and  other risk factors to identify high-risk entries and mitigate the risk of  nonpayment of final AD/CV duties. We encourage CBP to conduct its own  analysis of risk factors, in keeping with our recommendation. As  discussed in this report, our model is one of many possible models, and  risk factors are likely to change over time. Our model estimates that, for  the 2009\u20132013 period, entries from China were not associated with  additional nonpayment risk relative to otherwise identical entries of most  products from other countries; however, we found that entries of certain  specific products from China were associated with substantial increases  in nonpayment risk.", "CBP, Commerce, Treasury, and the United States International Trade  Commission all provided technical comments, which we incorporated in  the report, as appropriate  As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

For this purpose,  we combined three datasets from CBP\u2019s Automated Commercial System  (ACS) containing information on entries and billed amounts associated  with entries. ACS is used by CBP to track, control, and process all goods  entering the United States. The first ACS dataset contained AD/CV duty  entry data; the second contained final assessed AD/CV duty rate data;  and the third contained importer AD/CV duty billing data. As part of our  examination of the status and composition of uncollected AD/CV duties,  we analyzed the extent to which CBP writes off uncollectible bills. The  data for this part of the analysis constitutes a fourth dataset, which was  also taken from ACS and was provided as of October 2015. The definition  of \u201cuncollected duties\u201d that we use in this report differs slightly from the  definition used in our 2008 report. That report defined \u201cuncollected duties  as including all open, unpaid bills for AD/CV duties.\u201d For this report, we  narrowed that definition to all open, delinquent bills for AD/CV duties.  According to statute, amounts due to CBP are considered delinquent if  they are unpaid within 30 days after issuance of the bill for such a  payment. Similar to our 2008 report, we excluded softwood lumber from  Canada from our analysis because the AD/CV duty collection processes  for this product are established through a binational agreement, which is  outside the typical practice. The CBP data we analyzed to determine  collection rates for AD/CV duty bills included key characteristics such as  the bill amount, importer information, dates of entry, and dates and  amounts of liquidation. Using these data, we calculated two different  collection rates: (1) the weighted average percentage of the number of  bills collected and (2) the weighted average percentage of the dollar  amount collected. To calculate this rate, we included data on entries  where the final duty rate was higher than the initial estimated duty rate,  indicating that a bill would have been issued. Where a bill was issued but  no data existed on an associated delinquent bill, we assumed the bill was  paid. Because the entry and billing data used to calculate these rates are  a snapshot as of May 12, 2015\u2014the date our data request was filled\u2014 these collection rates are subject to change. For example, we included  data on entries from 2013 and 2014; however, about 42 percent of the  entries from 2013 and about 77 percent of the entries from 2014 had not  been liquidated as of March 2016. As more entries from these years are  liquidated, the collection rates may change due to a varying ratio of paid  to unpaid duty bills; in addition, the proportion of liquidations resulting in  any bill at all may change. After combining CBP\u2019s data, we also used  these data to analyze several other characteristics of unpaid bills,  including their distribution by dollar amount, top products associated,  importers with the highest amounts of unpaid bills, the average time  between entry and liquidation across all entries, the frequency with which  large rate changes result in unpaid bills, and the age of the bills. In each  analysis, where relevant, we determined the mean and median amounts  for comparison. Our analysis consisted of more than 41,000 delinquent  bills. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. In addition to analyzing data to determine the  status and composition of uncollected AD/CV duties, we reviewed  relevant statutes, regulations, and agency reports and interviewed CBP  and Department of Commerce (Commerce) officials.", "To assess the reliability of the ACS data, we (1) performed electronic  testing of required data elements, (2) reviewed existing information about  the data and the systems that produced them, and (3) interviewed agency  officials knowledgeable about the data and the systems that produced  them. Our electronic testing consisted of automated checks to determine  inconsistencies in the data. We identified several inconsistencies in the  data and performed follow-up interviews and analysis to resolve the  inconsistencies. We found the ACS data to be generally reliable for  purposes of our analysis, with several limitations that required steps  outlined below. To analyze the status and composition of uncollected  AD/CV duties, we made several assumptions in order to process the  data.", "We consolidated our data by unique combinations of entry number and  AD/CV duty case number.", "Each AD/CV duty case number includes codes that indicate,  separately, the relevant product and country of origin. However, the  product code is not consistent between countries. For example, the  product code for lemon juice when an entry is from Mexico is the  same code used for sodium sulfate when an entry is from Canada.  We constructed a database using a large list of case numbers  provided by CBP. We then identified, where available, codes from  every country corresponding to a given product description. We  conducted a manual search for several missing case numbers.  Because of limitations in CBP\u2019s database of open bills from ACS, we  were unable to determine which case number an open bill was  associated with. Therefore, in order to avoid falsely attributing open  bills to a given case, we dropped open bills associated with entries  containing more than one AD/CV duty case number. While we found a  relatively small number of bills containing more than one case number  (4,224, or 8 percent of the data), dropping these bills means that our  results somewhat understate the amount of uncollected duties.  Specifically, our methodology may underestimate the amount of  uncollected CV duties because, according to CBP, most CV entries  also include goods subject to an AD case, but the reverse is not true.", "We restricted our analysis to entries that could have resulted in  uncollected duties\u2014that is, entries that were liquidated and billed. In  describing the extent and nature of uncollected duties, we considered  the principal amount due and any interest accrued in order to present  the most comprehensive total picture of unpaid duties owed to CBP.  However, in estimating the risk of nonpayment, we considered only  the principal amount due and treated interest accumulated after  liquidation as endogenous to the decision not to pay the bill. (See  below for further details on our analysis of nonpayment risk.)", "We conducted a distinct assessment of the reliability of the write-off data  because these data were provided separately. We interviewed an agency  official knowledgeable about the source and uses of these data and  reviewed the agency\u2019s annual Performance and Accountability reports for  fiscal years 2013\u20132015, which include CBP\u2019s financial statements and are  audited by an external accounting firm. Using these data, we calculated  the dollar amounts of AD/CV duties that CBP has written off by year. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine the extent to which CBP has taken steps to improve its billing  and collection of AD/CV duties, we obtained and analyzed data from ACS  for entries from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2014, as of May 12,  2015; reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and agency reports; and  interviewed CBP, Commerce, and Department of the Treasury (Treasury)  officials. For example, we obtained CBP data showing the extent to which  CBP liquidates entries prematurely as well as those it liquidates beyond  the 6-month statutory time frame for liquidating AD/CV entries, and we  interviewed CBP officials from the Office of Trade about these processing  errors. However, as discussed in the report, the data were incomplete.  We also obtained CBP documents about the establishment of the  Antidumping and Countervailing Centralization Team (ACT) and the  portal used by the team to identify applicable AD/CV entries for  liquidation. As discussed in the report, we did a check of CBP data and  identified 94 AD/CV entries during the period covered by our review. The  94 entries were all entries where the entry and final liquidation dates had  occurred relatively quickly\u2014approximately 30 days apart. We then asked  CBP to check 20 of these entries to determine why the liquidations had  occurred so quickly. CBP officials told us that 7 (about 35 percent of the  20 entries) had been prematurely liquidated. On the basis of that  information, we asked CBP to provide additional information about the  number of liquidations that had occurred prematurely and any that had  occurred beyond the statutory 6-month time frame for liquidating entries.  CBP provided information from a February 2015 analysis. However, as  discussed in the report, prior to the ACT portal CBP had no means of  accurately tracking the number of premature and deemed liquidations  occurring. For that reason, the February 2015 analysis is not  comprehensive in nature.", "To follow up on the finding from our 2008 report that CBP collects little  information regarding importers of record, we examined CBP\u2019s planned  revisions to its form 5106, which CBP uses to collect key importer of  record information and make decisions regarding bonding and other  matters. We discussed the planned revisions with CBP officials. Customs  bonds are used to safeguard revenue and, according to CBP officials,  play an important role in CBP\u2019s efforts to improve AD/CV collections. To  follow up on another finding from our 2008 report\u2014that CBP\u2019s standard  bond formula provides little protection of AD/CV duty revenue, we met  with three of the major associations that represent the companies (known  as sureties) that issue customs bonds. We discussed, among other  topics, how customs bonds are used by importers to pay for AD/CV  duties, changes in the sureties\u2019 bond underwriting patterns that have  occurred since our 2008 report, and CBP\u2019s introduction of an electronic  bond. We also met with CBP officials to understand how CBP has made  changes to address the concerns discussed in our 2008 report that the  standard bonding formula provides little protection of AD/CV duty  revenue. Two CBP offices currently play major roles in the management  of customs bonds used to pay AD/CV duties: the Office of Trade and the  Office of Finance. We discussed with officials from those offices CBP\u2019s  efforts to centralize the management of all bonds and to change the  bonding formulas to address concerns that the standard bonding formulas  do not sufficiently protect revenue. We also obtained data showing how  CBP has required AD/CV importers to obtain both continuous entry bonds  and single transaction bonds to address the payment of unforeseen  obligations to the U.S. government.", "As part of our analysis of CBP\u2019s AD/CV duty collection process, we  examined bond use before and after the April 2006 through June 2009  suspension of the new shipper bonding privilege. To accomplish this, we  combined two separate datasets. The first was from a Commerce  database that documents new shipper reviews for fiscal years 2002  through 2015. The second was the previously described data from ACS  containing information on entries and billed amounts associated with  entries for fiscal years 2001 through 2014, as of May 12, 2015. Because  the Commerce and CBP datasets did not always use the same format or  spelling for the names of importers, we performed both an automated and  a manual matching of importer names in both datasets to identify the  universe of entries likely to be associated with a new shipper. We then  produced summary statistics for the amounts of delinquent duties  associated with new shippers as a group, with and without bonds, and  comparable statistics for the amount of delinquent duties associated with  all other shippers, with and without bonds. We also compared these data  for the pre- and post-2006 through 2009 periods. Because the time  frames associated with the Commerce and CBP datasets did not exactly  coincide, we decided to use in our analysis a timeframe common to both:  January 2002 through December 2013. We performed tests of the data  and determined, based on those tests and interviews, that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our analysis.", "To examine the extent to which CBP assesses and mitigates the risk to  revenue from potentially uncollectible AD/CV duties, we combined the  three datasets from ACS into a single database. The database is  associated with entries from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2014, as  of May 12, 2015. To develop a reasonable risk measurement for use in  addressing the risk of AD/CV duty nonpayment, we first examined agency  goals and criteria (including federal internal controls criteria) and identified  expected loss per shipment (in terms of uncollected duties). We also  reviewed CBP\u2019s reports to Congress. To calculate an expected loss  score, we mathematically extrapolated expected loss into two measurable  components: (1) likelihood of AD/CV duty nonpayment and (2) the  amount of duties not paid contingent on nonpayment (loss per  nonpayment). In developing a regression model to analyze each of these  two risk measures, we created several variables that describe importer  and manufacturer characteristics derived from variables in ACS.", "To determine associations with likelihood of duty nonpayment, we  calculated the coefficients of the regression of country, product, and other  shipment characteristics on the binary variable \u201cdelinquent.\u201d As many of  our variables are indicator variables, we found that a linear fit was a good  approximation of a logistic regression and had the advantages of being  less computationally intensive and producing coefficients that fit intuitively  into a risk scorecard. To determine associations with size of nonpayment,  we regressed the same independent variables on the continuous variable  \u201camount delinquent.\u201d To determine whether our models are appropriate  for forecasting, we ran a series of regressions over 2-year periods. We  selected several risk factors for review based on the size and statistical  significance of their coefficients in the full 2001\u20132014 period regression  model. We found that these risk factors, as evidenced by their  coefficients, are generally stable over time in our year-by-year regression  models, retaining the same sign and comparable magnitudes. However,  some risk factors also change over time, for example, large changes in  magnitude (e.g., Vietnam) or changing sign from positive to negative or  vice versa (e.g., Mexico). Our regression models do not establish whether  a given factor causes nonpayment or is merely correlated with this risk.  The models provide an example of how CBP data could be systematically  analyzed to provide insights into bill delinquency patterns, but we do not  intend them to be prescriptive.", "To determine appropriate periods of time for analysis, we examined the  effect of including data from a range of periods. We sequentially  expanded the regression analysis to include data from 2011\u20132013,  adding additional years up to and including 2005\u20132013, as well as  groupings of 2005\u20132009 and 2004\u20132008. Expanding the period of  analysis may have several effects. For example, increasing the available  data will generally result in more accurate estimates and therefore more  accurate models. On the other hand, longer periods may be associated  with greater amounts of systemic change in risk factors and therefore  yield less accurate models. For each period, we constructed the model on  one portion of our data and tested the model\u2019s ability to identify the  likelihood of nonpayment for entries outside of this sample (\u201cout-of- sample predictive power\u201d).", "We measured the model fit for this cross-validation process for each  period and found that the model\u2019s out-of-sample predictive power  improved until we included 5 years of data (2010\u20132013), at which point  the predictive power roughly plateaued with an R-squared value  estimated at 0.75 -0.77 out of sample for probability of nonpayment . As a  result, we believe that models constructed with 5\u20139 years of past data  would be reasonable. We selected 5-year periods (2004\u20132008 and 2009\u2013 2013) for purposes of comparing useful models from distinct periods. This  allowed us to compare datasets from two equal periods, one  corresponding to the period of our 2008 report and the other  corresponding to the most recent period for which complete data were  available.", "Because fewer data are available to CBP at entry than at liquidation, we  also ran out-of-sample tests without the variables for \u201cnet billed amount\u201d  and \u201crate review period length.\u201d We found that the model remains useful  at entry: Our ability to predict probability of nonpayment was unaffected,  while our ability to predict the loss per nonpayment was reduced by a  moderate amount. This reduction was expected given that loss per  nonpayment is a function of the amount billed, and the amount billed is  determined by CBP after entry, based on the final duty rate set by  Commerce. Using our full set of data, we found that duty rate increases  and decreases for many product types were systematically predictable.", "We presented the results of our regression analysis to CBP on two  occasions. Based on their comments, we adjusted the methodology used  to derive our analysis.", "As discussed previously, we assessed the reliability of the ACS data and  had to make several assumptions in order to process the data. Beyond  the assumptions discussed above, in order to perform our regression  analysis, we had to make several additional assumptions. These are  discussed in appendix II.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

To  demonstrate how a statistical model could be constructed that explores  the association between potential risk factors and the potential for  nonpayment, we used CBP\u2019s data to develop two regression models, one  to estimate the likelihood of nonpayment for any given entry and one to  estimate the size of revenue loss if nonpayment occurs. Mathematically,  the likelihood of nonpayment and the size of the loss if nonpayment  occurs are the two components of expected loss. Our regression models  do not establish whether a given factor causes nonpayment or is merely  correlated with this risk. To be useful for risk management, such a model  would need to be able to predict future nonpayment risk. As a result, to  assess the ability of the model to predict future losses, we aggregated,  cross-validated, and analyzed the data for two separate 5-year periods  and conducted qualitative assessments of parameter stability. Our  models provide a demonstration of how CBP could systematically analyze  its data to provide insights into bill delinquency patterns, but we do not  intend to be prescriptive.

Finally, for comparison, we examined  the extent to which new shippers that used cash instead of a bond to pay  for estimated AD/CV duties due at entry were associated with unpaid  bills. Our analysis of the new shipper bonding privilege focused on two  periods: from January 2002 through July 2006 (before the new shipper  bonding privilege was suspended) and from August 2009 through  December 2013 (after the new shipper bonding privilege was reinstated).  Because the use of a cash deposit was allowed during the entire period  from January 2002 through December 2013, we used this period to  analyze how the use of cash deposits by new shippers was associated  with unpaid bills.", "The analysis shows that after the new shipper bonding privilege was  reinstated, importers made much less use of it to pay initial estimated  AD/CV duties compared with the period before the privilege was  suspended.

This importer used new shipper  bonds to pay for 3 entries subject to AD/CV duties worth approximately  $511,000. According to surety officials we interviewed, sureties tightened  their underwriting standards in 2009, and this could account for the vastly  reduced number of new shipper bonds issued.", "Moreover, our analysis also shows that most of the importers that  obtained the new shipper bonds, including both before and after the  suspension of the privilege, were associated with unpaid bills. For  example, before the suspension (January 2002 through July 2006), 25 of  the 32 importers (or approximately 78 percent) that used a new shipper  bond had one or more unpaid bills. Approximately 76 percent of the bills  issued to these importers during this period went unpaid. The total  amount that went unpaid was approximately $89 million, with a median  bill amount of about $13,000 and an average bill amount of about  $75,000. After the suspension was lifted until December 2013, the 1  importer that used new shipper bonds did not pay any of its bills and the  total amount due was approximately $560,000. The median and average  bill amounts were approximately $180,000 and $187,000, respectively.", "In addition, our analysis shows that new shippers that used a bond to pay  for estimated AD/CV duties did not account for a significant amount of the  total unpaid debt during either of the two periods when the bonding  privilege was in effect. For the period from January 2002 through July  2006, these new shippers accounted for about 11 percent of all unpaid  bills. For the period after the reinstatement of the privilege through  December 2013, the percentage of total unpaid debt associated with new  shippers that used a bond to pay for estimated AD/CV duties was less  than 1 percent.", "Our analysis also shows that by comparison, over the entire time frame  we examined, new shippers that paid their estimated AD/CV duties in  cash were associated with many fewer unpaid bills. From January 2002  through December 2013, a total of 42 importers associated with a new  shipper review used a cash deposit instead of a bond to pay for estimated  AD/CV duties. Of the 42, only 1 was associated with an unpaid bill. This  importer had two unpaid bills worth a total of about $6,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Christine Broderick (Assistant  Director), Jos\u00e9 M.
