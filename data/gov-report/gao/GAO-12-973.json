According to program officials, 244 entities were using HETS in 2012, including about 130 providers, 104 clearinghouses that provide data exchange services to about 400,000 health care providers, and 10 Medicare contractors that help CMS process claims for services. From January through June 2012, HETS processed each month an average of 1.7 million to 2.2 million queries per day with most of the queries submitted between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern time. The users with whom we spoke confirmed that operational problems they experienced with the system in 2010 and the first few months of 2011 were resolved in spring 2011 after CMS implemented several hardware and software replacements and upgrades. System performance reports for the first 6 months of 2012 showed that the average response time per transaction was less than 3 seconds. Users described experiences with the system that were consistent with these data. They told us that they are currently satisfied with the operational status of HETS and that the system provides more complete information and reliable service than other systems that they use to verify eligibility with commercial health insurers.", "CMS took steps to ensure users remain satisfied with the system's performance, including notifying users in advance of system downtime, providing help desk support, and monitoring contractors' performance. The agency had also planned several technical improvements intended to increase HETS' capacity to process a growing number of transactions, which the agency projected to increase at a rate of about 40 percent each year. These plans include a redesign of the system and migration to a new database environment that is scalable to accommodate the projected increase in transaction volume. According to HETS program officials, near-term plans also include the implementation of tools to enable proactive monitoring of system components and additional services intended to enhance production capacity until the planned redesign of the system is complete.", "To help protect the privacy of beneficiary eligibility data provided by HETS, CMS established policies, processes, and procedures that are intended to address principals reflected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. For example, in its efforts to ensure proper uses and disclosures of the data, CMS documented in user agreements the authorized and unauthorized purposes for requesting Medicare beneficiary eligibility data. Additionally, the agency conducted privacy impact and risk assessments of HETS as required by the E-Government Act of 2002.

Health care providers  may request beneficiary eligibility data from HETS directly via CMS\u2019s  extranet or by utilizing the services of clearinghouses. According to  clearinghouse officials with whom we spoke, many providers use  clearinghouses to conduct transactions with HETS because they may not  have the technical capability to connect directly to CMS\u2019s extranet, or they  may chose to employ the services of clearinghouses for financial or other  reasons. For example, these providers may use clearinghouses to  conduct electronic transactions with CMS and other different payers\u2019  systems, and avoid expenses associated with establishing and  maintaining the in-house technology and expertise needed to connect  with multiple systems. Rather, they can conduct these transactions by  establishing one connection with a clearinghouse. However, the MACs  access HETS via CMS\u2019s extranet.

The data  entered into the workstation identify the provider, beneficiary, and  services for which eligibility is to be verified. The data are translated by  the end-user software into the standard HIPAA transaction format, then  transmitted from the user\u2019s workstation to the HETS system via either the  agency\u2019s extranet, or the vendor-supplied network service which connects  to the CMS extranet. The system validates the incoming data and, if the  request is valid, returns response data back to the user\u2019s workstation.

CMS\u2019s plans also  identified a step to, by the end of August 2012, migrate the current HETS  database to a new operating platform that is scalable to accommodate  the expected increase in transaction volume.", "Further, agency officials stated that while they plan to make these  improvements to the system over the next 3 years, their ability to conduct  the activities they have planned is dependent on the agency\u2019s budget.", "These officials stated that, to mitigate risks associated with the level of  funding the program receives in the future, they prioritized improvements  planned for the existing system and began to implement those that they  determined to be the most cost-effective during this and early next fiscal  year. Among other things, these include activities to support the current  system until the redesigned system is implemented, including  development of tools that enable the HETS contractors to proactively  monitor system components, additional services to enhance production  capacity, and automated processes for starting up and shutting down the  application. Program officials stated that they will review and prioritize  other activities for improving the system as part of the HETS redesign  project."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Established Policies and Procedures Intended to Address Privacy Principles and Assessed Impact and Risks of Sharing Data", "paragraphs": ["The Privacy Act of 1974 and the HIPAA Privacy Rule protect personally  identifiable health information, such as Medicare beneficiary information,  to ensure that it is disclosed only under specified conditions and used  only for its intended purpose. In accordance with these privacy  protections, the information provided by HETS is to be used only for  confirming eligibility of patients to receive benefits for services provided  under the Medicare fee-for-service program. CMS is governed by the  Privacy Act and all covered entities that use HETS\u2014health care  providers, clearinghouses, and Medicare contractors\u2014are required to  comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.", "In accordance with provisions of the Privacy Rule, the protected health  information provided by HETS is to be disclosed and used only for certain  activities. Among other activities, these include treatment of patients and  payment for services\u2014the activities supported by the use of HETS.", "CMS has taken actions intended to ensure that the personal health  information sent to and from the system is protected from misuse and  improper disclosure. For example, CMS documented in the HETS Rules  of Behavior that users must adhere to the authorized purposes for  requesting Medicare beneficiary eligibility data. Specifically, the rules  state that users are authorized to request information to determine  whether patients who were determined to be Medicare eligible are  covered for specific services that are to be provided at the point of care.  However, users are not authorized to request information for the sole  purpose of determining whether patients are eligible to receive Medicare  benefits.", "According to program officials, CMS enforces its rules of behavior by  monitoring inquiries to identify behaviors that may indicate intentional  misuse of the data. For example, inquiries from one user that result in  high rates of errors or a high ratio of inquiries compared to the number of  claims submitted may indicate that a user is searching the system to  identify Medicare beneficiaries rather than using HETS for its intended  purpose. Users engaging in these types of behavior may be contacted or,  when appropriate, referred for investigation for inappropriate use of the  data, such as health care identity theft or fraudulent billing practices.", "Additionally, system documentation described mechanisms that were  implemented to prevent access by requesters with invalid provider  identifications or certain providers who have been excluded or suspended  from participating in the Medicare program. For example, CMS maintains  databases of National Provider Identifiers, another HIPAA standard. The  eligibility request transactions submitted by HETS users include these  identifiers, and, before providing beneficiary data in response to requests,  the system validates the identifiers against data stored in an agency  database. Additionally, according to the HETS business owners,  providers who have been identified by HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General  and the General Services Administration as ones conducting activities   In  intended to defraud Medicare may be included on a \u201cdo not pay\u201d list.this case, providers excluded from the program would not \u201cneed to know\u201d  information about patients\u2019 personal health, including whether or not they  are eligible for Medicare benefits. According to HETS officials, these data  are also incorporated into the National Provider Identifier database that is  used to validate identifiers submitted to HETS and, as a result, these  excluded providers are also not allowed to receive information from the  system.", "HETS system documentation also described mechanisms for securing  the data transmitted to and from HETS. For example, access to the  system is only allowed through CMS\u2019s secured extranet. To gain access,  the providers and clearinghouses must first submit a Trading Partner  Agreement. In addition to including information needed to enable CMS  and its trading partners, or users, to establish connectivity and define data  exchange requirements, the agreement defines responsibilities for  securing the data of the entities receiving beneficiary eligibility information  from CMS. After users submit the agreement, CMS contacts them to  authenticate their identity and, once authentication has been determined,  CMS help desk staff provide the requester with a submitter ID that is  required to be included on all transactions. Users then may request  access to the CMS extranet from one of four network service vendors  which establish a secure software connection to the system.", "The table below summarizes these and other actions CMS described that  address key HIPAA privacy principles relevant to the implementation of  HETS.", "Further, the E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to  conduct privacy impact assessments, and the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies conducting these  assessments. The act and OMB\u2019s implementing guidance require that  these assessments address: (1) what information is to be collected; (2)  why the information is being collected; (3) the intended use of the  information; (4) with whom the information will be shared ; (5) what  opportunities individuals have to decline to provide the information or to  consent to particular uses of the information, and how individuals can  grant consent; (6) how the information will be secured ; and (7) whether a  system of records is being created under the Privacy Act.", "According to the OMB guidance, agencies should conduct a privacy  impact assessment before developing or procuring IT systems or projects  that collect, maintain, or disseminate information in identifiable form from  or about members of the public. Agencies are required to perform an  update as necessary when a system change creates new privacy risks.  Additionally, in a previous report, we identified the assessment of privacy risks as an important element of the privacy impact assessment  process to help officials determine appropriate privacy protection policies  and techniques to implement those policies. We noted that a privacy risk  analysis should be performed to determine the nature of privacy risks and  the resulting impact if corrective actions are not in place to mitigate those  risks.", "CMS conducted a privacy impact assessment of HETS as called for by  the E-Government Act, and updated the assessment in April 2011. The  assessment addressed the seven OMB requirements for implementing  privacy provisions. For example, in addressing how HETS information  would be secured, it stated that the system is accessible only via the  CMS private network to authorized users. The assessment also stated  that the intended use of the system is to allow providers to confirm  patients\u2019 enrollment in the Medicare program and provide information that  is needed to correctly bill for payment of claims. Additionally, as part of a  security risk assessment, program officials also completed a privacy risk  analysis of the system that addressed several privacy risks. For example,  CMS assessed privacy risks related to improper disclosure of the  protected health information processed by HETS and determined that the  risk level was low to moderate.", "By establishing practices and procedures intended to protect the privacy  of Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 personal health information, and assessing the  impact and risks associated with the use of HETS, CMS took required  steps to address privacy principles reflected by HIPAA, the HIPAA rules,  and the Privacy Act and has acted in accordance with OMB\u2019s guidance  for protecting personally identifiable information.

To  determine whether CMS provided the level of service agreed upon with  HETS users, we compared the information we collected to business  requirements defined in program and system plans, and to any  agreements with users. Additionally, we obtained users\u2019 views of the  extent to which the current implementation of HETS satisfied their needs  for timely information by holding structured interviews with selected  representatives of providers; clearinghouses, which provide services for  about 90 percent of Medicare providers; and a Medicare Administrative  Contractor who used the system.", "The selected HETS users included three clearinghouses; two fee-for- service providers, including a visiting nurse agency and a medical  equipment supplier; and one Medicare Administrative Contractor. Based  on data provided by system performance reports for the week of March  12th through the 18th 2012, we selected the highest volume users among  each user type throughout the United States. The selected users  submitted about 44 percent of the 14.5 million total transactions  processed during the selected period of time. Specifically, the  clearinghouses submitted a total of about 40 percent of the transactions,  the Medicare contractor submitted about 2 percent, and the provider and  supplier submitted less than 1 percent of the transactions, respectively.", "We discussed with the users their experiences and satisfaction with the  level of service the system has provided over the last 2 years, and the  results of CMS\u2019s efforts to resolve any problems or system-related issues.  In addition, we interviewed program officials knowledgeable of the  management of the program to gain additional understanding of the  agency\u2019s practices for defining performance requirements for HETS  contractors, and for managing and assessing their performance relevant  to ensuring efficient operations of HETS. We also discussed with the  users their experiences with other automated eligibility verification  systems provided by commercial health insurers. We held these  discussions to determine whether these officials could share any lessons  that could be beneficial to CMS in operating HETS.", "To identify the steps that CMS has taken to ensure that HETS users  remain satisfied with the performance of the system and that the agency  plans to take to ensure the system provides the level of service needed to  support future requirements, we reviewed agency documents, such as  project timelines and system release notes, and reports of users\u2019 calls to  the help desk. These documents described steps taken to address  problems reported by users, identified systems modifications to correct  problems, and showed patterns in the numbers of help desk calls over the  past 2 years. We also identified steps the agency initiated to help alleviate  problems introduced by increasing transaction volume as the number of  Medicare beneficiaries has increased over the past 2 years. Further,  through our review of relevant agency documents, contractors\u2019  performance reports, and discussions with program officials, we identified  steps CMS took to assess contractors\u2019 performance toward providing  efficient and quality service to users of HETS, and any necessary  corrective actions.", "Additionally, we identified steps the agency plans to take toward defining  and addressing future requirements of the system that may be introduced  by increasing numbers of verification inquiries, and collected and  reviewed documentation that provided information about projected growth  in transaction volume as providers were faced with the need to conduct  HETS queries of more patients filing Medicare claims.
