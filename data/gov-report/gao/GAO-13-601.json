Of these 34 federally facilitated exchanges (FFE), 15 are in states expected to assist CMS in carrying out certain FFE functions. However, the activities that CMS plans to carry out in these 15 exchanges, as well as in the state-based exchanges, have evolved and may continue to change. For example, CMS approved states' exchange arrangements on the condition that they ultimately complete activities necessary for exchange implementation. CMS indicated that it would carry out more exchange functions if any state did not adequately progress towards implementation of all required activities.", "CMS completed many activities necessary to establish FFEs by October 1, 2013, although many remain to be completed and some were behind schedule. CMS issued numerous regulations and guidance and took steps to establish processes and data systems necessary to operate the exchanges. The activities remaining cross the core exchange functional areas of eligibility and enrollment, plan management, and consumer assistance. To support consumer-eligibility determinations, for example, CMS is developing a data hub that will provide electronic, near real-time access to federal data, as well as provide access to state and third party data sources needed to verify consumer-eligibility information. While CMS has met project schedules, several critical tasks, such as final testing with federal and state partners, remain to be completed. For plan management, CMS must review and certify the qualified health plans (QHP) that will be offered in the FFEs. Though the system used to submit applications for QHP certification was operational during the anticipated time frame, several key tasks regarding plan management, including certification of QHPs and inclusion of QHP information on the exchange websites, remain to be completed. In the case of consumer assistance, for example, funding awards for Navigators--a key consumer assistance program--have been delayed by about 2 months, which has delayed training and other activities. CMS is also depending on the states to implement specific FFE exchange functions, and CMS data show that many state activities remained to be completed and some were behind schedule.", "Much progress has been made, but much remains to be accomplished within a relatively short amount of time. CMS's timelines provide a roadmap to completion; however, factors such as the still-evolving scope of CMS's required activities in each state and the many activities yet to be performed--some close to the start of enrollment--suggest a potential for challenges going forward. And while the missed interim deadlines may not affect implementation, additional missed deadlines closer to the start of enrollment could do so. CMS recently completed risk assessments and plans for mitigating risks associated with the data hub, and is also working on strategies to address state preparedness contingencies. Whether these efforts will assure the timely and smooth implementation of the exchanges by October 2013 cannot yet be determined.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services emphasized the progress it has made in establishing exchanges, and expressed its confidence that exchanges will be open and functioning in every state by October 1, 2013."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires the  establishment in all states of health insurance exchanges\u2014marketplaces  where eligible individuals can compare and select among insurance plans  offered by participating private issuers of health coverage.

Enrollment in the exchanges is to  begin on October 1, 2013, and the exchanges are to become operational  and offer health coverage starting on January 1, 2014. The Congressional  Budget Office estimated that about 7 million individuals will enroll in  exchanges by 2014, increasing to about 24 million by 2022.", "The exchanges are intended to provide a seamless, single point of  access for individuals to enroll into private health plans, apply for income- based financial subsidies established under the law, and, as applicable,  obtain an eligibility determination for other health coverage programs,  such as Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program  (CHIP). an exchange, individuals must complete an application and meet certain  eligibility requirements defined by PPACA; for example, they must be  U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. To support exchanges\u2019 efforts to  determine applicants\u2019 eligibility to enroll, CMS is building a tool called the  federal data services hub (data hub).

As directed by PPACA, FFEs must carry out the same  functions as exchanges established and operated by a state. The federal  government bears responsibility for establishing and operating FFEs;  however, in establishing the framework within which an FFE in a  particular state will be established and operated, CMS has provided  states the option to assist with certain FFE operations. CMS refers to  FFEs in these states as partnership exchanges. States seeking to  operate a state-based exchange were required to submit an application to  CMS containing attestations regarding when the state would complete  specific required activities CMS deemed essential to operating an  exchange. States electing not to establish a state-based exchange, but  seeking to participate in a partnership exchange were required to  complete an abbreviated version of that application tailored to the  particular activities that the state would assist the FFE to carry out. On the  basis of this documentation, CMS conditionally approved states to  establish a state-based exchange or to participate in a partnership  exchange on the basis that they complete the required activities by  certain dates, among other steps necessary for the operation of an  exchange. States electing not to establish a state-based exchange or  participate in a partnership exchange were not required to submit an  application to CMS.", "As the required start of health plan enrollment draws near, an important  question is whether CMS will have FFEs ready to begin accepting  applications by October 1, 2013, and fully operational by January 1, 2014.  You asked us to examine the federal government\u2019s role and  preparedness to establish FFEs and the data hub, and the sources and  amounts of funding used by the federal government to carry out  preparatory activities. In this report, we describe  1.  the federal government\u2019s role in establishing FFEs for operation in  2014 and state participation in that effort,  2.  the status of federal and state actions taken and planned for FFEs  and the data hub, and  3.

We also interviewed CMS officials to clarify these documents  and obtain updated information on the evolving decisions related to  federal and state activities in specific areas.", "To describe the status of federal and state actions taken and planned for  FFEs and the data hub, we examined planning documents used by CMS  to track the implementation of key activities to be conducted by the  federal government to establish FFEs and the data hub. In particular, we  reviewed a February 22, 2013, timeline used by CMS to track the  activities that remained to be completed before the implementation of the  exchanges. In addition, we developed a data collection instrument for  CMS to complete about its key activities underway or planned for  establishing the FFEs. The instrument asked CMS to provide information  on the percent of each activity that it had completed, the expected or  actual completion date, and a description of key activities completed and  remaining to be completed. For those FFEs where states chose to  participate in a partnership exchange, we examined the activities they  agreed to perform as a requirement of their conditional approval from  CMS. We examined those activities and targeted completion dates that  were reported in the conditional approval letters issued from December  2012 through March 2013. CMS later provided us with an update on the  status of certain of these activities as of April 24, 2013. We also  interviewed CMS officials to understand CMS\u2019s plans for establishing  FFEs and, in early May, obtained updated information on the status of  key federal activities. We discussed with CMS other activities generally  related to exchanges that the agency may have to perform if states  planning to operate a state-based exchange or participate in a  partnership exchange decide not to or are unable to perform as planned.  To provide an overview of the status of CMS\u2019s development and  implementation of the data hub, we reviewed project management  documentation, such as plans, schedules, and technical documentation  describing the data hub\u2019s functionality. We also assessed project  management documents that described the extent to which CMS had  completed steps towards implementing the data hub, such as evidence of  test results and project milestone reviews. When examining the actions  taken by the federal government and states, we relied largely on  information and documents provided to us by CMS regarding the status of  the exchanges\u2014including information CMS developed based on its  contacts and information exchanges with states\u2014and did not interview or  collect information directly from states.", "To describe CMS spending to support establishment of FFEs and the  data hub, we requested data from CMS on the sources of funding for  activities conducted for the purpose of establishing the FFEs and the data  hub, including activities carried out by contractors, and the total amount of  such funding obligated or expected to be obligated through fiscal year  2013. We received data from CMS on obligations for contracts and  interagency agreements from fiscal year 2010 through March 31, 2013, to  assist in the development and operation of the FFEs and the data hub  and carry out certain other exchange-related activities. CMS provided  the total amounts obligated, the appropriations account to which the  obligations were charged, a brief description of the projects, and the  contractors or other recipients of funds. CMS officials said the data do not  include CMS staff salaries and other administrative expenses, which are  not tracked specifically for the FFEs and the data hub. In addition, the  data do not include obligations for grants CMS awarded to states to assist  in the establishment of FFEs.

The benefits, cost-sharing features,  and premiums of each QHP are to be presented in a manner that  facilitates comparison shopping of plans by individuals. Once individuals  wish to select a QHP, they will complete an application\u2014through the  exchange website, over the phone, in person, or by mailing a paper  form\u2014that collects the information necessary to determine their eligibility  to enroll in a QHP.

Also at the time of the application, the exchange will  determine individuals\u2019 eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP. After an individual  has been determined to be eligible for enrollment in a QHP, the individual  will be able to use tools on the exchange website to compare plans and  make a selection. For individuals applying for enrollment in a QHP and for  income-based financial subsidies, eligibility determinations and  enrollment should generally occur on a near real-time basis, to be  accomplished through the electronic transfer of eligibility information  between the exchange and federal and state agencies, and through the  electronic transfer of enrollment data between the exchange and QHP  issuers. Assistance with the enrollment process will be provided to  individuals either through the website, an established telephone call  center, or in person.", "To undertake these functions, all exchanges, including those established  and operated by the federal government, will be required to perform  certain activities, many of which fall within the core functions of eligibility  and enrollment, plan management, and consumer assistance.", "Eligibility and enrollment: All exchanges will be required to  determine an individual\u2019s eligibility for QHP enrollment, income-based  financial subsidies, and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP.  Exchanges will be required to enroll eligible individuals into the  selected QHP or transmit information for individuals eligible for  Medicaid or CHIP to the appropriate state agency to facilitate  enrollment in those programs. The exchange is to use a single,  streamlined enrollment eligibility system to collect information from an  application and verify that information. CMS is building the data hub to  support these efforts. The data hub is intended to provide data  needed by the exchanges\u2019 enrollment eligibility systems to determine  each applicant\u2019s eligibility. Specifically, the data hub will provide one  electronic connection and near real-time access to the common  federal data, as well as provide access to state and third party data  sources needed to verify consumer application information. For  example, the data hub is to verify an applicant\u2019s Social Security  number with the Social Security Administration (SSA), and to access  the data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) that are needed to assess the applicant\u2019s  income, citizenship, and immigration status. The data hub is also  expected to access information from the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA), Department of Defense (DOD), Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), and Peace Corps to enable  exchanges to determine if an applicant is eligible for insurance  coverage from other federal programs that would make them ineligible  for income-based financial subsidies. In states in which an FFE will  operate, the hub is also expected to access information from state  Medicaid and CHIP agencies to identify whether FFE applicants are  already enrolled in those programs.", "Plan management: Exchanges will be required to develop and  implement processes and standards to certify health plans for  inclusion as QHPs and recertify or decertify them, as needed. As  part of these processes, the exchange must develop an application for  issuers of health coverage that seek to offer a QHP. The exchange  must review a particular plan\u2019s data to ensure it meets certification  standards for inclusion in the exchange as a QHP. The exchange  must also conduct ongoing oversight and monitoring to ensure that  the plans comply with all applicable regulations.", "Consumer assistance: All exchanges will be required to provide a  call center, website, and in-person assistance to support consumers  in filing an application, obtaining an eligibility determination,  comparing coverage options, and enrolling in a QHP. Other  consumer assistance function activities that exchanges must conduct  are outreach and education to raise awareness of and promote  enrollment in QHPs and income-based financial subsidies.

The agency also noted that a partnership exchange can  serve as a path for states toward future implementation of a state- based exchange. Although the states would assist in carrying out  the plan management function, consumer assistance function, or both  on a day-to-day basis, CMS would retain responsibility for these and  all other FFE functions. For example, for plan management, states  would recommend QHPs for certification, and CMS would decide  whether to approve the states\u2019 recommendations and, if so,  implement them. In the case of consumer assistance, states would  manage an in-person assistance program and Navigators and may  choose to conduct outreach and education activities.

To measure progress towards completing these steps, CMS  officials indicated that the agency created a set of typical dates for when  specific activities would need to be completed in order for the exchanges  to be ready for the initial enrollment period. The agency then adapted  those dates for each state establishing a state-based exchange or  participating in a partnership exchange. The agency officials said that if  the state indicated in its Blueprint that it planned to complete an activity  earlier than CMS\u2019s typical targeted completion date, CMS accepted the  state\u2019s earlier date. If the state proposed a date that was later than CMS\u2019s  typical targeted completion date, the state had to explain the difference  and CMS determined whether that date would allow the exchange to be  ready for the initial enrollment period.

The March 2012 rule, among other  things, sets forth the minimum federal standards that state-based  exchanges and FFEs must meet and outlines the process a state must  follow to transition between types of exchanges. The February 2013 rule  specifies benefit design standards that QHPs must meet to obtain  certification. That rule also established a timeline for QHPs to be  accredited in FFEs. CMS also issued a proposed rule related to the  Navigator program on April 5, 2013. This rule proposes conflict of  interest, training, and certification standards that will apply to Navigators  in FFEs. CMS officials expected to issue this final rule prior to initial  enrollment. CMS officials indicated that before initial enrollment begins in  October 2013, they would propose an additional rule that would set forth  exchange oversight and records retention requirements, among other  things.

In contrast to other FFE states in which CMS manages  all aspects of the QHP application and certification process, these   15 states were to evaluate health issuer plan applications to offer a QHP  in the exchange and submit recommendations to CMS regarding the  plans to be certified as QHPs. CMS indicated that the states are expected  to submit their recommendations by July 31, 2013, which is also when  CMS expects to complete its evaluation of QHPs for the other FFE  states.

Specifically,  several steps necessary for the implementation of the Navigator program  in FFEs have been delayed by about 2 months. CMS had planned to  issue the funding announcement for the Navigator program in February  2013 and have two rounds of awards, in June and September 2013.  However, the announcement was delayed until April 9, 2013, and CMS  officials indicated that there would be one round of awards, with an  anticipated award date of August 15, 2013. CMS did not indicate the  number of awards it expected to make, but noted that it expects that at  least two types of applicants will receive awards in each of the 34 FFE  states, and at least one will be a community or consumer-focused  nonprofit organization.

CMS officials said that the required training for Navigators will  be web-based, and it is under development. According to CMS, the  Navigator training will be based on the training content that is being  developed for agents and brokers in the FFEs and partnership  exchanges, which CMS indicates is near completion. In addition, CMS is  developing similar web-based training for the state partnership exchange  in-person assistance programs. While CMS had planned to begin  Navigator training in July 2013, under its current plan, the agency will not  have awarded Navigator grants by this date. CMS indicated that it plans  to complete development of the training curriculum and certification exam  in July or August 2013. CMS officials expected that the training would  begin in the summer of 2013, following completion of the curriculum and  exam.", "Each of the six partnership exchange states that CMS conditionally  approved to assist with certain consumer assistance responsibilities plans  to establish other in-person assistance programs that will operate in  addition to Navigator programs in these states. The dates by which the  states planned to release applications and select in-person assisters  varied. (See fig. 4.) For example, according to the conditional approval  letters, one partnership exchange state planned to select in-person  assisters by March 1, 2013, to begin work by May 15, 2013, while another  planned to make that selection by August 1, 2013, to begin work by  September 1, 2013.

While the deadline for most states to select in-person assisters had not  passed as of April 24, 2013, there were delays for two states. One state  that planned to select in-person assisters by March 15, 2013 delayed that  deadline to May 30, 2013, while the other delayed it to June 15. CMS  indicated that these delays are not expected to affect the implementation  of these programs. However, the state now planning to complete  selection by May 30, 2013, had originally planned to begin training  assisters in March and begin work May 15, 2013. The second state had  planned that in-person assisters would begin work August 1, 2013.", "For example, three states that had planned to release  CMS and states with partnership exchanges have also begun, and  established time frames for, undertaking other outreach and consumer  assistance activities that are necessary to implement FFEs. CMS  recommended that in-person outreach activities begin in the summer of  2013 to educate consumers in advance of the open enrollment period.  Examples of key activities that remain to be completed include the federal  call center, healthcare.gov website, media outreach, and the consumer  complaint tracking system for the FFEs.
