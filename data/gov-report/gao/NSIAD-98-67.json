The objectives of the JET were to estimate the most probable cost of the F-22 program and to identify realistic initiatives that could be implemented to lower program costs. In January 1997, the JET estimated the F-22 EMD program would cost $18.688 billion, an increase of about $1.45 billion over the previous Air Force estimate. The JET also reported that additional time would be required to complete the EMD program and recommended changes to the EMD schedule.", "The Air Force and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology adopted the JET\u2019s recommendations, including its cost estimate for the EMD program. Other JET recommendations included slowing the manufacturing of the EMD aircraft to ensure an efficient transition from development to low-rate initial production and increasing the time available to develop and integrate avionics software. In August and September 1997, the Air Force negotiated changes with the prime contractors to more closely align the cost-plus-award-fee contracts with the JET cost estimate and revised schedule. However, as of January 1998, many substantial planned changes recommended by the JET had not been incorporated into the Lockheed Martin contract, such as changes to the avionics estimated to cost $221 million.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, enacted on November 18, 1997, imposed cost limitations of $18.688 billion on the F-22 EMD program and $43.4 billion on the production program. The limitation on production cost did not specify a quantity of aircraft to be procured. The act instructed the Secretary of the Air Force to adjust the cost limitations for (1) the amounts of increases or decreases in costs attributable to economic inflation after September 30, 1997, and (2) the amounts of increases or decreases in costs attributable to compliance with changes in federal, state, or local laws enacted after September 30, 1997.", "Conferees for the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1998, enacted October 8, 1997, provided direction to the Secretary of the Air Force regarding out-of-production parts on the F-22 program. Because it is not economical for some component manufacturers to keep production lines open to produce old technology parts with low demand, they have discontinued making parts, some of which are used on the F-22 EMD aircraft, and will discontinue making others. To minimize cost and schedule impacts on the F-22 EMD and production programs, the Air Force plans to redesign these out-of-production parts or buy sufficient quantities of them for the first five lots of production aircraft. The appropriations conferees directed the Secretary of the Air Force to fund the cost of redesigning out-of-production parts from the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation appropriation. The effect of following that direction would be to add that effort, expected by the Air Force to cost $353 million, to the EMD program.", "In January 1998, the Air Force notified the Congress that it increased the EMD cost limitation by $353 million, to respond to direction from the conferees, and decreased the production cost limitation by the same amount. As adjusted, the EMD cost limitation increased to $19.041 billion.

We also reviewed the extent to which the F-22 EMD program was achieving cost, schedule, and performance goals, including major modifications.", "To determine whether the program was expected to meet the cost limitation, we obtained the current cost estimate, which served as a basis for the fiscal year 1999 budget request. We compared that estimate to the estimate supporting the cost limitation and discussed the reasons for the differences with F-22 financial management officials. We made several analyses, including comparing the estimated cost at completion for the prime contracts with planned amounts, and evaluating cost variances identified in the earned value management system.", "We obtained and reviewed information on the cost and schedule goals for the F-22 EMD program established by the JET during its review of the F-22 program. Since the JET did not revise F-22 performance requirements, we defined the performance goals as those performance requirements on contract at the time the JET reviewed the program. To assist us in determining the goals, we also reviewed overall program documents such as Selected Acquisition Reports, Monthly Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summaries, Program Management Reviews, contracts with the prime contractors, Test and Evaluation Master Plans, and Program Management Directives.", "To determine whether the program was expected to meet schedule goals, we obtained the current approved program schedule, which incorporated the latest restructured plans for the F-22 EMD program. We discussed the schedule and potential changes to it with F-22 program officials. We also reviewed the planned flight test schedule and the changes to it as a result of the late first flight of the first EMD aircraft. In addition, we discussed technical problems in assembling subsequent EMD aircraft. We evaluated schedule variances in the earned value management system and compared planned milestone accomplishment dates with actual dates of accomplishments. We also assessed the impact the late first flight may have on the overall EMD schedule.", "To determine whether the program was expected to meet the F-22 performance goals, we analyzed information on the performance of key performance parameters and of those important subparameters that are measured. We compared the Air Force\u2019s current estimate for these parameters to previous estimates to determine whether estimated performance had changed. We determined whether the current estimates were based on actual tests, engineering models, or engineering judgment. We discussed each of the key performance parameters with program officials and determined the basis for the current estimates. We also reviewed past program documentation to determine the basis for the required performance and discussed the reasons for differences between required performance and estimated performance.", "To evaluate the bases for the Air Force\u2019s current performance estimates, we collected information on the goals established for the major performance subparameters that are critical components of the performance parameters. We collected and analyzed information on Air Force estimates, as of January 1998, toward meeting the goals of these subparameters to determine whether the Air Force estimates seemed reasonable. For example, the major subparameters of the airlift support parameter are the number of aircraft support equipment items, the airlift loads necessary to transport aircraft support equipment items, and the maintenance manpower required for a squadron of F-22s. Each of these subparameters has a performance goal just as the overall parameter has a performance goal. The performance parameters and their associated major subparameters are shown in table II.1.", "Number of support equipment items Airlift loads required to deploy support equipment Number of support equipment items (27 individual subparameters) (No subparameters)", "To determine the status of contract modifications expected to have a significant effect on F-22 cost or performance, we reviewed the Air Force\u2019s process for receiving, reviewing, approving, and monitoring engineering change proposals. We obtained a list of the proposals received and determined which had been approved. For those proposals that were approved, we reviewed the related documentation to determine their status and their estimated impact on aircraft performance and on the cost of the EMD program.", "To be able to certify whether we had access to sufficient data to make informed judgments on the matters covered in our report, we maintained a log of our requests and the Air Force responses. We numbered and tracked each request we made for documents and for meetings to determine how long it took to receive responses from the Air Force.
