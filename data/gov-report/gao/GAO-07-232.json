The Air Force is the largest contributor to DOD's total on-hand inventory on the basis of inventory value. Under the statutory authority of the Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on his own initiative, GAO determined the extent to which (1) the Air Force's on-order and on-hand inventory reflect the amount of inventory needed to support required inventory levels from fiscal years 2002 through 2005, and (2) the Air Force had shortages in its inventory needed to support required levels during this period. To address these objectives GAO analyzed Air Force secondary inventory data (spare parts such as engines and guided missiles) from fiscal years 2002 through 2005."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["More than half of the Air Force's secondary inventory (spare parts), worth an average of $31.4 billion, was not needed to support required on-hand and on-order inventory levels from fiscal years 2002 through 2005, although increased demand due to ongoing military operations contributed to slight reductions in the percentage of inventory on hand and the number of years of supply it represents. DOD regulations provide guidance for developing materiel requirements based on customer expectations while minimizing inventories. However, the value of Air Force on-order inventory not needed to support required inventory levels increased by about 7.8 percent, representing an average of 52 percent ($1.3 billion) of its on-order inventory. The Air Force has continued to purchase unneeded on-order inventory because its policies do not provide incentives to reduce the amount of inventory on order that is not needed to support requirements. When the Air Force buys these items it may obligate funds unnecessarily, which could lead to not having sufficient obligation authority to purchase needed items and could negatively impact readiness. In addition, although the percentage of the Air Force on-hand inventory was reduced by 2.7 percent due to increases in demand, about 65 percent ($18.7 billion) of this inventory was not needed to support required inventory levels. GAO calculated that it costs the Air Force from $15 million to $30 million annually to store its unneeded items. Of the Air Force's inventory items not needed to support required inventory levels, 79 percent had no recurring demands (such as engines and airframe components), resulting in a potentially infinite supply of those items. The Air Force has continued to retain this unneeded inventory with no recurring demands, in part, because the Air Force has not performed a comprehensive assessment to revalidate the need to continue to retain these items. For the remaining 21 percent of items that had recurring demands, increasing demands resulted in a reduction in the number of years of supply that this inventory represents, with the largest quantity and value of items having between 2 to 10 years of supply. Inventory not needed to support required inventory levels can be attributed to many long-standing problems, such as decreasing demands, retaining items used to support aging weapon systems that have diminishing sources of supply or are being phased out of service, and not terminating contracts for on-order items. Air Force officials acknowledged that decreases in demand have resulted in having more inventory than is needed; however, the Air Force has not evaluated why it continues to experience decreases in demand or taken actions to mitigate the effect of these changes. Without taking actions to reduce its unneeded inventory, the Air Force will continue its past practices of purchasing and retaining items it does not need and then spending additional resources to handle and store these items. Although more than half of its secondary inventory was not needed to support required levels, the Air Force still had shortages of certain items. From fiscal years 2002 through 2005, the percentage and value of the Air Force's inventory shortages remained the same at about 8 percent and $1.2 billion."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each of the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)  maintain a supply of secondary inventory of spare parts to keep military  equipment operating for its missions.

This  increase was primarily due to the addition of new items to the Air Force\u2019s  inventory in fiscal year 2005. Specifically, from September 30, 2002,  through September 30, 2005, the Air Force added 2,331 new unique items  with a total of about 179,425 individual parts that were valued at  approximately $1.3 billion. Our analysis shows that increases in the Air  Force\u2019s inventory were also caused by changes in the value and quantity of  the unique items in the inventory. We found that changes in the price of  items in the Air Force\u2019s secondary inventory resulted in a $0.8 billion  increase in the value of its inventory in fiscal year 2005. Similarly, changes  in the quantity of secondary inventory unique items that were on hand in  fiscal year 2002 were the reason for a $0.7 billion increase in the value of  DOD\u2019s secondary inventory in fiscal year 2005.

This information is used to  develop the Air Force\u2019s budget stratification report. The stratification  report shows the amount of inventory needed to meet operating  requirements. When the total of on-hand and on-order inventory falls to or  below a certain level\u2014called the reorder point\u2014inventory managers place  orders for additional inventory to prevent out-of-stock situations from  occurring.

Instead, the Air Force has revised its policies to make it  easier to purchase inventory that is not needed to support requirements.

Additionally, DOD\u2019s Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation states  that the Air Force is required to review and validate, at least once  annually, the methodology used in deciding to retain these items. In  responding to our surveys, many item management specialists cited  various Air Force memoranda that contain the justification for retaining  items that support aging weapon systems, such as the B-52 and the A/OA- 10. For example, according to the retention memo for B-52 assets, the  rationale for taking a conservative approach when disposing of excess  inventory items is to counter routine difficulties in obtaining assets needed  to meet requirements due to diminishing manufacturing sources and the  increasing cost of reprocuring these items should demand arise after  disposal of on-hand assets occurs. The projected life of the B-52 is  expected to last until the year 2040. According to an Air Force  memorandum, unless an item or system supporting the B-52 is replaced,  most of these inventory items will be required at some point during the  weapon system\u2019s projected life. Similar reasons were given for retaining  the A-10 assets. However, item management officials for the A-10 have  requested that all assets supporting this weapon system\u2014many of which  currently have little or no usage\u2014be retained for the projected life of the  weapon system, which is the year 2028. Based on our sample, we estimate  that there is at least $24 million worth of inventory on hand that supports  the A-10 and the B-52 weapons systems. Although the actual usage rates  may be small, given the length of time these systems will continue to be in  service, without establishing some baseline requirements for the items  supporting these systems, the Air Force will continue to have large  quantities of inventory on hand that appear not to be needed to support  requirements, even though the Air Force projects that these items may be  needed in the future to support these weapon systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Support of New Weapon Systems by Current Items", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force is retaining some inventory items because they potentially  may be used to support new weapon systems. In June 2005, the Air Force  Materiel Management Division directed that all parts for the F-16 aircraft  weapon system be retained for a period of at least 1 year until the Air  Combat Command completes an analysis of alternatives on the next  generation replacement for the QF-4 aircraft weapon system. In July  2006, this retention policy was extended until the analysis of alternatives is  completed in 2007 and a decision is made. Currently, the F-16 is a leading  candidate for replacing the QF-4 aircraft that will be phased out of service;  thus, the future requirements for assets supporting the F-16 are unknown  at this time. As a result, the Air Force is retaining all F-16 assets because  they may be used to support the new weapon system. According to Air  Force officials, they are using the lessons learned from the QF-4 program,  where they had documented cases of repurchasing previously owned Air  Force inventory from salvage contractors, usually at very high prices.

The Air Force defines items on order that are in  excess of their requirements objective as termination quantities, which  should be considered for contract cancellation under Air Force policy. As  of September 30, 2005, the Air Force had 789 unique items (about 115,000  individual parts), valued at about $261 million, that should have been  considered for contract termination. However, based on our sample, we  estimate that only 5 percent of the contracts for items that should have  been considered for termination actually were terminated or reduced.  Item management specialists reported that contracts were not cancelled  or the quantity on contract was not reduced due to a variety of reasons  that include: items were delivered before the termination quantities were  identified, items were delivered before termination actions were taken,  contract termination model results showed that it was not economically  feasible to terminate contracts, items were purchased as government  furnished equipment to support contractor repair, data errors resulted in  inaccurately identifying contracts for termination, and manpower  constraints resulted in the issuance of an interim policy directing that no  contracts valued at $1 million or less be terminated. For these items, we  did not determine whether the Air Force ran the termination model in a  timely manner to determine the feasibility of canceling the orders or  bringing the items into inventory, nor did we determine whether the Air  Force responded to the model\u2019s recommendations in a timely manner.", "One frequent reason noted for lack of action to terminate or reduce a  contract was an interim policy instituted from March 2005 through June  2006 at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, directing that no  termination actions be taken for items valued at $1 million or less. For  these items, item management specialists also were not required to  perform the contract cancellation computation to determine if it was  economically feasible to terminate these contracts. According to  Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center officials, this revised termination  policy was instituted because of a decrease in the manpower needed to  accurately and completely process these items with potential excess  inventory due to mandatory training requirements. For the total number of  items that we computed to be on-order inventory not needed to meet  requirements as of September 30, 2005, this policy resulted in the  acquisition of about 77 percent of the Oklahoma Air Logistics Center\u2019s  inventory, valued at $123 million, which was not supported by  requirements."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Air Force Inventory Shortages Remained the Same", "paragraphs": ["Although more than half of its secondary inventory was not needed to  support requirements, the Air Force still had shortages of certain items in  inventory.

In our previous work, we have similarly reported  that increases in demand, the use of substitute items, and weapon systems  upgrades or modifications have been reasons for inventory shortages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The nation faces an increasingly fiscally constrained environment where it  is imperative that the Air Force exercise good stewardship over the  billions of dollars invested in its inventory. At a time when the Air Force is  making personnel reductions due to fiscal challenges, its ineffective and  inefficient inventory management practices hinder its ability to efficiently  and effectively allocate its resources. On average, from fiscal year 2002  through fiscal year 2005, the Air Force experienced shortages for some  required items, valued at about $1.2 billion, which may have negatively  affected readiness. However, during this same period, the Air Force  maintained about $20 billion worth of items both on order and on hand  that were not needed to support requirements. When the Air Force buys  unneeded items, it is obligating funds unnecessarily, which could lead to  not having sufficient funds to purchase needed items, which also may  negatively affect readiness. Correcting these problems would make more  funds available that could then be used to purchase items needed to  reduce the Air Force\u2019s inventory shortages or meet other Air Force  requirements. Without modifying its policies to provide incentives to  reduce the amount of inventory on order that is not needed to support  requirements or conducting a comprehensive assessment to validate the  need to retain unneeded on-hand inventory that does not have recurring  demands, the Air Force will continue its past practices of purchasing and  retaining items that it does not need and then spending additional  resources to handle and store these items. Absent establishing ongoing  requirements for items to support weapon systems that have lengthy  projected life spans, the spare parts used in these systems will appear to  be unneeded even though the Air Force plans to retain these items and  expects that these items will be needed over the life span of the system.  Moreover, although inventory requirements change as a result of changes  in the national threat levels and missions, continuing decreases in demand  have caused more inventory to be on hand than is needed to support  requirements. Until the Air Force evaluates why it continues to have long- standing decreases in demand, it will continue to maintain inventory that  is not needed to support requirements, which may result in unnecessary  increased storage costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To meet customer expectations while minimizing inventory and to reduce  the Air Force\u2019s inventory not needed to support requirements, we are  recommending that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Air Force to take the following four actions:    modify its policies to provide incentives to reduce purchases of on-order  inventory that are not needed to support requirements, such as requiring  contract termination review for all unneeded on-order inventory or  reducing the funding available for the Air Force Materiel Command by an  amount up to the value of the Air Force\u2019s on-order inventory that is not  needed to support requirements;    conduct a comprehensive assessment of the inventory items on hand that  are not needed to support requirements and that have no recurring  demands and revalidate the need to continue to retain these items, and, as  part of this assessment, consider establishing ongoing requirements for  items supporting weapon systems that have lengthy projected life spans;    evaluate the reasons why the Air Force continually experiences decreases  in demands which have contributed to having more than half of its  inventory on hand not needed to support requirements; and    after evaluating the reasons for the decreases in demand, determine what  actions are needed to address these decreases and then take steps to  implement these actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in app. IV), DOD  concurred with three of our recommendations and partially concurred  with one. DOD cited specific actions it plans to take to implement the four  recommendations and specified implementation timelines for each  recommendation. We do not believe that DOD\u2019s planned actions are fully  responsive to two of our recommendations. Our evaluation of DOD\u2019s  planned actions is discussed in detail below.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation for the Air Force to  modify its policies to provide incentives to reduce purchases of on-order  inventory that are not needed to support requirements. While DOD agreed  that opportunities exist to reduce Air Force on-order inventory by  ensuring that on-order material above the reorder point is properly  reviewed and that measures are put in place to ensure Air Force inventory  management specialists are following excess on-order termination  procedures, it did not agree that a change or modification to the Air  Force\u2019s policy was required to accomplish this task, as we recommended.  DOD said that the Air Force plans to address this issue by enforcing  existing policy and by placing an increased focus on excess on-order  measures. However, DOD did not explain these measures or what steps it  will take to ensure that they are effectively implemented. DOD plans to  provide a status update on the implementation of this recommendation by  the end of September 2007. While we believe the actions cited by DOD are  a step in the right direction, we do not believe that these planned actions  are fully responsive to our recommendation. In this report we found that  the Air Force has continued to not terminate contracts for unneeded on- order inventory because its policies do not provide incentives to reduce  the amount of inventory on order that is not needed to support  requirements. For example, as we stated in our report, in June 2006 the Air  Force revised its policy for reviewing contract termination actions valued  at $1 million or less, which makes it easier to purchase inventory that is  not needed to support requirements. This new policy requires each air  logistics center to review at least 80 percent of the center\u2019s total computed  termination value, with priority given to those terminations with the  highest dollar value. Under its prior policy, all such orders were required  to be reviewed for potential contract termination. As a result, this revised  policy will require fewer on-order inventory items to be reviewed for  potential contract termination. Given that we found more than half of the  Air Force\u2019s on-order inventory was not needed to support on-order  requirements at a time when the old policy requiring review of all orders  was in effect, we believe that this new policy will exacerbate the problem.  Thus, we continue to believe that the Air Force needs to modify its current  policy to provide incentives to reduce purchases of on-order inventory as  we recommended.", "DOD concurred with our second recommendation to conduct a  comprehensive assessment of unneeded on-hand inventory, stating that it  agreed that opportunities exist to reduce Air Force on-hand inventory for  items that are not needed to support requirements and have no recurring  demands and that the need to continue to retain these items should be  validated. DOD stated that the Air Force will review its current stockage  retention policy and take actions necessary to reduce the inventory as  required. DOD also stated that the Air Force will conduct annual reviews  of all inventory items as directed by DOD\u2019s Supply Chain Management  policy. DOD plans to provide a status update on the implementation of this  recommendation by the end of September 2007. DOD also commented that  no further guidance was needed. While we recognize that some of this  inventory should be retained for economic or contingency reasons, we  believe that added scrutiny should be applied to the Air Force\u2019s review of  its stockage retention policy to ensure that it is not retaining assets that  are not needed to support current and future operational needs. Based on  our work, we believe that the Air Force has a tremendous potential for  reducing its inventory because much of the inventory has no projected  recurring demands, meaning that it is unlikely that this inventory will ever  be used. In other cases, inventories may not be needed because many  years of supply are on hand. DOD\u2019s planned actions are a step in the right  direction; however, unless and until the Air Force makes appropriate  adjustments to its inventory retention levels, there are no assurances that  significant improvements will be made to reduce the Air Force\u2019s on-hand  inventory not needed to support requirements.", "In responding to our second recommendation, DOD did not address the  portion of the recommendation directing the Air Force to consider  establishing requirements for items that support weapon systems that  have lengthy projected life spans. Without establishing requirements for  items that the Air Force wants to retain for future use, it will be difficult to  determine what portion of its inventory that is in excess of its  requirements is valid to retain. For example, as stated in our report, many  of the items supporting the A-10 and B-52 weapon systems have minimal  usage rates, but they are being procured today to prevent difficulties in  obtaining these assets in the future due to diminishing manufacturing  sources. These weapon systems have projected life spans that could last  until the year 2028 and 2040, respectively. Given the length of time these  systems will continue to be in service, the Air Force needs to establish  some baseline requirements for the items supporting these systems;  otherwise, the Air Force will continue to have large quantities of inventory  on hand that appear not to be needed to support requirements, even  though these items may be needed in the future to support these weapon  systems. Thus, we continue to believe that our recommendation is valid  and DOD should consider establishing requirements for these items.", "DOD concurred with our third recommendation to evaluate the reasons  why the Air Force continually experiences decreases in demands, which  have contributed to having more than half of its inventory on hand not  needed to support requirements. DOD agreed that the Air Force  experiences changes in demand levels and stated that these changes can  be attributed to changes in Air Force missions, reliability and technology  improvements, and modifications of inventory items. DOD stated that the  Air Force plans to review the computation forecasting model and make  any changes required to help ensure future requirements reflect actual  demands. DOD plans to provide a status update on the implementation of  this recommendation by the end of September 2007. We believe that these  actions are generally responsive to our recommendation.", "In responding to this recommendation, DOD also stated that our finding  that more than half of the Air Force inventory on hand is not needed to  support requirements is inaccurate. DOD has consistently disagreed with  our definition of inventory not needed to support requirements because it  differs from the definition that DOD uses for budgeting purposes. DOD  policy identifies inventory not needed to support requirements based on  current requirements and requirements that are projected through the end  of a 2-year budget period. For our work, we only analyzed the Air Force\u2019s  inventory that is needed to support current requirements. We do not  believe that the projected requirements for the 2-year budget period  should be considered in determining the amount of inventory needed to  support current requirements. As stated in our report, if the Air Force did  not have enough inventory on hand or on order to satisfy the projected  requirements for the 2-year budget period, the requirements determination  process would not result in additional inventory being purchased to satisfy  these requirements. As a result, based on our analysis, we found that more  than half of the Air Force\u2019s on-hand and on-order inventory is not needed  to support requirements. We continue to believe that our characterization  of the Air Force inventory is reasonable, because it reflects the amount of  inventory needed to be on hand and on order to support current  requirements.", "Finally, DOD fully concurred with our fourth recommendation to  determine what actions are needed to address the decreases in demand  and then take steps to implement these actions. DOD stated that the Air  Force incorporates requirement changes, resulting in decreased demands,  into the computation forecasting model as soon as those changes are  known. However, DOD acknowledged that the key is to define the changes  soon enough to prevent or terminate buys which may not be needed. DOD  stated that the Air Force will monitor the goals, actions, and deliverables  as a part of the Air Force computation forecasting model review.

The stratification reports serve as a  budget request preparation tool and a mechanism for military officials to  review funding. Specifically, the Air Force uses this inventory stratification  process to develop inventory budgets, show why inventory is held, and  identify assets that are either on hand or on order as of the stratification  date. Our analysis was based on evaluating the Air Force\u2019s item  stratifications within the opening position table of the Central Secondary  Item Stratification Reports.", "To validate the data in the budget stratification reports, we generated  summary reports using electronic data and verified our totals against the  summary stratification reports obtained from the Air Force. The Air Force  secondary inventory data are identified by unique stock numbers for each  spare part, such as an engine for a particular aircraft, which we refer to as  unique items. The Air Force may have in its inventory multiple quantities  of each unique item, which we refer to as individual parts. We calculated  the value of each unique item by multiplying the quantity of the item\u2019s  individual parts by the item\u2019s unit price, which is the latest acquisition cost  for the item. We computed total values for all items collectively in the  inventory and the stratification tables were recreated. This computation  approach is consistent with the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) process  for valuing assets in its annual Supply System Inventory Report. In cases  where we found discrepancies in our dataset because of one or more  items being reported in the stratification, we identified the excess item and  removed it from the dataset. After assessing the Air Force data, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  analysis and findings.", "Upon completion of the data validation process, we revalued the Air  Force\u2019s secondary inventory items identified in its budget stratification  summary reports because these reports value useable items and items in  need of repair at the same rate, and do not take into account the repair  cost for repairable broken items. We computed the new value for items in  need of repair by subtracting repair costs from the unit price for each item.  In cases where the repair cost was greater than the unit price, we obtained  new calculations from the Air Force for revaluing these assets. To  determine the causes for the $1.2 billion increase in the Air Force\u2019s  secondary item inventory levels between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, we  analyzed the inventory to determine if the increase was due to changes in  the inventory\u2019s value, changes in the quantity of items in inventory, new  items added to the inventory, or obsolete items removed from the  inventory.", "We excluded requirements for administrative and production lead time  from the Air Force\u2019s on-hand requirements. However, DOD\u2019s practice has  always been to use administrative and production lead time requirements  to justify the amount of inventory it had on hand. We do not agree with  this practice to use lead time requirements to justify on-hand inventory  because based on DOD\u2019s material management regulations, acquisition  lead time quantities are not required to be on hand. Acquisition lead time  is the sum of administrative and production lead times. However, we do  agree with DOD that excess on-hand inventory should be used to offset or  satisfy requirements for lead time because it would reduce the amount of  inventory that needs to be on order.", "In commenting on our past reports, DOD and the Air Force have  disagreed with our definition of inventory that was not needed to satisfy  current operating requirements because it differs from the definition that  is used for the inventory budget process. We consider the Air Force to  have unneeded on-order or on-hand inventory if it has more inventory than  is needed to satisfy its requirements based on the Opening Position table  of the Air Force\u2019s budget stratification report. However, if the Air Force  has more inventory on order or on hand than is needed to satisfy its  requirements, it does not consider the inventory beyond the requirements  to be unneeded. Instead, the Air Force uses the on-order inventory that is  beyond its on-order requirements to satisfy future demands over a 2-year  period and contingency retention requirements. Similarly, when the Air  Force has on-hand inventory that is beyond its on-hand requirements, it  uses the inventory to satisfy future demands over a 2-year period, lead  time requirements, economic retention requirements, and contingency  retention requirements. Only after applying inventory to satisfy these  additional requirements would the Air Force consider that it has more  inventory than is needed and would consider this inventory for potential  reutilization or disposal. We do not agree with the Air Force\u2019s practice of  not identifying inventory used to satisfy these additional requirements as  excess because it overstates the amount of inventory needed to be on  hand or on order by billions of dollars. The Air Force\u2019s requirements  determination process does not consider these additional requirements  (except for on-hand inventory needed to meet lead time requirements)  when it calculates the amount of inventory needed to be on hand or on  order. If the Air Force did not have enough inventory on hand or on order  to satisfy these additional requirements, the requirements determination  process would not result in additional inventory being purchased to satisfy  these requirements. Tables 7 and 8 show a comparison of our analysis and  the Air Force\u2019s stratification results of how on-order and on-hand  inventory for fiscal year 2005 is applied to satisfy requirements.", "To determine the extent to which the Air Force\u2019s on-order and on-hand  secondary inventory reflects the amount of inventory needed to support  requirements, we reviewed DOD and Air Force inventory management  policies, past GAO products on DOD and Air Force inventory management  practices for secondary inventory items, and other related documentation.  We also compared the Air Force\u2019s current inventory to its current on-order  and on-hand operating requirements and computed the amount and value  of secondary inventory exceeding or not meeting current operating  requirements. To determine the amount and value of the Air Force  inventory not needed to support requirements and inventory shortages, we  reviewed the Air Force\u2019s summary and item-specific budget stratification  reports for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. We subdivided all items into  one of four categories: (1) items that only had on-order inventory not  needed to support requirements, (2) items that only had on-hand items not  needed to support requirements, (3) items that had both on-order and on- hand items not needed to support requirements, or (4) items with  inventory shortages. In computing the number and value of on-order items  not needed to support requirements, we added the results from category  one and the results from the on-order portion of category three to  compute the total number of items and value of on-order items not needed  to support requirements. Similarly, we added the results from category  two and the results from the on-hand portion of category three to compute  the total number of items and value of on-hand items not needed to  support requirements.", "Additionally, we calculated the storage costs of the inventory on hand that  was not needed to meet requirements. We obtained the storage rates for  the three different categories\u2014covered, open, and special\u2014of storage  from the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA), which was where the inventory  items were held. Then we sent DLA officials a list of the Air Force  inventory, and they identified the category of each item. To determine the  storage rate, we created a database that calculated the number of items  multiplied by the annual storage cost rate and multiplied by the volume  per item. To distinguish between the categories of items, the storage rates  for useable items and items in need of repair were calculated separately.", "Additionally, to understand whether the inventory not needed to support  requirements had improved in relation to its years of supply, we calculated  the number of supply years a given item would have based on its present  quantity and demand. To determine the years of supply, we computed the  projected years of supply using the projected recurring demand data for  items with on-hand and on-order inventory not needed to support  requirements. In fiscal years 2002 and 2005, items with projected recurring  demands represented about 21 percent of the items with on-order and on- hand inventory not needed to support requirements. The remaining 79  percent of these items had no projected recurring demands, which means  that the potential years of supply is infinite.", "We developed a survey to estimate the frequency of reasons why the Air  Force maintained items in inventory that were not needed to support  requirements or that did not meet requirements. In the survey, we referred  to those items that were not needed to support requirements as \u201cexcess\u201d  and the items that did not meet requirements as \u201cshortages.\u201d The survey  asked general questions about the higher assembly (component parts)  and/or weapon systems that the items support, and whether the item is on  the Air Force\u2019s mission-critical items list (i.e., Air Force Readiness Driver  Program). In addition, we asked survey respondents to identify the  reason(s) for the excess or shortage. We provided potential reasons as  responses from which they could select based on reasons identified in  some of our prior work. Since the list was not exhaustive, we provided a  response option of \u201cother, please explain.\u201d Finally, we asked that survey  respondents provide copies of any implementation plans, schedules, and  initiatives planned or in place to reduce excesses or improve shortages. In  addition to an expert technical review of the questionnaire by an  independent survey methodologist, we conducted in-depth pretests by  item management specialists at the Cryptologic Systems Group located in  San Antonio, Texas prior to deployment of the final survey instrument. We  revised the questionnaire accordingly based on findings from the pretests.", "We sent this survey electronically to specific item management specialists  in charge of sampled unique items at the Air Force\u2019s Air Logistic Centers.  To estimate the frequency of reasons for inventory not needed to meet  requirements and inventory shortages, we drew a stratified random  probability sample of 335 unique items\u2014230 of these with excess  inventory and 105 with inventory shortages\u2014from a study population of  18,676 items\u201410,810 with inventory not needed to meet requirements and  7,866 with inventory shortages. Based on our analysis of the Air Force  stratification data, for fiscal year 2005, there were 88,445 unique items with  inventory not needed to meet requirements valued at $19.8 billion. Of  these 88,445 items, 10,810 met our criteria to be included in our study  population of items not needed to meet requirements.

Additionally, based on our analysis of the stratification data,  all of the 7,866 unique items with inventory shortages, valued at $1.2  billion, met our criteria to be included in our shortage study population.  We selected our sample of items not needed to meet requirements from six  strata defined by the criteria described in table 9. Our shortage sample was  selected from two strata defined by the criteria described in table 10. The  divisions of the population, sample, and respondents across the strata, as  well as response rate by stratum, are also shown in tables 9 and 10.", "We sent 335 electronic surveys\u2014one survey for each item in the sample\u2014 to the 230 Air Force item management specialists identified as being  responsible for these items. Ultimately, we received 295 responses for the  survey, for adjusted response rates of 82 percent for excess items and 88  percent for shortage items. Each sampled item was subsequently weighted  in the final analysis to represent all the members of the target population.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample of unique items is only one of a large number of samples that  we might have drawn. Because each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results in 95 percent confidence intervals. These are intervals  that would contain the actual population values for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident  that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true  values in the study population. All percentage estimates from our sample  have margins of error (that is, widths of confidence intervals) of plus or  minus 10 percentage points or less, at the 95 percent confidence level  unless otherwise noted.", "In addition to sampling errors, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors.  For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the  sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how the  data are entered into a database or were analyzed can introduce unwanted  variability into the survey results. We took steps in the development of the  questionnaire, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these  nonsampling errors.
