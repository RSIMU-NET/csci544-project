Although Medicare managed care enrollment has nearly doubled in the last 3 years, approximately 32 million beneficiaries (83 percent) remain covered under fee-for-service. Many health care analysts believe that competition among MCOs can lead to enhanced benefit packages and lower out-of-pocket fees for Medicare beneficiaries. Analysts further believe that increased managed care enrollment may yield savings for the Medicare program. The potential of Medicare+Choice cannot be realized, however, unless beneficiaries are well-informed about their enrollment options.", "Recently, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, took steps to increase beneficiaries\u2019 awareness of their health care options. Beneficiaries can now obtain names of available plans and a summary of their benefit packages by calling a toll-free telephone number or logging onto HCFA\u2019s Internet Web site. The agency intends to include some of this information in the Medicare handbooks it will mail to all beneficiaries in October 1999. In spite of these new resources, however, MCOs\u2019 sales agents and member literature will remain beneficiaries\u2019 only source of detailed information about plans\u2019 benefits and out-of-pocket fees. HCFA, therefore, continues to review and approve all member literature and other marketing materials distributed by MCOs to help ensure that beneficiaries receive accurate information about their available health plan options.", "Because correct and useful information is vital to the success of the Medicare+Choice program, you asked us to assess (1) the extent to which MCOs\u2019 member literature provides beneficiaries with accurate and useful plan information and (2) whether HCFA\u2019s review process ensures that beneficiaries can rely on MCOs\u2019 member literature to make informed enrollment decisions. To address these issues, we assessed the accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and comparability of the member literature of 16 MCOs and studied HCFA\u2019s requirements and practices for reviewing and approving these materials. Our analysis focused on three benefits that vary in complexity: annual screening mammography, outpatient prescription drugs, and ambulance transportation.

Of the almost 7 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care as of March 1999, nearly all were enrolled in plans whose MCOs receive a fixed monthly fee from Medicare for each beneficiary they serve.

BBA also established an annual, coordinated enrollment period to begin in 1999 during which beneficiaries may enroll or change enrollment in a Medicare+Choice plan. Previously, MCOs were required to have at least one 30-day period each year when they accepted new members, but most MCOs accepted new members throughout the entire year.

While some regional offices may review materials that certain organizations distribute nationwide, generally each regional office is responsible for reviewing the materials to be distributed within its geographic jurisdiction. To verify the accuracy of benefit information, regional staff are instructed to check plan materials against the BIF.

Beginning in November 1998, HCFA was required to provide an annual national educational and publicity campaign to inform beneficiaries about the availability of Medicare+Choice plans and the enrollment process. Also, each fall starting in 1999, HCFA must distribute to beneficiaries an array of general information about the traditional Medicare program, supplemental insurance, appeal and other rights, the process for enrolling in a Medicare+Choice plan, and the potential for Medicare+Choice contract termination.

While we found no errors about ambulance services, some MCOs\u2019 member literature omitted information about the benefit. Moreover, beneficiaries frequently did not receive important information until after enrollment. Even then, beneficiaries in some plans received member literature that was incomplete and did not fully disclose plan benefits, exclusions, and fees. The lack of full disclosure in member literature leaves the beneficiary vulnerable to unexpected service denials and additional out-of-pocket fees.

Also, MCOs were required to notify beneficiaries of this new Medicare benefit. Materials from five MCOs, however, explicitly stated that beneficiaries must obtain physician referrals to obtain screening mammograms. (See fig. 3 for three examples.) Member literature from five other organizations failed to inform beneficiaries of their right to self-refer for this service.", "Much of the MCOs\u2019 member literature provided incorrect or inconsistent information about prescription drug coverage. For example, the member literature for a large, experienced Medicare MCO specified an annual dollar limit for prescription drugs that was lower than the amount required by the organization\u2019s Medicare contract. The contract required the provision of unlimited generic drugs and coverage of at least $1,200 for brand-name drugs. This MCO\u2019s materials, which varied by county, understated the brand-name drug coverage, listing annual dollar limits as low as $600. When we contacted the MCO officials, they confirmed that they were providing the lower benefit coverage. On the basis of the MCO\u2019s enrollment for 1998, we estimated that about 130,000 members could have been denied part of the benefit that Medicare paid for and to which they were entitled under the MCO\u2019s contract. Another MCO provided conflicting information about its prescription drug benefit. In one document, the MCO alternately described its prescription drug benefit as having a $200 monthly limit and a $300 monthly limit. (The correct limit was $300.) In another case, an MCO used the same member literature for four separate plans, emphasizing that all members were entitled to prescription drug benefits. Actually, however, only two of the four plans offered a prescription drug benefit.", "The member literature we reviewed did not contain errors regarding ambulance services, but the documents often omitted important information about the benefit.

For example, one MCO failed to provide enrollees with a current member policy document until August 1998\u20148 months after the start of the new benefits year.", "Distributing outdated information can be misleading. HCFA allows MCOs to use outdated plan member materials as long as the organizations attach an addendum indicating any changes to the benefit package. HCFA officials believe that this policy is reasonable because beneficiaries can determine a plan\u2019s coverage by comparing the changes cited in the addendum with the prior year\u2019s literature. However, some MCOs distributed outdated literature without the required addendum. When MCOs did include the addendum, the document did not always clearly indicate that its information superseded the information contained in other documents. In addition, some MCOs did not provide dates on their literature, which obscured the fact that the literature was outdated.", "Adequate preenrollment benefit information will become even more crucial in 2001, as BBA\u2019s annual enrollment provisions begin to take effect in 2002 and Medicare beneficiaries are no longer able to disenroll on a monthly basis. To help beneficiaries make informed choices, BBA requires HCFA to provide beneficiaries with summary plan information before the annual November enrollment period. Furthermore, new regulations now require MCOs to issue letters by mid-October each year describing benefit changes that will be effective January 1 of the following year. MCOs must send these annual notification letters to all enrollees, and to any prospective enrollees upon request. However, HCFA has not required MCOs to provide more complete member literature prior to enrollment. As a result, beneficiaries still might not have the information they need to make sound enrollment choices.", "Additionally, beneficiaries enrolling in plans before 2002 may be unaware that their plans may be terminating services shortly after the beneficiaries have enrolled. A plan must notify its members at least 60 to 90 days before it ends services. However, there is no requirement that a terminating plan stop advertising and enrolling new members, with the result that in 1998, some beneficiaries unknowingly joined plans that soon exited the Medicare program. For example, one MCO notified its members in May 1998 of its intent to end services in several Ohio counties. The MCO continued to advertise and enroll new beneficiaries without informing them that plan services would end on December 31, 1998.

However, other MCOs did not disclose important restrictions in any member literature.", "In fact, MCOs that adopt HCFA\u2019s suggested disclosure language will send beneficiaries to an information dead end.

Furthermore, an MCO is not required, according to HCFA officials, to provide beneficiaries with copies of its Medicare contract. MCO officials we spoke with differed on whether their organization would distribute copies of its contract to beneficiaries. By establishing an MCO\u2019s Medicare contract\u2014a document that is not usually available to beneficiaries\u2014as the only document required to fully explain the plan\u2019s benefit coverage, HCFA cannot ensure that beneficiaries are aware of the benefits to which they are entitled.", "Vague or incomplete benefit descriptions leave beneficiaries vulnerable to unexpected service denials. For example, disputes sometimes arise when beneficiaries are told they do not have the coverage they believed they would have when they enrolled. An official from the Center for Health Dispute Resolution (CHDR), HCFA\u2019s contractor that adjudicates managed care appeal cases, told us that CHDR uses the information in MCOs\u2019 member literature to determine whether plan members are entitled to specific benefits that are not covered by Medicare fee-for-service. When an MCO\u2019s literature is vague, CHDR allows the MCO to submit internal plan memorandums that clarify its benefit coverage.

It was not easy to know where to look for the information. For example, we found the answer to the question of whether a plan used a formulary in plan A\u2019s summary of benefits, plan B\u2019s Medicare prescription drug rider, and plan C\u2019s contract amendment. Plan C\u2019s materials required more careful review to answer the question because the membership contract indicated the plan did not provide drug coverage.

OPM contract specialists then review the brochures to verify compliance with mandatory terminology and format requirements and to ensure that nonstandard information is presented appropriately, given the plans\u2019 benefit packages and organizational structures. For example, organizations offering fee-for-service (indemnity) plans would use different language in describing plan procedures and restrictions than MCOs would.

Achieving this goal will require HCFA\u2019s work group to reach consensus on standards for clear and accurate information and to avoid imposing burdensome requirements on MCOs. HCFA\u2019s long-term goals include establishing standards for other key documents, but the agency has not yet developed a coordinated strategy for its long-term efforts or decided whether such standards will be voluntary or mandatory."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Beneficiaries who enrolled or considered enrolling in the plans we reviewed were not well-served by plans\u2019 efforts to produce member materials or HCFA\u2019s review of them. The information that plans distributed was often confusing and hard to compare. Some plans distributed inaccurate or incomplete information or provided the information after beneficiaries had made their enrollment decisions, when it was less useful. These problems significantly limited beneficiaries\u2019 ability to make informed decisions about their health plan options. Moreover, some beneficiaries may have been denied health care coverage to which they were entitled or required to pay unexpected out-of-pocket fees. In contrast, each FEHBP plan must provide prospective enrollees with a single, comprehensive brochure to facilitate comparisons and informed enrollment choices.", "Revisions to HCFA\u2019s current review process and procedures could greatly improve the quality of plans\u2019 member literature. For example, full implementation of HCFA\u2019s new contract form for describing plans\u2019 benefit coverage, the PBP, could help ensure that approved member literature is accurate and fully discloses important plan information. Similarly, standard terminology and formats for key member literature would facilitate full disclosure and provide beneficiaries with comparable plan information. Moreover, new standards for the distribution of key member literature would enable beneficiaries to have the information they need when they need it. The required use of standard forms for routine administrative functions, such as member enrollment, could reduce HCFA\u2019s workload and allow staff to spend more time reviewing important member literature. Finally, efforts to standardize review procedures would help ensure consistent application of the agency\u2019s marketing material review policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration", "paragraphs": ["In October 1996, we recommended that the Secretary of Health and Human Services direct the HCFA Administrator to (1) require standard formats and terminology for important aspects of MCOs\u2019 marketing materials, including benefits descriptions, and (2) require that all literature distributed by organizations follow these standards. Although HCFA has taken initial steps toward this end, significant work remains. Therefore, we are both renewing our previous recommendations and recommending that the HCFA Administrator take the following additional actions to help Medicare beneficiaries make informed health care decisions and reduce the administrative burden on agency staff and MCOs.", "Require MCOs to produce one standard, FEHBP-like document for each plan that completely describes plan benefit coverage and limitations, and require MCOs to distribute this document during sales presentations and upon request.", "Fully implement HCFA\u2019s new contract form for describing plans\u2019 benefit coverage, the PBP, for the 2001 contract submissions to facilitate the collection of comparable benefit information and help ensure full disclosure of plans\u2019 benefits.", "Develop standard forms for appeals and enrollment.", "Take steps to ensure consistent application of the agency\u2019s marketing material review policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["HCFA agreed with our findings that the agency\u2019s review process and procedures need to be strengthened in order to ensure that beneficiaries receive accurate and useful information. The agency also concurred with our recommendations to improve the oversight of Medicare+Choice organizations\u2019 marketing materials and to require the use of standardized formats and language in plans\u2019 member materials. HCFA has steps under way that may help correct some of the problems we found. For example, the agency is developing a standardized summary of benefits document and intends to require Medicare+Choice organizations to use the document beginning in November 1999.", "While HCFA\u2019s efforts may standardize important aspects of plans\u2019 materials, such as information about appeal rights, these efforts stop short of requiring Medicare+Choice organizations to provide a single standard and comprehensive document that describes plan benefits and beneficiaries\u2019 rights and responsibilities as plan members. HCFA believes that Medicare+Choice organizations should retain the flexibility to develop materials that differentiate their services from those provided by other Medicare+Choice organizations. We agree that MCOs should be able to differentiate their plans. However, requiring MCOs to provide an FEHBP-like brochure, in addition to other plan materials, would preserve the MCOs\u2019 flexibility and provide Medicare beneficiaries with more complete and comparable information than they may currently receive. In fact, these standard brochures may encourage plans to compete on real differences in plan features.

We also interviewed HCFA officials at headquarters and at all regional offices and spoke with representatives of industry and beneficiary groups. We visited four regional offices (Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco) that cover high managed care penetration areas. In addition, we analyzed 1998 member literature and Medicare contracts for 16 of the 346 MCO contracts effective in 1998 (4 from each region we visited). Our sample included MCOs that varied in enrollment levels, structure, location, and years of Medicare experience. Because each MCO can offer more than one plan\u2014for example, a standard option and a high option\u2014we reviewed key materials for a total of 26 plans. We considered key member literature to include benefit summary brochures, member policy booklets, member handbooks, and plan letters related to benefit changes. The plans we reviewed used various combinations of these key documents to disclose the details of their benefit packages, including benefit restrictions and members\u2019 rights. Finally, we compared the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and Medicare\u2019s standards for plans\u2019 member literature.", "Our analysis focused on three benefits that vary in complexity: ambulance transportation, annual screening mammography, and outpatient prescription drugs. We selected ambulance transportation and screening mammography because these benefits must be provided by all Medicare plans and are relatively simple to describe and understand.
