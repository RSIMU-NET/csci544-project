The agency has taken steps towards developing a standard methodology, but it has not established time frames for finalizing these efforts. GAO's work on assessing data reliability indicates that data should be consistent. Because HUD does not require grantees to use selected data sources in a consistent manner, the reported information on unmet housing needs of persons with HIV are not comparable across jurisdictions and are not useful and reliable. In addition, the statutory HOPWA funding formula is based on cumulative AIDS cases since 1981, including persons who have died, rather than on current numbers of persons living with HIV (including those with AIDS). This approach has led to areas with similar numbers of living HIV cases receiving different amounts of funding. Because HOPWA funds are awarded based on cumulative AIDS cases, these funds are not being targeted as effectively or equitably as they could be.", "Agency data for HOPWA and the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Ryan White program indicate most recipients of assistance obtained stable, permanent housing, but Ryan White housing data may have limitations. HRSA, within the Department of Health and Human Services, does not require Ryan White grantees to maintain current data on clients' housing status. However, it uses the data that grantees report to calculate the proportion of clients that have stable housing. HRSA is charged with tracking Ryan White clients' housing status as a part of the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Federal internal control standards state that events should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and value to management in controlling operations and making decisions. Because HRSA does not require grantees to maintain current data on clients' housing status, HRSA's data may be of limited usefulness in tracking the National HIV/AIDS Strategy goal of improving clients' housing status.", "HUD and HRSA perform oversight activities but may be missing opportunities to use data to improve performance. HUD staff conduct risk-based monitoring of HOPWA grantees, and HRSA staff have improved monitoring of Ryan White grantees. HUD and HRSA both collect performance data from their grantees and take steps to ensure that the data are complete and submitted in a timely manner. HUD uses performance data to create summaries of program performance but does not have a specific process for comparing individual grantees' year-to-year data for unmet housing need. Federal internal control standards note the importance of such comparisons. By not analyzing these trends, HUD may not be identifying and addressing reporting problems. In addition, HRSA staff responsible for monitoring Ryan White grantees do not review grantee data on housing assistance provided. Federal internal control standards state that activities need to be established to monitor performance measures.

Additionally, CDC  officials now consider HIV case counts to be more accurate and reliable  than counts of AIDS cases alone because persons with HIV may live  many years before progressing to AIDS and may move between stages  as their health changes.", "HUD officials and the four HOPWA grantees we met with stated that the  HOPWA funding formula was out of date. In its last three congressional  budget justifications, HUD has proposed updating the formula. According  to HUD\u2019s 2015 budget justification, the HOPWA formula should be  updated to better reflect the nature of the HIV epidemic that has evolved  over the years through advances in HIV care and the increasingly  disproportionate impact on impoverished persons with HIV. HUD has  proposed basing the funding formula on living HIV rather than cumulative  AIDS cases and on consideration of local housing costs and poverty  rates. HUD recognized that some communities could lose funds as a  result of a redistribution of grant funds. To mitigate any potential negative  impacts of large funding reductions on some communities, HUD has also  proposed incrementally reducing funding over time.", "HUD\u2019s projections based on its proposed formula change\u2014using living  HIV cases instead of cumulative AIDS cases and data on housing costs  and poverty\u2014show a redistribution of funds that results in funding  increases for some communities and decreases for others. For example,  based on HUD\u2019s 2015 projections of HOPWA award amounts, the New  York City MSA\u2019s award would decrease by about $5 million from HUD\u2019s  2014 estimated award amount. In contrast, smaller MSAs, such as  Charlotte North, Carolina, and Cleveland, Ohio would receive increases  of more than $200,000 from HUD\u2019s 2014 estimated award amounts.  Although our analysis of CDC data suggests that the proportions of living  HIV cases among the cities that received HOPWA funds in 2012 are  similar to the proportions of cumulative AIDS cases, these changes could  result in meaningful differences in the amounts of funding that some  grantees receive.", "The Office of Management and Budget has also noted that the current  formula for distributing HOPWA funds does not reflect the current nature  of the disease. As discussed in GAO\u2019s prior work, a cumulative count of  AIDS cases that includes deceased persons does not necessarily reflect  the number of living HIV cases in a particular year. In contrast, data on  the number of persons living with HIV exclude the deceased and include  persons in all stages of HIV infection. In addition, regional changes in the  number of HIV cases may not be fully accounted for in the current  HOPWA formula due to the continued inclusion of deceased persons.  Reauthorizations of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program in 2000, 2006 and  2009 required the use of living cases of both HIV and AIDS in the  distribution of formula grants for Ryan White Parts A and B.

These stakeholders  noted that HOPWA clients or other persons with HIV often had substance  abuse issues and a mental illness and that supportive services that  helped address these issues were critical to helping some clients become  stable. Three HOPWA grantees noted that another strength of the  program was the flexibility it offered to grantees, allowing them to fund the  type of housing assistance that was most needed in their communities.  Grantees that we visited funded a wide range of housing types, including  a facility for persons with HIV who had mental, physical, or drug abuse  issues; a facility for single adults who had progressed to AIDS and had a  history of homelessness; and a hospice for HIV-positive persons. Finally,  officials from four organizations that received both HOPWA and Ryan  White Part A funding explained that HOPWA worked well with the Ryan  White HIV/AIDS program. These officials explained that they took steps to  transition Ryan White Part A clients who received temporary housing  assistance into the HOPWA program, which offered permanent housing  assistance.

Limiting rental  assistance to Fair Market Rents is challenging, particularly in high-cost  cities like New York City and San Francisco, where officials noted that the  average price of an apartment was double the amount of the Fair Market  Rent. Also, two of the four HOPWA grantees that we interviewed and  HUD administrators of the HOPWA program stated that the administrative  fee of 3 percent that grantees could retain from their HOPWA grant was  low. HUD officials stated that other HUD programs had higher fees,  including Community Development Block Grants (20 percent) and the  Home Investment Partnerships Program (10 percent). Finally, staff from  three HOPWA grantees, five organizations that receive HOPWA or Ryan  White Part A funding, and HUD officials with responsibility for  administering the HOPWA program told us that the funding formula  needed to be updated so that it was based on the number of persons  living with HIV.

While HUD advises grantees to use one or more of seven  specific data sources, HUD does not require grantees to use these  sources in a consistent and therefore comparable manner, as suggested  by federal internal control standards and our work on data reliability. HUD  has taken steps toward developing a standard methodology but has not  established time frames for finalizing these efforts. As a result, the  usefulness of HUD\u2019s overall estimate is not clear. Furthermore, Congress  may not have a complete understanding of the continuing need for  programs that provide housing assistance to persons with HIV.", "Second, the funding provided under HOPWA has filled important gaps in  the availability of affordable housing in communities throughout the  country. However, the current statutory formula for HOPWA has not kept  pace with the changing nature of the disease. Congress recognized this  shift in the 2000, 2006, and 2009 reauthorizations of the Ryan White  HIV/AIDS program that required HIV case counts to be used in the  distribution of Ryan White HIV/AIDS program funds. While we recognize  that it may not be appropriate to use precisely the same formula for both  HOPWA and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, the rationale for  allocating funds on the basis of those currently living with HIV applies to  both grant programs. Because HOPWA funds are awarded based on  cumulative AIDS cases, these funds are not being targeted as effectively  or equitably as they could be.", "Third, HRSA relies on housing data reported by Ryan White HIV/AIDS  program grantees to report on its progress in addressing one of the goals  of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy but does not require grantees to  ensure that these data are current. Internal control standards for the  federal government state that events should be promptly recorded to  maintain their relevance and value to management in controlling  operations and making decisions. Without taking steps to ensure that  grantee-reported housing status data are current, HRSA may not have  reliable information to use in reporting on the extent to which Ryan White  HIV/AIDS program clients are reaching the National HIV/AIDS Strategy  goals for attainment of permanent housing.", "We also found that HUD had not optimized its use of the performance  information it required HOPWA grantees to collect. While HUD has  processes in place to review the completeness and internal consistency  of each grantee\u2019s annual data submission, HUD has not established  specific procedures to compare the unmet housing need data individual  grantees submit from year to year. The extent to which persons with HIV  have an unmet housing need speaks to the continuing need for the  HOPWA program.

To describe HUD\u2019s proposed changes to the  HOPWA funding formula, we reviewed HUD\u2019s congressional budget  justifications for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015.", "GAO, Housing: HUD\u2019s Program for Persons with AIDS, GAO/RCED-97-62 (Mar. 24,  1997) and HIV/AIDS: Changes Needed to Improve the Distribution of Ryan White CARE  Act and Housing Funds, GAO-06-332 (Feb. 28, 2006). received both HOPWA and Ryan White Part A grants. We used HRSA\u2019s  2011 Ryan White HIV/AIDS program expenditure data to identify grantees  that had spent Ryan White Part A funds on housing assistance. We  compared the locations of the Ryan White Part A grantees that had  funded housing assistance to locations of the formula HOPWA grantees  and selected four cities that had both. We based our selection on grant  size (i.e., grant amounts at either the higher end or middle of the range in  fiscal year 2011), the presence of Ryan White Part A grantees that had  expended Ryan White Part A funds on housing assistance, and  geographic diversity. Based on this analysis, we selected New York City,  New York; New Orleans, Louisiana; San Francisco, California; and St.  Louis, Missouri. In each city, we interviewed officials from the formula  HOPWA grantees and Ryan White Part A grantees; one or more HOPWA  project sponsors; one or more Ryan White Part A subgrantees; the local  HUD field office; the local Continuum of Care grantee; and at least one  HIV advocacy organization. We selected HOPWA project sponsors and  Ryan White Part A grantees based on discussions with grantee staff and  selected advocacy organizations based on information from a national  HIV advocacy organization about active local HIV advocacy  organizations. We also toured housing that was funded through formula  HOPWA funds or Ryan White Part A in each city, including emergency  housing, a permanent housing facility, and a hospice, to see how the  funds had been used. To obtain views on the impact of the HOPWA and  Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programs in rural areas, we also interviewed the  State AIDS Directors for California, Louisiana, Missouri, and New York.", "To determine the results that have been achieved through federal  programs that provide housing assistance to persons with HIV, we  obtained and analyzed HOPWA data on how funds were used and client  characteristics for program years 2009 through 2012. To assess the  reliability of the HOPWA data, we interviewed HUD officials and  contractors that had responsibility for processing information about their  data reliability procedures. We also conducted electronic testing for  missing data, outliers, or obvious errors. We found that most data were  reliable for the purposes of describing how funds were used and  identifying the characteristics of the persons who benefitted from housing  assistance. As previously noted, we found that HUD\u2019s data on unmet  housing need were not sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "For the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, we obtained and reviewed Ryan  White HIV/AIDS Program Services Report (RSR) data for Part A, and for  fiscal years 2010 through 2012. Agency officials told us that 2009 data  were only available in aggregate form and not by Part A grantee. To  assess the reliability of HRSA\u2019s Ryan White Part A data related to  housing assistance, we reviewed HRSA guidance and policies,  interviewed HRSA officials with responsibility for processing the data,  interviewed four HRSA Program Officers, and conducted electronic  testing. We also compared HRSA\u2019s methodology for calculating the  percentage of Ryan White HIV/AIDS program clients who had stable  housing to internal control standards for the federal government. Because  HRSA does not require grantees to regularly update each client\u2019s housing  status, we determined that housing status data were not sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Also, we obtained and analyzed expenditure  data for both programs. For HOPWA and Ryan White Part A, the most  recent years of expenditure data were 2012 and 2011, respectively. For  HOPWA, we analyzed program data on activities funded (e.g., housing  assistance, housing development, supportive services); types of housing  assistance funded (e.g., tenant-based rental assistance, permanent  facilities); and demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity, age,  income). For the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, we analyzed RSR data  on the number and proportion of clients who received housing assistance  through Part A. For those clients who did receive housing assistance, we  analyzed demographic characteristics (sex, race, ethnicity, age, earnings  relative to the federal poverty level).", "To describe the strengths of the HOPWA and Ryan White Part A  programs, as well as any weaknesses associated with these programs,  we reviewed program requirements; identified studies through a search of  various databases using keywords such as \u201cHOPWA\u201d and \u201cRyan White\u201d;  and interviewed a purposive sample of program grantees, HOPWA  project sponsors, and Ryan White Part A subgrantees. We also  interviewed HIV advocates, HUD and HRSA officials with responsibilities  related to the HOPWA and Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs, and an  academic researcher on HIV and housing who had co-authored various  articles on housing for persons with HIV in New York City. Upon  completion of our initial search, we identified eight studies that discussed  the effects of housing assistance programs on persons with HIV. We  reviewed the studies\u2019 methodology, limitations, and conclusions for the  purposes of excluding studies that did not ensure a minimal level of  methodological rigor and excluded two studies. Of the six remaining  studies, two were randomized control trial studies, one was a cross- sectional study, and one used a quasi-experimental design. Two had  weaker research designs but were retained since they were sufficiently  rigorous and, given the limited number of empirical studies on this  subject, provided useful information on the importance of access to  housing for medical outcomes for people living with HIV.", "To assess the extent to which the HOPWA and Ryan White Part A  programs coordinated with each other at the federal level, we identified  program requirements in the governing legislation for the HOPWA and  Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs. We also obtained and reviewed  documentation of HUD\u2019s and HRSA\u2019s efforts to coordinate with each  other, interviewed HUD and HRSA officials about these efforts, and  compared the efforts to GAO\u2019s criteria related to coordination and  program overlap.", "GAO, Housing Assistance: Opportunities Exist to Increase Collaboration and Consider  Consolidation, GAO-12-554 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 16, 2012) and Housing Assistance:  An Inventory of Fiscal Year 2010 Programs, Tax Expenditures, and Other Activities,  GAO-12-555SP (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 16, 2012), an E-supplement to GAO-12-554. the list of housing programs. For the five programs, we compared their  primary goals, client eligibility requirements, requirements related to  supportive services, and the specific types of housing assistance that  could be provided. We also discussed whether and how HOPWA and  Ryan White Part A grantees coordinated with these programs during our  site visits to the purposive sample of cities. Additionally, we reviewed the  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program descriptions, program  information from each program\u2019s website, and prior GAO reports to  determine each program\u2019s size, administering agency, and assistance  type. Finally, we interviewed HIV advocacy groups, HOPWA and Ryan  White Part A grantees, HUD and HRSA officials, and an academic  researcher about housing assistance and services for persons with HIV.", "To assess HUD and HRSA\u2019s monitoring and oversight efforts, we  identified and reviewed their monitoring policies, procedures, and  guidance. We also interviewed HUD headquarters and field office staff  with responsibilities related to HOPWA grantee monitoring, as well as  HRSA staff who had primary responsibility for monitoring Ryan White Part  A grantees. We compared HUD\u2019s risk assessment policies for program  years 2008 through 2013 to documentation on the implementation of  these procedures for the four HOPWA grantees we visited, including  documentation of risk assessments and site visits conducted. For the  Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, we reviewed the status of five previously  issued GAO recommendations related to program monitoring and  oversight and summarized HRSA\u2019s efforts to address these  recommendations. We also analyzed updated HRSA data on Part A site  visits conducted in 2012 and 2013. Additionally, we interviewed both HUD  and HRSA officials on how they use performance data to monitor  HOPWA and Ryan White Part A grantees. For HOPWA, we reviewed  documentation of HUD\u2019s use of performance data for program years 2009  through 2013. For the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, we reviewed  published reports on the agency\u2019s use of housing-related performance  data. We compared HUD and HRSA\u2019s monitoring efforts to federal  internal control standards as well as practices that leading organizations  used related to managing for results.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2014 to April 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
