Noted challenges to operational effectiveness raise questions about whether the MV-22 is best suited to accomplish the full repertoire of missions of the helicopters it is intended to replace. Additionally, suitability challenges, such as unreliable component parts and supply chain weaknesses, led to low aircraft availability rates. MV-22 operational tests and training exercises identified challenges with the system's ability to operate in other environments. Maneuvering limits and challenges in detecting threats may affect air crew ability to execute correct evasive actions. The aircraft's large size and inventory of repair parts created obstacles to shipboard operations. Identified challenges could limit the ability to conduct worldwide operations in some environments and at high altitudes similar to what might be expected in Afghanistan. Efforts are underway to address these deficiencies, but some are inherent in the V-22's design. V-22 costs have risen sharply above initial projections--1986 estimates (stated in fiscal year 2009 dollars) that the program would build nearly 1000 aircraft in 10 years at $37.7 million each have shifted to fewer than 500 aircraft at $93.4 million each--a procurement unit cost increase of 148 percent. Research, development, testing, and evaluation costs increased over 200 percent. To complete the procurement, the program plans to request approximately $25 billion (in then-year dollars) for aircraft procurement. As for operations and support costs (O&S), the Marine Corps' V-22's cost per flight hour today is over $11,000--more than double the targeted estimate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the V-22 Osprey began development in the mid-1980s, it has  experienced several fatal crashes, demonstrated a variety of deficiencies,  and faced the virtual cancellation of the program\u2014much of which it has  been able to overcome.

We interviewed a wide range of  Department of Defense (DOD), Marine Corps, V-22 program, and  contractor officials; MV-22 operators, maintainers, logisticians, combat  troops and their commanders; and others both in the United States and in  Iraq. We also observed MV-22 shipboard operations during training off the  coast of North Carolina and operation of the 12 MV-22s deployed in Iraq.

Currently, the MV-22 is going to replace only the CH-46E. The Air Force  variant (CV-22) will augment existing U.S. Special Operations Command  (USSOCOM) aircraft.", "The Osprey program was started in December 1981 to satisfy mission  needs for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Originally spearheaded by the  Army, the program was transferred to the Navy in 1982 when the Army  withdrew from the program citing affordability issues. The program was  approved for full-scale development in 1986, and the first aircraft was  flown in 1989. A month after the first flight, the Secretary of Defense  stopped requesting funds for the program due to affordability concerns. In  December 1989, DOD directed the Navy to terminate all V-22 contracts  because, according to DOD, the V-22 was not affordable when compared  to helicopter alternatives, and production ceased. Congress disagreed with  this decision, however, and continued to fund the project. Following a  crash in 1991 and a fatal crash in 1992 that resulted in seven deaths, in  October of 1992 the Navy ordered development to continue and awarded a  contract to a Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters joint venture  (Bell-Boeing) to begin producing production-representative aircraft.", "In 1994, the Navy chartered a medium lift replacement COEA, which  reaffirmed the decision to proceed with the V-22. It also provided an  analytical basis for KPPs to be proposed for the system. This analysis  defined the primary mission of a medium-lift replacement aircraft to be the  transport of combat troops during sea-based assault operations and during  combat operations ashore. Secondary missions included transporting  supplies and equipment during assault and other combat operations as  well as supporting Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) special operation  forces, casualty and noncombatant evacuation operations, tactical  recovery of aircraft and personnel operations, combat search and rescue  operations, and mobile forward area refueling and re-arming operations.  These original mission descriptions and aircraft employment were  reaffirmed by the Marine Corps in 2003 and again in 2007. The existing  medium-lift aircraft fleet needed to be replaced due to inventory shortfalls  and reduced aircraft reliability, availability, and maintainability\u2014needs  accentuated by the increasing age and limited capabilities of its current  fleet of helicopters.", "The analysis concluded that the V-22 should be the Marine Corps\u2019 choice.  The analysis considered a number of helicopter candidates\u2014including the  CH-46E and CH-53D\u2014and the V-22 tiltrotor\u2014judging each candidate  based on their performance characteristics and expected contribution to  tactics and operations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted which   measured candidate aircraft against specific performance parameters\u2014 including KPPs. The analysis used models to assess research and  development, production or procurement, and operations and support  cost and concluded that for non-assault missions, such as medical  evacuation missions, the V-22 was the most effective option because of its  greater speed, increased range, and ability to deploy in one-third the time  of the alternative candidates. For assault missions, the analysis concluded  the V-22 would build combat power in the form of troops and equipment  most quickly, was more survivable, would maximize the arrival of forces  and minimize casualties, and would halve helicopter losses. In terms of  affordability, the analysis concluded that, holding V-22 and helicopter  force sizes equal, the V-22 would be the most effective but at a higher cost.  The analysis further noted that while the major factor in favor of the V-22  was its speed, at short distances greater speed offers little advantage.", "Subsequently, Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) began with five aircraft  in 1997, increasing to seven each year in 1998 and 1999. In 2000, the  program undertook operational evaluation testing, the results of whi the Navy\u2019s operational testers to conclude that the MV-22 was  operationally suitable for land-based operations and was opera effective. Later evaluations resulted in testers concluding that the MV-22 would be operationally suitable on ships as well. Based on the same tests DOD\u2019s independent operational testers concluded that the MV-22 was  operationally effective but not operationally suitable, due in part to  reliability concerns. Despite the mixed test conclusions, a Program  Decision Meeting was scheduled for December 2000 to determine wh the V-22 should progress beyond LRIP production and into full-rate  production. Following two fatal crashes that occurred in 2000 and re in 23 deaths, the last one occurring just before the full-rate production  decision, the V-22 was grounded and, rather than proceeding to full-rate production, the program was directed to continue research and  development at a minimum sustaining production rate of 11 aircr year.  aft per  Before the V-22 resumed flight tests, modifications were made to  requirements and design changes were made to the aircraft to correct  safety concerns and problems. The aircraft nacelles were redesigned to  preclude line chafing; a robust software qualification facility was built; and  Vortex Ring State, a dangerous aerodynamic phenomenon that all rotor  wing aircraft are subject to and was reported to have contributed to one of  the fatal V-22 crashes in 2000, was further investigated. Requirements for  landings in helicopter mode in which engine power had failed  (\u201cautorotation\u201d) and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons protection  among others were eliminated, and some KPPs were modified, prior to  conducting a second round of operational testing with modified aircraft in  June 2005. Testers then recommended that the aircraft be declared  operationally effective and suitable for military use. The Defense  Acquisition Board approved it for military use as well as full-rate  production in September 2005. DOD is procuring the V-22 in blocks. Block  A is a training configuration, while later blocks are being procured and  fielded as the operational configurations.

Three Marine  squadrons used the same 12 MV-22s for three consecutive deployments.  In March 2008, the Navy awarded Bell-Boeing a 5-year, $10.4 billion  production contract for 141 MV-22s and 26 CV-22s. This multiyear contract  was awarded to achieve anticipated procurement cost savings.

Those missions were mostly general support missions\u2014moving people  and cargo\u2014in the low-threat operational environment that existed in Iraq  during their deployments. The aircraft\u2019s favorable reviews were based  largely on its increased speed and range compared with legacy helicopters.  According to MV-22 users and troop commanders, its speed and range \u201ccut  the battlefield in half,\u201d expanding battlefield coverage with decreased  asset utilization and enabling it to do two to three times as much as legacy  helicopters could in the same flight time. In addition, the MV-22\u2019s ability to  fly at higher altitudes in airplane mode enabled it to avoid the threat of  small arms fire during its Iraq deployment. Figure 3 compares the flight  radius of the MV-22 to that of legacy CH-46s.", "Commanders and operators have noted that the speed and range of the  Osprey offered some significant advantages over the legacy platforms it  replaced during missions performed in Iraq, including missions that would  have been impossible without it. For example, it enabled more rapid  delivery of medical care; missions that had previously required an  overnight stay to be completed in a single day; and more rapid travel by  U.S. military and Iraqi officials to meetings with Iraqi leaders, thus  allowing greater time for those meetings.", "While in Iraq, the MV-22 also conducted a few AeroScout raid and external  lift missions. These types of missions were infrequent, but those that were  carried out were successfully completed. Such missions, however, were  also effectively carried out by existing helicopters. AeroScout missions are  made by a combination of medium-lift aircraft and attack helicopters with  a refueling C-130 escort that, according to Marine Corps officers, find  suspicious targets and insert Marines as needed to neutralize threats. In  participating in these missions, the MV-22 was limited by operating with  slower legacy helicopters\u2014thus negating its speed and range advantages.  Similarly, external lift missions do not leverage the advantages of the V-22.  In fact, most Marine equipment requiring external transport is cleared only  for transit at speeds under 150 knots calibrated airspeed (kcas), not the  higher speeds at which the MV-22 can travel with internal cargo or  passengers. According to Iraq-based MV-22 squadron leadership, the CH- 53, which is capable of lifting heavier external loads, was more readily  available than the MV-22 to carry out those missions and, as such, was  generally called on for those missions, allowing the MV-22 to be used more  extensively for missions that exploit its own comparative strengths.", "The introduction of the MV-22 into Iraq in combination with existing  helicopters has led to some reconsideration of the appropriate role of  each. Battlefield commanders and aircraft operators in Iraq identified a  need to better understand the role the Osprey should play in fulfilling  warfighter needs. They indicated, for example, that the MV-22 may not be  best suited for the full range of missions requiring medium lift, because the  aircraft\u2019s speed cannot be exploited over shorter distances or in  transporting external cargo. These concerns were also highlighted in a  recent preliminary analysis of the MV-22 by the Center for Naval Analysis,  which found that the MV-22 may not be the optimal platform for those  missions.", "The MV-22\u2019s Iraq experience also demonstrated some limitations in  situational awareness that challenge operational effectiveness. For  example, some MV-22 crew chiefs and troop commanders in Iraq told us  that they consider a lack of visibility of activity on the ground from the V- 22\u2019s troop cabin to be a significant disadvantage\u2014a fact previously noted  in operational testing. They noted that the V-22 has only two small  windows. In contrast, combat Marines in Iraq stated that the larger troop  compartment windows of the CH-53 and CH-46 offer improved ability to  view the ground, which can enhance operations. In addition, CH-53s and  CH-46s are flown at low altitude in raid operations. According to troop  commanders this low altitude approach into the landing zones combined  with the larger windows in CH-53s and CH-46s improves their (the troop  commanders) situational awareness from the troop compartments,  compared with the situational awareness afforded troop commanders in  the MV-22s with its smaller windows and use of high altitude fast descent  approach into the landing zone. The V-22 program is in the process of  incorporating electronic situational awareness devices in the troop cabin  to off-set the restricted visibility. This upgrade may not fully address the  situational awareness challenges for the crew chief, who provides visual  cues to the pilots to assist when landing. Crew chiefs in Iraq agree that the  lack of visibility from the troop cabin is the most serious weakness of the  MV-22."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iraq Deployment Demonstrated Continuing Suitability Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Availability challenges continue to affect the MV-22. In Iraq, the V-22\u2019s  mission capability (MC) and full mission capability (FMC) rates fell  significantly below required levels and significantly below rates achieved  by legacy helicopters.

In Iraq, the three MV-22 squadrons averaged mission capability  rates of about 68, 57, and 61 percent respectively. This experience is not  unique to the Iraq deployment, as low MC rates were experienced for all  MV-22 squadrons, in and out of Iraq.

According to MV-22 officers and maintainers, the low FMC rate realized  was due in part to unreliability of V-22 Ice Protection System (IPS)  components. Although the faulty IPS had no effect on the MV-22\u2019s ability  to achieve missions assigned in Iraq, in other areas, where icing conditions  are more likely to be experienced\u2014such as Afghanistan\u2014IPS unreliability  may threaten mission accomplishment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Repair Parts Issues and Maintenance Challenges Affected the Availability of MV-22s in Iraq", "paragraphs": ["Although MV-22 maintenance squadrons stocked three times as many  parts in Iraq as the number of deployed MV-22 aircraft called for, they  faced reliability and maintainability challenges.

A  lack of specific repair parts was a problem faced throughout the Iraq  deployments despite deploying with an inventory of spare parts to support  36 aircraft, rather than the 12 MV-22 aircraft actually deployed. Despite the  preponderance of parts brought to support the MV-22s in Iraq, only about  13 percent of those parts were actually used in the first deployment. In  addition, some aircraft components wore out much more quickly in Iraq  than expected, which led to shortages. Thirteen MV-22 components  accounted for over half the spare parts that were not available on base in  Iraq when requested. Those components lasted, on average, less than 30  percent of their expected life, with six lasting less than 10 percent of their  expected life. The shortages caused MV-22 maintainers to cannibalize  parts from other MV-22s to keep aircraft flying, and significantly increased  maintenance hours. Parts were cannibalized not only from MV-22s in Iraq  but also from MV-22s in the United States and from the V-22 production  line. The shortages also contributed to the low mission capability rates, as  an aircraft in need of maintenance or spare parts may not be considered  mission capable.

Restricted maneuverability limits its ability to perform defensive  maneuvers. Flight limits have been imposed while the aircraft is in  helicopter mode to avoid a loss of controlled flight.", "Limits have been imposed to avoid Vortex Ring State (VRS), a condition  that can cause a loss of lift and control of the aircraft when it is in  helicopter mode. VRS can occur in any rotorcraft, and in the V-22 is now  considered well defined and avoidable when the aircraft\u2019s forward speed  and descent rate stay within prescribed ranges. However, specifically in  the V-22, VRS can result in loss of lift on one proprotor and not the other,  causing the aircraft to invert. Testers previously recommended that follow- on tests should involve multiple aircraft, at heavy weights, in close  proximity as might be anticipated in the conduct of a combat assault  mission. The test could increase confidence that appropriate, safe tactics  exist to enable the MV-22s to deliver assault forces to a small area in a  short time while avoiding undue exposure to enemy threats.", "Although an integrated defensive weapon system\u2014needed to suppress  threats while approaching a landing zone, disembarking troops within the  landing zone, or while leaving the landing zone\u2014is a requirement, the MV- 22 does not have such a system. The MV-22 currently has only a rear ramp- mounted defensive weapon system that is not integrated into the aircraft  and only covers its rear quadrants. Based on Iraq experiences, this  defensive weapon was viewed as lacking flexibility due to its ability to  only point in one direction when employed in the \u201cground fire\u201d position  and because it was not of sufficient caliber to be effective in all scenarios.  Some air crews commented that the capabilities of the MV-22 offset  previous notions about the requirement for defensive fire power. However,  commanders stated that while the current defensive weapon system was  sufficient for the Iraq deployment, many other scenarios are easily  envisioned where an improved defensive weapon system would be much  preferred. A belly-mounted Interim Defensive Weapon System (IDWS)  capable of covering all quadrants is being tested. However, in tests, the  system jammed frequently.

While officials and Marine combat  units who have flown in the MV-22 say it can carry 24 troops, a Marine  Corps after-action report indicates that the MV-22 can not carry 24 troops  if they are equipped as intended. The MV-22 operational requirements  document based the 24 troop number for the MV-22 variant on an  assumption of an average weight for a fully equipped combat troop of 240  pounds; however, improvements in body armor and equipment have raised  the weight projection for each Marine with combat equipment to 400  pounds. As a result, the aircraft\u2019s planned capacity to transport fully  loaded combat troops is 20 rather than 24.", "Aircraft troop-carrying capacity may be further reduced in other  configurations and flight scenarios. As previously stated, the belly- mounted interim defensive weapon system will reduce the number of  combat troops that can be transported by two. When the platoon of  Marines transported is configured with heavy weapons, the number of  embarked troops may be reduced due to limited cabin volume.

Furthermore, MV-22 deck spot utilization also differs  from that of the CH-46: the aircraft is not cleared to take off and land using  the two deck spots adjacent to the tower of LHA- and LHD-class ships. As  a result, the MV-22 is only cleared to take off and land from four of the six  operational deck spots of the LHD- and LHA-class ships usable by CH-46s.  According to program officials, efforts are underway to try to approve  operational use of these deck positions for takeoff and landing on LHD  ships.", "The repair parts inventory that a squadron of MV-22s deploys with is  significantly greater in volume and weight than that of the legacy  helicopters it is replacing and will impinge on maintenance and other  operations in the ship\u2019s hangar space. The space needed for MV-22 repair  parts is so large that some parts may need to be pre-positioned ashore and  not housed shipboard. Hangar space is used to conduct maintenance on  aircraft sheltered from the elements or if the maintenance effort requires  the use of heavy lifting cranes located in the hangar deck ceiling. Training  exercises found that the larger MV-22 reduced the number of spots that  can be used in the hangar deck for maintenance from four to three, and  made movement of aircraft from the hangar deck to the flight deck  difficult if an MV-22\u2019s wings were spread or an aircraft was on jacks  undergoing repairs.", "The MV-22\u2019s downwash has been described as significantly greater than  that of the CH-46. During prior operational tests, concerns were raised  about the effect of downwash on operations below the aircraft, including  troop embarkation and debarkation, hooking up external loads, and  fastroping. Recent shipboard tests have identified safety issues related to  MV-22 downwash, including dislodging equipment such as life raft  securing bands, and potentially blowing down the sailor who stands on the  flight deck of the ship guiding the aircraft to a safe landing. To resolve  these problems, life raft containers have been replaced through ship  alterations with containers intended to withstand the downwash, and,  during one training exercise on an L-class ship, another person was  assigned to physically hold in place the sailor acting as the landing guide  when MV-22s were landing. Downwash of the MV-22 interacting with other  aircraft was also noted onboard ship. In one documented incident,  downwash from a landing MV-22 exerted such force on the helicopter next  to it that the helicopter\u2019s pilot had to take action to prevent his aircraft  from lifting off the ship. Downwash concerns, however, are not restricted  to shipboard operations. Recently completed tests on the CV-22 found that  the significant downwash also had various negative effects on the land- based missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Operating Globally in Extreme Environments", "paragraphs": ["At the start of its development, the V-22 was intended to operate in many  different environments.

During developmental testing, numerous problems were encountered with  the seals intended to maintain the cabin pressure, so the system was not  used in operational testing in 2000. In the absence of such a system, the  DOD Director, Operational Test and Evaluation found that operational  MV-22s would be forced to avoid or exit areas of suspected nuclear,  biological, or chemical contamination and require time to decontaminate  affected aircraft\u2014likely reducing their availability and sortie capability.

Current  V-22 performance charts do not support helicopter operations above  10,000 feet. Furthermore, according to recent MV-22 tests, the V-22\u2019s IPS is  not reliable. Flying through known or forecasted icing conditions is  currently prohibited. The status of the IPS is one of the main issues  preventing the MV-22 from being fully mission capable.

The inventory of repair parts needed to maintain the MV-22 is large.  Although the squadrons in Iraq were supported with a parts inventory  large enough for three times the number of aircraft deployed, certain  \u201chigh-demand, low-density items\u201d were used and their spare inventories  depleted\u2014driving the need for expensive and time-consuming  cannibalization of repair parts from other aircraft. A reliability and  maintainability program is in place to address underperforming  components. Efforts include a recently awarded joint performance-based  logistics contract to identify ways to improve aircraft reliability and reduce  the system\u2019s logistics footprint. However, program management does not  consider the current reliability and maintainability strategy to be coherent.

Some KPPs used to analyze the MLR alternative  candidates were consolidated or modified as the V-22 progressed through  development and operational testing, as shown in table 4.", "While operational tests reports state that the MV-22 is meeting all its KPPs,  according to program officials, modifications were made to balance  aircraft operational requirements against technical risks and program  costs. For example, the amphibious external lift KPP was modified. In its  2000 operational test report, the office of the Director, Operational Test  and Evaluation (DOT&E) found the MV-22 operationally effective but  noted that weight increase of the aircraft could affect its performance  against two KPPs: amphibious external lift and land assault external lift.  Projections by DOT&E indicated that a 1,000-pound increase in aircraft  weight would reduce performance in these metrics below threshold  values. These two external lift KPPs of concern to DOT&E were combined  into the land assault external lift KPP that had previously existed. This is  one example of the 2001 modifications that consolidated 14 KPPs into 7  for the MV-22 variant.", "In addition, during the 2000 operational test, DOT&E found the aircraft not  operationally suitable in part due to reliability concerns. Mission capability  (MC), one of the metrics used to measure suitability, was also modified in  2004 such that the MC rate does not have to be met until the aircraft  reaches system maturity (60,000 flight hours). According to Marine Corps  Headquarters officials, the aircraft currently has over 50,000 hours and  may reach the 60,000 hour threshold within a year.", "Concerns about V-22 weight increase and how it may affect aircraft  performance have continued. In 2005, a DOT&E report on the second  operational test of the MV-22 predicted a drop in performance for Block B  aircraft due to weight increase. However, according to Navy operational  testers who tested the MV-22 Block B in 2007, performance did not drop.  DOT&E did not report on the 2007 Block B test.

Its speed and range were enhancements. However,  operational tests and training exercises suggest that challenges may limit  its ability to accomplish the full repertoire of missions of the legacy  helicopters it is replacing. If so, those tasks will need to be fulfilled by  some other alternative. Viewed more broadly, the MV-22 has yet to fully  demonstrate that it can achieve the original required level of versatility. To  be useful to the warfighter in a variety of climates and places, its ability to  address and resolve a range of operational challenges must be evaluated.", "Furthermore, suitability challenges that lower aircraft availability and  affect the operations and support funding that may be required to maintain  the fleet needs to be addressed. Based on the Iraq experience, the cost per  flight hour is more than double the target estimate. In addition, savings in  unit procurement cost expected as a result of the multiyear procurement  contract may be offset by modifications and upgrades required on already- produced aircraft. DOD is therefore faced with the prospect of directing  more money to a program, the military utility of which in some areas  remains unproven.", "The V-22 program has already received or requested over $29 billion in  development and procurement funds.

In addition, the program continues to face a  future of high operations and support cost funding needs, currently  estimated at $75.4 billion for the life cycle of the program. This estimate  may not accurately reflect the high cost per flight hour experienced by the  MV-22 fleet so far. In light of the significant funding needs of a program  that has not yet achieved all expected capabilities, now is a good time to  consider the return on this investment as well as other less costly  alternatives that can fill the current requirement.", "To resolve this dilemma, the uses, cost, and performance of the V-22 need  to be clarified and alternatives should be considered once again. To what  degree is the V-22 a suitable and exclusive candidate for the operational  needs of the Marine Corps and other services? How much will it cost?  How much can DOD afford to spend? To what degree can a strategy be  crafted for ensuring control over these future costs? If the V-22 is not or is  only partially suitable, to what degree can another existing aircraft or  some mixture of existing aircraft (even including V-22s) or a new aircraft  perform all or some of its roles more cost effectively?
