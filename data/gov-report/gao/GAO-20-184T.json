Over the course of the program, qualified small, disadvantaged businesses, including ANC-owned firms, can receive federal contract awards that have been set aside solely for such businesses, and business development support from SBA, such as mentoring, financial assistance, and other management and technical assistance. In its three reports, among other things, GAO found that SBA had (1) incomplete information and documentation on ANC-owned firms and their compliance with regulatory requirements; (2) limitations in its ability to track and share key program data needed to enforce its own program; (3) insufficient staffing in its Alaska District Office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks; and (4) inadequate or vague program guidance for clearly communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations.", "GAO made 21 recommendations to SBA that address weaknesses in SBA's oversight and monitoring of ANC-owned firms participating in the 8(a) program. SBA has taken steps to implement many of those recommendations, including enhancing training for SBA staff that emphasized program rules, and developing and implementing a regulation that helps SBA better enforce rules against ANC-owned firms obtaining contracts for which they were not necessarily eligible.", "However, SBA has not yet implemented recommendations that, if implemented as intended, could significantly improve its oversight of the 8(a) program. For example, SBA has not yet addressed limitations raised in GAO's 2006 and 2016 reports regarding SBA's tracking of revenue information for ANC-owned firms, which limits SBA's oversight of 8(a) rules prohibiting multiple subsidiaries under one ANC from generating revenue in the same primary line of business\u2014which 8(a) program regulations intend to limit. SBA officials informed GAO of the agency's plans to develop an information system capable of addressing this issue. However, at the time of GAO's 2016 report, SBA could not provide detailed information or plans about this system, and as of today, the agency could not provide documentation that this system is operational. As another example, SBA has not addressed GAO's 2006 recommendation to consistently determine whether other small businesses are losing contracting opportunities when SBA awards contracts through the 8(a) program to ANC-owned firms, as required in regulation\u2014an area where GAO found that SBA had fallen short in its oversight. Instead, in 2009, SBA reported that it performed a single analysis of a limited set of procurement data from a limited period and concluded the data did not indicate that other small 8(a) firms (e.g., black-owned, Hispanic-owned, and others) were losing contracting opportunities to ANC-owned firms. However, SBA's actions did not address the intent of GAO's recommendation to \u201cconsistently\u201d perform this oversight.

The 8(a) program is one of the  federal government\u2019s primary vehicles for developing socially and  economically disadvantaged small businesses, including those firms  owned by ANCs.

Over the course of the program, qualified small, disadvantaged  businesses can receive business development support from SBA, such  as mentoring, procurement assistance, business counseling, training,  financial assistance, surety bonding, and other management and  technical assistance. One of the key areas of support is eligibility for  competitive and sole-source federal contracts that are set aside for 8(a)  businesses, which can be an important factor of the financial  development for ANC-owned firms. Oversight and monitoring of all firms  participating in the 8(a) program are delegated to each of SBA\u2019s 68  district offices nationwide. Of its 68 district offices\u2014staff at the Alaska  District Office were assigned and oversaw the majority of all participating  ANC-owned firms.", "ANCs and ANC-owned firms have a unique status in the 8(a) program  and can enter into complex business arrangements In terms of their  organizational structures, ANCs can be either for-profit or not-for-profit  and can own a family of for-profit subsidiary firms, including but not  limited to, wholly owned holding companies that often provide  administrative support to smaller sister ANC-owned firms. As a condition  of the 8(a) program, participating ANC-owned firms must be for-profit.  Generally, ANC-owned firms can remain in the 8(a) program for up to 9  years, provided they maintain their eligibility. During the first four  \u201cdevelopmental\u201d years, participating firms may be eligible for assistance  in program areas including sole-source and competitive 8(a) contract  support, and training in business capacity development and strategies to  compete successfully for both 8(a) and non-8(a) contracts, among other  things. In the last 5 years, firms prepare to transition out of the program,  and are required to obtain a certain percentage of non-8(a) revenue to  demonstrate their progress in developing into a viable business that is not  solely reliant on the 8(a) program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Faced Long-Standing Weaknesses in Its Oversight and Monitoring of Tribal Firms\u2019 Compliance with 8(a) Program Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Across three reports on SBA\u2019s 8(a) program, we have found persistent  weaknesses in the oversight and monitoring of participating Tribal firms,  in particular ANC-owned firms. Specifically, we found that SBA had (1)  incomplete information and documentation on ANC-owned firms\u2019  compliance with regulatory requirements; (2) limitations in its ability to  track and share key program data needed to enforce revenue rules of  Tribal firms, including ANC-owned firms; (3) insufficient staffing in its  Alaska District Office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks  of ANC-owned firms; and (4) inadequate program guidance for clearly  communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations.", "Incomplete information and documentation on ANC-owned firms  and their compliance with regulations: We reported in 2016 that during  a 2014 site visit to the Alaska District Office, we noted that incomplete  information and documentation limited SBA\u2019s oversight of the regulatory  requirements specific to ANC-owned firms we examined. For example,  SBA faced significant challenges in providing us with very basic  information on ANC-owned firms, such as the total number of firms  serviced by the agency. For example, during the course of our review, it  took 3 months for SBA to provide us with a list of ANC-owned firms in the  8(a) program, and on three separate occasions SBA officials provided  three separate numbers for the total number of ANC-owned firms\u2014 ranging from 226 to 636. We noted in our 2016 report that SBA\u2019s inability  to account for and make available principal information on all of the ANC- owned firms participating in the program raises concerns about the  integrity of the agency\u2019s internal controls and ability to provide effective  and sustained oversight.", "As another example, we reported in 2016 that SBA was unable to provide  seven of 30 required agency offer letters for 8(a) contracts that we  requested for our review of contracts that may have been follow-on, sole- source contracts. According to the regulation, these required offer letters are critical documents that could have assisted SBA staff in  understanding a contract\u2019s acquisition history and any small business that  performed this work prior to any subsequent awards. Once an applicant is  admitted to the 8(a) program, it may not receive an 8(a) sole-source  contract that is also a follow-on contract to an 8(a) contract that was  performed \u201cimmediately previously\u201d by another 8(a) program participant  (or former participant) owned by the same ANC. We found that SBA\u2019s  inability to enforce the regulatory prohibition against follow-on, sole- source contracts was directly tied to the quality of the documentation it  collected from contracting agencies. While we found that one program  official in the Alaska District Office took steps during our 2016 review to  ask agencies to specifically report whether contracts are follow-on, sole- source awards in offer letters, we have no evidence supporting that this  practice was more broadly adopted by the program as a whole.  Ultimately, we recommended and SBA agreed to enhance its internal  controls and oversight of ANC-owned firms in the 8(a) program by  ensuring that all ANC-owned firm files contain all relevant documents and  information and providing additional guidance and training to SBA staff on  the enforcement of related policies, among other things.", "Limitations in tracking and sharing key program data needed to  enforce 8(a) revenue rules: In all three reports mentioned in this  testimony, we found that SBA faced limitations in tracking information on  the primary revenue generators for Tribal firms, including ANC-owned  firms, to ensure that multiple firms under one parent ANC are not  generating their revenue in the same primary line of business\u2014that is,  expressed as and operating under the same North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) code\u2014which SBA\u2019s regulation intends to  limit. As discussed later in this testimony, we first identified this issue in  our 2006 report, noting that SBA was not effectively tracking ANC-owned  firms\u2019 revenue data to ensure that the sister firms were not generating the  majority of revenue in the same line of business. We recommended that  SBA collect information on the participation of 8(a) ANC-owned firms as  part of required overall 8(a) monitoring, to include tracking the primary  revenue generators for ANC-owned firms and to ensure that multiple  subsidiaries under one ANC are not generating their revenue in the same  primary line of business. Then in our 2012 report, we found that SBA had  not addressed this limitation and recommended that SBA develop a  system that had the capability to track revenues from ANC-owned firms\u2019  primary and secondary lines of business to ensure that ANC-owned firms  under the same parent ANC are not generating the majority of their  revenue from the same primary line of business.", "In our 2016 report, we found that SBA still had not developed such a  system and thus was not effectively tracking and sharing the type of  revenue information needed to ensure 8(a) ANC-owned firms are  following the intent of 8(a) revenue rules. For example, we found that  without such a system, sister ANC-owned firms owned by the same ANC  could circumvent the intent of the prohibition. In particular, one sister  ANC-owned firm could generate a greater portion of revenues under its  secondary line of business that another sister ANC-owned firm is using as  its primary line of business. Although this type of activity is not prohibited,  we determined that if such activity is left untracked, a firm\u2019s secondary  line of business could effectively become its primary revenue source in  the same line of business that its sister firm claims for its primary line of  business without actually violating SBA\u2019s regulation. During our 2016  review, we found 5 pairs of ANC-owned firms participating in the 8(a)  program from fiscal years 2011 through 2014 that concurrently generated  millions of dollars in the same line of business as their sister ANC-owned  firm\u2019s primary line of business, while generating less or no revenue under  their own primary line of business. As we found then, such activity  could, intentionally or not, potentially circumvent the intent of SBA\u2019s  prohibition, and as discussed later, we recommended that SBA take  action to prevent ANC-owned firms from circumventing this rule. Figure 1  below illustrates one example we reported on in our 2016 report.", "Insufficient staffing levels in SBA\u2019s Alaska District Office: In our 2006  report, we noted that SBA lacked adequate staffing levels in the Alaska  District Office\u2014a district office responsible for the oversight of the  majority of ANC-owned firms. Our reports, and a 2008 report issued by  the SBA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, have shown that inadequate  staffing was a long-standing challenge and a consistent weakness that  directly contributed to SBA\u2019s inability to provide adequate oversight. In our  2012 report, we noted that ANC-owned firms could quickly outgrow the  program. It should be noted that we recommended that SBA evaluate its  staffing levels in 2006, and in our 2016 report, we found that the staffing  challenges persisted. As a result, we found that SBA needed a sustained  and comprehensive approach to staffing its Alaska District Office in order  to conduct sufficient oversight of ANC-owned firm activities. We were told  that frequent staff turnover directly contributed to the limited number of  staff in the Alaska District Office with ANC firm expertise\u2014limiting their  ability to conduct effective and timely oversight of the ANC-owned firms  participating in the program. An SBA official told us at the time that the  optimum number of staff for the Alaska District Office was five with no  more than 100 assigned 8(a) firm files each; however, that office had 1.5  staff responsible for about 200 files each. We found, based on SBA  documentation and observation during our site visit to Alaska that,  because of this staffing shortage, supervisory review of contract  monitoring activities and annual reviews fell behind, resulting in a backlog  of oversight duties related to ANC-owned firms.", "In 2016, we found that SBA took some short-term actions to address the  issues that we identified, such as temporarily redistributing the  management of ANC-owned firm files across several other district offices  and within the Alaska District Office. As for long-term action, SBA officials  provided us with documentation describing the program\u2019s long-term  staffing strategy, which included succession planning and managing  attrition. For example, SBA planned to hire four additional BOS, and an  attorney who understands ANCs. At that time, SBA began implementing  its staffing strategy by hiring additional business opportunity specialists  for its Alaska District Office. However, we have not evaluated whether the agency implemented the remainder of its strategy for succession planning  and managing attrition.", "Inadequate program guidance: We reported that SBA lacked program  guidance that could have assisted the Alaska District Office in improving  staff\u2019s knowledge of program rules and monitoring practices. We initially  raised our concern about the need for strong guidance in 2006 given the  unique status in the 8(a) program and relationships entered into by ANC- owned firms. For our 2012 report, SBA officials told us that it was in the  process of updating its program guidance for the program. However, in  our 2016 report, we similarly found that staff lacked sufficient guidance  and training on key program regulations and internal monitoring practices,  and concluded that resulting inconsistent supervisory review of ANC  transactions and related documentation increased SBA\u2019s vulnerability to  compliance and fraud risks.", "Several months after we issued our report in 2016, SBA issued updated  standard operating procedures on program rules that address the 2011  regulatory changes related to sister ANC-owned firms receiving follow-on,  sole-source contracts and sister subsidiaries sharing primary NAICS  codes. In addition to updating the guidance, SBA also provided training to  its Alaska District Office staff on its 2011 regulations, specifically training  on prohibitions against follow-on sole source contracts. SBA officials also  told us in 2016 that staff in the Alaska District Office were provided  training in supervisory review and other critical file management  procedures, which we noted were weaknesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Not Yet Implemented Some Key Recommendations to Address Oversight and Monitoring Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["To address the weaknesses described above, as well as others related to  oversight and monitoring, our 2006, 2012, and 2016 reports contained a  total of 21 recommendations to SBA.", "While SBA has fully implemented 15 of these recommendations, SBA has  not implemented six recommendations\u2014three of which we highlight in  this statement. All six recommendations are important to enhancing  SBA\u2019s oversight of ANC-owned firms in the 8(a) program. We have not  evaluated the operational effectiveness of SBA\u2019s actions to implement the  15 recommendations, but if effectively implemented, those actions should  help SBA improve its oversight and monitoring of ANC-owned firms in the  8(a) program. In response to our recommendations, SBA\u2019s actions  included providing training to its staff that emphasized regulations governing  the requirement for procuring agencies to specifically state whether a  contract is a follow-on contract in their offer letters, which could help  reduce the award of a follow-on, sole-source contracts to sister ANC- owned firms; developing and enacting a regulation that gives SBA the authority,  under certain circumstances, to change an ANC-owned firm\u2019s primary  line of business (expressed as a NAICS code) to the NAICS code that  generates the greatest portion of the firm\u2019s revenue; this action is  intended to help SBA enforce rules preventing sister ANC-owned  firms from operating in the same primary lines of business; and updating and providing written guidance to field staff officials on the  enforcement of follow-on sole-source contract regulations.", "However, to date SBA has not provided us with evidence that it has  implemented the three following recommendations, which if implemented  as intended, could significantly improve its oversight of the 8(a) program.  Absent action on these recommendations, SBA exposes the program to  continued noncompliance.", "Tracking revenue data and other information on 8(a) ANC-owned  firms: As previously discussed, SBA\u2019s regulation prohibits ANCs from  owning multiple firms that operate under the same primary line of  business (expressed as a primary NAICS code). In each of our 2006,  2012, and 2016 reports we identified weaknesses in SBA\u2019s ability to track  this information in order to prevent sister ANC-owned firms from violating  this rule or circumventing its intent. As a result, in 2006 we recommended  that SBA track the primary revenue generators for ANC-owned firms and  to ensure that multiple subsidiaries under one ANC are not generating  their revenue in the same primary line of business, among other things.  Similarly, in 2012 we recommended that, as SBA is developing a tracking  system, it should take steps to ensure that the system tracks information  on ANC-owned firms, including revenues and other information. In 2006  and 2012, SBA did not indicate whether it agreed with and intended to  implement these recommendations. However, during our 2016 audit, SBA  informed us that it had plans to address this issue, but could not provide  any details. We therefore recommended in 2016 that SBA document this  planned method for tracking revenue generated under subsidiaries\u2019  primary and secondary lines of business. SBA agreed to implement this  2016 recommendation. As part of this recommendation, we stated that  SBA\u2019s documentation should include milestones and timelines for when  and how the method will be implemented. We also recommended that  SBA provide the appropriate level of access to and sharing of relevant  subsidiary data across district offices, including primary and secondary  lines of business and revenue data, once SBA develops a database with  the capabilities of collecting and tracking these revenue data.", "In August 2018, SBA informed us that regulations promulgated in 2016  allow it to change an 8(a) ANC-owned firm\u2019s primary line of business  under certain circumstances if the greatest portion of the firm\u2019s revenues  evolved from one line of business to another. In our 2016 report, we  concluded that the new regulations were a step in the right direction but  would be difficult to implement effectively without the proper tracking and  visibility of revenue data that we describe above and in our 2016 report.  In 2018, SBA officials noted that they were testing an analytics tool that,  they said, would allow them to track revenues for ANC-owned firms, as  we recommended. SBA\u2019s estimated completion date for the evaluation  and implementation of this tool was December 31, 2018, but as of October 2019, SBA has not been able to provide documentation on  whether this action has been implemented. We will continue to monitor  SBA\u2019s efforts to implement this recommendation.", "Criteria thresholds for contract modifications: As we reported in 2006,  SBA regulation requires that when the contract execution function is  delegated to the procuring agencies, these agencies must report to SBA  certain 8(a) information, including contract modifications. Further, the  agreements between SBA and the procuring agencies that we reviewed  in 2006 require that the agencies provide SBA with copies of all 8(a)  contract modifications within 15 days of the date of the contract award.  However, in our 2006 report, we found that contracting officers were not  consistently following these requirements. While some had notified SBA  when incorporating additional services into the contract or when  modifying the contract ceiling amount, others had not. Hence, we  recommended that when revising relevant regulations and policies, the  SBA Administrator should revisit the regulation that requires agencies to  notify SBA of all contract modifications and consider establishing  thresholds for notification. In 2006, SBA disagreed with this  recommendation and thus had not revisited this regulatory requirement,  but rather reiterated a preexisting requirement to provide all contract  modifications, including administrative modifications, to SBA. We  determined that this action did not fulfill our recommendation as it does  not help to ensure that agencies are going to comply with the regulatory  requirement.", "Small businesses potentially losing contracts to 8(a) ANC-owned  firms: In our 2006 report, we found SBA\u2019s oversight had fallen short in  that it did not consistently determine whether other small businesses were  losing contracting opportunities when large, sole-source contracts were  awarded to ANC-owned firms. Further, we found cases where SBA did  not take action when incumbent small businesses lost contract  opportunities when ANC-owned firms were awarded a large sole-source  contract. Hence, we recommended, that when revising relevant  regulations and policies, the SBA Administrator should consistently  determine whether other small 8(a) businesses are losing contracting  opportunities when awarding contracts through the 8(a) program to ANC- owned firms. SBA did not agree with this recommendation, nor did it address the intent of this recommendation by developing a procedure to  consistently perform this action. Instead, SBA reported to us that in 2009  it performed a single analysis of a limited set of procurement data from a  limited period and concluded the data did not indicate that other small  8(a) firms (e.g., small businesses which are unconditionally owned and  controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged  individuals, such black-owned and Hispanic-owned firms) were losing  contracting opportunities to ANC-owned firms. We continue to believe  that without a strategy for consistent monitoring of this issue, SBA is  limited in determining the extent to which other small 8(a) businesses are  being adversely impacted by contracts awarded to ANC-owned firms.", "In summary, the findings I have described in my statement today have  persisted over time as SBA has struggled to articulate and execute an  effective overall monitoring and oversight strategy.
