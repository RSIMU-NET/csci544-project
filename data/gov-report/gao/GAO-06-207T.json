Incorporate return-to-work considerations from the beginning of the assessment process: Private insurers integrated return-to-work considerations early and throughout the eligibility assessment process. Their assessment process both evaluated a person's potential to work and assisted those with work potential to return to the labor force. Provide incentives for claimants and employers to encourage and facilitate return to work: These incentives included requirements for obtaining appropriate medical treatment and participating in a return-to-work program, if such a program would benefit the individual. In addition, they provided financial incentives to employers to encourage them to provide work opportunities for claimants. Strive to use appropriate staff to achieve accurate disability decisions and successful return-to-work outcomes: Private insurers have access to staff with a wide range of expertise not only in making eligibility decisions, but also in providing return-to-work assistance. The three private disability insurers told us that they selected the appropriate type and intensity of staff resources to assess and return individuals with work capacity to employment cost-effectively. In comparison, VA's Individual Unemployability decision-making practices lag behind those used in the private sector. As we have reported in the past, a key weakness in VA's decision-making process is that the agency has not routinely included a vocational specialist in the evaluation to fully evaluate the applicant's ability to work. Preliminary findings from our ongoing work indicate that VA still does not have procedures in place to fully assess veterans' work potential. In addition, the IU decision-making process lacks sufficient incentives to encourage return to work.

Therefore, ensuring the most effective and  efficient management of benefits and services to those who incur  disabilities because of military service is of paramount importance. At the  same time, many people with disabilities have indicated that they want to  work and be independent and would do so if they receive the supports  they need. Fortunately, numerous technological and medical advances,  combined with changes in society and the nature of work, have increased  the potential for people with disabilities to work. Nevertheless, VA has  seen substantial growth of unemployability benefit awards to veterans  with service-connected disabilities.

Today I would like to discuss how   U.S. private sector disability programs facilitate return to work in three  key areas: (1) the eligibility assessment process, (2) work incentives, and   (3) staffing practices.

This involved both  determining\u2014as well as enhancing\u2014the ability of each claimant to return  to work. For example, private insurers used vocational specialists to help  ensure they fully assess the work capacity of claimants, identify needed  accommodations, and develop individualized plans to help those who can  return to work. In addition, these insurers provided incentives for  claimants to take part in vocational rehabilitation programs and to obtain  appropriate medical treatment. They also provided incentives for  employers to provide work opportunities for claimants.

All veterans  awarded service-connected disabilities are assigned single or combined   (in case of multiple disabilities) ratings ranging from 0 to 100 percent, in  increments of 10 percent, based on the rating schedule; such a rating is  known as a schedular rating.

The 57 VA regional  offices use nonmedical rating specialists to evaluate veterans\u2019 eligibility  for these benefits. Upon receipt of an application for compensation  benefits, the rating specialist would typically refer the veteran to a VA  medical center or clinic for an exam. Based on the medical examination  and other information available to the rater, the rater must first determine  which of the veteran\u2019s conditions are or are not service-connected. For  service-connected conditions, the rater compares the diagnosis with the  rating schedule to assign a disability rating.", "Along with medical records, raters may also obtain other records to  evaluate an IU claim. VA may require veterans to furnish an employment  history for the 5-year period preceding the date on which the veteran  claims to have become too disabled to work and for the entire time after  that date. VA guidance also requires that raters request basic employment  information from each employer during the 12-month period prior to the  date the veteran last worked.

For example, advances in medicine and technology have reduced  the severity of some medical conditions and have allowed individuals to  live with greater independence and function in work settings. Moreover,  the nature of work has changed in recent decades as the national economy  has moved away from manufacturing-based jobs to service- and  knowledge-based employment. Yet VA\u2019s and SSA\u2019s disability programs  remain mired in concepts from the past\u2014particularly the concept that  impairment equates to an inability to work\u2014and as such, we found that  these programs are poorly positioned to provide meaningful and timely  support for Americans with disabilities.", "In contrast, we found that a growing number of U.S. private insurance  companies had modernized their programs to enable people with  disabilities to return to work. In general, private insurer disability plans  can provide short- or long-term disability insurance coverage, or both, to  replace income lost by employees because of injuries and illnesses.  Employers may choose to sponsor private disability insurance plans for  employees either by self-insuring or by purchasing a plan through a private  disability insurer. The three private disability insurers we reviewed  recognized the potential for reducing disability costs through an increased  focus on returning people with disabilities to productive activity.

With the initial  reporting of a disability claim, these insurers immediately set up the  expectation that claimants with the potential to do so will return to work.  Identifying and providing services intended to enhance the claimants\u2019  capacity to work are central to their process of deciding eligibility for  benefits. Further, the insurers continue to periodically monitor work  potential and provide return-to-work assistance to claimants as needed  throughout the duration of the claim. Their ongoing assessment process is  closely linked to a definition of disability that shifts over time from less to  more restrictive\u2014that is, from an inability to perform one\u2019s own  occupation to an inability to perform any occupation.", "After a claim is received, the private insurers\u2019 assessment process begins  with determining whether the claimant meets the initial definition of  disability. In general, for the three private sector insurers we studied,  claimants are considered disabled when, because of injury or sickness,  they are limited in performing the essential duties of their own occupation  and they earn less than 60 to 80 percent of their predisability earnings,  depending upon the particular insurer. As part of determining whether the  claimant meets this definition, the insurers compare the claimant\u2019s  capabilities and limitations with the demands of his or her own occupation  and identify and pursue possible opportunities for accommodation\u2014 including alternative jobs or job modifications\u2014that would allow a quick  and safe return to work. A claimant may receive benefits under this  definition of disability for up to 2 years.", "As part of the process of assessing eligibility according to the \u201cown  occupation\u201d definition, insurers directly contact the claimant, the treating  physician, and the employer to collect medical and vocational information  and initiate return-to-work efforts, as needed. Insurers\u2019 contacts with the  claimant\u2019s treating physician are aimed at ensuring that the claimant has  an appropriate treatment plan focused, in many cases, on timely recovery  and return to work. Similarly, insurers use early contact with employers to  encourage them to provide workplace accommodations for claimants with  the capacity to work.", "If the insurers find the claimant initially unable to return to his or her own  occupation, they provide cash benefits and continue to assess the claimant  to determine if he or she has any work potential. For those with work  potential, the insurers focus on return to work before the end of the 2-year  period, when, for all the private insurers we studied, the definition of  disability becomes more restrictive. After 2 years, the definition shifts  from an inability to perform one\u2019s own occupation to an inability to  perform any occupation for which the claimant is qualified by education,  training, or experience. Claimants initially found eligible for benefits may  be found ineligible under the more restrictive definition.", "The private insurers\u2019 shift from a less to a more restrictive disability  definition after 2 years reflects the changing nature of disability and allows  a transitional period for insurers to provide financial and other assistance,  as needed, to help claimants with work potential return to the workforce.  During this 2-year period, the insurer attempts to determine the best  strategy for managing the claim. Such strategies can include, for example,  helping plan medical care or providing vocational services to help  claimants acquire new skills, adapt to assistive devices to increase  functioning, or find new positions. For those requiring vocational  intervention to return to work, the insurers develop an individualized  return-to-work plan, as needed. Basing the continuing receipt of benefits  upon a more restrictive definition after 2 years provides the insurer with  leverage to encourage the claimant to participate in a rehabilitation and  return-to-work program. Indeed, the insurers told us they find that  claimants tend to increase their efforts to return to work as they near the  end of the 2-year period.", "If the insurer initially determines that the claimant has no work potential,  it regularly monitors the claimant\u2019s condition for changes that could  increase the potential to work and reassesses after 2 years the claimant\u2019s  eligibility under the more restrictive definition of disability. The insurer  continues to look for opportunities to assist claimants who qualify under  this definition of disability in returning to work. Such opportunities may  occur, for example, when changes in medical technology\u2014such as new  treatments for cancer or AIDS\u2014may enable claimants to work, or when  claimants are motivated to work.", "The private insurers that we reviewed told us that throughout the duration  of the claim, they tailor the assessment of work potential and development  of a return-to-work plan to the specific situation of each individual  claimant. To do this, disability insurers use a wide variety of tools and  methods when needed. Some of these tools, as shown in tables   1 and 2, are used to help ensure that medical and vocational information is  complete and as objective as possible. For example, insurers consult  medical staff and other resources to evaluate whether the treating  physician\u2019s diagnosis and the expected duration of the disability are in line  with the claimant\u2019s reported symptoms and test results. Insurers may also  use an independent medical examination or a test of basic skills, interests,  and aptitudes to clarify the medical or vocational limitations and  capabilities of a claimant. In addition, insurers identify transferable skills  to compare the claimant\u2019s capabilities and limitations with the demands of  the claimant\u2019s own occupation. This method is also used to help identify  other suitable occupations and the specific skills needed for these new  occupations when the claimant\u2019s limitations prevent him or her from  returning to a prior occupation.

As part of this program, a  return-to-work plan for each claimant can include, for example, adaptive  equipment, modifications to the work site, or other accommodations.  These private insurers mandate the participation of claimants whom they  believe could benefit from rehabilitation because they believe that  voluntary compliance has not encouraged sufficient claimant participation  in these plans.", "The insurers told us that they encourage rehabilitation and return to work  by allowing claimants who work to supplement their disability benefit  payments with earned income. During the first 12 or 24 months of  receiving benefits, depending upon the particular insurer, claimants who  are able to work can do so to supplement their benefit payments and  thereby receive total income of up to 100 percent of predisability  earnings. After this period, if the claimant is still working, the insurers  decrease the benefit amount so that the total income a claimant is allowed  to retain is less than 100 percent of predisability income.", "When a private insurer, however, determines that a claimant is able, but  unwilling, to work, the insurer may reduce or terminate the claimant\u2019s  benefits. To encourage claimants to work to the extent they can, even if  only part-time, two of the insurers told us they may reduce a claimant\u2019s  benefit by the amount the claimant would have earned if he or she had  worked to maximum capacity. The other insurer may reduce a claimant\u2019s  monthly benefit by the amount that the claimant could have earned if he or  she had not refused a reasonable job offer\u2014that is, a job that was  consistent with the claimant\u2019s background, education, and training.  Claimants\u2019 benefits may also be terminated if claimants refuse to accept a  reasonable accommodation that would enable them to work.", "Since medical improvement or recovery can also enhance claimants\u2019  ability to work, the private insurers we studied not only require, but also  help, claimants to obtain appropriate medical treatment. To maximize  medical improvement, these private insurers require that the claimant\u2019s  physician be qualified to treat the particular impairment. Additionally, two  insurers require that treatment be provided in conformance with medical  standards for treatment type and frequency. Moreover, the insurers\u2019  medical staff work with the treating physician as needed to ensure that the  claimant has an appropriate treatment plan. The insurers told us they may  also provide funding for those who cannot otherwise afford treatment.", "The three private sector insurers we studied may also provide financial  incentives to employers to encourage them to provide work opportunities  for claimants. By offering lower insurance premiums to employers and  paying for accommodations, these private insurers encourage employers  to become partners in returning disabled workers to productive  employment. For example, to encourage employers to adopt a disability  policy with return-to-work incentives, the three insurers offer employers a  discounted insurance premium. If their disability caseload declines to the  level expected for those companies that assist claimants in returning to  work, the employers may continue to pay the discounted premium  amount.

The private insurers\u2019 core staff generally includes claims  managers, medical experts, vocational rehabilitation experts, and team  supervisors. The insurers explained that they set hiring standards to  ensure that the multidisciplinary staff is highly qualified. Such  qualifications are particularly important because assessments of benefit  eligibility and work capacity can involve a significant amount of  professional judgment when, for example, a disability cannot be  objectively verified on the basis of medical tests or procedures or clinical  examinations alone. Table 3 describes the responsibilities of this core  staff of experts employed by private disability insurers, as well as its  general qualifications and training.", "The three disability insurers we reviewed use various strategies for  organizing their staff to focus on return to work, with teams organized to  manage claims associated either with a specific impairment type or with a  specific employer (that is, the group disability insurance policyholder).  One insurer organizes its staff by the claimant\u2019s impairment type\u2014for  example, cardiac/respiratory, orthopedic, or general medical\u2014to develop  in-depth staff expertise in the medical treatments and accommodations  targeted at overcoming the work limitations associated with a particular  impairment. The other two insurers organize their staff by the claimant\u2019s  employer because they believe that this enables them to better assess a  claimant\u2019s job-specific work limitations and pursue workplace  accommodations, including alternative job arrangements, to eliminate  these limitations. Regardless of the overall type of staff organization,  each of the three insurers facilitates the interaction of its core staff\u2014 claims managers, medical experts, and vocational rehabilitation experts\u2014 by pulling these experts together into small, multidisciplinary teams  responsible for managing claims.

These experts\u2014deployed both at the insurer\u2019s work  site and in the field\u2014provide specialized services to support the eligibility  assessment process and to help return claimants to work. For instance,  these insurers contract with medical experts beyond their core employee  staff\u2014such as physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and  physical therapists\u2014to help test and evaluate the claimant\u2019s medical  condition and level of functioning. In addition, the insurers contract with  vocational rehabilitation counselors and service providers for various  vocational services, such as training, employment services, and vocational  testing.", "The private insurers we examined told us that they strive to apply the  appropriate type and intensity of staff resources to cost-effectively return  to work claimants with work capacity. The insurers described various  techniques that they use to route claims to the appropriate claims  management staff, which include separating (or triaging) different types of  claims and directing them to staff with the appropriate expertise.  According to one insurer, the critical factor in increasing return-to-work  rates and, at the same time, reducing overall disability costs is proper  triaging of claims. In general, the private insurers separate claims by those  who are likely to return to work and those who are not expected to return  to work. The insurers told us that they assign the type and level of staff  necessary to manage claims of people who are likely to return to work on  the basis of the particular needs and complexity of the specific case (see  table 4).", "As shown in table 4, claimants expected to need medical assistance, such  as those requiring more than a year for medical stabilization, are likely to  receive an intensive medical claims management strategy. A medical  strategy involves, for example, ensuring that the claimant receives  appropriate medical treatment. Claimants who need less than a year to  stabilize medically are managed much less intensively. For these claims, a  claims manager primarily monitors the claimant\u2019s medical condition to  assess whether it is stable enough to begin vocational rehabilitation, if  appropriate. Alternatively, a claimant with a more stable, albeit serious,  medical condition who is expected to need vocational rehabilitation, job  accommodations, or both to return to work might warrant an intensive  vocational strategy. The private disability insurers generally apply their  most resource-intensive, and therefore most expensive, multidisciplinary  team approach to these claimants. Working closely with the employer and  the attending physician, the team actively pursues return-to-work  opportunities for claimants with work potential.", "Finally, claimants who are likely not to return to work (or \u201cstable and  mature\u201d claims) are generally managed using a minimum level of  resources, with a single claims manager responsible for regularly  reviewing a claimant\u2019s medical condition and level of functioning. The  managers of these claims carry much larger caseloads than managers of  claims that receive an intensive vocational strategy. For example, one  insurer\u2019s average claims manager\u2019s caseload for these stable and mature  claims is about 2,200 claims, compared with an average caseload of 80  claims in the same company for claims managed more actively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Individual Unemployability Return-to-Work Efforts Lag behind Other Programs", "paragraphs": ["Unlike disability compensation programs in the private sector, VA has not  drawn on vocational experts for IU assessments to examine the claimant\u2019s  work potential and identify the services and accommodations needed to  help those who could work to realize their full potential.
