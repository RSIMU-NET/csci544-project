About 10 percent of the nation\u2019s veterans use VA health care services. To provide these services in fiscal year 1998, VA requested a medical care appropriation of almost $17 billion. In addition, VA requested a legislative change to authorize it to retain private health insurance and Medicare reimbursements. The Congress has responded by authorizing VA to retain private health insurance payments and certain other payments in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. VA estimates this would provide an additional $468 million in fiscal year 1998 after deducting administrative costs for collections.

For the fiscal year 1997 allocation, VERA was designed to allocate 88 percent of the $17 billion medical care appropriation to the 22 regional networks. VERA allocates resources on the basis of two key components: network workloads and national capitation rates. Workloads are the estimates of the number of high-priority veterans a network can serve. High-priority veterans\u2014 commonly referred to as Category A veterans\u2014are those with service-connected disabilities, low incomes, or special health care needs. The networks in turn allocate these resources to their facilities.", "VERA provides more comparable levels of resources to each network for each high-priority veteran served than the process it replaced, which allocated resources primarily on the basis of facilities\u2019 historical budgets.VERA provides more comparable levels of resources by classifying patients on the basis of the cost of their health care into two workload groups\u2014 basic care and special care. Basic care patients generally receive routine services that are less expensive than those received by special care patients. Special care patients often have complex or chronic conditions, such as spinal cord injuries, advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic mental illness, or end-stage renal disease or require care in settings such as nursing homes (see app. III for complete list of special care patient classifications). The VERA special care category also includes some adjustment for age to account for expected changes in the age distribution of veterans in a network. VERA determines a national capitation rate for each workload group. (See fig. 1 for fiscal year 1997 capitation rates.)", "VERA allocations to each network are based primarily on patient workloads and the two national capitation rates. To account for differences in regional labor costs, VERA increases patient allocations for networks with higher labor costs and reduces them for networks with lower labor costs.In addition, each VISN receives funding for other health-related functions, including research support, education support, equipment, and nonrecurring maintenance. Funding for these activities is determined using national cost estimates for each activity and each network\u2019s workload in that activity. (See fig. 2 for an example of how a network allocation is made.)", "VERA creates incentives for networks to serve more high-priority veterans. Because allocations are based on high-priority veteran workload, networks serving more high-priority veterans compared with other networks gain resources under VERA; those serving fewer such veterans compared with others lose resources. This takes place because all networks receive the same national capitation rates for the workload they serve.", "Network officials have responded to VERA\u2019s incentives by increasing the number of high-priority veterans served, according to officials we contacted. For example, VISN 2 (Albany) facilities had served 7,442 high-priority veterans through the first half of fiscal year 1997 whom they had never served before, officials told us. Similar efforts are under way at the other VISNs we contacted.", "In addition, VERA has incentives for reducing costs. Because network allocations are based on a national standard (the national capitation rate), networks have an incentive to keep their costs below the national rate. Networks that are more efficient (that is, with patient costs below the national capitation rate) have more funds available for local initiatives. However, those with patient care costs above the national capitation rate (that is, less efficient networks) must increase efficiency to have such funds available.", "Network and medical center officials are taking a variety of actions to reduce costs because of VERA\u2019s incentives and other VA initiatives, they said. These officials represented networks gaining and losing resources under VERA. Among these actions are providing more care on an outpatient basis, decreasing more costly inpatient care; reducing lengths of stay in nursing homes; and expanding primary care to prevent or postpone the need for more costly care. In addition, some networks are developing plans to reduce duplication by integrating the management structures of nearby hospitals or consolidating the delivery of certain services into one location."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VERA Shifted Few Resources in 1997, but Full Implementation Would Shift Substantially More", "paragraphs": ["Although VA began phasing in VERA in fiscal year 1997, VA did not shift substantial amounts of resources among networks. VERA\u2019s immediate impact was lessened because its adjustments to network allocations only affected budgets for the second half of the fiscal year and caps were placed on the amount of funds moved. Networks with reduced funding needed time for management to implement less costly ways of providing quality care while improving access, VA officials said. Networks gaining funding needed time to plan for and use new funds to provide the best quality and most cost-efficient services.", "The partial implementation of VERA in fiscal year 1997 moved resources from the Northeast and Midwest, where per veteran costs have been higher than the national average, to the South and West, where per veteran costs have been lower than the national average. Five networks received less funding in fiscal year 1997 than in fiscal year 1996 and 17 received more. The largest network reduction in fiscal year 1997 was about 1 percent, and the largest increase was about 7 percent (see fig. 3).", "If VA had fully implemented VERA in fiscal year 1997, it would have substantially shifted funding among the networks, ranging from a reduction of 14 percent to an increase of 16 percent when compared with fiscal year 1996 allocations (see fig. 3).

These data will reflect changes in the number of veterans served and any changes in VA appropriations. As a result, some VISNs that received reduced allocations under VERA in fiscal year 1997 could receive increased allocations in future years if the number of veterans they serve increases significantly. Alternatively, some networks that gain resources in 1997 could lose resources in future years if the number of veterans they serve does not keep pace with those served by other VISNs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Continues to Explore Ways to Improve VERA Allocations", "paragraphs": ["VA is exploring several options for improving allocations. First, it is exploring whether it can better measure workload and determine capitation rates to improve equity of resource allocation. Because most of VERA\u2019s allocations are based on patient care capitation and workload measures, these two measures are the ones most likely to contribute to any inappropriate resource shifting.", "VA continues to examine the method for setting capitation rates by trying to better account for differences in regional costs for each veteran served. We have previously noted the importance of such an examination. VERA assumes that all differences in regional costs\u2014after adjusting for the basic and special care case mix and differences in labor costs\u2014result from differences in efficiencies. Although differences in network efficiencies play a major role, to the extent that any of the remaining differences do not result from efficiencies, VERA may allocate some resources inappropriately. For example, some of these differences could result from differences in veterans\u2019 health status not captured by VERA\u2019s case mix. VA\u2019s recently released data on veterans\u2019 self-reported physical and mental health status, however, tend to support VERA\u2019s regional shift in allocations.Veterans in northeastern and midwestern VISNs, which received reduced funds under VERA, tended to report being healthier than veterans in southern VISNs, which gained funds under VERA. VA officials are planning to examine whether using such data will improve the case mix adjustment.", "In addition to capitation, VA is examining whether workload measures can be improved. VA officials are examining the possibility of determining workload on the basis of a VISN\u2019s population of high-priority veterans rather than on past users as VERA did for fiscal year 1997. To do this, however, VA would need to know why veterans choose to use or not use VA health services so it could adjust the population workload numbers, according to VA officials. VA could consider, for example, adjusting for veterans\u2019 private health insurance coverage or access to non-VA health providers.", "Usage rates for high-priority veterans vary widely among VISNs. They range from 25 percent in VISN 4 (Pittsburgh) to 45 percent in VISN 18 (Phoenix) of the eligible beneficiaries on the basis of data from fiscal years 1994 to 1996. (See fig. 4.) Whether veterans have private insurance or access to non-VA health providers are important variables in predicting use of VA services in networks, VISN officials said. Our previous work also showed that health insurance status affects usage of VA health care services: we found that uninsured veterans were eight times more likely to use VA services than insured veterans. State-level insurance data also suggest that veterans\u2019 usage rates vary with insurance coverage. States included in VISNs such as VISN 4 (Pittsburgh) and VISN 11 (Ann Arbor), which have lower rates of veteran use of VA health care services, have proportionally fewer uninsured veterans. On the other hand, states in VISN 18 (Phoenix) and VISN 16 (Jackson), which have higher rates of veteran use of VA health care services, have proportionally more uninsured veterans.", "VA plans to systematically survey veterans on why they choose to use VA health care services, officials told us. This survey will also provide information for refining VERA for VA\u2019s use as it implements an enrollment system for veterans\u2019 health care in fiscal year 1999, officials said. If this option is adopted, VERA workload would become population based rather than user based. The differences in allocations, if any, would depend on the adjustments made to the population base for why veterans use or do not use VA services. VA is also considering other refinements to VERA, including possible improvements in VERA\u2019s adjustment for regional differences in labor costs, regional equipment costs, and nonrecurring maintenance costs. Although VA has considered possible changes to VERA to account for the impact of third-party health insurance payments that the Congress has authorized, VA plans no change before it has experience in collecting and using these funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Monitoring of Changes Resulting From VERA\u2019s Incentives Is Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["VA headquarters officials do not adequately monitor some of the important changes under way in VA health care delivery resulting from VERA\u2019s incentives and other VA initiatives. Although officials have begun to address this issue, they lack timely and detailed indicators of certain changes occurring in health care delivery. As a result, it is difficult for VA to ensure that VERA\u2019s capacity to allocate resources equitably is not compromised and that veterans receive appropriate health care.", "Because workload and capitation drive VERA allocations, key indicators to monitor are changes in the number of basic and special care patients VISNs serve and changes in medical care practices that could significantly affect VISN per patient costs. Such information is needed to identify significant changes that could affect VERA\u2019s future resource allocation or the appropriateness of care veterans receive. For example, some networks, according to officials, are increasing workload by thousands of veterans and changing the way they provide care in response to VERA\u2019s incentives. Such changes could significantly increase future allocations to their VISNs and reduce allocations to others and result in new medical care practices for certain conditions. With adequate information, VA headquarters can promptly assess the extent to which such changes are consistent with VERA\u2019s purpose and take corrective actions when they are not. VA also can examine the appropriateness of care veterans receive when medical care practices change significantly, such as when length of stay for inpatient services decreases dramatically, and take corrective action if necessary. Such analyses would also enable VA to distribute information to all VISNs on best practices and problems identified.", "VERA data systems cannot promptly track changes in workload and medical care practices. The data lag more than a year after services have been provided. For example, until July 1997, fiscal year 1995 was the most recent year for which VERA data systems could provide information on workload and medical care practices. Several data validation processes cause lags in data availability. VA officials told us that the delays result mainly from the need to determine the patient classification in the VERA model for each veteran served and the need to allocate patient costs among VISNs when patients receive services in more than one VISN. They said that hospital delays in posting information on the services provided to veterans partly account for the time lag.", "VA, however, has developed some indicators beyond the VERA system to more promptly track changes in health care delivery. The most applicable of these indicators for monitoring VERA is the change in high-priority veteran workload, which VA began to report in fiscal year 1997 as part of its new quarterly reports on VISN performance. Nonetheless, this measure is inadequate for assessing the impact of workload changes on future VERA allocations because it cannot classify these veterans into VERA\u2019s basic and special patient care workload measures.", "Moreover, VA does not monitor other changes in service delivery that are critical to assessing networks\u2019 responses to VERA\u2019s incentives. For example, VA has not been monitoring changes in the number of one-time users of VA health care. Networks have an incentive under VERA to increase the number of one-time users, whose cost of care is significantly below the national capitation rate. Providing one-time services to a veteran is one of the most advantageous ways to increase workload, VA officials told us. Although VISNs incur relatively fewer costs for each patient served, VERA still allocates the full capitation amount for each one-time patient. As networks respond to VERA\u2019s incentives and VA\u2019s initiatives to increase primary care along with its associated preventive services, VA does not know the extent to which the number of one-time users is increasing. To the extent that some networks increase these visits disproportionately, future VERA allocations could be substantially affected. In addition, monitoring unusual increases in the number of one-time users could raise issues that require further investigation.", "Moreover, VA lacks measures for monitoring changes in special patient category services, which include the most expensive services VA delivers. Monitoring these changes is important because of VERA\u2019s incentives to reduce the cost of patient care and because the special care population is particularly vulnerable. VISNs may reduce costs for this care in several ways. One way is to serve more patients with existing resources. For example, some VISNs are increasing the number of patients served in VA-operated nursing homes without increasing the number of beds or staff available by reducing patients\u2019 average length of stay.", "In fiscal year 1996, lengths of stay varied considerably by VISN. (See table 1.) VISNs with longer lengths of stay have the greatest incentive to reduce lengths of stay, while increasing workload. Although VERA does not prescribe how networks should respond to its incentives, some network and hospital officials told us they had initiatives under way to increase nursing home workload, decrease lengths of stay, and lower costs by reducing staffing. Under certain circumstances, officials said, they would use other funds to pay some of the costs of VA-operated nursing home care.", "By reducing the length of stay in nursing homes, a VISN could serve more patients with the same resources, and VERA would allocate more funds to the VISN because of the increased workload. For example, according to VA, the cost of serving one patient for a year in a VA-operated nursing home bed was about $80,000 in fiscal year 1996. But in fiscal year 1997, VERA would only allocate $35,707 for this patient. If the length of stay were 4 months, however, a VISN could serve three patients and VERA would allocate $107,121 at the fiscal year 1997 capitation rate.", "Monitoring such changes is important because it can help managers identify whether changes are consistent with VA-wide goals or corrective action is needed. If monitoring reveals that nursing home discharges are increasing, this may indicate progress toward meeting VA\u2019s goal of reduced reliance on inpatient services. If a VISN is serving more patients, it may also indicate increased veterans\u2019 access. Meanwhile, however, managers need to monitor whether the changes significantly affect future allocations and the appropriateness of services provided. For example, hospital officials in VISN 4 (Pittsburgh) told us they were working to significantly lower their nursing homes\u2019 lengths of stay. If VISN 4 reduces its length of stay to that of VISN 18 (Phoenix), it could serve more than 3,000 additional nursing home patients annually, and VERA would allocate significantly more resources to it. Monitoring the likelihood of such a resource shift is important because such a shift would reduce the resources available to other networks for future allocations. Monitoring is also important to ensure that changes in the care provided this vulnerable, special care population are appropriate. For example, monitoring would help VA identify issues to examine such as whether patients with reduced length of nursing home stay receive appropriate discharge planning and other needed services.", "VA headquarters is considering improving the timeliness and detail of indicators used for monitoring changes in allocations and VA health care delivery, officials said. Among these improvements are the availability of VERA workload data during the fiscal year in which they are collected and monitoring changes in the number of special care patients and one-time users and in the services provided to certain special care populations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Oversight of Networks\u2019 Allocation Decisions Is Inadequate to Ensure Equitable Access to Services", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s decentralized management structure gives VISNs the responsibility for allocating the resources VERA provides.

A VISN may shift resources to underserved areas in its network by providing additional funding to facilities located there, by establishing community- based outpatient clinics (CBOC), or by contracting out for services.However, if VISNs do not take steps to improve equity of access through their resource allocations, the promise of VERA may not be realized.", "The seven networks we contacted have various funding allocation methods. One funds its facilities using a flat rate for each veteran user. Another uses a combination of historical funding and negotiation with medical center management regarding new initiatives. Two others include a feature in their allocation methods for each new veteran served. One pays prospectively on the basis of targets for increased patients. The other pays retrospectively after the veteran has received services. Several VISNs are continuing to develop and evaluate their resource allocation methods.", "Differences in VISN allocation methods may be appropriate to account for characteristics specific to each VISN. These include differences in facility missions, veteran users\u2019 health needs, and the geographic dispersion of the population served. For example, if a VISN has some facilities that mainly provide low-cost primary and outpatient care and others that provide a large volume of expensive inpatient care, the VISN allocation methods will need to account for these differences in missions and associated costs. VISNs, however, may allocate resources\u2014regardless of whether they shift funds among facilities\u2014in such way that they make little improvement in equity for underserved veterans.", "VA has provided little oversight of networks\u2019 allocation of resources to their facilities. Documents headquarters has distributed to the networks provide no guidance nor do they specify criteria that networks should consider in allocating resources to their facilities. These documents only describe the budget items included in VERA allocation and those allocated separately by headquarters. Furthermore, headquarters has done little to monitor network efforts to improve veterans\u2019 equitable access to services. Although headquarters has required each VISN to report changes in allocations they made to each facility, including a report of funds used for addressing equity of access, the instructions for this report do not explain what this category is intended to capture or how VISNs should determine the amount of funds per facility they report for this purpose.

Although officials in the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer have begun to review changes in the numbers of special care patients served, as of August 21, 1997, these data were not complete and were unavailable for our review. Furthermore, this effort does not include data to monitor changes in medical practice for veterans receiving special care services.

In addition, he noted that VA is developing outcome measures for evaluating VISN performance in achieving equitable access to care. We support these actions because they could significantly improve VA oversight of VISN allocations at the network level. However, the Secretary-designate stated that oversight of the networks should focus on performance outcomes rather than inputs. Although we agree that measuring outcomes is important, we believe headquarters should also review and approve VISN resource allocation methods to ensure that VISNs have the same understanding of the criteria and that variations in methods appropriately apply the criteria.

First, we examined how VA allocates resources through the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system to the 22 Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISN). Second, we examined how headquarters monitors VERA\u2019s impact. Third, we reviewed how headquarters oversees networks\u2019 allocation of resources to the facilities in their geographic regions.", "To address our objectives, we (1) collected and reviewed data on VERA\u2019s allocation method; (2) reviewed our previous work that examined VA\u2019s resource allocation process (see Related GAO Products); (3) reviewed national and regional veteran population data that could be used in considering alternatives to VERA\u2019s method; (4) collected and examined documents on VISN allocations to facilities in VISN geographic areas; and (5) interviewed officials in the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of Policy, Planning, and Performance, and Office of the Chief Network Officer because of their VERA-related responsibilities. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer designed and is implementing VERA. The Office of Policy, Planning, and Performance collects information on network performance indicators that can be used for monitoring changes resulting from VERA\u2019s implementation, and the Office of the Chief Network Officer has overall responsibility for managing and coordinating network activities. We also used information provided by VA\u2019s National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics, which provides statistical data and analysis of veterans and VA services.", "We contacted network directors and other officials, including chief financial officers in seven networks to collect VISN-level data and interview them on VERA\u2019s implementation, VISN allocation methods, and the implications for veterans\u2019 equity of access to services. We telephoned officials in four networks: VISN 2 (Albany), VISN 3 (Bronx), VISN 18 (Phoenix), and VISN 20 (Portland). We visited three networks: VISN 1 (Boston), VISN 4 (Pittsburgh), and VISN 16 (Jackson). Three of these VISNs would have gained resources if VERA had been fully implemented in fiscal year 1997, and four would have lost resources. (See fig. 3.) We visited seven medical centers in these networks (Brockton/West Roxbury, Northampton, Pittsburgh, Clarksburg, Lebanon, Fayetteville, and Jackson), where we interviewed medical center managers, program directors, physicians, nurses, administrative personnel, and others about VERA implementation and VISN allocations to facilities.", "We performed our review between January 1997 and July 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VERA Special Patient Classifications", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1997, VERA\u2019s special care category consisted of veterans with high-cost health care needs in 29 special care patient classifications. Networks receive a capitation payment for each veteran they serve in one of the classifications. The capitation rate for veterans in the special care classifications was $35,707. Patients are assigned to only one classification on the basis of cost and other factors. The special care patient classifications are costly because of the type and amount of care required or the type of facility where care is provided. For example, some patient classifications are for patients receiving treatment for a long time period, such as for end-stage renal disease and spinal cord injury, while others are for patients with relatively shorter periods of treatment such as those for organ transplants.
