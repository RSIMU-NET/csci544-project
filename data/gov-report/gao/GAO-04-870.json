Three of the five surveyed agencies have begun to use spend analysis to obtain knowledge and improve their spending for goods and services. Veterans Affairs' success in using spend analysis and a strategic approach to pharmaceutical procurement helped save $394 million in 2003. Currently, agency teams are organizing medical-equipment and supplies purchase data to develop national contracts to save an estimated $82 million a year. Spend analysis is being used by HHS to support strategic sourcing of office-related equipment and supplies through discount agreements with major vendors that could save an estimated $9.5 million per year. Agriculture used a 2001 spend analysis to negotiate a discount agreement for office supplies that yielded savings of $1.8 million to date and is identifying more such opportunities. Agriculture is also modernizing its acquisition system to develop automated data-mining, spend analysis, and reporting capabilities to support future opportunities. The departments of Justice and Transportation have not yet used spend analyses to support a more strategic approach to procurement. Veterans Affairs, HHS, and Agriculture have made good progress using spend analysis to improve their procurements, and they have adopted some elements of a strategic approach. Implementing spend analysis is challenging and can take time, and the agencies have not yet adopted the full range of private sector best practices.

To obtain these answers,  companies use a number of practices involving automating, extracting,  supplementing, organizing, and analyzing procurement data. Companies  establish automated systems to extract and compile internal financial data  covering everything they buy; supplement that data with information from  external sources; organize this data into complete and consistent  categories of products, services, and suppliers; and have the data  continually analyzed. Companies then leverage this data to institute a  series of structural, process, and role changes aimed at moving away from  a fragmented procurement process to a more efficient and effective  corporate process in which managers make decisions on a companywide  basis.", "We have already issued several reports examining the benefits of using a  strategic approach to procurement and spend analysis at the Department  of Defense.

For background on the agencies\u2019 contract and purchase card  spending on goods and services, we used summary fiscal year 2003  Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) data from the General Services  Administration (GSA). Because we used FPDS data for information  purposes and not to support our findings, we did not verify the data.

While each of the companies we studied is a leader in its  respective market, each was also not immune to market or stockholder  pressures to improve performance or to challenges from senior corporate  leadership to improve the manner in which the company acquired goods  and services. In turn, these companies adopted a strategic approach to  leverage their buying power, reduce costs, better manage their suppliers,  and improve the quality of goods and services acquired.", "As shown in figure 1, we identified broad principles and practices that  were critical to carrying out the companies\u2019 strategic approach  successfully. Taking a strategic approach involves a range of activities  from developing a better picture of what the company is spending on  procurement to taking an enterprisewide approach to procuring goods and  services and developing new ways of doing business.", "Pursuing such an approach in the private sector clearly pays off. Studies  have reported significant cost savings for some companies of 10 to 20  percent of their total procurement costs. And the leading commercial  companies we studied reported savings and anticipated savings in the  billions of dollars.", "Conducting a spend analysis to obtain improved knowledge on  procurement spending is a critical component of an effective strategic  approach. A spend analysis permits company executives to review how  much their company has spent each year, what was bought, from whom it  was bought, and who was purchasing it. The analysis identifies where  numerous suppliers are providing similar goods and services\u2014often at  varying prices\u2014and where purchasing costs can be reduced and  performance improved by better leveraging buying power and reducing  the number of suppliers to meet the company\u2019s needs.", "Spend analysis is an important driver of strategic planning and execution,  and it allows for the creation of lower-cost consolidated contracts at the  local, regional, or global level. At the same time, as part of a strategic  procurement effort, spend analysis allows companies to monitor trends in  small and minority-owned business supplier participation to address the  proper balance between small and minority business utilization and  equally important corporate financial savings goals for strategic sourcing.", "Setting up a spend analysis program can be challenging, according to our  prior research. Companies have had problems accumulating sufficient  data from internal financial systems that do not capture all of what a  company buys or are being used by different parts of the company but are  not connected. Because simplified data may not exist or be available,  companies have frequently been unsure who their buyers are and have had  to contend with databases that include listings of items and suppliers that  in reality are identical to each other but which are all stored under  different names. Companies have also found that existing databases have  not captured anywhere nearly enough details on the goods and services  for which vendors are being paid.", "Despite the challenges, companies that developed formal, centralized  spend analysis programs have found that they have been able to conduct  effective and ongoing spend analysis through the use of five key processes,  involving automating, extracting, supplementing, organizing, and analyzing  data.", "Automation: Data automatically compiled.", "Extraction: Essential data culled from accounts payable and other internal systems.", "Supplemental information: Additional data sought from other internal and  external sources.", "Organization: Review data to ensure accuracy and completeness; organize data into  logical, comprehensive commodity and supplier categories.", "Analysis and strategic goals: Using standard reporting and analytical tools, data  analyzed on a continual basis to support decisions on strategic-sourcing and procurement  management in areas such as cost cutting, streamlining operations, and reducing the  number of suppliers.  Scope generally covers an organization's entire spending.", "Building the foundation for a thorough spend analysis involves creating an  automated information system for compiling spending data. The system  routinely extracts vendor payment and related procurement data from  financial and other information systems within the company. The data are  then automatically compiled into a central data warehouse or a  spreadsheet application, which is continually updated. Most of the  automated spend analysis systems currently in use were developed in- house, although some companies have hired third-party companies for  expertise and technology.", "The data are primarily extracted from vendor accounts payable financial  systems and reviewed for completeness. Accounts payable data can be  voluminous and very detailed. Companies process large numbers of  vendor invoices for payment each year, and each of those must be  examined by their spend analysis systems. When necessary, the accounts  payable data are supplemented with other sources, such as purchase card  data obtained from external bank-card vendors\u2019 systems or other  information, such as suppliers\u2019 financial status and performance  information. Companies must obtain as much information as possible from  both internal and external sources to gain a complete understanding of  their spending.", "For spend analysis to be effective, data files must be accurate, complete,  and consistent. The data are subjected to an extensive review for accuracy  and consistency, and steps are taken to standardize the data in the same  format, which involves the creation of uniform purchasing codes. The data  are typically organized into comprehensive categories of suppliers and  commodities that cover all of the organization\u2019s purchases.", "In tandem with building a spend analysis foundation, commodity  managers or cross-functional commodity teams are established to access  and analyze the information on an ongoing basis, using standard reporting  and analytical tools. Each team is responsible for one or more  commodities, which may also include responsibility for a number of sub- categories. Once the spending data has been organized and reviewed,  companies use the data as the foundation for a variety of ongoing strategic  decisions and efforts.", "Our past work also shows how federal agencies, in particular DOD, might  apply these private sector best practices to obtain lower prices from  suppliers and improve procurement effectiveness. For example, we  noted that although DOD\u2019s spending on services contracts approaches  $100 billion annually, its management of services procurement has been  inefficient and ineffective. To achieve the potential for billions of dollars  in savings, we recommended that DOD take a more strategic approach to  services contracting that includes adopting the spend analysis best  practices of leading companies. In response, in 2004 the agency started  developing a spend analysis system that will pull purchasing data from  disparate databases for analysis by newly organized DOD-wide commodity  teams. DOD expects that users of this spend analysis system will be able  to identify procurement trends, buying patterns, and opportunities for  strategic sourcing, which will result in cost savings and quality  improvements.", "The government purchase card program offers yet another arena for the  use of spend analysis. Through the purchase card program, agency  personnel can acquire the routine goods and services they need directly  from vendors as long as the purchase is $2,500 or less. From 1994 to 2003,  the use of such cards exploded from $1 billion to $16 billion, but we found  that agencies generally were not taking advantage of opportunities to  negotiate discounts with major vendors. We therefore recommended  several actions\u2014including conducting spend analysis using available data  and gathering additional information where feasible\u2014that would  ultimately help agencies to achieve $300 million annually in potential  savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Begun Analyzing Spending Trends to Improve Knowledge and Procurement", "paragraphs": ["Three of the five agencies we reviewed\u2014Veterans Affairs, HHS, and  Agriculture\u2014have each conducted spend analyses, either by using their  own resources or by hiring consultants to do the work.

Reflecting national trends, Veterans Affairs\u2019  pharmacy procurement costs have risen significantly in recent years,  consuming an increasing percentage of the department\u2019s health care  budget. The $2.1 billion the agency spent on such items in 2000 were  primarily for prescription drugs and their dispensing, but also included  some supplies and over-the-counter drugs. To mitigate this increase in  pharmacy procurement costs, the agency created a pharmacy benefits  management strategic health group in 1995 that analyzes pharmaceutical  spending trends across all medical facilities and employs various  procurement arrangements for purchasing prescription drugs at  substantial discounts. According to the agency, the pharmaceutical  procurement standardization program led to savings of $394 million in  fiscal year 2003 alone.", "Veterans Affairs has also made progress in the areas of medical and  prosthetics supplies and equipment. In fiscal year 2001, the agency  purchased about $500 million in medical-surgical supplies and $1.1 billion  in medical equipment and prosthetics. For example, VA created a national  prosthetics spend database that extracts procurement data from all  medical facilities\u2019 systems and organizes data on purchased items into  commodity categories, such as wheelchairs and aids for the blind. The  agency\u2019s prosthetics strategic health group also formed a number of  commodity teams with stakeholders from across the medical facilities and  health care regions to use spend analysis to identify commonly used items  that can be purchased at substantial discounts under a national contract.  The prosthetics group also uses spend analysis to monitor medical facility  compliance with the national contracts and to ensure potential savings are  realized. As of June 2004, the group\u2019s spend analysis and strategic-sourcing  efforts have resulted in 23 national contracts and accumulated more than  $57 million in cost avoidance.", "The agency is just beginning to develop a spend analysis tool for medical  and surgical supplies and high-technology medical equipment. Specifically,  it is working with a contractor to create uniform medical-product names  for an agencywide spend analysis system. When the system is fully  operational in fiscal year 2006, it will automatically extract medical  supplies and equipment procurement data into a central data warehouse,  organized by common categories of products.

Like  other agencies, procurement activities in HHS were operating under a  decentralized environment of independent, transaction-oriented buying  processes, with limited visibility over the agency\u2019s total procurement  spending.", "For example, HHS has conducted a spend analysis of commonly  contracted products. In its first phase, $100 million in yearly spending for  thousands of office-related products such as custodial supplies, office  supplies, office furniture, office equipment (such as photocopiers and  facsimile machines), and peripheral information technology products  (such as computer monitors and scanners) was analyzed to identify  opportunities for significant savings to purchase card buyers through  agencywide discount agreements. Between May and July 2004, HHS  awarded the first agreements to three vendors for the office supplies,  custodial products, and peripheral items. HHS estimates the potential  savings from these discount agreements range from 7 percent to  54 percent and could yield at least $9.5 million in annual savings for the  department on just the office supplies, office equipment, and information  technology peripherals. Later this year, the agency will work with its  consultant to do a new round of spend analysis to identify potential  categories and savings opportunities in the next phase of the strategic- sourcing initiative for products.", "In a second initiative, HHS procurement headquarters hired a consultant in  August 2003 to support a newly organized agencywide group of 100 senior  procurement and other key managers to work on consolidation of services  acquisitions.

Its progress in making similar improvements in its  procurements of other medical supplies and equipment has been slower,  however, and its efforts related to clinical care or facilities support  services are in their very early stages.", "A March 2004 inspector general\u2019s audit report, for example, noted that the  agency\u2019s efforts to reform medical supplies and equipment purchasing  practices since 2002 have not yet translated into significant national  contracting results and medical purchasing cost savings. The audit  recommended increasing efforts to pursue aggressively more national  contracts that, if implemented, could achieve about $82 million per year in  savings.", "A spend analysis tool that would examine Veterans Affairs\u2019 medical  supplies and equipment spending trends will not, in fact, be ready before  2006, when best practices\u2014such as automated compilation of purchase  data, extracted from facilities\u2019 procurement and vendor payment systems  and supplemented and organized\u2014will be put in place for use by  established commodity teams.", "The agency is also beginning to focus on taking a more strategic approach  to acquiring services for veterans medical facilities from contract  providers. In May 2004, the Secretary announced that Veterans Affairs  must more effectively purchase contract health care services for veterans  (such as skilled nursing and laboratory services) by leveraging its  purchasing power as a national healthcare system. The Secretary directed  that a national clinical-contracting strategy be drafted by November 2004  that would identify high-value, competitively priced purchasing options for  obtaining medical services from contract providers throughout the  country. In addition, in commenting on a draft of this report, the agency  stated its intent to pursue national contracts for non-clinical services as  well. Facilities now contract locally for a wide variety of support services,  such as facilities maintenance, housekeeping, and food service.  According to the agency, both efforts will use spend analysis as  appropriate. However, we believe it will be difficult for the agency to  accomplish this objective since the new spend analysis tool, expected in  2006, will only capture data on medical supplies and equipment spending  trends.", "HHS asked its division heads to begin planning for departmentwide  consolidation of procurement activities in April 2003. Although  headquarters managers had worked with consultants to conduct spend  analyses to improve their knowledge of overlapping and duplicative  procurement spending, they had no plan to develop an automated tool to  repeat the process and only a small number of consolidated procurement  actions were expected to result. (See appendix I, table 2.)", "In June 2004, however, HHS procurement managers told us that an  agencywide working group was going to propose obtaining commercial  software to develop an automated spend analysis system to compile the  necessary data and generate standardized reports. As result, they believe  that HHS\u2019 spend analysis efforts could make use of an automation tool in  the future to enable the process to be repeated consistently, obtain data  from HHS sources such as financial management systems, and analyze  data on a continual basis. The proposal was intended to augment ongoing  plans for an HHS-wide standard electronic procurement system to be  phased in over the next year or so. According to these officials, details on  the proposed system\u2019s spend analysis capabilities are forthcoming,  pending approval and funding to implement it.", "Agriculture\u2019s current spend analysis efforts are also not automated,  include no financial management data such as vendor accounts payable  systems, and do not analyze data on a continual basis. (See app. I, table 3.)  The agency does have plans to have an agencywide spend analysis system  in place by 2006, but the system will be a centralized tool shared by  component organizations that may or may not choose to chart their own  strategic procurement paths.", "A temporary subcommittee in the meantime is reviewing some  agencywide spending data to identify a few categories of high-dollar  purchase card vendors for use in negotiating discount agreements.  However, a senior procurement policy official told us that a large-scale  strategic approach to buying goods and services may be neither feasible or  advisable, given the agency\u2019s highly diverse missions and decentralized  operations. When it comes to changing the buying culture across the  agency, the agency wants to use spend analysis to create attractively  priced discount agreements with a few vendors that agency purchasers  will be encouraged, not mandated, to use. Although he indicated that  Agriculture may establish a few agencywide commodity councils in the  future to pursue more areas for consolidated buying, he did not anticipate  creating new structure, processes, and roles within the agency.", "Aside from their spend analysis activities, the three agencies have not  consistently created the type of supporting structure, processes, and roles  leading companies institute to foster a more strategic approach to buying  goods and services. While Veterans Affairs has used the best practice of  establishing commodity teams that coordinate buying strategies for  pharmaceutical, prosthetics, and more recently high-cost, high-technology  medical equipment and supply items, the same practice has not been used  to coordinate buying strategies for services. Outside of forming single,  cross-agency working groups to leverage a few categories of supplies  commonly bought by purchase cardholders, Agriculture and HHS have not  fully embraced viewing procurement as an agencywide process for  streamlining acquisitions, saving money, and increasing the quality of  purchased goods and services when compared to the current  decentralized environment of independent, stand-alone contract actions.  Agriculture and HHS have not adopted the best practice of using cross- functional commodity teams to establish a network of technical experts to  support volume and technical leveraging of agency spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["When the government faces enormous fiscal pressures and a growing  budget deficit, agencies\u2019 transformations of their business processes is  more important than ever if the agencies are to get the most from every  dollar spent.

Like leading companies, agencies that establish an effective  spend analysis program can then achieve a total-spending perspective  across the agency; make the business case for collaboration in joint  purchasing rather than fragmented purchasing, create supporting  structure, processes, and roles to assign accountability and exercise  oversight; identify potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in  procurement savings opportunities by leveraging buying power; and  identify opportunities to achieve other procurement process efficiencies  such as reducing duplication in purchasing, supporting small and minority- owned business utilization, and improving supplier performance. In  contrast, agencies such as the departments of Justice and Transportation,  which have yet to make extensive use of spend analysis and may well miss  out on the opportunity to achieve savings to the same extent possible as  other agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the varying spend analysis efforts by Veterans Affairs,  HHS, and Agriculture go further in emulating the best practices of leading  companies and that these agencies have the supporting structure,  processes, and roles in place to effectively use the results of spend  analysis, we are making the following three recommendations:    To identify, track, and evaluate what clinical care and support services are  being purchased by veterans\u2019 medical facilities, the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs should direct procurement headquarters officials to expand the  planned development by 2006 of an automated medical supplies and  equipment spend analysis system also to capture spending data on  services. Such expansion should support automating, extracting,  organizing, supplementing, and analyzing spending trends for clinical care  and support services in the same way that improvements aimed at medical  supplies and equipment are being made. The agency\u2019s new spend analysis  system needs to include healthcare-related services\u2019 procurement data to  improve decision makers\u2019 knowledge and help them identify opportunities  for leveraged buying, including the planned development of a national  strategy to contract for services.", "To address agency leadership\u2019s direction to eliminate redundant  management activities, the Secretary of Health and Human Services  should direct headquarters\u2019 procurement officials to identify additional  steps needed to adopt a more strategic approach to acquiring goods and  services. HHS headquarters\u2019 procurement officials should also be directed  to consider using current financial and procurement management  information systems to extract the type of spending data on an automated  and repeatable basis that the agency needs to identify opportunities to  leverage its buying power, reduce costs, and provide better management  and oversight of key suppliers. Such data would include what categories of  goods and services are being acquired; how many suppliers are being used  for specific categories; and how much HHS is spending on specific  categories, in total and with each supplier. Their assessment should also  address the creation of supporting structures, processes, and roles as  necessary, such as the establishment of cross-functional commodity  teams, to help obtain the necessary buy-ins across the agency\u2019s divisions,  eliminate duplication of effort, and improve the coordination and volume  discounting of high-dollar, high-volume categories of goods, services, and  suppliers on an ongoing basis.", "While waiting until 2006 for the planned agencywide spend analysis  system to come online, the Secretary of Agriculture should assess whether  the agency\u2019s temporary electronic marketplace subcommittee provides  sufficient structure, processes, and roles for analyzing spending trends on  an ongoing basis and supporting a more strategic approach to acquiring  goods and services. Agriculture\u2019s assessment should address expanding  the subcommittee\u2019s current narrow focus on leveraging the agency\u2019s  almost $600 million in purchase card buying power, to also yield discounts  applicable to larger contract actions across the range of goods and  services being acquired and whether the establishment of cross-functional  commodity teams would help obtain the necessary buy-in across the  agency\u2019s diverse mission organizations and improve the coordination and  acquisition of high-dollar, high-volume categories across a wide range of  goods and services.", "In light of the significant potential for savings and performance  improvements that the two agencies not using spend analysis could  achieve, we recommend that the Attorney General of the United States and  the Secretary of Transportation direct officials responsible for  procurement and financial management and other appropriate  stakeholders to step up the process of gaining knowledge of their spending  to take a strategic approach to procurement, adopting the type of best  practices employed by leading companies. Specifically, we are making the  following two recommendations:    Justice and Transportation should assess using current financial or  procurement information systems such as FPDS and purchase card data  on an automated and repeatable basis to extract the type of spending data  that the agencies need to identify opportunities to leverage the agencies\u2019  buying power, reduce costs, and provide better management and oversight  of suppliers. Such data would include what categories of goods and  services are being acquired; how many suppliers are being used for  specific categories; and how much the agency is spending on specific  categories, in total and with each supplier.", "Once an initial spend analysis can be completed to arm the agencies with  the knowledge of such opportunities, Justice and Transportation should  assess whether their current procurement structure, processes, and roles  are adequate to support a more strategic approach to acquiring goods and  services, for example whether cross-functional commodity teams would  provide more effective, coordinated management of high-dollar, high- volume categories of goods, services, and suppliers on an ongoing basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the  Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, and Justice, and we received  oral comments from the Department of Transportation.

Commenting on one of the draft\u2019s statements on the  agency\u2019s use of a consultant\u2019s 2001 spend analysis to obtain more  favorable prices, Agriculture indicated they did not solely rely on the  consultant\u2019s report but needed to perform additional analysis for the  agencywide discount agreements. Further, Agriculture also commented  that many other federal departments, through the use of existing purchase  card data and other available data systems, can discern sufficient  information to begin leveraging their spending to obtain reduced prices for  commonly acquired services and supplies. We agree.", "While the Department of Justice generally agreed with the report\u2019s findings  and recommendations, the agency also clarified the status of spend  analysis efforts.

In addition, this official  informed us that the agency is expanding its spend analysis efforts. For  example, his office recently reviewed purchase card spending data to  identify volume discount opportunities and is now using the results to  negotiate new discount agreements with several office product vendors. In  addition, he told us that to facilitate future agencywide purchase card  spend analyses, Transportation awarded a task order in June 2004 with  one bank-card company that includes purchase-card audit software and  enhanced data-mining capabilities.
