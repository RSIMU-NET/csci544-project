Moreover, differences in the implementation of CPFA requirements by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) contributed to a higher shipping rate for USDA. Following the July 2012 reduction in the minimum percentage of food aid to be carried on U.S.-flag vessels, USAID was able to substantially increase the proportion of food aid awarded to foreign-flag vessels, which on average have lower rates, helping to reduce its average shipping rate. In contrast, USDA was able to increase the proportion of food aid awarded to foreign-flag vessels by only a relatively small amount because it is compelled by a court order to meet the minimum percentage of food aid carried on U.S.-flag vessels by individual country, a more narrow interpretation of the geographic area requirement than what USAID applies.

While CPFA has ensured that a portion of U.S.-flag vessels carry some food aid cargo, the number of vessels carrying food aid and U.S. mariners required to crew them has declined. The available pool of sealift capacity has always met all of the Department of Defense's (DOD) requirements, without the full activation of the reserve sealift fleet. DOD's most serious scenario would require a full and prolonged\u2014a period longer than 6 months\u2014activation of the reserve sealift fleet as well as the use of commercial vessels. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) estimated that 3,886 mariners would be needed to crew the reserve surge fleet and 9,148 mariners to crew commercial vessels. MARAD estimated that at least 1,378 additional mariners would be needed to satisfy a full and prolonged activation, including the crewing of commercial vessels.

Under U.S. law, a minimum share of U.S. food aid must be shipped on  U.S.-flag vessels. For the purposes of the report, we refer to that  requirement as cargo preference for food aid (CPFA). The percentage  requirement of CPFA has fluctuated since 1954, from the original 50  percent to 75 percent in 1985, and back to 50 percent in 2012. The U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department  of Agriculture (USDA) administer food aid programs; the cost of  transporting food aid comes from the funding for these programs. The  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Maritime Administration (MARAD)  is responsible for monitoring USAID\u2019s and USDA\u2019s adherence to CPFA.

We also interviewed USAID, USDA, and MARAD officials about each  agency\u2019s roles and responsibilities regarding CPFA, the processes each  agency uses to implement CPFA and to ensure and monitor compliance  with the requirements, the cost implications of the requirements on food  aid programs, and the impact of the requirements on cargo preference  objectives. To determine the CPFA requirements\u2019 impact on food aid  shipping cost, we analyzed food aid procurement data for both USAID  and USDA from April 2011 through fiscal year 2014, including some bulk  food commodities and all packaged food commodities and shipment data  for fiscal years 2011 through 2014. During this time period, CPFA  requirement levels changed from 75 to 50 percent. We examined the  number of total U.S.-flag and foreign-flag bids per solicitation. We used  regression analysis to identify the impact of the changes in the CPFA  requirements. To examine the extent to which the implementation of  CPFA requirements contributes to sufficient sealift capacity, we  interviewed DOD officials about the sealift capability and military  usefulness of the vessels in the U.S.-flag fleet. We also analyzed  MARAD\u2019s data on U.S.-flag vessels, including those carrying food aid  cargo and the number of mariner positions aboard such vessels.  Furthermore, we obtained data from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) on the  number of mariners potentially qualified to provide sealift during times of  war or national emergencies. We found the data on U.S.-flag vessels,  mariner positions supported by CPFA, and mariners that crewed the  Ready Reserve Force from 2002 to 2015 sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.  We also interviewed MARAD officials to  understand the crewing process for the reserve sealift fleet. MARAD  officials described the data they used and factors they considered to  estimate the number of positions needed for a full, prolonged operation of  the reserve surge fleet and all commercial vessels and the number of  available mariners. However, we were not able to assess the accuracy of  these estimates because MARAD was unable to provide us with the  details about them. To obtain stakeholder views on options to improve the  sustainability of the oceangoing U.S.-flag fleet, we conducted  semistructured interviews and requested follow-up documentation from a  nongeneralizable sample of 29 stakeholders knowledgeable about CPFA  issues, selected based on, among other factors, how often others  suggested we meet with them and their location. We categorized these  stakeholders into (1) maritime industry stakeholders, which are those  stakeholders that we interviewed that self-identified as brokers, carriers,  freight forwarders, and mariners, and (2) other maritime stakeholders,  which are those stakeholders that we interviewed that self-identified as  academia, commodities, freight forwarders, implementing partners or  nongovernmental organizations (NGO), ports, and trade associations.  The intent of our semistructured interviews was to identify options to  improve the sustainability of the oceangoing U.S.-flag fleet, including food  aid-carrying U.S.-flag vessels. We did not specifically ask stakeholders to  consider the effect that options may have on food aid. Twenty of the 29  stakeholders we interviewed responded to our follow-up request.  Eighteen of these stakeholders (7 maritime industry stakeholders and 11  other maritime stakeholders) selected what they believe to be the top  three options from among those suggested and provided comments on a  variety of the options, while the other 2 stakeholders (both other maritime  stakeholders) responded that they would not provide their views because  they did not favor any of the options.

From April 2011 through fiscal year 2014,  we found that U.S.-flag vessels charged $61 ton more than foreign flag  vessels for packaged food aid and $55 per metric ton more for bulk food  aid. After the CPFA requirement change, foreign-flag vessels participated  more in the food aid solicitation. Our estimates using statistical modeling to  control for various factors show that the number of bids received for each  solicitation increased by three after the 2012 change in the CPFA  requirements and that all of the increase was from the increase in bids  from foreign-flag vessels. According to USAID officials, after the CPFA  requirement change, they have received more foreign-flag bids for some  routes previously dominated by U.S.-flag vessels. Results from our  regression model also indicates that the shipping rate on foreign-flag  vessels decreased by 9 percent for USAID and 7 percent for USDA since  the CPFA requirement change in 2012. USAID was able to award more  food aid shipments to lower-priced foreign-flag vessels, which led to a  statistically significant decrease in its overall shipping rates.

MARAD officials explained that the majority of mariners  hold permanent positions aboard a given commercial vessel and  volunteering for prolonged employment aboard the reserve sealift  fleet would, in most cases, mean that they would forfeit their  permanent positions. The mariners would then have to compete  for a new commercial position once they finished their time in the  reserve sealift fleet, a contingency that would likely decrease their  likelihood of volunteering. MARAD developed the Mariner  Outreach System (MOS) to monitor, among other things, U.S.  mariners\u2019 willingness to crew the reserve sealift fleet.

According to USDA officials, eliminating the waiting period could  also help to improve the sustainability of the oceangoing U.S.-flag  fleet because vessels that have transitioned from foreign to U.S.- flag may be younger and in better condition than some U.S.-flag  vessels currently participating in the food aid shipments.

How well  USAID and USDA can achieve food aid programs\u2019 goals depends on the  effective and efficient use of food aid resources. The elimination of  reimbursements to USAID and USDA, which the agencies used to fund  food aid programs, further accentuates the importance of effectively using  their limited food aid resources for the programs\u2019 goals. Under U.S. law, a  minimum proportion of U.S. food aid must be shipped on U.S.-flag  vessels to promote both national security and commercial interests.  However, because using U.S.-flag vessels is often more expensive than  using foreign-flag vessels, a larger portion of the food aid budget must go  to shipping costs than if there were no such requirement. Changes in the  law in 2012 reduced the U.S.-flag minimum requirement for food  assistance from 75 to 50 percent, decreasing the overall shipping cost of  food aid, especially for programs administered by USAID. However,  USDA has experienced limited savings, because the agency is subject to  a court order requiring it to administer cargo preference on a country-by- country basis; USDA\u2019s utilization of foreign-flag vessels was far below the  50 percent allowed by the 2012 law. GAO has twice recommended that  key agencies administering CPFA agree on a consistent interpretation of  CPFA requirements through an MOU, but the agencies have only  addressed the definition of vessel categories and not the definition of  \u201cgeographic area.\u201d As USDA continues to use a more stringent definition  of geographic area when implementing CPFA, it is not able to take  advantage of the shipping price decreases that USAID utilizes. Pursuant  to the terms of the court order requiring USDA to comply with CPFA on a  country-by-country basis, an MOU embodying an agreement between  USDA and MARAD on a consistent definition of \u201cgeographic area\u201d would  allow USDA to administer CPFA using a method other than country-by- country.", "CPFA ensures that U.S.-flag vessels carry a portion of food aid, but the  extent to which CPFA contributes to sufficient sealift capabilities for DOD  is unclear. While DOD officials noted that the number of U.S.-flag vessels  is sufficient for contingency needs including a full and prolonged  activation of the reserve fleet, it is unclear whether there are enough  mariners available to fulfill this scenario, particularly in senior officer  positions. MARAD has estimated that there is a shortage of qualified  mariners available to address a full and prolonged activation of the  reserve fleet. However, its estimate does not fully account for all of the  potential sources of supply, including reserve naval officers. Without a full  understanding of both the need for and potential available supply of  mariners under DOD\u2019s most serious scenario, the U.S. government is  limited in its capacity to address any potential imbalance.

We also interviewed USAID, USDA,  and MARAD officials about each agency\u2019s role and responsibilities  regarding CPFA, the processes each agency uses to implement CPFA,  the cost implications of such requirements on food aid programs, and the  impact of such requirements on cargo preference objectives.", "To determine the CPFA requirements\u2019 impact on food aid shipping cost,  we analyzed food aid procurement data for both USAID and USDA from  April 2011 through fiscal year 2014, including some bulk food  commodities and all packaged food commodities and shipment data for  April 2011 through fiscal year 2014. With the exception of the detailed  discussion in appendix II, we use the term \u201csolicitation\u201d to mean  solicitation line. Each agency announces solicitations for bids to ship food  aid. Each solicitation includes a line for a specific amount of a specific  commodity to be procured for a specific food aid program. For example, a  recent solicitation for USAID freight included one line for 51,710 metric  tons of sorghum for the World Food Program\u2019s food aid program in  Sudan. During this time period, CPFA requirement levels changed from  75 to 50 percent. We examined the number of total U.S.-flag and foreign- flag bids per solicitation. We analyzed USDA and USAID bid data to  estimate the cost difference between U.S.- and foreign-flag vessels and  the CPFA requirements\u2019 effect on shipping awards. We used regression  analysis to identify the impact of the changes in the CPFA requirements  on the cost of shipping U.S. food aid. For detailed discussion of our  methodology and results, see Appendix II.", "To examine the extent to which the implementation of CPFA  requirements contributes to sufficient sealift capacity, we reviewed the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) documentation related to the Voluntary  Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) and the Maritime Security Program  (MSP) and interviewed DOD officials about the sealift capability and  military usefulness of the vessels in the U.S.-flag fleet. We also analyzed  MARAD\u2019s data on U.S.-flag vessels, including those carrying food aid  cargo and the number of mariner positions aboard such vessels. We  interviewed MARAD officials to understand the reliability of the data  provided. According to MARAD officials, MARAD receives information  directly from operating companies related to vessel specifications, as well  as crewing requirements. Such information is stored in the Mariner  Outreach System (MOS). Information stored in MOS was used to provide  vessel crewing information for commercial and reserve sealift vessels.  Further, MARAD officials used the Cargo Preferences Overview System,  which records bills of lading, to identify those vessels carrying food aid  cargo. We found the U.S.-flag vessel and mariner positions data  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Furthermore, we  obtained U.S. merchant mariner credential data available through the  U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s (USCG) Merchant Mariner Licensing and  Documentation System and interviewed USCG officials to understand the  number of U.S. mariners with Standards of Training, Certification and  Watchkeeping (STCW) and unlimited tonnage/horsepower  endorsements. The Merchant Mariner Licensing and Documentation  System stores information on merchant mariners\u2019 credentials and  endorsements. We found overall credential and endorsement information  to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also obtained  data on the number of actively sailing mariners from USCG. The data  received represents mariners with STCW and unlimited  tonnage/horsepower endorsements for which USCG obtained discharge  certificates during the last 18 months. However, according to officials we  interviewed it likely underrepresents the number of mariners that sailed  during this period because discharge certificates may not have been  received for all mariners that have sailed. Further, USCG indicated that  while it had checks in place to avoid double counting of mariners that filed  multiple discharge certificates during this period, there was also a  possibility of some double counting of the mariners that sailed more than  once during this time period. We are presenting this number, with its  limitations, to help place MARAD\u2019s estimate of the number of available  mariners into some context. We also interviewed MARAD officials to  understand the crewing process for the Reserve Sealift Fleet and the  number of U.S. mariners available to support DOD needs in time of  national emergency. MARAD officials provided an estimate of the number  of available mariners. MARAD officials told us that they estimated the  number of mariners needed to ensure that the entire Reserve Sealift Fleet  was able to conduct prolonged operations while full commercial  operations continued by calculating the number of positions on each  vessel, and comparing this sum with the estimate of available mariners.  During the course of our review, MARAD provided the estimated number  of mariners needed as 12,658. In commenting on our draft report,  however, DOT noted that the estimated number was instead 13,034.  However, these estimates, as well as the estimates of the number of the  available mariners, are of undetermined reliability because we were only  partially able to assess them. While MARAD officials outlined the data  sources and key factors they considered when making these estimates,  they reported that they did not have a final report that documented and  presented precise calculations and methods that they used, and we were  therefore unable to examine the details of their estimates. We determined  that while we could comment on MARAD\u2019s stated rationale and basic  approach to estimating the sufficiency of the number of mariners, we  could not assess the accuracy of MARAD\u2019s estimates on the number of  mariners available or the number of mariners required.

We then added more  stakeholders based on interviewee responses to our question on whom  else they thought we should speak with, considering, among other  factors, how often others suggested we meet with them, the  representation of their subcategory, and their location. For example, we  conducted site visits at ports that we selected based on their ranking  compared with that of other ports in terms of net commodity weight  (metric tons) of food aid as well as the presence of stakeholders in the  area.

Eighteen of these stakeholders (7 maritime  industry stakeholders and 11 other maritime stakeholders) selected what  they believe to be the top 3 options from among those suggested and  provided comments on a variety of the options, while 2 of these  stakeholders (both other maritime stakeholders) responded that they  would not provide their views because they did not favor any of the  options.

The act also eliminated the Maritime  Administration\u2019s reimbursement to the U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for  the ocean freight differential resulting from the CPFA requirements.", "Because the CPFA requirements require that a certain percentage of U.S.  food aid be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels, some foreign-flag carriers may  have been deterred from bidding on some solicitations knowing that they  would be unlikely to win the shipping award. This would be the case,  especially when 25 percent of Title II packaged food aid tonnage was  allocated to Great Lakes ports. According to a 2010 study, food aid  shipped through Great Lakes ports was mostly shipped on lower-priced  foreign-flag vessels because the portion allocated to the Great Lakes  ports was made without consideration of the vessel\u2019s flag as mandated by  Section 17 of the Maritime Security Act of 1995. Most of the remaining  75 percent of Title II packaged food aid would then be required to be  shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. The lower percentage required to be  shipped on U.S.-flag vessels may encourage foreign-flag carriers to  participate in the bidding process, especially for certain routes for which  they did not previously participate. In addition, more competition and  higher participation from foreign-flag carriers after the CPFA change may  lead to lower overall shipping rates because foreign-flag vessels on  average charge lower shipping rates.

We found few  differences in the implementing partner and the type of commodity before  and after the changes.", "However, we did find differences in the destination and the month of the  solicitation line. For example, the percentage of solicitation lines destined  for Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, decreased from 8 to 3 percent of solicitation  lines after the changes in the CPFA requirements. The differences in  these characteristics before and after the change emphasized the  importance of controlling for these characteristics when comparing the  number of bids before and after the changes. In our example of Port-Au- Prince, a solicitation line with food aid destined there was correlated with  a higher number of bids. And since the percentage of solicitation lines  destined there decreased after the change, the number of bids may have  decreased due to this.

The increase in the number of bids from  U.S.-flag vessels was not statistically significant. We also found that the  number of foreign-flag vessels and foreign-flag carriers bidding for each  solicitation line increased by 1.58 vessels and 1.22 carriers. We found  that the number of U.S.-flag vessels and carriers bidding decreased by  0.26 vessels and 0.60 carriers. This suggests that some of the increase in  the number of foreign-flag bids may be from more carriers and vessels  participating. The results from the OLS regressions are robust to the  inclusion of different sets of control variables. We do not control for a  dummy for whether the solicitation line was for bulk or packaged food aid  and for the type of commodity because controlling for them did not  significantly improve the explanatory power of the model.", "Potential limitations and sensitivity analysis. The main limitation with our  methodology is that we cannot control for all factors that may affect the  number of bids from U.S.-flag and foreign-flag vessels. For example, the  number of U.S.-flag vessels available to ship food aid declined during our  study period from April 2011 through fiscal year 2014. However, we did  not include data on the trends in the vessels in our analysis. So even  though the changes of the CPFA requirements may have increased the  number of bids from U.S.-flag vessels, the decline in the number of U.S.- flag vessels may have decreased the number of bids, thereby nullifying  any increases from the changes in the CPFA requirements. Since the  number of U.S.-flag vessels available for food aid was not included in our  analysis, we may have erroneously found that the changes did not  change the number of bids from U.S.-flag vessels.", "Figure 11 adds validity to our methodology in identifying the effect  of the changes of the CPFA requirements on the number of bids  from foreign-flag vessels. We estimated 39 OLS regressions, 1 for  each month between May 2011 and July 2014, as the dummy  variable so we could test for a break point. For each month, we  created a dummy variable set to 0 for any solicitation line before  that month and to 1 for any solicitation line after that month. We  estimated 39 separate OLS regressions with each regression  controlling for 1 month dummy variable in addition to the tonnage,  implementing partner, and destination of the food aid, and the  month the first bid was submitted for the solicitation line.

We found that the largest coefficient is  for July 2012, the month of the changes in the CPFA  requirements. These results show that the largest increase in the  number of bids from foreign-flag vessels occurred in July 2012,  the month of the CPFA changes. This suggests that the changes  in the CPFA requirements had a larger effect on the number of  bids from foreign-flag vessels than any other changes that may  have happened between from April 2011 through fiscal year 2014.", "We estimated the OLS regression models using data from 6  months before and after the changes; we found even larger and  statistically significant increases in the number of bids, especially  from foreign-flag vessels.

We found that the average overall shipping rates  declined slightly from $258 per metric ton to $252 per metric ton after the  changes (see table 6). For U.S.-flag vessels, the average shipping rates  increased from $290 to $309 per metric ton after the changes. The  average shipping rates remained unchanged after the changes for  foreign-flag vessels.", "We also compared the characteristics of the solicitations lines before and  after the changes in the CPFA requirements. These characteristics  included the composition of the food aid by the type of commodities,  agency, the month of the solicitation line, the implementing partner, and  the destination. We found few differences in the implementing partner and  the type of commodity before and after the changes. However, we did find  differences in the destination and the month of the solicitation line. These  results are consistent with those from the data on bids since the data on  awards is a subset of the data on bids and represents 72 percent of the  solicitation lines in the data on bids.", "Regression model and results. To compare the shipping rates for each  solicitation line before and after the changes in the CPFA requirements,  we estimated OLS regressions using the following equation.", "We estimated this equation for solicitation line i where Change is a  dummy for before and after the CPFA changes; X is a set of solicitation  line characteristics including the tonnage, implementing partner, and  destination of the food aid, and the month the first bid was submitted for  the solicitation line; and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is the error term. y is the natural logarithm of  the shipping rate for each solicitation line i.", "Using this model, we found that the overall shipping rate decreased by  around 6 percent (see table 7). We also found that the shipping rates on  foreign-flag vessels decreased by around 8 percent. The shipping rates  on U.S.-flag vessels did not change. The results from the OLS  regressions are robust to the inclusion of different sets of control  variables. The estimates range from a decrease of around 6 percent to a  decrease of around 8 percent. We do not control for a dummy for whether  the solicitation line was for bulk or packaged food aid and for the type of  commodity because controlling for them do not increase the adjusted R  squared by much.", "Compared with USDA, USAID is more flexible in applying the CPFA  requirements. The percentage of food aid shipped on U.S.-flag vessels  declined much more for USAID than for USDA after the changes in the  CPFA requirements. Consistent with this difference between agencies,  the shipping rates for USAID decreased, while those for USDA did not  (see table 8). The overall shipping rate decreased by around 9 percent  for USAID, likely because of the increased use of foreign-flag vessels  after the change and the 9 percent decrease in the shipping rates on  those foreign-flag vessels. The shipping rate on U.S.-flag vessels  increased by around 5 percent for USAID. For USDA, the overall  shipping rate and the shipping rate on U.S.-flag vessels were unchanged,  while the shipping rate on foreign-flag vessels decreased by around 7  percent.", "Potential limitations and sensitivity analysis. The main limitation with our  methodology is that we cannot control for all factors that may affect  shipping rates. For example, the overall commercial shipping rates could  have declined during the period of our data from April 2011 through fiscal  year 2014. Some of the decrease in shipping rates could have been due  to other factors that cause the overall decline instead of the changes in  the CPFA requirements. While we did not obtain data on commercial  shipping rates, we found two results that may ameliorate this limitation.", "Figure 12 adds validity to our methodology in identifying the effect  of the changes of the CPFA requirements on USAID\u2019s shipping  rates. We estimated 39 OLS regressions, 1 with each month  between May 2011 and July 2014 as a dummy variable. For each  month, we created a dummy variable set to 0 for any solicitation  line before that month and to 1 for any solicitation line after that  month. We estimated 39 separate OLS regressions with each  regression controlling for 1 month dummy variable in addition to  the tonnage, implementing partner, and destination of the food  aid, and the month the first bid was submitted for the solicitation  line. Figure 12 shows the coefficient and the 99 percent  confidence interval around the coefficient on the month dummy  variable from each of the 39 OLS regressions. We found that the  smallest coefficients are for July and August 2012. These results  show that the largest decline in USAID\u2019s shipping rates occurred  in July 2012, the month of the CPFA changes. This suggests that  the changes in the CPFA requirements had the larger effect on  USAID\u2019s shipping rates than any other changes that may have  happened between from April 2011 through fiscal year 2014.", "When we estimated the OLS regression models only for the  period 6 months before and after the changes, we found even  larger and statistically significant decreases in the shipping rates  on foreign-flag vessels. For this shorter period, there was likely to  have been less change in other factors such as overall  commercial shipping rates. For USDA, the decrease in the overall  shipping rate became larger and statistically significant, likely  because of the large decrease in the shipping rates on foreign-flag  vessels. However, for USAID, the decrease in the overall shipping  rate was not statistically significant, likely because of the larger  standard errors.
