For example, IICA's strategic goals of a productive agricultural sector, enhancing agricultural development, and food security are aligned with USDA's foreign assistance goals. State, USAID, HHS, and USDA fund activities in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements) with OAS, PAHO, and IICA, which in 2016 totaled $32 million.

In this report, we (1) assess the extent to which the  organizations\u2019 strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2)  examine how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the  extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assess  the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as  part of their assistance agreements; and (4) assess the extent to which  U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those  called for by these provisions.", "To address the first objective, we gathered documentation and  interviewed officials from the four U.S. agencies and the four  organizations to determine the U.S. strategic goals for foreign assistance  to the Western Hemisphere and the goals of the four organizations.  According to Department of State (State) and U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) officials, the strategic document that  underpins their foreign assistance priorities for the region is The  Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs\u2019 and  USAID\u2019s Bureau for Latin American and Caribbean Affairs\u2019 Joint Regional  Strategy. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials said  that HHS\u2019s relevant strategic document is The Global Strategy of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services. U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) strategic goals for foreign assistance, according to  officials, are outlined in the United States Department of Agriculture  Strategic Plan FY2015\u20132018. The OAS outlined its strategic goals in the  Comprehensive Strategic Plan of the Organization, adopted on October  31, 2016. PAHO\u2019s goals are laid out in Strategic Plan of the Pan  American Health Organization 2014\u20132019. IICA\u2019s strategic document is  the IICA 2010\u20132020 Strategic Plan, which took effect in October 2010.  PAIGH\u2019s strategic document is the Declaration and Guide for the Pan  American Agenda 2010-2020. We compared the strategic goals  articulated by the four organizations against U.S. strategic goals to  assess the extent to which the organizations\u2019 goals contribute to U.S.  interests in the region. We then interviewed officials from the four  agencies and reviewed relevant documentation on efforts they undertake  to ensure that U.S.-funded activities align with U.S. strategic goals.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed documentation of the  organizations\u2019 internal control mechanisms and confirmed our findings  with the organizations. We identified mechanisms to include policies,  directives, rules, practices, and organizational structures that can have an  oversight role in the use of the organizations\u2019 funds. We also interviewed  officials from State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to discuss their support of  these mechanisms.", "To address the third objective, we identified 60 active assistance  agreements that these agencies oversaw with OAS, PAHO, and IICA  during calendar years 2014 through 2016 and selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 12 agreements, three each from State,  USAID, HHS, and USDA. To determine which agreements we would  review for each agency, we selected the three agreements with the  lowest, median, and highest dollar value. If any of an agency\u2019s  agreements supported the same country or activity or were for one-time  projects such as seminars, we selected the next appropriate agreement  based on dollar value.", "For these selected agreements, we then identified the applicable agency  guidance for monitoring activities in the agreements, which we define as  all documents related to each agreement provided to us by the agencies,  such as monitoring reports. The number of key monitoring provisions  varied\u2014even within each agency\u2014depending on when agency guidance  was issued and updated relative to when the agreements were approved.  USDA did not have applicable internal agency-specific guidance for  monitoring of assistance agreements at the time it awarded the  agreements we reviewed; thus, with USDA\u2019s input, we used the  applicable sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, which together  have five key monitoring provisions for agreements. However, USDA  approved two of the agreements in 2012 and the third agreement in 2016,  and this third agreement was subject to an amended version of the Code  of Federal Regulations, which added an additional provision for  performance goals. State\u2019s four applicable grants policy directives have seven key monitoring provisions for agreements that were applicable at  the time the agreements we reviewed were approved. USAID\u2019s Standard  Provisions for Cost-Type Awards to Public International Organizations  (PIOs): A Mandatory Reference to ADS Chapter 308 has two key  monitoring provisions for agreements: audits and records, and the  organization\u2019s adherence to their rules. HHS\u2019s grants policy has five key  monitoring provisions for grant documentation.", "We identified key monitoring provisions for agencies to include as part of  agreements to ensure oversight of the use of funds, such as financial and  progress reports. For the 12 agreements in our sample, we analyzed the  assistance agreements from the four agencies, and then determined the  extent to which the agencies\u2019 agreements included key monitoring  provisions implementing monitoring activities called for by applicable  agency guidance. We did not include subsequent amendments to these  12 agreements in our review of key monitoring provisions. We interviewed  officials from State, USAID, HHS, and USDA (1) to confirm we were  applying the appropriate federal or agency guidance and (2) to discuss  instances in which the agreements did not include key monitoring  provisions.", "To address the fourth objective, we reviewed the 12 selected assistance  agreements and guidance to identify specific required monitoring  activities, such as financial and program reports, site visits, and other  forms of oversight. The agreements specify the requirements for these  activities such as requiring financial reports on a quarterly basis. For  these 12 agreements, we reviewed all the documentation provided to us  by the agencies, then determined the extent to which the agencies had  full documentation of key monitoring activities as specified in the  assistance agreements, including those called for by key monitoring  provisions, as well as those called for by guidance when the monitoring  provisions were absent. We did not include subsequent amendments to  these 12 agreements in our review of monitoring activities. We  interviewed officials from State, USAID, HHS, and USDA to discuss  instances in which the agency did not have full documentation of key  monitoring activities. We also discussed how State, USAID, and HHS  agency officials manage their agreement documentation and use the  information in the agreements\u2019 required monitoring documentation.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to December 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Financial Oversight Mechanisms of Four Inter-American Organizations", "paragraphs": ["The Organization of American States (OAS), Pan American Health  Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on  Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute on Geography and  History (PAIGH) have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of  funds.

We identified key monitoring provisions implementing the  applicable agency guidance for State, USAID, HHS, and the applicable  regulations for USDA, as shown in table 19. For both the agency  guidance and the federal regulations, those listed are the ones that were  in effect when the agreements in our sample were approved.
