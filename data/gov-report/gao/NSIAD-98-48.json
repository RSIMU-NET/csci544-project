DSB, a civilian advisory board to DOD, issued two reports in 1996 addressing outsourcing and other opportunities for substantially reducing DOD support services. The first focused solely on outsourcing and privatization issues. The second, incorporating findings from the earlier report, had a broader scope that included other methods for reducing infrastructure costs. In preparation for the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), OSD\u2019s Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) directorate assessed the DSB\u2019s savings estimates from the second report.

The Board also noted that an Outsourcing Institute study found that the private sector saved about 10 to 15 percent by outsourcing but that the public sector savings from outsourcing would be higher because of the inefficiency of government service organizations. The DSB task force stated that an aggressive DOD outsourcing initiative could generate savings ranging from $7 billion to $12 billion annually by fiscal year 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Second Study", "paragraphs": ["Building on the earlier study, DSB\u2019s second task force report provided a new vision wherein DOD would only provide warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy- and decision-making, and oversight activities. All other activities would be done by the private sector. DSB said that DOD would need to make an investment of about $6 billion but would ultimately save about $30 billion annually by the year 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions.", "Of these $30 billion in annual savings, $6 billion was to come from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities, which DSB defined as including inventory control points, distribution depots, maintenance depots, and installation supply and repair. About $4.2 billion of the savings would be achieved by outsourcing these activities; the remaining $1.8-billion savings would be achieved through improvements in inventory management practices and equipment reliability. Table 1 shows a breakout of the estimated logistics infrastructure savings.", "According to the DSB estimates, the $6-billion savings represents an approximate 40-percent reduction in the $14 billion the Board estimated DOD spends annually for CONUS logistics activities. According to a DSB task force member, estimates for the cost of installation supply and repair activities were unavailable. Therefore, the group used $14 billion as a rough estimate to approximate total CONUS logistics cost, not including activities already contracted out. Although we were unable to substantiate those numbers, the data that is available indicates that DSB\u2019s estimate of $14 billion for CONUS logistics costs is conservative. For example, the Navy has reported that more than $8.5 billion of Navy resources was applied in fiscal year 1996 to maintenance programs in support of fleet ships and aircraft.", "The report also stated that to gain economies and achieve significant savings, DOD needs to consider dramatic changes in the way it does business. DSB said the Department must get out of the material management/distribution and repair business by expanding contractor logistics support to all fielded weapon systems and by expanding the use of \u201cprime vendors\u201d for all commodities. Contractor logistics support, which relies on a contractor to provide long-term, total life-cycle logistics support, combines depot-level maintenance with wholesale and selected retail material management functions. Under the \u201cprime vendor\u201d concept, DOD would rely on a single vendor to buy, warehouse, and distribute inventory to the customer as needed, thus removing the Defense Logistics Agency and the services from their present middleman role."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist for Logistics Infrastructure Savings", "paragraphs": ["Our reviews of best practices within the private sector and ongoing work at DOD indicate that DOD has significant opportunities for reducing logistics costs and improving performance by changing its business processes.

These findings are consistent with the general theme of the DSB\u2019s reports that opportunities exist for savings in the operation of DOD\u2019s logistics support activities. However, DSB focused on outsourcing, while our work has focused first on reengineering and streamlining, and outsourcing where appropriate and more cost-effective."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Can Reduce Logistics Costs", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, DOD has considered a number of actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its logistics system. As with the private sector, such actions should include using highly accurate information systems, consolidating certain activities, employing various process streamlining methods, and outsourcing. For example, defense maintenance depots have about 40-percent excess capacity, and we have advocated consolidating workloads to take advantage of economies of scale and eliminate unnecessary duplication. Consolidating workloads from two closing depots would allow the Air Force, for instance, to achieve annual savings of over $200 million and reduce its excess capacity from 45 percent to about 8 percent.", "In addition, our work has pointed out the benefits of outsourcing when careful economic analysis indicates the private sector can provide required support at less cost than a DOD activity can. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency has successfully taken steps to use prime vendors to supply personnel items directly to military facilities. The consumable items under these vendor programs account for 2 percent of the consumable items DOD manages. DOD\u2019s prime vendor program for medical supplies, along with other inventory reduction efforts, has resulted in savings that we estimate exceed $700 million. More importantly, this program has moved DOD out of the inventory storage and distribution function for these supplies, thus emptying warehouses, eliminating unnecessary layers of inventory, and reducing the overall size of the DOD supply system. Also, service is improved because DOD buys only the items that are currently needed and consumers can order and receive inventory within hours of the time the items are used.", "While DOD has achieved benefits from outsourcing, it has been shown that adequate competition has been key to achieving significant reductions. Public-private competition studies by CNA have stressed this point. In its 1993 review of the Navy\u2019s Commercial Activities Program, CNA noted that about half the competitions were won by the in-house team and that when competitions with no savings were excluded, the savings from contracts awarded to the public sector were 50 percent and those to the private sector were 40 percent. CNA officials concluded that because of competition both sectors were spurred to increase efficiency and reduce costs and DOD achieved greater savings. CNA also concluded that savings would have been less had the public sector been excluded from competition. Likewise, our review of DOD\u2019s public-private competition program for depot maintenance determined that such competitions resulted in reduced costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector Closely Analyzes Outsourcing Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Facing increasing pressures to maintain market competitiveness, private companies have been reevaluating their organization and processes to cut costs and improve customer service.

For example, Southwest Airlines contracts out almost all maintenance, thus avoiding costly investments in facilities, personnel, and inventory. However, in contrast, having already made a significant investment in building infrastructure and training personnel, British Airways reached a different decision about its support operations. While it has sold off and/or outsourced some activities (namely engine repair and parts supply) and improved remaining in-house repair operations, the airline now has become a third-party supplier of aircraft overhaul.", "Whether the organization decides to consolidate, reengineer, or outsource activities, or to do some combination thereof, the private firms and consultants with whom we met stressed that identifying and understanding the organization\u2019s core activities and obtaining accurate cost data for all in-house operations are critical to making informed business decisions and assessing overall performance. Core activities are those that are essential for meeting an organization\u2019s mission.", "Before making decisions on what cost-saving options should be used, an organization should develop a performance-based, risk-adjusted analysis of benefits and costs for each option to provide (1) the foundation for comparing the baseline benefits and costs with proposed options and (2) a basis for decisionmakers to use in selecting a feasible option that meets performance goals. The organization should also factor into the analysis the barriers and risks in implementing the options.

The Board\u2019s estimate of $1.5 billion in annual savings by year 2002 (6 years from the year of DSB\u2019s study) is overstated by at least $1.2 billion. DSB based its estimate on a Logistics Management Institute (LMI) study that assessed the reductions of operation and support costs that result from improved reliability and maintainability due to technological advancements. Such advancements may include using improved materials and fewer component parts; thus reducing the number of spare purchases and the need for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Accomplishing these advancements requires an investment that must be evaluated in light of the expected return on investment.", "For its study, LMI assumed an aggressive technology improvement program. For example, it assumed a 9 to 1 return on investment that would accrue over 20 years, with savings starting the second year. Further, it assumed that any given investment would generate a savings stream for at least 10 years. Based on these assumptions and its analysis, LMI concluded that with an annual investment starting at $100 million and leveling at $500 million within 5 years, DOD could achieve $300 million in savings in the sixth year. DOD would not achieve the $1.5-billion savings that DSB included in its savings estimate until the fourteenth year.

The Board based this projection on public-private competition studies, industry studies by such companies as Caterpillar and Boeing, and anecdotal evidence.

The studies DSB cited were primarily for commercial activities\u2014such as base operations, real property maintenance, and food service. As we have reported, these activities generally have highly competitive markets. For some logistics activities, such as nonship depot maintenance, our recent work has shown that competitive markets do not currently exist. To the extent that competitive markets do not exist, the amount of savings that can be generated through outsourcing may be reduced.", "As we reported in 1996, 76 percent of the 240 open depot maintenance contracts we examined were awarded noncompetitively (i.e., sole source). More recently, we reported that the percentage of noncompetitive depot maintenance contracts had increased for activities other than shipyards. For the three services, about 91 percent of the 15,346 new depot maintenance contracts awarded from the beginning of fiscal year 1996 to date were sole source. Moreover, the DSB recommended contractor logistics support arrangements for new and modified weapon systems.

For example, proponents of increased privatization have questioned the justification for retaining many support activities as core and have recommended revising the core logistics requirement. Section 311 of the 1996 DOD Authorization Act directed the Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive depot maintenance policy, including a definition of DOD\u2019s required core depot maintenance capability. While DOD has identified a process for determining core depot maintenance capability requirements, it has not completed its evaluation. Moreover, DOD has not developed a process for identifying core requirements for other logistics functions and activities. Thus, core requirements in these areas are also unknown. The 1998 DOD Authorization Act again requires that the Department identify its core depot maintenance requirements, this time under the new provisions described above.", "Additionally, 10 U.S.C. 2466 states that no more than 50 percent of the depot maintenance funds made available in a given fiscal year may be spent for depot maintenance conducted by nonfederal personnel.
