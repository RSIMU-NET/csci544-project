As we reported in our February 1997 high-risk series report, Medicare, because of its size and mission, is an attractive target for exploitation and is inherently vulnerable to fraud and abuse.This vulnerability was also highlighted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) recent estimate that in 1997 11 percent, or $20 billion, of Medicare fee-for-service payments were inappropriate.", "With the August 21, 1996, enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Congress provided important new resources and tools to fight health care fraud, abuse, and inappropriate payments. These new resources include increased funding for anti-fraud-and-abuse activities for the HHS OIG and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), as well as for the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. HIPAA also established the Medicare Integrity Program, which ensures increasing funding for HCFA\u2019s Medicare program safeguard efforts and authorizes the hiring of specialized anti-fraud contractors.", "The Congress also mandated that we periodically report on such aspects of the Medicare Trust Fund as the Comptroller General considers appropriate. Although HIPAA required us to report beginning on January 1, 2000, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 advanced the initial reporting date to June 1, 1998. To address this requirement, we have assessed HCFA\u2019s progress in implementing the Medicare Integrity Program. Specifically, we are providing information on (1) what additional resources and authorities the Congress provided to HCFA through the Medicare Integrity Program, (2) how HCFA has made use of these resources and authorities to improve the protection of Medicare funds, and (3) how HCFA plans to use these authorities and resources in the future.", "To develop our information, we reviewed budget and expenditure data for program safeguard activities for fiscal years 1994 through 1998. We also discussed with HCFA headquarters and regional officials as well as officials of two Medicare contractors how Medicare Integrity Program funding was being used. In addition, we reviewed relevant HCFA and contractor documents, including HCFA\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget and performance requirements, the draft statement of work for program safeguard contracts, and HCFA\u2019s Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 performance plan. We conducted our work at HCFA headquarters; HCFA\u2019s region V and region VI offices; Adminastar Federal Inc.; and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, Inc.

Physicians, hospitals, and other providers submit claims to Medicare to receive payment for services they have provided to beneficiaries. HCFA administers Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service program through a network of more than 60 claims processing contractors, that is, insurance companies\u2014like Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, Mutual of Omaha, and CIGNA\u2014that process and pay Medicare claims. In fiscal year 1997, contractors processed about 900 million Medicare claims.", "Medicare contractors use federal funds to pay health care providers and beneficiaries and are reimbursed for the costs they incur in performing the work. They are also responsible for payment safeguard activities intended to protect Medicare from paying inappropriately. The contractors have broad discretion in conducting these activities, resulting in significant variation among contractors in implementing payment safeguards.", "HCFA budgets funding for five main types of program safeguard activities carried out by Medicare contractors: (1) medical review, (2) Medicare secondary payer review, (3) audit of provider cost reports, (4) fraud unit investigations, and (5) provider education. Medical review includes automated and manual, prepayment and postpayment reviews of Medicare claims; it is intended to identify claims for noncovered or medically unnecessary services. Medicare secondary payer review focuses on identifying other primary sources of payment, such as employer-sponsored health insurance or third-party liability settlements, for claims submitted to Medicare. The audit process involves auditing cost reports submitted by providers, such as skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. Contractor fraud units investigate potential cases of fraud or abuse identified through beneficiary complaints, other contractor safeguard units, or other sources. Provider education can include mailings to providers, briefings, and workshops to increase provider awareness of coverage and billing policies as well as coding and documentation requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Integrity Program Offers Increasing Funding", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with fiscal year 1997, HIPAA stipulates that annual funding levels be appropriated from the Medicare Trust Fund to carry out HCFA\u2019s program safeguard activities. This process ensures that HCFA has funding for these important functions. Starting with the $440 million that was available for program safeguard activities in 1997 and the $500 million expected to be used for fiscal year 1998, HIPAA increases funding annually up to a maximum of $720 million in 2003 and following fiscal years. Funding levels provided by HIPAA in the Medicare Integrity Program for fiscal years 1997 through 2003 are summarized in table 1.", "Before HIPAA was enacted, program safeguard activities were funded out of Medicare\u2019s general contractor program management budget, and the level of funding available for program safeguard activities could be constrained by the need to fund ongoing Medicare program functions\u2014such as processing claims. In fact, while the number of Medicare claims grew by 70 percent between 1989 and 1996, funding for claims review grew less than 11 percent. In 1994, HHS proposed a program safeguard funding arrangement similar to that in HIPAA, saying that it would improve program safeguards by creating \u201ca stable level of funding from year to year so that HCFA and its contractors could plan and manage the function on a multi-year basis.\u201d HHS went on to say that \u201cast fluctuations in funding have made it difficult  to retain experienced staff who understand the complexities of the program.\u201d Appendix II summarizes program safeguard funding for fiscal years 1994 through 1998, by type of program safeguard activity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HCFA Has Not Taken Advantage of HIPAA\u2019s Assured Safeguard Funding but Is Increasing Direction of Contractor Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although HIPAA provides significant new resources and authorities, the timing of the act\u2014the passage of which occurred only 6 weeks before the start of fiscal year 1997\u2014limited the opportunity for change in the first year. Then, HCFA failed to take advantage of the advance knowledge of fiscal year 1998 program safeguard funding by providing safeguard budgets to its contractors at the beginning of fiscal year 1998. That delay has hindered contractors\u2019 ability to expand their program safeguard activities. However, HCFA has taken steps to direct program safeguard funding to identified weaknesses and program safeguard activities where it is most needed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Despite Assured Funding, Allocations to Contractors for 1998 Safeguard Activities Were Not Timely", "paragraphs": ["Notification of fiscal year 1998 program safeguard funding was not given to contractors until January 1998\u2014nearly one-third of the way into the fiscal year. HCFA officials told us that they waited so that HCFA could notify contractors of their program safeguard funding at the same time as claims processing funding. As a result of this late start, it may be difficult for the contractors to complete all of the program safeguard work that HCFA expected them to accomplish with this increased funding.", "Although HIPAA appropriated program safeguard funding for fiscal year 1998, HCFA officials believed that distribution of that funding needed to be delayed until funds for contractors\u2019 other activities were distributed. They stated that contractors might use Medicare Integrity Program funds for other program management purposes if these program safeguard funds were released in advance of program management funds. Despite HCFA\u2019s concerns, its contractors are required to use Medicare Integrity Program funding only for program safeguard activities. After reviewing a draft of this report, HCFA told us that it would notify contractors of their fiscal year 1999 base program safeguard funding before the first day of the fiscal year.", "In addition to being late, the January 1998 funding notification to contractors did not include all of the fiscal year 1998 contractors\u2019 funding. As of the end of February, HCFA had not released more than $40 million in program safeguard funding for various projects to be carried out by its contractors. Some of these projects were made possible by the supplemental program safeguard funding provided in November by HHS\u2019 fiscal year 1998 appropriation. The contractors told us that funding received later in the fiscal year is more difficult for them to use effectively because HCFA requires them to complete the projects by the end of September or use a subcontractor. While subcontracting allows the contractor to commit all of its fiscal year funds, contractor officials told us that it does not contribute to building valuable expertise within their own staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Funding Has Not Significantly Increased Contractor Staffing", "paragraphs": ["Despite fiscal year 1998 budget increases, neither of the contractors we visited had significantly increased their staff available to perform program safeguard activities, such as provider audit and claims review. While it is difficult to make precise comparisons because of reorganizations at both contractors, contractor officials said that there has been little or no hiring of program safeguard staff, other than some replacements to offset attrition. In some areas, contractors have not filled all of their existing vacancies. Furthermore, contractors\u2019 staffing for some important program safeguard activities is now less than it was before HIPAA. For example, both contractors reported that as of the end of March 1998, they had fewer staff on board to audit provider cost reports than they did in September 1996, before implementation of HIPAA. One contractor currently employs 77 audit staff, down from 88 in September 1996. The other contractor currently employs 151 audit and reimbursement staff, down from 158 in 1996. The latter contractor\u2019s medical review staff has also declined, from 86 in 1996 to 83 at the time of our visit.", "Because they were uncertain about their level of safeguard funding until well into the year, the contractors also indicated they were not hiring staff to carry out other HCFA-directed projects. In particular, contractors expressed reluctance to hire permanent staff to carry out special projects that are funded only for the current fiscal year. As a result, these projects can affect other program safeguard work. For example, both contractors we visited indicated that the HCFA-directed project to review claims for physician evaluation and management services will require a complex level of review that needs to be done by experienced full-time staff in their medical review units\u2014rather than being carried out by temporary employees or subcontractors\u2014thereby reducing the time that trained and experienced staff are available for the contractors\u2019 ongoing claims review workload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCFA Is Doing More to Direct Current Contractors\u2019 Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1998, HCFA has begun to direct program safeguard funding to address weaknesses identified by the HHS OIG\u2019s financial audit of HCFA for fiscal year 1996, and to expand its analysis of how funding can best be allocated among Medicare contractors and program safeguard activities. Although this does not address our concerns about the timeliness of contractor safeguard budgets, HCFA is attempting to better target the safeguard funds. To address the findings of the HHS OIG\u2019s audit of HCFA\u2019s fiscal year 1996 financial statement, HCFA is using fiscal year 1998 program safeguard funding to carry out several corrective actions to supplement regular program safeguard activities, such as the following:", "To increase the level of claims review, 28 Medicare part B contractors have been directed to conduct a special prepayment review of more than 166,000 physician claims for evaluation and management services.", "All contractors are to manually perform prepayment reviews of a sample of claims that cleared their automated screens, and each may decide what types of claims it will sample and choose its sampling method.", "HCFA and its contractors will carry out numerous other targeted efforts and special projects, such as home health agency reviews, the correct coding initiative for part B claims, and numerous information system upgrades.", "Beginning in fiscal year 1998, HCFA also required Medicare contractors to provide more information and support for their Medicare program safeguard budget requests than it had in prior years, and a HCFA official told us HCFA will continue this practice in fiscal year 1999. Also in fiscal year 1998, HCFA used a new methodology for allocating the program safeguard budget to Medicare contractors.

HCFA intends that these new competitively awarded contracts will establish program safeguard contractors who specialize in program integrity and have enhanced data analysis capabilities.", "Although HIPAA did not set a deadline for awarding these contracts, many of the benefits of HIPAA cannot be achieved until the new safeguard contractors are in place. The benefits that can be achieved through these contracts include the following: enabling the review, by a single entity, of all services to a beneficiary by centralizing program safeguard activities now divided among several types of contracts: carriers, intermediaries, durable medical equipment regional carriers, and regional home health intermediaries; eliminating the competing interests of timely payment of claims and achieving better price and contractor performance through competition; reducing the number of program safeguard units from the current level of more than 60 to simplify oversight, achieve more consistent contractor performance, and achieve economies of scale; and allowing HCFA to more aggressively mitigate conflicts of interest arising when contractors enter into new health care lines of business."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Replacement of Current Contractors With Program Safeguard Specialists to Be Limited in Near Term", "paragraphs": ["Despite its new authority to use program safeguard specialists, HCFA does not plan to make any major changes in who conducts program safeguard operations in the foreseeable future.
