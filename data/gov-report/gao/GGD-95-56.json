Youth who have come in contact with the juvenile justice system by committing an offense (such as liquor offenses, running away, truancy, or ungovernable behavior) that would not be a crime if committed by an adult are status offenders. For purposes of this review, we have defined \u201cgender bias\u201d as intentional or unintentional differences in the juvenile justice systems\u2019 outcomes of female and male status offenders who (except for gender) have similar characteristics, such as age, status offense, and prior offense history. As agreed with your Committees, our specific objectives were to (1) compare the outcome of the intake decisions and the frequency and outcomes of detentions, adjudications, and out-of-home placements of female and male status offenders and (2) compare the availability of facilities and services for female and male status offenders in selected jurisdictions.", "On the basis of our models using National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ) data, the county probation officers\u2019 responses to our survey, and our visits to selected facilities, we found minimal gender bias, as we defined it.", "According to NCJJ\u2019s national data, 500,620 status-offender cases were petitioned to juvenile courts in the United States during the 6-year period from 1986 to 1991. (These data did not include youth who were handled informally\u2014picked up, counseled, and/or released.) Of these cases, about 40 percent involved females and 60 percent involved males. Our analyses showed that females and males had similar probabilities (percent chances) of being detained, adjudicated, or placed for about 60 percent of the offense categories. For the remaining 40 percent, females and males had different probabilities for the 3 outcomes. On the basis of the relative numbers of cases involving females versus males, female runaway cases outnumbered male runaway cases by about 1-1/2 times, while male liquor offender cases outnumbered female liquor offender cases by about 3 times. However, our national-level analyses alone cannot be used to draw conclusions about either the presence or the absence of gender bias. Such conclusions cannot be drawn because NCJJ\u2019s national data files did not contain sufficient information on prior histories of status offenders and other variables relevant to judges\u2019 decisions in the cases. Therefore, to enable us to determine if gender bias existed, we developed 25 statistical models using data from those states with appropriate data for these more in-depth analyses.", "In comparing outcomes for female and male status offenders in relationship to gender bias, each of the 25 models considered and accounted for case characteristics\u2014such as each youth\u2019s prior offense history and age\u2014that, according to the models, generally influence intake and judicial decisions. For five of the six intake regression models, our results indicated no evidence of gender bias. Similarly, for 14 of the 19 regression models for the detention, adjudication, and placement decisions, our results indicated no evidence of gender bias in the juvenile courts\u2019 handling of status offenders. However, for the one intake model that exhibited a difference for a specific state, females were more likely to be petitioned to juvenile court than males. For the other five state-specific models\u2014three detention, one adjudication, and one placement\u2014females were less likely to be detained, adjudicated, or placed than males. Our analysis also showed that certain factors, such as offenders\u2019 prior offense history and source of referral, affected the status offenders\u2019 outcomes. While our models indicated no evidence of gender bias in 19 cases and some evidence in 6 cases, our results were limited to those aspects of the juvenile justice system for which data existed.", "At the 15 facilities we visited, we generally found minimal gender-based differences in the availability of counseling, educational, and medical services for females and males, although the extent of such services varied by type of facility. The 10 co-educational facilities offered similar services for females and males, although some of the facilities provided females with health services, such as gynecological services and prenatal care, not applicable to males. Officials at the other five facilities (four serving females and one serving males) said that their programs were not gender-based and could be replicated or offered to either females or males. The only gender-based difference we noted involved admission physicals. At two of the female-only group homes, health examinations included testing (which could be refused at one of the homes) for sexually transmitted diseases, whereas, at similar male-only facilities operated by the same organizations, such testing was not done unless requested by the males.", "The survey responses from the county probation officers did not indicate any significant gender-bias concerns. The respondents reported that generally no differences existed in the way females and males with similar status-offense histories were treated within their juvenile justice systems.", "About 70 percent of juvenile probation officers who responded for their departments reported that treatment options, e.g., facilities and services, were about equally available for detained female and male status offenders. While some respondents noted that overall more facilities were needed for both females and males, they added that there were more facilities for males than females.", "Officials in the jurisdictions and at the facilities we visited emphasized that, in their view, insufficient facilities and services were available for status offenders, irrespective of gender. These officials said that more resources were needed for female and male status offenders. These needed resources included early-intervention programs to divert first-time offenders from further involvement in the juvenile justice system. Officials said that status offenders did not need gender-specific services, except for gynecological services and prenatal care. The officials had mixed views about whether the needs of status offenders were better met by co-educational or single-gender facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Juvenile justice is primarily the domain of state and local authorities. Thus, juvenile courts\u2019 jurisdiction and procedures can vary widely throughout the United States. For instance, depending upon the state and the alleged offense, the juvenile courts\u2019 jurisdiction may end at age 18, 17, 16, or even younger. Referrals of youth to juvenile justice authorities can come from various sources, including police officers, parents, schools, and social service agencies. Police officers account for 41 percent of the referrals, according to 1989 Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) data.", "Generally, after an alleged status offender is referred to juvenile authorities, screening or intake staff (e.g., a juvenile probation officer) decide whether the case should be handled formally or informally. Juveniles can be temporarily placed in detention centers at some point between referral and case disposition by the court. If the intake decision were to proceed formally, a petition is drafted and filed to provide notice of the offenses that will be pursued. The petition charges the youth with a status-offense violation and identifies the youth and those other persons who should be informed of the proceedings. These proceedings include an adjudication hearing and possibly a disposition hearing. At the adjudication hearing, the juvenile court judge reviews evidence and determines if the youth has committed a status offense. At a concurrent or subsequent disposition hearing, the judge determines an appropriate action or treatment plan for the status offender. The juvenile court judge\u2019s disposition options include dismissal of the case, probation, fine or restitution, community service, and placement. Placement refers to any \u201cout-of-home\u201d disposition, which usually takes place in residential facilities. These facilities provide 24-hour care to juveniles. The following are types of residential facilities:", "Detention centers: secure, residential facilities.", "Group homes: nonsecure facilities that are intended to provide a residential environment in which to meet the long-term counseling needs of troubled youth.", "Shelters: nonsecure facilities that are intended to provide overnight or short-term housing and crisis intervention counseling to troubled youth.", "Figure 1 shows the number of petitioned juvenile cases processed by the juvenile courts in 1991, according to OJJDP data.", "Cases handled informally usually do not involve a petition or an adjudication hearing. These informal (nonpetitioned) cases may be dismissed; possible reasons for dismissal include lack of evidence or the youth\u2019s receiving a warning or counseling. Even when cases can be handled informally, juveniles can be given probation or even placed. As shown in figure 1, 2 percent (or 500) of all petitioned nonadjudicated cases in 1991 resulted in juveniles\u2019 being placed.", "According to OJJDP, in many jurisdictions, most status-offense cases are handled informally. In many communities, county attorneys, family crisis units, or social service agencies\u2014rather than the juvenile courts\u2014have assumed responsibility for screening and diverting alleged status offenders from the juvenile justice system.", "Even though juvenile justice is primarily the responsibility of state and local authorities, Congress has taken an increased interest in juvenile justice issues during the past two decades. Most significantly, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.), established a formula grant program for states to improve their juvenile justice systems. States receive formula grant funds if they comply with certain requirements. One of these requirements was that status offenders should not be held in secure detention facilities, such as jails, police lockups, juvenile detention centers, or training schools. In 1980, Congress amended the law to allow states to detain status offenders under certain conditions and still receive their grant funds. According to OJJDP regulations, these status offenders must be provided certain procedural protections.", "Some child advocacy groups have raised concerns about the lack of appropriate placement services for females in the juvenile justice system. For example, in September 1992, the National Network for Runaway and Homeless Youth Services advocated the need to review gender bias within the states\u2019 juvenile justice systems. In addition, some studies have indicated that females were more likely to be detained for status offenses than males."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To aid us in defining gender bias and in designing models or approaches to address the objectives, we reviewed relevant literature identified in bibliographies provided us by NCJJ and OJJDP. Regarding the first objective, we used NCJJ\u2019s national estimates of status-offender data for calendar years 1986 through 1991 to develop gender-specific probabilities of detentions, adjudications, and placements for status offenders by offense categories. However, these data did not contain sufficient information relevant to judges\u2019 decisions to assess gender bias, e.g., prior offense history and source of referral for the offense. To examine gender bias, we did further analysis using data from several states that had additional variables beyond those used for NCJJ\u2019s national estimates. We developed 6 models to study the outcome of intake decisions in 6 states and 19 models to further study detentions, adjudications, and placements in 7 states. We used a class of models commonly used in criminological research to analyze these types of outcomes. We used NCJJ\u2019s state-specific data files to conduct regression analyses for seven states\u2014Arizona, California, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Utah. Data limitations precluded us from developing models for status offender intake decisions in Nebraska, placements in Arizona, and detentions in Utah. Further, we could not address possible gender bias elsewhere in the juvenile justice system because data did not exist. For example, the data did not include youths who were handled informally\u2014picked up, counseled, and/or released by the police or by county juvenile department intake officials.", "To compare the availability of facilities and services, we visited a total of 15 facilities located in 9 counties\u2014generally 2 counties (a rural county and an urban county) within each of 4 selected states (Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, and Texas).", "We mailed a survey to a national sample of county probation department officials to obtain (1) opinions on differences in the juvenile justice systems\u2019 processing of status offenders and (2) perspectives on the availability of facilities and services for status offenders. By using a national sample, we were able to project the results to our study population of 1,249 chief juvenile justice probation officers.", "Appendix I presents more details about our objectives, scope, and methodology, including a discussion of how we selected states for analysis with respect to our second objective. Appendix V contains a copy of the survey and the survey\u2019s results.", "We did our work from March 1993 through August 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Since no federal agency has responsibility for the issues discussed in this report, we did not obtain official comments on a draft of this report. However, we did discuss our results with NCJJ and OJJDP officials and, where appropriate, incorporated their comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minimal Gender Bias in Juvenile Justice Systems\u2019 Handling of Status Offenders", "paragraphs": ["Our analyses of 6 years of national data indicated that there were only relatively small differences in the percentages of female and male status offenders detained, adjudicated, and placed. With six exceptions, our logistic regression analyses of intake decisions, detentions, adjudications, and placements in seven states generally did not indicate any significant gender-based differences in the processing of female and male status offenders.

Of the total petitioned status-offender cases, 41.3 percent (206,756 cases) involved females and 58.7 percent (293,864 cases) involved males. In terms of gender distinctions, two specific offense categories had noticeable differences in the numbers: females were involved in 61.9 percent of the running away offenses and males were involved in 74.3 percent of the liquor offenses.", "Table 1 shows that petitioned female status offenders had about the same probability, or percent chance, as petitioned male status offenders of being detained, adjudicated, or placed out-of-home during 1986 through 1991, for 60 percent of the outcomes. For example, the probabilities for female and male truants who were detained, adjudicated, or placed were within 2 percentage points of each other. The exceptions were in the offense categories of running away and liquor violations. For the offense categories of liquor violation, running away, truancy, and ungovernability, our data analysis showed that the probabilities of either female or male status offenders\u2019 being detained before disposition by the juvenile courts had declined from calendar years 1986 to 1991. For example, the probability of ungovernable female status offenders\u2019 being detained decreased from about 19 percent to 8 percent, and the decrease for males was from 19 percent to 9 percent (see app. II, table II.3).", "Regarding running away, our analyses showed that males had higher probabilities than females of being detained, adjudicated, or placed. Further, males with liquor offenses had higher probabilities of being adjudicated or placed than females. Appendix II provides more detailed analyses of NCJJ national data.", "The national estimates did not enable us to determine whether gender bias occurred in the outcomes because these data did not contain variables that are likely to be relevant to judges\u2019 decisions (e.g., prior offense histories).

Overall, the 25 models involved applications of the logistic regression procedure. That is, each state\u2019s models contained variables that measured characteristics that may be associated with the juvenile judicial system outcomes and estimated how the characteristics influenced outcomes. These characteristics included the source of referral to the juvenile court, location (e.g., metropolitan or rural area) of the court, age and race of the offender, type of offense, and offender\u2019s prior offense history. We used these models to test for gender bias. For the intake decisions, we analyzed all cases referring to the intake staff; for the detention and adjudication decisions, we analyzed only petitioned cases; for the placement decisions, we analyzed cases of adjudicated status offenders.", "Table 2 shows the \u201cgender-bias quotients,\u201d which were the resulting estimates of gender bias from the models that we developed. As the gender-bias quotient approaches 1.0, the amount of estimated gender bias decreases. No specific criteria exist as to the extent that the quotient would have to deviate from 1.0 to indicate gender bias. In our judgment, however, a deviation from 1.0 of more than .2 would indicate the presence of gender bias. Our results indicated that (1) in 5 of the 6 intake models, females were about equally as likely as males to be petitioned to juvenile court and (2) in 14 of the other 19 models, no gender bias was demonstrated in the juvenile justice systems\u2019 outcomes for status offenders. In the Florida intake model, females were more likely to be petitioned to juvenile court than males because the juvenile justice system treated females\u2019 characteristics, e.g., type of offense, differently due to their gender. In the other five models, we found some indication of gender bias in Arizona\u2019s, Florida\u2019s, and Nebraska\u2019s detention decisions and Florida\u2019s adjudication and placement decisions. These models indicated that females were less likely to be detained or placed than males because the juvenile justice system treated females\u2019 characteristics, e.g., referrals by the police, differently due to their gender. Our conclusions about gender bias are limited to aspects of the juvenile justice process for which we had data. See appendix III for a detailed explanation of the models and the methodology.", "In measuring gender bias, we combined the effects of the individual variables to estimate the overall probabilities of intake decisions, detention, adjudication, and placement. By combining these effects to estimate gender bias, some variables may have had offsetting effects, regardless of whether the models showed gender bias. For example, in the Missouri intake results, which did not indicate gender bias, law enforcement and school referrals for females lowered their probability of being petitioned, but urban courts increased the probability of being petitioned. These offsetting situations occurred relatively infrequently.", "Our analysis showed that certain factors, such as offenders\u2019 prior offense history and source of referral, affected the status offenders\u2019 outcomes. For example, as would be expected, offenders\u2019 prior offense history generally affected their detention outcomes.

The results of our regression analysis enabled us to identify situations where there were differences in treatment on particular variables but no aggregate gender bias, as measured by the gender-bias quotients.", "Further, the method we used to construct the gender-bias quotients takes into account two sets of influences on each of the four case-processing outcomes.

The second influence is the differences in how females\u2019 and males\u2019 characteristics were treated.

If some variables had larger influences on these outcomes than others and the variables with larger influences were correlated with gender, then there would be gender differences in these outcomes. Such differences would not be characterized as gender bias, however, because they are explained by the gender differences in the distribution of case characteristics. Failure to control for gender differences in case characteristics may lead to the incorrect inference that there is gender bias in the outcomes, when, in fact, what has been observed is gender differences in the distribution of variables associated with outcomes.", "On the other hand, estimated differences in the way the juvenile justice system evaluates females\u2019 and males\u2019 characteristics, apart from the distribution of these characteristics across cases, would indicate gender bias.

In general, we sought to build the most parsimonious models consistent with the data, but we also attempted to include theoretically relevant variables\u2014such as the type of status offense\u2014where possible. p elogit(p)/(1 elogit(p))", "In this formula, \u201cp\u201d is the predicted probability of an outcome, e.g., the probability of petitioned at intake; \u201ce\u201d refers to the operation of exponentiating; and \u201clogit(p)\u201d is the estimated logit of the probability of the particular outcome. The logit was evaluated at the mean levels of the variables in the regression equation. These probabilities, the model probabilities, indicated how females and males, respectively, were treated by the courts on their average characteristics.", "Third, we used the parameter estimates from the males\u2019 equations to estimate outcomes for females if they were treated in the same way as males. These probabilities were labeled \u201cp(2)\u201d or the \u201cequal treatment probabilities\u201d for females. We computed these probabilities by multiplying the means of the females\u2019 variables by the parameter estimates from the males\u2019 equations. We used these products to predict the equal treatment probabilities for females. Finally, we took the ratio of the two sets of probabilities\u2014\u201cequal treatment\u201d to \u201cpredicted,\u201d or p(2) to p(1)\u2014to estimate the gender-bias quotient. As the gender-bias quotients approach 1, the amount of gender bias diminishes. Gender-bias quotients greater than 1 indicate that females were less likely to receive a particular outcome than if their characteristics were treated as males\u2019 characteristics. Gender-bias quotients less than 1 indicates the reverse, that females were more likely to receive an outcome than if their characteristics were treated equally to males\u2019 characteristics. For example, a hypothetical outcome of .7 detentions in a state would suggest that females were more likely to be detained in that state than males with similar characteristics; an outcome of 1.3, on the other hand, would indicate that females were less likely to be detained than males with similar characteristics."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Model Specification", "paragraphs": ["The general form of our logistic regressions was as follows.

From these, and the mean values of the independent variables, we calculated the estimated probabilities. Continuing with the example, we calculated p(1) as the probability of detention for females. We then calculated a second probability of detention, the equal treatment probability, or p(2): p(2) [1 exp( Bm i)] the parameter estimates, odds ratios can be calculated. The odds ratios can be interpreted in a relatively straightforward manner. The odds ratio is an estimate of how much more likely, or unlikely, it is for the outcome of interest to be present among those having a particular characteristic than those not having that characteristic. For example, an odds ratio of 4 for a variable indicating whether a status offender had prior dispositions would be interpreted to indicate that status offenders with prior dispositions are four times as likely as those without prior dispositions to have the outcome (e.g., detention) of interest.", "Finally, the method we used to estimate gender bias was based on methods developed by economists to measure discrimination in labor markets. Their method, called the \u201cresidual difference,\u201d measures discrimination, or bias, in terms of the differences between the two sets of outcomes after the effects of all relevant variables have been accounted for. In the residual difference method, a bias or discrimination is the residual that cannot be explained by the variables in the model. The strength of the method lies in its ability to account for bias in terms of the differences in treatments on characteristics. The major weakness of the method lies in using an incomplete or incorrect set of variables to estimate the regressions. Depending on how they are correlated with the outcome variables, omitted variables or incorrectly included variables could reduce or increase the \u201cresidual difference.\u201d Thus, misspecified models could lead to incorrect inferences about bias."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variables Used in the Models", "paragraphs": ["We fit state-specific models for each decision, using the relevant variables available in the states\u2019 data sets.

In the petitioning decisions in Florida in which females were more likely to be petitioned to juvenile court than in their equal-treatment outcomes, the gender differences in treatment arose around female runaways and in the location of the juvenile courts. Female runaways were more likely to be petitioned to court than male runaways; however, female runaways were less likely to be petitioned than female truants or liquor-law violators. In addition, female runaways comprised a larger portion of female cases than male runaways did of male cases. Females in metropolitan areas were about a third more likely to be petitioned than their male counterparts.

In Arizona, petitioned females who were referred to the court by law-enforcement officers were one-tenth as likely to be detained than their male counterparts.

Specifically, females adjudicated for liquor offenses, truancy, or ungovernability all were less likely to be placed than comparable males with these offenses. In addition, females adjudicated for liquor violations, truancy, and ungovernability were less likely to be placed than females adjudicated for running away.

For example, two of the shelters offer family counseling, but the programs reportedly were poorly attended. Staff from two of the group homes said that they could not offer family counseling because court-ordered placements resulted in youth coming from all areas of the state. These officials explained that family counseling was impractical because the parents would have been unable to attend the sessions since they did not live close to the respective facility.", "Nineteen of the 34 juvenile justice officials and 6 of the 15 service providers we interviewed emphasized that family counseling is essential because female and male status offenders were running from some form of abuse or neglect at home. According to these officials, family counseling could help correct poor parenting skills, which is a contributor to abuse and neglect. Staff at one of the group homes we visited told us that limited resources were used most effectively only when the whole family was included in the treatment plan. According to the staff, a group-home facility could build a youth\u2019s self-esteem and correct negative behaviors, but frequently the youth may be released from the group home and returned to the environment that caused the negative behaviors. The staff said that in these situations, where the family issues had not been addressed, the youth was likely to revert to negative behaviors.", "Staff at other facilities told us that parents and guardians did not always give female and male status offenders the support needed to address and solve problems. For example, an official at one shelter said they were unable to return a pregnant runaway to her home because her single-parent mother was using drugs and had just been evicted from their apartment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Educational Services", "paragraphs": ["The 15 facilities we visited provided a variety of educational services. At three of the four secure detention facilities, status offenders generally attend on-site schools staffed by licensed teachers. The other secure facility, Kentucky\u2019s Big Sandy Regional Detention Center, did not have an on-site school. A representative from the detention center told us resident youth are provided educational services when the juvenile court judges order the public schools to transport the youth to their classes.", "At the six (co-educational) shelters, we found no differences in the educational services provided to female and male status offenders. Status offenders at four of the six shelters either attended the local public schools or received daily or part-time instruction at the respective facility. These youth generally did not attend the local schools if they had dropped out of school, were studying for their general equivalency diploma, or did not reside in the county where the shelter was located. At the fifth shelter, all female and male status offenders attended an on-site school staffed by licensed teachers. At the sixth shelter, all female and male status offenders attended local schools.", "Female and male status offenders also received similar educational services at the four gender-specific group homes. For example, we visited one male-only group home and one female-only group home in Kentucky that were operated by the same organization. Both of these group homes sent the youth to county alternative schools. The two remaining group homes (each serving females only) sent resident youth to the local public schools.", "Education was a main component of the services offered status offenders at the nonresidential program we visited in Florida. Licensed teachers provided basic instruction, which enabled the youth to earn high-school credits that would aid them in returning to the public schools or obtaining a general equivalency diploma. Classes were conducted on the campus of the local community college, which gave the youth access to other educational services as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medical Services", "paragraphs": ["According to service providers at the 15 facilities we visited, females and males were receiving needed medical services, either provided through arrangements by parents or guardians or from local community health-care providers. For example, pregnant females admitted to some facilities received prenatal care. Facility staff at one shelter told us that a male had been referred to a local dermatologist for severe acne. In addition, staff at several facilities reported that many of the females and males had to be referred to community dentists because the youth had never received dental care before arriving at the facilities.", "Also, females and males reportedly were given health screenings and/or physical examinations before or after admission. The health screenings included a list of questions to determine each youth\u2019s immediate health needs. The physical examinations typically involved a nurse\u2019 taking each youth\u2019s temperature and blood pressure and checking for any signs of physical distress.", "All four of the secure detention facilities and one of the six shelters had on-site medical personnel. These personnel ranged from a nurse, who was available from 3 days to 7 days per week, to a doctor, who was available from 1 day to 5 days per week. Although these five facilities had on-site medical personnel to address minor medical problems or dispense prescription medication, some service providers at these facilities told us that their facilities were often overcrowded and needed additional medical staff. For example, at two secure detention facilities, the on-site nurse could not fully treat all of the youth on each day\u2019s sick list and, thus, had to select patients.", "The remaining five shelters, four group homes, and the nonresidential facility did not have on-site medical services. Four of the 10 officials at these facilities told us that such resources were needed. For instance, one official explained that counselors were having to use their already limited counseling time to dispense medication and transport youth to doctors\u2019 offices.", "Regular on-site individual and group counseling were not provided.
