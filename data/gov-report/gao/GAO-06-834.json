It devastated the region and caused billions of dollars in  damage. The hurricane affected about 1.5 million people located within  approximately 90,000 square miles spanning Louisiana, Mississippi, and  Alabama, and was the worst natural disaster in our nation\u2019s history in  geographic scope, extent and severity of destruction and damage, and the  number of persons displaced from their homes. Shortly after Hurricane  Katrina made landfall, Hurricanes Rita and Wilma followed, further  exacerbating damage to the Gulf Coast region. In response to these events,  the Congress has provided nearly $88 billion for relief and recovery  through four emergency supplemental appropriations acts through the end  of June 2006.", "As part of its mission under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), as reflected in the National  Response Plan (NRP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), was tasked  with the primary role of managing the federal relief and recovery efforts  within the affected region. The first emergency supplemental  appropriation act was enacted 4 days after Hurricane Katrina struck the  Gulf Coast and provided over $10 billion. The second emergency  supplemental appropriation act was enacted 6 days after the first  emergency supplemental appropriation act and provided significantly  more funding\u2014$50 billion\u2014to FEMA for its Disaster Relief Fund and  required the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide weekly reports to  the Committees on Appropriations detailing the allocation and obligation  of these amounts. The Congress later called for FEMA to also report on  expenditures over $50 million, among other information.", "In creating these reporting requirements, the Congress sent a clear  message that it wanted to know how these funds were being spent and  have updated information on a weekly basis. These reports are publicly  available and at the time of this report were being posted to the House  Committee on Appropriations website. In December 2005, when the  Congress rescinded $23.4 billion from FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund, FEMA  had obligated about $25 billion, or 42 percent, of the $60 billion it received  in the first two emergency supplemental appropriations. With this  rescission, the Congress distributed the funds as direct appropriations to  other federal agencies. As of June 2006, approximately $88 billion has been  provided to 23 federal agencies for the relief work through four  emergency supplemental appropriations acts.", "We currently have a large body of ongoing work to address preparation,  response, recovery, and rebuilding efforts related to the hurricanes that  devastated the Gulf Coast region. Due to widespread congressional  interest in these subjects, our work is being completed under the  Comptroller General\u2019s authority to conduct evaluations on his own  initiative. Topics of reports already issued include (1) contract  management; (2) accounting for international assistance; (3) the adequacy  of internal controls to prevent fraud and abuse; and (4) the military\u2019s  response to catastrophic natural disasters. We are sending you this report  on the tracking of hurricane relief funding because of your interest in and  responsibility for oversight of matters related to the hurricane relief and  recovery efforts. Our work focused on the funds designated for hurricane  relief and recovery in the four emergency supplemental appropriations  acts enacted as of June 2006. Our objective was to determine whether the  federal government was adequately tracking and reporting on the use of  this funding. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed the four  emergency supplemental acts to determine which federal agencies were  receiving appropriations, how much each was receiving, what the funds  were intended for, and whether any reporting requirements were  specified. Because the second supplemental, which provided $50 billion to  FEMA, required FEMA to report to the Committees on Appropriations on  a weekly basis on the use of these funds, we reviewed FEMA\u2019s weekly  reports to determine whether the information provided was timely and  useful. We limited our review of these reports to certain aspects of them  that have governmentwide implications. Specifically, our review of  FEMA\u2019s weekly reports focused on the obligations and expenditures  reported for mission assignments that were issued to agencies performing  disaster relief work related to the Gulf Coast hurricanes on behalf of  FEMA. The obligation and expenditure information we present in this  report was obtained from FEMA and certain other federal agencies. To  assess the reliability of the data, we interviewed officials knowledgeable  about the data included in the reports and what the data represented, and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.

Once the mission assignment is issued and approved, the mission  assignment document is FEMA\u2019s basis for obligating the portion of  FEMA\u2019s funds allocated to the assigned relief and recovery effort. From a  federal agency standpoint, the mission assignment provides the recipient  agency reimbursable budgetary authority, not the actual transfer of funds,  to perform the agreed upon work. Among other things, mission  assignments include a description of work, an estimate of the dollar  amount of work to be performed, completion date for the work, and  authorizing signatures.

Of the $29.7 billion in obligations, FEMA issued mission  assignments to federal agencies totaling $8.5 billion, or 28.6 percent. The  other $21.2 billion includes, for example, obligations that FEMA made for  areas such as the individual and household program ($7.0 billion) and  manufactured housing ($4.7 billion), which are being reviewed in some  respects by other auditors. As of March 29, 2006, FEMA reported  approximately $8.5 billion of obligations for mission assignments and  approximately $661 million of expenditures for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,  and Wilma as shown in table 2.", "While FEMA reports obligations based on the dollar amount of the mission  assignments it has placed with other federal agencies when they are  assigned, these obligation amounts do not represent the amount of funds  that the agencies have, in turn, actually obligated to perform disaster relief  work on behalf of FEMA. In some cases, the agencies have obligated tens  or hundreds of millions of dollars less than the amount reported by FEMA.", "Our analysis of FEMA\u2019s reported mission assignments to other federal  agencies to perform work on behalf of FEMA in the amount of $8.5 billion  identified two types of reporting problems, both of which resulted in  FEMA\u2019s obligations being overstated from a governmentwide perspective.  First, some federal agencies recorded obligations in their internal tracking  systems that were much less than the amount of obligations reported by  FEMA. This occurred because FEMA\u2019s recorded obligations are based on  the dollar amount of the entire mission assignment. In contrast, the  amount of obligations recorded by federal agencies is the amount of funds  they actually obligated to perform disaster relief work. The performing  agency does not incur obligations until it actually performs or contracts  for the work. Four examples of this reporting problem follow:    On September 28, 2005, FEMA\u2019s report showed that obligations on  mission assignments issued to DOD related to Hurricane Katrina  totaled about $2.2 billion. As of March 2006, this amount had been  substantially reduced twice. On November 3, 2005, FEMA amended the  mission assignment and reduced the amount to about $1.7 billion, and  it reduced the amount again on March 15, 2006, to about $1.1 billion.  While FEMA was reporting obligations as high as $2.2 billion during  this 6-month period, DOD\u2019s reports show that it incurred only   $481 million of actual obligations as of April 5, 2006\u2014hundreds of  millions of dollars less than what FEMA reported over the same   6-month period. According to a DOD official, it is currently reviewing  the mission assignments and will be returning obligational authority  that was not used to FEMA.", "On September 28, 2005, FEMA\u2019s report showed that obligations on  mission assignments issued to COE related to Hurricane Katrina were  about $3.3 billion. Since then, this amount has increased. On   October 20, 2005, FEMA amended and increased the mission  assignment amounts to about $3.7 billion and on April 5, 2006, to about  $4 billion. However, according to COE\u2019s internal records as of   April 7, 2006, it had actually obligated about $3 billion for Hurricane  Katrina work, a difference of over $1 billion.", "Based on information provided by the Coast Guard, FEMA had  recorded mission assignment obligations related to Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita in the amount of nearly $192 million as of April 2006.  However, at that time, the Coast Guard had only actually incurred  about $85 million in obligations. Thus, the difference between what  FEMA reported to the Congress and what Coast Guard information  showed it had actually obligated is approximately $107 million.", "Based on information provided by the Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD), at the end of March 2006, FEMA had  obligated and reported approximately $83 million for HUD mission  assignments related to Hurricane Katrina. However, HUD had only  incurred about $47 million in obligations for work to be done under  mission assignments. While HUD may eventually utilize the full amount  obligated by FEMA, at that time, there was an approximately   $36 million difference between the amounts FEMA reported as  obligated for HUD and what HUD had actually obligated. HUD expects  final reconciliation to be completed by December 2006.", "Second, at least three federal agencies we interviewed did not have  mission assignments recorded in their internal tracking systems that were  recorded in FEMA\u2019s system. According to the officials from certain federal  agencies, this occurred because the agency\u2019s financial management office  was not informed of the mission assignments. FEMA officials informed us  that this problem likely occurred because, while the agencies\u2019 program  offices appropriately received mission assignment information from  FEMA, those agencies\u2019 program offices did not properly provide the  information to their agencies\u2019 financial management offices. Two  examples of this reporting problem follow:    At the Department of Health and Human Services, we noted $90 million  in mission assignment obligations related to Hurricane Katrina or  amendments to those obligations that were reported by FEMA as of  January 18, 2006, but not recorded by the department\u2019s financial  management office as of February 24, 2006. The department told us  that these mission assignments or amendments had been issued by  FEMA, but had not been received by the department\u2019s program or  financial management offices. After we pointed out the discrepancies,  the two agencies reconciled the differences.", "In another case, the Environmental Protection Agency had a similar  situation involving $11.5 million in mission assignments and  amendments related to Hurricane Katrina for which it did not record  obligations as of March 2006 because the financial management office  was unaware the mission assignments had been made by FEMA.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, for $10 million of  the $11.5 million in mission assignments, not only was the financial  management office unaware but the agency had never been informed  that the mission assignment had been issued by FEMA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Reports Do Not Provide Adequate Information on Actual Expenditures Made by Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["A different set of issues arises with regard to expenditure data. Because of  the nature and timing of payments FEMA makes to performing agencies,  FEMA\u2019s reported expenditures from the Disaster Relief Fund do not  present an accurate status of federal spending for hurricane relief and  recovery from a governmentwide perspective. This is explained in part by  problems with the timeliness and adequacy of billings to FEMA by other  agencies. As previously explained, FEMA reimburses performing agencies  for work they perform on behalf of FEMA in accordance with the mission  assignment agreements. FEMA requires that performing agencies (1) bill it  within 90 days after completion or upon termination of a mission  assignment, and (2) provide a certain level of documentation for its review  in order for the billings to be approved. FEMA does not recognize  reimbursements to other agencies as expenditures in its accounting  system (and therefore in its reports to the Congress) until this approval  has occurred. From a governmentwide perspective, this process results in  FEMA\u2019s expenditures being understated.", "As of March 29, 2006, FEMA reported about $661 million of expenditures  to agencies performing mission assignments for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,  and Wilma (see table 2). However, performing agencies\u2019 internal tracking  systems showed a significantly higher level of expenditures on their  mission assignments. The process FEMA uses for reimbursing performing  agencies creates timing differences between FEMA\u2019s and the performing  agencies\u2019 records. As a result, FEMA\u2019s reported expenditures are less than  actual expenditures performing agencies have made in support of FEMA\u2019s  hurricane relief and recovery efforts. In the case of a mission assignment,  a performing agency would recognize an expenditure when that agency  pays costs (liquidates obligations) to employees, contractors, or other  outside entities for work performed. However, FEMA does not recognize  the reimbursement of these costs as an expenditure until it has reviewed  and approved a bill from the performing agency. With the exception of  COE, reimbursements to the performing agencies are made using the IPAC  system. While the IPAC funds transfer occurs immediately upon request by  the agency seeking reimbursement, in FEMA\u2019s accounting records the  IPAC transaction would be reflected as a suspense account transaction  until FEMA has received and approved the supporting documentation for  the IPAC billing. Therefore, by virtue of the timing delays, FEMA\u2019s  reported expenditures would be less than expenditures made and reported  by performing agencies and a user of FEMA\u2019s report could incorrectly  infer that a particular agency has received tasks from FEMA but has not  spent any of the funds. Thus, the cost of actual work performed is better  reflected by the performing agencies. Two examples follow:    FEMA\u2019s report as of March 29, 2006, showed that approved mission  assignment expenditures (cash reimbursements) related to Hurricane  Katrina were about $210 million for DOD. However, DOD\u2019s report as of  April 5, 2006, showed that it had already received $324 million in  reimbursement from FEMA for mission assignments related to  Hurricane Katrina.", "The U.S. Forest Service had not billed FEMA for any of its work done  under mission assignments even though the agency reported that it had  made close to $170 million in expenditures related to its Hurricane  Katrina mission assignments as of January 31, 2006. Accordingly,  FEMA reported no expenditures for this agency in its weekly report  since FEMA had not yet approved any billings. FEMA\u2019s billing  instructions state that reimbursement requests can be forwarded to  FEMA monthly, regardless of the amount. Also, agencies should submit  the final bill no later than 90 days after completion or upon termination  of the mission assignment. The Forest Service, however, was not doing  this, and as a result, FEMA did not report any expenditures for mission  assignment work performed by the Forest Service as of March 29, 2006,  even though the Forest Service had spent about $170 million. The  Forest Service explained that it billed FEMA in March and June 2006  and planned to issue additional bills in August and September 2006. We  noted that there had been some billing activity reported by FEMA  subsequent to March 29, 2006.", "Aside from the timing issues discussed above, some performing agencies  have not provided billing documentation that meets FEMA\u2019s requirements  to support their reimbursements for work performed on mission  assignments. Although performing agencies using the IPAC system receive  funds immediately upon requesting reimbursement, if upon review of  supporting reimbursement documents, FEMA officials determine that  some amounts are incorrect or unsupported, FEMA may retrieve or  \u201ccharge back\u201d the monies from these agencies through the IPAC system.  For example, travel charges should be supported by a breakdown by  object class with names, period of performance dates, and amounts.  Failure to submit this documentation may result in FEMA charging back  the agency for the related mission assignment billing. FEMA\u2019s records as  of May 15, 2006, showed that FEMA had \u201ccharged back\u201d about $267 million  from performing agencies for costs billed to FEMA for mission  assignments related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. About   $260 million, or over 97 percent, of these charge-backs involved five  agencies: the Department of Transportation ($102 million), DOD   ($57 million), the Environmental Protection Agency ($45 million), the  Federal Protective Service within DHS ($32 million), and the Department  of Health and Human Services ($24 million). Consistent with its practice of  only reporting approved expenditures, these amounts were not recognized  as expenditures by FEMA, even though the performing agencies claim they  have expended those amounts. In addition, until FEMA requested the  charge-backs, the billings would have been in a FEMA suspense account,  and would have temporarily depleted monies from the Disaster Relief  Fund since the agencies had already received reimbursement through the  IPAC system. At least one agency, DOD, has indicated that it is trying to  gather additional supporting documentation for the $57 million that FEMA  charged back. Therefore, at least part of these charged back funds may be  reported as expenditures by FEMA at some point in the future. If the  agency cannot provide FEMA the needed supporting documentation, the  agency may not be reimbursed and thus will be required to use its own  appropriations.", "FEMA is also experiencing billing problems with COE, which does not use  the IPAC system. According to FEMA personnel, COE had billing and  documentation problems in the past and was not permitted to use the  IPAC system for transactions with DHS. While COE was working on  gaining access to using the IPAC system prior to Hurricane Katrina, this  process was put on hold, and instead COE must manually submit  supporting documentation before FEMA reimburses its mission  assignment costs. This allows for a thorough review by FEMA, but has also  led to payment delays. As of February 6, 2006, COE\u2019s internal accounts  receivable report showed that it had not received reimbursement for about  $1.2 billion of bills submitted to FEMA for Hurricane Katrina mission  assignments even though COE officials stated that they had sent  documentation supporting the majority of the bills. Of that amount, about  $610 million, or over half of the total, was over 60 days old. According to  FEMA officials, as of April 7, 2006, it had not received documentation  supporting about $800 million of the $1.2 billion of outstanding accounts  receivable on COE\u2019s records. None of the $1.2 billion has been reported as  expenditures by FEMA, although COE reports these amounts as  expenditures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Framework to Collect and Consolidate Agency Data and Report on This Information Limits Ability to Assess Status of Hurricane Funding", "paragraphs": ["From a governmentwide perspective, since Hurricane Katrina made  landfall, about $88 billion through four emergency supplemental  appropriations has been appropriated to 23 federal agencies. We found  that no one agency or central collection point exists to compile and report  on how these funds are being spent. Without a framework and  mechanisms in place to collect and consolidate information from these  agencies and report on a periodic basis, decision makers will not have  complete and consistent information on the uses of the funding that has  been provided thus far. Information on the amount of obligations and  expenditures made on the actual relief and recovery effort would provide  decision makers information they can use to determine, for example, if   (1) additional funds should be provided for the relief and recovery work,  (2) the funds already provided could be deemed excess and used for other  disaster relief and recovery work, (3) funds should be rescinded, or   (4) duplicate programs are providing similar assistance. As a result, in  order to have governmentwide information on actual obligations incurred  and expenditures made on the relief and recovery effort, the agencies  would have to use their own internal tracking systems to extract this  information and provide the information to a central point, where the data  could be consolidated and reported.

Once these funds are  appropriated, they are merged into, and commingled with existing  appropriation accounts. OMB Circular No. A-11 requires agencies to  report obligations and outlays on a quarterly basis at the appropriation  level; however, those reports on budget execution and budgetary  resources do not call for separately identifying amounts on a  programmatic basis, such as hurricane relief and recovery efforts. Thus,  reporting under this Circular will not provide the information needed to  monitor the status of hurricane-related funding. Although FEMA was  required to provide weekly reports to the Congress on obligation and  expenditure information on the $42.6 billion it received (although with  limited usefulness as discussed previously), most of the other 22 agencies  that received over $45 billion would only be responsible for tracking this  information internally.", "While there are some reporting requirements included in the emergency  supplemental appropriation acts, overall reporting requirements differ  greatly. Also, the reporting requirements do not call for consolidating  information on obligations and expenditures on a governmentwide basis  and, therefore, do not facilitate governmentwide reporting on hurricane- related spending. The reporting requirements that were included for the  various agencies ranged from very detailed reporting to no reporting at all.  For example, while FEMA was required to report obligations and  expenditures, 16 other federal agencies did not have any reporting  requirements. See appendix II for more information on the reporting  requirements included in the first four emergency supplemental  appropriations acts.", "Given that consolidated governmentwide reporting will require that  financial information be compiled from 23 different agencies, an entity  that regularly collects and compiles information from different agencies,  such as OMB or the Department of the Treasury, would likely be in the  best position for requesting this information and preparing consolidated  governmentwide reporting on hurricane-related funding.

In addition, there is no  framework or mechanisms in place to collect and consolidate information,  and to report on the $88 billion in hurricane relief and recovery funds  provided thus far to 23 federal agencies in the four emergency  supplemental appropriations acts on a governmentwide basis.

We believe our  recommendation is still valid for FEMA since, as stated in the agency\u2019s  response, its mission assignments are a significant component in the  establishment of a framework for governmentwide reporting on the status  of hurricane-related funding. However, as the intent of our  recommendation is to help ensure the Congress is receiving complete,  timely, useful, and reliable reports, we agree that other alternatives could  be considered to achieve the same objectives.

We met with FEMA  officials to discuss (1) the definitions of the terms obligations and  expenditures used in the report, (2) the process of FEMA issuing mission  assignments to agencies and the obligation of FEMA\u2019s funds related to the  mission assignments, and (3) the process of agencies seeking  reimbursement for goods and services provided in response to the disaster  relief work including FEMA\u2019s billing procedures.
