This report aims to provide Congress with the best possible understanding of the most recent estimates of sexual violence in eastern DRC and adjoining countries as it considers the range of policy options available to address the alarming incidence of such violence in the region. This report identifies and assesses available information on sexual violence in war-torn eastern DRC and adjoining countries.

Unlike case file data, surveys are conducted using the techniques of random sampling and their results are generalizable. However, there are limitations and challenges to using surveys to gather sexual violence data and estimate rates of violence, particularly in eastern DRC. Specifically, GAO found the following: (1) Three population-based surveys provide data on the rate of sexual violence in eastern DRC. The most recent survey, conducted in eastern DRC in 2010, estimated that 9 percent of the population had experienced some form of sexual violence in the 1-year period from March 2009 through March 2010. An earlier survey in eastern DRC conducted in late 2007 estimated about 16 percent of the population had experienced sexual violence over the period 1993 through 2007, although this survey did not employ the standard survey estimation techniques used in the 2010 survey. The third survey was conducted in early to mid-2007 and estimated that about 8 percent of females in North Kivu and 6 percent of females in South Kivu had experienced sexual violence within the 1-year period preceding the survey. (2) Two population-based surveys for Uganda--the only adjoining country for which such information is available--provide data on the rate of sexual violence. The most recent survey, conducted in 2010 in four districts in northern Uganda, estimated less than 0.5 percent of the population reported experiencing sexual violence at the hands of armed groups in the 1-year period from April 2009 to April 2010. An earlier survey conducted nationwide in Uganda in 2006 estimated 39 percent of females and 11 percent of males had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetimes. (3) There are limitations and challenges to using population-based surveys to gather data and estimate rates of sexual violence, particularly in war-torn areas like eastern DRC. For example, there can be undercoverage due to poor infrastructure and insecurity which can limit access to some areas; underreporting, as survey response rates partly depend on whether or not sexual violence victims are willing to discuss such difficult experiences; and higher survey costs if large sample sizes are required. (4) Case file data, such as data collected by medical service providers or law enforcement agencies on sexual violence victims, can provide indicators that sexual assaults are occurring in certain locations and can help service providers respond to the needs of victims. However, since case file data are based on a nonrandom sample, the results of analyzing such data are not generalizable. Also, UN officials and others noted that case file data are largely anecdotal and not uniform, and service providers are generally hesitant to share their data with outside parties. This report does not contain recommendations. GAO provided a draft of this report to State and other relevant agencies for review and comment. These agencies reviewed the report and responded that they did not have comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Large numbers of civilians in war-torn areas of the Democratic Republic  of the Congo (DRC) have been the victims of horrific sexual violence,  including rape, mutilation, and sexual slavery carried out by armed  groups. According to United Nations (UN) and U.S. officials, researchers,  and nongovernmental organization (NGO) representatives, sexual  violence\u2014a form of gender-based violence\u2014includes any sexual act,  attempted or perpetrated, such as rape or sexual slavery, carried out  against the will of someone, whether male or female. Sexual violence has  been perpetrated against the civilian population (men, women, and  children) by members of illegal armed groups and some Congolese  national military units, as well as by other civilians. While opportunistic  acts of sexual violence occur, members of illegal armed groups and  Congolese military units also use sexual violence to exact revenge on  communities for their perceived cooperation with rival groups. Sexual  violence has been a feature of conflict in the DRC at least since the  Congolese civil war of the mid-1990s.", "Although warfare between the DRC and its neighbors has officially ended,  conflict, especially in the eastern part of the DRC, has persisted.  According to UN officials, U.S. agency officials, and subject matter  experts, the entire DRC has been affected by war to varying degrees, but  North Kivu, South Kivu, and the Ituri District in Orientale Province  (hereafter referred to as eastern DRC) continue to suffer from ongoing  conflict and violence and are considered war-torn; three countries that  border eastern DRC are Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi.", "There are two basic types of data on sexual violence from war-torn  eastern DRC and adjoining countries: (1) data from population-based  surveys, and (2) case file data, such as data collected by medical service  providers or data collected by law enforcement or international entities on  sexual violence victims. Population-based surveys identify the extent of  something specific (such as whether a respondent has been sexually  assaulted) within a given population based on participants\u2019 responses.  According to some UN officials and NGO representatives, analyzing case  file data helps service providers better understand the conditions on the  ground in eastern DRC so they can better address sexual violence and  assist sexual violence victims. Between the two basic types of data on  sexual violence, data from population-based surveys provide information  that is more appropriate for estimating a rate of sexual violence because  such surveys are conducted using the techniques of random sampling (as  opposed to nonrandom sampling, such as reviewing medical or clinical  intake records), and their results are generalizable to a target population.", "This report responds to a requirement in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.

We also interviewed relevant officials and  representatives from these entities regarding data collected on sexual  violence in eastern DRC and adjoining countries. We identified five recent  population-based surveys that contain estimates on rates of sexual  violence in eastern DRC and adjoining countries. We evaluated the  methodological strengths and shortcomings of these existing estimates by  discussing the specifics of these surveys with researchers and  statisticians specializing in the scientific measurement of human rights  issues, and conducting a rigorous analysis of each of the five relevant  surveys to identify their respective strengths and limitations. We also  reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Standards and  Guidelines for Statistical Surveys and derived a number of survey  research principles relevant to assessing the surveys.

It was colonized in 1885 as a  personal possession of Belgian King Leopold II, administered by the  Belgian government starting in 1907, and achieved independence from  Belgium in 1960. For almost 30 years of the postindependence period,  the DRC was known as Zaire and was ruled by an authoritarian regime  under Joseph Mobutu. Following the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, some  perpetrators of the genocide and refugees fled into eastern DRC. See  figure 1 for a map highlighting eastern DRC and countries that border  eastern DRC.", "The Mobutu regime was toppled in 1997 by Laurent Kabila, who led a  rebel group from eastern DRC with the assistance of Rwanda and  Uganda. Kabila was assassinated in 2001 and leadership shifted to his  son, Joseph Kabila. During the period of the senior Kabila\u2019s regime, the  nation experienced a period of civil war during which numerous rebel  groups, with the assistance of Rwanda, Uganda, and other neighboring  countries, captured significant parts of the DRC. The war continued into  the regime of Joseph Kabila, and resulted in the deaths of an estimated  5.4 million people by 2007.", "After decades of instability and war, the central government in the capital,  Kinshasa, currently has little administrative capacity and control over  remote regions, such as eastern DRC. The lack of control is exacerbated  by the long distances and the rudimentary infrastructure, which make  transportation and communication difficult. While the precise magnitude  of sexual violence in the DRC is difficult to establish, the high number of  sexual assaults in the DRC, and the severity of these assaults, has  attracted the attention of the international community, including the U.S.  government, other foreign governments, the UN, and NGOs. State has  identified the DRC as a priority focus for U.S. efforts to prevent and  respond to violence against women and girls. In August 2009, Secretary  of State Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled to the city of Goma in North Kivu  in eastern DRC, where she met with victims of sexual violence and the  providers of medical and other services to those victims; while in Goma,  the Secretary announced $17 million in funding to assist female victims of  sexual violence in the DRC. Additionally, State and USAID coordinate  multiple programs in the DRC designed to assist the victims of sexual  violence, including through legal aid to facilitate prosecutions.", "The UN Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) was first deployed to  the DRC in 1999 to support the implementation of a cease-fire  agreement. Over the past 11 years, MONUC has steadily grown in size  from an initial force of about 5,500 troops to its authorized size, through  June, 30, 2011, of more than 20,000 total military and police personnel.  MONUC\u2019s mandate prioritizes the protection of civilians. In 2010, MONUC  was renamed the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) to reflect an increased  emphasis on stabilization. The United States is the largest donor to  MONUSCO, contributing almost one-third of MONUSCO\u2019s $1 billion  annual budget. In addition, in early 2010, the UN Secretary General  appointed Margot Wallstr\u00f6m as Special Representative for the Secretary  General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. The primary role of the Special  Representative is to keep the issue of sexual violence in the forefront of  public and diplomatic dialogue. A number of NGOs are also active in  addressing sexual violence in the DRC through providing medical, legal,  and vocational training services to victims of sexual violence; researching  sexual violence issues; and advocating for specific policies and  prevention mechanisms to end the violence and/or provide assistance to  sexual violence victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on the Rate of Sexual Violence in War-Torn Eastern DRC and Adjoining Countries", "paragraphs": ["We identified five population-based surveys, shown in table 1 below, that  provide data on the rate of sexual violence in eastern DRC and Uganda.", "We identified three population-based surveys for eastern DRC that  provide data on the rate of sexual violence: (1) a survey by McGill  University researchers in partnership with the Uniformed Services  University of the Health Sciences and others (McGill University), (2) a  survey by the UC Berkeley Human Rights Center (UC Berkeley), and (3)  a survey by the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Planning  with support of the Ministry of Health. All three surveys were conducted  since 2006 and utilized random sampling of the population in parts of  eastern DRC to identify whether respondents had been the victims of  sexual violence, among other things.", "McGill University Survey (2010)", "Data from a survey conducted by McGill University in 2010 estimated that  9 percent of the population had experienced sexual violence in the 1-year  period from March 2009 through March 2010, and 13 percent of the  population had experienced sexual violence in the 2-year period from  March 2008 through March 2010. The McGill University survey found  that self-reported sexual violence and other human rights violations were  prevalent in specific territories of eastern DRC. Over the period covered  by the survey\u20141994 through 2010\u2014the survey estimated about 33  percent of the population had experienced some form of sexual violence.", "The McGill University survey employed a rigorous methodology and  utilized generally accepted survey design, implementation, and analysis  principles. The survey was conducted in March 2010 and provides the  most recent information on the rate of sexual violence in eastern DRC.  The survey employed statistical weighting, a procedure used when  deriving generalizable estimates from a complex sample. The survey  estimates are also accompanied by 95 percent confidence intervals,  which give an indication of the precision of estimates. Additionally, the  survey was designed as a multistage cluster survey. This multistage  cluster survey included stratification by region, a technique that ensures  representation across geographic areas, and clustering of villages, a  typical practice for household surveys in developing countries that can  reduce the cost of conducting a survey by reducing the number of  locations to which interviewers must travel.", "However, the findings from the survey conducted by McGill University are  not generalizable to the entire population in eastern DRC. Some of the  villages in eastern DRC were inaccessible because of security concerns,  difficult terrain, or poor infrastructure; consequently, the survey is  generalizable only to certain territories surveyed in eastern DRC. The  territories of Mwenga and Walikale in eastern DRC are not represented in  this survey, and if the rates of sexual violence were higher in these areas,  then the overall rate of sexual violence identified in this survey would be  an underestimate. For example, according to UN officials, more than 300  people were mass-raped in 13 villages in Walikale, North Kivu, by armed  groups between July 30 and August 2, 2010. Figures on this attack and  others like it in Mwenga or Walikale would not have been captured in this  survey, if any occurred.", "UC Berkeley Survey (2007)", "A survey conducted by UC Berkeley, in partnership with the International  Center for Transitional Justice and the Payson Center for International  Development at Tulane University, in late 2007, estimated about 16  percent of the population had experienced sexual violence over the  period 1993 through 2007. Additionally, the survey estimated that 23  percent of the population had witnessed an act of sexual violence in their  lifetimes. The UC Berkeley survey was conducted between September  and December 2007 on attitudes about peace, justice, and social  reconstruction in eastern DRC. It was designed similarly to McGill  University\u2019s, as a multistage cluster survey, but it is difficult to assess the  accuracy of the survey because it did not employ the standard survey  estimation techniques used in the 2010 survey conducted by McGill  University. UC Berkeley followed generally accepted survey design and  implementation principles, but the analysis did not employ the use of  statistical weights. The use of weights is a generally accepted analysis  procedure when deriving generalizable estimates from a complex sample.  Although researchers at UC Berkeley planned for a self-weighting sample  (one where every element in the population has the same probability of  being selected), the final sample was not self-weighting. The decision not  to use weights in the analysis of the survey data means that we cannot  conclude how different the reported estimates of sexual violence rates  from this survey are from what would have been otherwise obtained had  the data been weighted using complex sample design formulas. In  addition, reporting of estimates is generally accompanied by a measure of  precision, such as a margin of error or a confidence interval. As this  survey does not provide a margin of error, it means that we cannot  assess the precision of its estimates.", "DRC Ministry of Planning  Survey (2007)", "The Democratic Republic of the Congo Demographic and Health Survey  was conducted nationwide from January to August 2007 by the DRC  Ministry of Planning with the support of the DRC Ministry of Health and a  number of foreign government, international, and nongovernmental  organizations, including USAID, various UN agencies, and the World  Bank. The survey estimated that in North Kivu and South Kivu  provinces, about 8 percent and 6 percent of females between the ages of  15 and 49, respectively, had experienced sexual violence within the 1- year period preceding the survey. The survey also estimated that in North  Kivu and South Kivu provinces about 25 percent and 18 percent of  females, respectively, had experienced sexual violence at some point in  their lives.

This limitation can be due to several factors. Some  researchers said in eastern DRC it can be because villages are  inaccessible because of security concerns or lack of transportation  infrastructure, especially in remote villages in eastern DRC where  violence is ongoing or likely. According to researchers, accessing  insecure and/or remote locations to conduct surveys could require  procuring security services, which can drive up the cost of the survey.  Surveys that suffer from undercoverage are limited because their results  can be generalized only to certain areas. For example, as previously  noted, the survey conducted by McGill University is generalizable only to  certain territories surveyed in eastern DRC; the territories of Mwenga and  Walikale in eastern DRC are not represented in this survey, and the  survey\u2019s results cannot be generalized to these territories.", "In addition, several UN officials and NGO representatives said that  conducting population-based surveys on sexual violence is especially  challenging in eastern DRC because of the sensitive nature of asking  survey respondents to reveal that they have been victims of sexual  violence and the fear of social stigma that can result from revealing such  victimization. Thus, according to U.N. officials, NGO representatives, and  researchers, data from population-based surveys may suffer from  underreporting because response rates depend, in part, on whether or  not victims are willing to discuss experiences of sexual violence. In  addition, survey respondents may hesitate to report if they do not expect  that health services would be provided. Some U.S. officials and NGO  representatives said that conducting surveys in war-torn areas, like  remote parts of eastern DRC, where services are not available, can raise  the expectations of respondents that they will receive services;  consequently, such respondents can become frustrated if they do not  receive these services. Having services available is important because,  according to NGO representatives, when female victims discuss sexual  violence, they often disclose other issues, such as forced early marriage  and domestic abuse.", "Going forward, since the reporting requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act is  annual, information on any change in the rate of sexual violence from one  year to the next will be needed. Survey costs can increase if more precise  estimates are needed to determine whether the rate of sexual violence  has changed significantly between two points in time. Survey costs rise  because more precise estimates require a larger sample\u2014a larger  number of individuals\u2014from the population being surveyed than would be  the case for a survey that makes an estimate for one point in time. A main  component of cost for a population-based survey is the staff and other  resources required to survey a sample large enough to complete the  work. According to researchers we spoke to, the goals of their surveys  were to make estimates for one point in time. If the ability to detect small  year-to-year differences is desired, the sample size needed could  dramatically increase. This larger sample will not only drive up the cost of  the survey, but it may be difficult, compared with a sample needed for a  one-point-in-time estimate, to precisely measure whether the rate of  violence has changed significantly. See appendix II for an illustration of  how sample sizes will increase when more precise estimates are needed  to determine whether the rate of sexual violence has changed  significantly over time.", "According to UN officials and researchers, surveys conducted in eastern  DRC are hampered by a lack of reliable baseline census or population  data on which to base the surveys. One group of researchers noted that  reliable population data are seldom available in conflict areas. For  example, they told us that, using the most recent population data from  eastern DRC, a researcher could only estimate that DRC\u2019s population is  somewhere between 55 million and 70 million people. Inaccurate  population estimates can affect the estimated rates of sexual violence  resulting from population-based surveys. In addition, according to UN  officials and a researcher, population-based surveys will not capture the  stories of those outside the populations of surveyed villages, such as  civilians who have been abducted by armed groups and villagers who  have left their home villages to flee violence or poor economic conditions.", "As previously stated, population-based survey data are the more  appropriate type of data for estimating sexual violence rates. However,  results from surveys conducted on sexual violence may lack qualitative  details and contextual sophistication that can help policymakers  understand the context and conditions in which that violence has  occurred. According to some UN officials and NGO representatives,  analyzing case file data helps service providers better understand the  conditions on the ground in eastern DRC so they can better address  sexual violence and assist sexual violence victims. Also, some UN  officials noted that trend data (identifying local patterns of when, where,  and what type of violence occurs, etc.) can be more important than  determining the rate of sexual violence that is generalizable to a wider  population.", "For example, as previously noted, more than 300 people were mass- raped in 13 villages in Walikale, North Kivu, by armed groups between  July 30 and August 2, 2010. NGO representatives and UN officials noted  that the contextual details of the magnitude and severity of this mass  attack would not have been captured in a survey. According to some  NGO representatives and UN officials, the best source of real-time, in- depth information on the details of these attacks came from the case file  data collected by service providers. Also, surveys and their results may  not always capture the cultural context of those surveyed. For example,  one group of researchers said that in-depth interviews with males in  eastern DRC\u2014who had previously reported experiencing sexual  violence\u2014revealed that these males were actually reporting sexual  violence experienced by a female family member, such as a wife, rather  than by the males themselves.", "It is difficult to compare the results of different population-based surveys  because the methodological approach of each survey is typically  designed to meet the researchers\u2019 specific objectives. As a result, the  surveys can cover specific geographic areas, age groups of respondents,  and dates of data collection, and may vary in defining sexual violence.  For example, McGill University\u2019s survey covered specific parts of eastern  DRC using an in-depth questionnaire in 2010 to record exposure to  conflict-related sexual violence among adults 18 and older from 1994 to  2010. The survey conducted by UC Berkeley in 2007, on the other hand,  covered parts of eastern DRC as well as other parts of the country and  included one question on exposure to sexual violence among adults 18  and older. And the Democratic Republic of the Congo Demographic and  Health Survey, conducted nationwide from January to August 2007,  asked women about their experiences with sexual violence and breaks  out its data to include North Kivu and South Kivu but does not include any  data specifically for the Ituri District in Orientale Province. There are other  differences between the surveys as well; for example, while the McGill  survey asked respondents to identify if they had experienced explicitly  defined incidences of sexual violence (such as rape, sexual molestation,  or stripping of clothing), the UC Berkeley survey left the term \u201csexual  violence\u201d undefined and open to the interpretation of the respondent.  Also, in the UC Berkeley survey, interviewers were assigned to same-sex  respondents; the McGill survey did not explicitly match interviewers with  respondents of the same gender.", "In Uganda, the survey conducted by UC Berkeley in 2010 focused  specifically on four territories in northern Uganda and measured exposure  to sexual violence between 1987 and 2005 and from 2009 to 2010 among  adults 18 and older. In contrast, the Uganda Demographic and Health  Survey was a national survey conducted in 2006 on many different health  issues, including measuring lifetime exposure to sexual violence among  women aged 15-49 and men aged 15-54. UC Berkeley\u2019s survey in  Uganda, as in eastern DRC, left the term \u201csexual violence\u201d undefined and  open to the interpretation of the respondent.

While UNFPA officials acknowledged that case file  data are not appropriate for estimating a rate of sexual violence, they  stated that their case file data provide a useful tool for identifying patterns  such as the relationships between the perpetrator and victim, the profile  of victims, and where abuses are occurring.", "IRC representatives stated that IRC has been treating victims of sexual  violence and collecting its case file data on sexual violence in the DRC  since 2002. IRC has provided services to over 40,000 victims of sexual  violence since 2002, according to IRC representatives. IRC  representatives estimate that they treat 350-400 victims each month. In  the DRC, IRC works through eight service providers that include seven  national partners and one international NGO to provide services to victims  of sexual violence in two territories in North Kivu and six territories in  South Kivu. According to IRC representatives, these eight organizations  use the case file data that IRC collects to inform their programming for  victims of sexual and other types of violence in eastern DRC. IRC also  has a lead role in coordinating the Gender-Based Violence Information  Management System (GBVIMS) initiative with the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) and UNFPA. The initiative is designed to enable  service providers to safely collect, store, and analyze case file data on  reported sexual violence incidents. The objective of the initiative is to  enhance the collection and reliability of service provider-collected case  file data by simplifying and harmonizing data collection and enabling the  safe and ethical sharing of reported case file data. The initiative is  currently being piloted in North and South Kivu by IRC and was fully  implemented in Uganda in January 2009, according to a UN official.  According to this official, UNFPA and an international NGO are currently  evaluating the applicability of the initiative in Rwanda.", "There are other organizations that provide analyses of sexual violence in  eastern DRC using case file data from service providers. Notably, a report  produced by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative with support from Oxfam  America reviewed case file data on sexual violence victims that had  received medical care from Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, South Kivu. Also,  some advocacy NGOs, such as Human Rights Watch, publish reports  that include information on sexual violence in eastern DRC that is based  on case file data from service providers. Other organizations that provide  services to sexual violence victims, including Doctors Without Borders  and the International Committee of the Red Cross, collect and track their  own case file data, but will not share their data outside their organization  because of security concerns, including fear of retribution against victims  or their families and the possibility that victims could be ostracized by  their families and/or communities if their identities or experiences were  revealed.", "Besides UNFPA, there are other UN agencies that publish reports with  information on reported cases of sexual violence. For example, the  November 2010 Report of the Secretary General on the implementation  of Security Council resolutions 1820 and 1888 reported that there  were 15,314 and 15,297 cases of sexual violence in the DRC reported in  2008 and 2009, respectively. UN officials said that, in UN reports, the  totals of sexual violence cases reported are very likely underestimated for  a number of reasons, including the existence of stringent verification and  validation guidelines for UN agencies. Country reports on human rights  practices, drafted annually by the State Department, collecting  information on human rights from a number of sources, also include  information on reported cases of sexual violence.", "According to U.S. officials, UN officials, and NGO representatives, case  file data on sexual violence in Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi are limited  compared with data for eastern DRC. NGO representatives stated that  because of the ongoing conflict in eastern DRC, there are many service  provider organizations in that area assisting victims of sexual violence  and collecting data on services provided. According to these experts,  current case file data on sexual violence reported in Rwanda, Uganda,  and Burundi are generally not associated with any armed conflict. The  2009 and 2010 Department of State Human Rights Reports found the  following:  In Rwanda, courts tried 239 reported rape cases, of which 159 were  new and filed in court, and 1,463 cases were pending in court at the  end of 2010. The 2009 edition of the same report stated that the  police investigated 2,356 cases of rape and that 1,487 new cases of  rape were filed in court.", "In Uganda, rapes were underreported and few cases investigated\u2014 619 rape cases were registered with the police in 2009, of which 240  went to court, resulting in 12 convictions. The 2009 edition of the  same report indicated that 1,536 rape cases were registered with the  police in 2008.", "In Burundi, rape was underreported for cultural reasons, fear of  reprisals, and the unavailability of medical care. State reported that as  of September 2010, one NGO operating in Burundi received reports of  3,701 cases of rapes and domestic violence and a medical facility  received 742 victims during the year at its center for rape victims in  Burundi\u2019s capital. In the 2009 edition of the same report, State said  that the same NGO received reports of 3,019 cases of rape and  domestic violence during the first half of 2009. Another local NGO in  Burundi\u2019s capital reported receiving an average of 131 rape victims  monthly. Also, an international NGO working in partnership with a  medical facility in Burundi\u2019s capital reported that the medical center  treated at least 7,800 people who suffered from sexual violence over  the course of 6 years (from 2004 to 2009).", "Case file information on sexual violence from service providers can  provide useful insights on sexual violence and is useful to help service  providers adjust programmatic responses to assist victims of sexual  violence; however, it has shortcomings and biases that significantly limit  its utility for estimating the rate of sexual violence. Most important,  because case file data are not generated from a random sample, they  cannot be used to make generalized statements about the rate of  violence in a given area. In addition, service provider data have other  shortcomings and biases that significantly limit their utility for discussing  the rate of sexual violence.", "Case file data from service providers only record if and when victims of  sexual violence seek medical or other available services. According to UN  officials and researchers, service providers collecting these data rely on  victims visiting hospitals, clinics, or government or UN offices, which  depends on victims\u2019 access to these locations and interest in coming forth  to report victimization. UN officials said there are a number of factors that  can affect whether or not and how frequently a victim of sexual violence  will seek services at a facility, including (1) whether drugs or other  treatments are available at a facility, (2) whether a facility is open or  closed at particular days or times, (3) overcoming fear or lack of finances  to travel (often through insecure areas) to visit a facility, and (4) a  decision by some victims to forgo treatment if they believe they are not  seriously physically injured. Victims of sexual violence also have to  overcome social stigma to seek such services. UN officials also said there  can be significant time delays between when a sexual violence attack  occurs and when that attack is actually reported.", "Other factors can compound underreporting of sexual violence in eastern  DRC. NGO representatives said that males and children are also victims  of sexual violence in eastern DRC, but they rarely seek services and few  services are specifically designed for them. In addition, UN officials said  that while service providers record information on those seeking  assistance for themselves, other victims who cannot reach medical or  other care in time go unreported. Moreover, according to UN officials,  many victims seek medical assistance only when medical symptoms  significantly affect their well-being.", "UN officials, NGO representatives, and researchers noted that case file  data are largely anecdotal and not uniform, and are collected and  maintained in an ad hoc and confidential manner by service providers.  Because of the way case file data are collected and maintained, it is  unknown how many victims may be counted multiple times by the same  service provider or by different service providers. Some UN officials and  NGO representatives said that as data are collected and combined and  the number of reported cases of sexual violence increases, so does the  possibility of counting the same victim multiple times. According to UN  officials, the lack of a clear referral process between service providers,  the unclear identification of victims, and the flow of internally displaced  civilians also complicate efforts to collect and maintain reliable data on  recipients of services. However, some UN officials noted that the service  provider case data that UNFPA collects are verified by UN officials and  are subject to more stringent review processes than service provider case  data collected by other organizations.", "UN officials and NGO representatives said service providers generally are  hesitant to share their case file data with each other or outside parties,  such as the UN. UN officials said that in addition to striving to protect the  identities of sexual violence victims, service providers sometimes  compete over the limited financial resources available to assist victims  and therefore have little incentive to share their data with each other or  outside parties. UN officials and NGO representatives also noted that  service providers view their own case file data as the number of reported  sexual violence victims successfully treated by their organization.  Consequently, an increase in the number of reported sexual violence  victims successfully treated (i.e., their case file data) is viewed as a  positive indicator of successful programming because it means victims  are overcoming social stigma to come forward to seek the organization\u2019s  services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of State and Defense,  and to the United States Agency for International Development, for their  review and comment.

To  assess the rate of sexual violence in eastern DRC and adjoining  countries, we reviewed Section 1502(d)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.

We reviewed and analyzed  relevant reports and guidance issued by United Nations agencies,  including United Nations Population Fund reports on reported cases of  sexual violence in the DRC and the United Nations Comprehensive  Strategy for Combating Sexual Violence in the Democratic Republic of  Congo. We also reviewed various documents and reports by  nongovernmental agencies, such as the International Rescue Committee  (IRC), subject matter experts, and research organizations, such as from  the University of California (UC) Berkeley Human Rights Center, on  sexual violence and the application of scientific measurement to human  rights in the DRC and adjoining countries.", "During the course of our review, we interviewed officials from the  Department of State, the United States Agency for International  Development, and the Department of Defense.

To  evaluate the relative accuracy and methodological strengths and  shortcomings of these existing estimates, we interviewed and discussed  the specifics of these surveys with researchers and statisticians  specializing in the scientific measurement of human rights issues. In  addition, we conducted a rigorous analysis of the five relevant surveys  and identified strengths and limitations associated with each survey. We  also reviewed the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Standards  and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys and derived a number of survey  research principles relevant to assessing the surveys, which can be found  in appendix III. Although OMB\u2019s standards were not final until 2006, the  vast majority of OMB\u2019s guidelines represent long-established, generally  accepted professional survey practices that preceded the 2006 standards  by several decades.

This sample size may not be sufficient to compare across years.  Table 2 demonstrates how sample sizes must increase if more precision  is needed to determine whether rates of violence have changed  significantly from one year to the next. We started by assuming the Year  1 rate to be the proportion McGill University found to have experienced  sexual violence in the preceding year (9 percent). Then we looked at  various scenarios to see what sample sizes would be needed given a  range of changes in the rate.
