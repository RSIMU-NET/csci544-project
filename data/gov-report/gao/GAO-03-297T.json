Efforts to target cargo for screening are hampered by the quality of information regarding which cargo poses the greatest risk. New initiatives are under way to supplement these programs. The predominant focus of these initiatives has been to establish additional lines of security in the supply chain of international commerce. In essence, this means moving part of the security effort overseas, where goods are prepared for shipment into this country. These initiatives include such efforts as establishing international standards for ports, carriers, and maritime workers; stationing Customs personnel overseas; reducing security vulnerabilities all the way back to points of manufacture; and using new technology to monitor the contents and movement of containers from their point of origin. The nation faces three key challenges to implementing efforts to improve the security of ports and containers: creating and enforcing a set of security standards, ensuring the cooperation of diverse groups with competing interests when it comes to the specifics of how things are to be done, and paying the increased security bill.

Instead, Customs personnel rely on small, handheld radiation pagers that have a limited range and capability.

More than 95 percent of our non\u2013North American foreign trade arrives by ship. In 2001, approximately 5,400 ships carrying multinational crews and cargoes from around the globe made more than 60,000 U.S. port calls. More than 6 million containers (suitable for truck-trailers) enter the country annually. Particularly with \u201cjust-in-time\u201d deliveries of goods, the expeditious flow of commerce through these ports is so essential that the Coast Guard Commandant stated after September 11th, \u201ceven slowing the flow long enough to inspect either all or a statistically significant random selection of imports would be economically intolerable.\u201d", "As indispensable as the rapid flow of commerce is, the terrorist attacks of September 11th have served to heighten awareness about the supply system\u2019s vulnerability to terrorist actions. Drugs and illegal aliens are routinely smuggled into this country, not only in small boats but also hidden among otherwise legitimate cargoes on large commercial ships. These same pathways are available for exploitation by a terrorist organization or any nation or person wishing to attack us surreptitiously. The Brookings Institution reported in 2002 that a weapon of mass destruction shipped by container or mail could cause damage and disruption costing the economy as much as $1 trillion. Port vulnerabilities stem from inadequate security measures as well as from the challenge of monitoring the vast and rapidly increasing volume of cargo, persons, and vessels passing through the ports. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that various assessments of national security have concluded that the nation\u2019s ports are far more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than the nation\u2019s aviation system, where most of the nation\u2019s efforts and resources have been placed since September 11th.", "Guarding against the introduction of nuclear or other dangerous cargo into the United States involves having effective security measures at numerous points along the supply chain. Transporting a shipping container from its international point of origin to its final destination is a complex process that involves many different participants and many points of transfer. Many of these participants carry out their roles in the exporting country (see fig. 1). The actual materials in a container can potentially be affected not just by the manufacturer or supplier of the material being shipped, but also by carriers who are responsible for getting the material to a port and by personnel who load containers onto the ships. Others who interact with the cargo or have access to the records of the goods being shipped include exporters who make arrangements for shipping and loading, freight consolidators who package disparate shipments into containers, and forwarders who manage and process the information about what is being loaded onto the ship. Review by the Customs Service, which traditionally comes once the ship arrives at its destination, is likewise just one step in the transportation chain on the domestic side.", "Detecting smuggled fissile material that could be used to make a nuclear weapon is a difficult task not just because it is a potential needle in this vast haystack of international trade. It is also difficult because one of the materials that is of greatest concern\u2014highly enriched uranium\u2014has a relatively low level of radioactivity and is therefore very difficult to find with radiation-detection equipment. By contrast, radioactive materials that could be used in conjunction with conventional explosives to create a so- called dirty bomb are somewhat easier to detect, because they have much higher levels of radioactivity. Because of the complexity of detecting nuclear material, the Customs officers or border guards who are responsible for operating the equipment must also be trained in using handheld radiation detectors to pinpoint the source of an alarm, identifying false alarms, and responding to cases of illicit nuclear smuggling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Programs for Countering Nuclear Smuggling at Domestic and International Ports Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["Existing programs for detecting the smuggling of nuclear materials are spearheaded by the Customs Service and are directed mainly at the import side of the transportation chain.

Customs has deployed about 4,200 pagers among its 7,500 inspectors and expects every inspector to have a pager by September 2003.

With more than 6 million containers a year entering U.S. ports, examining them all has not been possible. Instead, Customs has acknowledged that its approach relies on reviewing shipping manifests, invoices and other commercial documents, and intelligence leads to target approximately 2 percent of the containers that enter the country nationwide for physical inspection, though the actual percentage varies from port to port. To better address terrorist threats, Customs is modifying its targeting approach, which was originally designed for counter-narcotics efforts. Customs officials told us that one of their greatest needs was for better information to more accurately target shipments.

For example:   The Coast Guard has its own screening process for identifying and boarding vessels of special interest or concern. Shortly after the September 11th terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard modified its ship arrival notification requirement. The modification requires all vessels over 300 gross tons to contact the Coast Guard 96 hours\u2014up from 24 hours\u2014 before they are scheduled to arrive at a U.S. port. Each vessel must provide information on its destination, its scheduled arrival, the cargo it is carrying, and a roster of its crew members.

The recent incidents at the Port of New York and New Jersey involving the Palermo Senator and the Mayview Maersk illustrate that basic questions remain about how actions should be carried out at domestic ports. In both cases, the Coast Guard had concerns about the vessels but allowed them to enter the port. In the case of the Palermo Senator, the ship remained at the dock for 18 hours after testing showed high levels of radioactivity. For the Mayview Maersk, the ship remained at the dock for 6 hours while the Coast Guard checked for explosives.", "These incidents illustrate the need for clearer definitions of responsibility and procedure.

That is, DOE, DOD, and the State Department have pursued separate approaches to installing radiation detection at border crossings, leaving some crossings more vulnerable than others to nuclear smuggling. Moreover, according to agency officials, U.S. assistance has sometimes lacked effective follow-up to ensure that the equipment delivered was properly maintained and used. Some equipment has sat idle for months or years for want of final agreements, reliable power supplies, or appropriate placement. For example, some equipment given to Estonia sat in an embassy garage for 7 months while an agreement governing its release was finalized; portal monitors sat in the U.S. embassy in Lithuania for 2 years because officials disagreed about whether a new $12,600 power supply was needed to run them; and one portal monitor delivered to Bulgaria was installed on an unused road. In many cases, countries that have received U.S. radiation-detection equipment were not systematically providing information to U.S. agencies about the nuclear materials they detect, making it difficult to determine the equipment\u2019s impact and effectiveness.

Concentrating on a small percentage of all containers, even with efforts to target high- risk cargoes, may not provide sufficient coverage. To widen coverage without bringing international commerce to a virtual halt, federal agencies are beginning to address those parts of the overseas supply chain that have received relatively limited attention, including country of origin. The main thrust of several new initiatives has been to create multiple lines of defense by pushing security beyond U.S. docks to include points of departure and, ultimately, places of manufacture. This is a fundamental change that involves viewing cargo security as an international effort rather than a national effort. Recognizing the important role that international organizations play in setting standards and procedures to facilitate international trade and enhance the security of the global supply chain, the United States is participating in these forums to help achieve these dual goals. To develop such international efforts, part of the federal government\u2019s effort must be on the diplomatic front as it seeks to forge security-related agreements in international forums, such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

The Coast Guard, through a contractor, has been developing a set of standards since May 2002 as part of its efforts to conduct vulnerability assessments at 55 major U.S. ports. The standards will cover such things as preventing unauthorized persons from accessing sensitive areas, detecting and intercepting intrusions, checking backgrounds of those whose jobs require access to port facilities, and screening travelers and other visitors to port facilities. In the past, the level of security has largely been a local issue, and practices have varied greatly. The standards are to be performance- based, meaning that they describe the desired outcome and leave the ports considerable discretion in how to accomplish the task.", "In our earlier work, we reported that effectively implementing such standards in U.S. ports, even with the authority of the federal government behind them, poses challenges. For example, at the Port of Tampa some major employers, such as ship repair companies, hire hundreds of workers for short-term projects as needs arise. Historically, according to port authority officials, these workers have included people with criminal records. However, new state requirements for background checks, as part of the credentialing process, could deny such persons access to restricted areas of the port. From a security standpoint, excluding such persons may be advisable; but from an economic standpoint, a company may have difficulty filling jobs if it cannot include such people in the labor pool. Around the country, ports will face many such issues, ranging from these credentialing questions to deciding where employees and visitors may park their cars. To the degree that stakeholders disagree on specific methods, or believe that specific security actions are unnecessary or conflict with other goals and interests, achieving consensus about what to do will be difficult.", "Developing and implementing standards across international lines is likely to present a formidable challenge as well, but doing so is essential to protecting the integrity of the international supply chain. Efforts to develop international standards are under way on several fronts, but much still remains to do. For example, security procedures for loading and sealing a container at the manufacturer\u2019s or consolidator\u2019s warehouse, or for transferring cargo from one mode of conveyance to another, are still under development. Likewise, international standards covering documentation on the contents of cargo containers and the credentialing of cargo handlers and port workers are still being discussed. Because of the number and diversity of nations and stakeholders involved in the international supply chain, achieving consensus on these and other standards could be difficult and time consuming."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shared Responsibilities Place a Premium on Effective Cooperation", "paragraphs": ["Effective cooperation is essential\u2014and not ensured\u2014even at the domestic level. As we have reported, one challenge to achieving national preparedness and response goals hinges on the federal government\u2019s ability to form effective partnerships among many entities. If such partnerships are not in place\u2014and equally important, if they do not work effectively\u2014those who are ultimately in charge cannot gain the resources, expertise, and cooperation of the people who must implement security measures.", "Our reviews of domestic seaports have found that such partnerships can break down even when procedures are supposedly in place. For example, at the Port of Honolulu, a security plan exists that calls for notifying the Coast Guard and local law enforcement authorities about serious incidents. One such incident took place in April 2002 when, as cargo was being loaded onto a cruise ship, specially trained dogs reacted to possible explosives in one of the loads, and the identified pallet was set aside. Despite the notification policy, personnel working for the shipping agent and the private company providing security at the dock failed to notify either local law enforcement officials or the Coast Guard about the incident. A few hours after the incident took place, Coast Guard officials conducting a foot patrol found the pallet, and, when told about the dogs\u2019 reaction, immediately notified local emergency response agencies. Once again, however, the procedure was less than successful because the various organizations were all using radios that operated on different frequencies, making coordination between agencies much more difficult. Fortunately, the Honolulu incident did not result in any injuries or loss.", "Just as efforts to enhance port security in the domestic environment require the collaboration of many public and private parties, the challenges internationally require cooperation and collaboration by a wide array of stakeholders. Clearly, there are important initiatives moving forward in the four major international institutions outlined above\u2014on port and carrier standards in the IMO, on customs procedures in the WCO, on seafarer and port worker documentation in the ILO, and on standards for electronic container seals in the ISO. Each organization is made up of individual nations contributing different levels of development, maritime activity, and economic capacity. Admiral James M. Loy, former Commandant of the Coast Guard and current Acting Director of TSA, has emphasized that reaching global agreements is critical, noting that \u201cinternational and domestic cooperation, both civil and military, is essential\u2026because we can\u2019t hope to ensure our security by working alone or by waiting until the threats have already crossed the thresholds of our ports.\u201d Although many cooperative efforts are under way to address supply chain security, achieving consensus among the diverse parties on a number of matters in this area and forging comprehensive agreements to address them will be challenging."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Issues Are Pivotal", "paragraphs": ["Many of the planned security improvements at seaports will require costly outlays for infrastructure, technology, and personnel. Even before September 11th, the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports estimated that the costs for upgrading security infrastructure at U.S. ports will range from $10 million to $50 million per port. Officials at the Port of New York and New Jersey estimate their capital costs for bringing the port\u2019s security into compliance with the port\u2019s vulnerability assessment at $73 million. The federal government has already stepped in with additional funding for port security, but demand has far outstripped the additional amounts made available.", "International ports also may face funding challenges similar to those faced by ports in the United States. Recently, at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta echoed this sentiment, saying that implementation of security measures to ensure safety of passengers and goods may challenge the resources of foreign economies. However, the extent of any fiscal challenges faced by specific foreign ports is unknown at this point.", "In summary, Mr. Chairman, the nation\u2019s approach to dealing with nuclear smuggling is both to develop entirely new lines of defense overseas and to shore up those defenses that are already in place in the nation\u2019s ports. The challenges domestically are well known and well chronicled: ports remain susceptible to weapons of mass destruction, with neither our best technology nor a set of clear standards and procedures in place. The challenges overseas could be much the same. Just as inconsistent standards and security vulnerabilities among domestic ports could lead terrorists to seek the path of least resistance, overseas ports that do not adopt strong security standards may attract the attention of those hoping to inflict harm on America. At the domestic level, the challenges faced can be mitigated somewhat by the fact that stakeholders ultimately share the same goals of national security. Although all countries involved in international commerce may share the basic goal of secure trade and may share commitment, foreign countries may vary greatly in their understanding of, vulnerabilities to, and capabilities to address the threats involved.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
