First, some aspects of the proceedings limit public access, but addressing them is largely outside of DOD's control. For example, proceedings, by law, are held on NSGB\u2014a location that is largely inaccessible to the general public. Further, cases currently before the military commissions have spent 4-10 years in pre-trial hearings with trials yet to be scheduled, which some suggest has lessened media coverage and public visibility. Second, there are other challenges that DOD officials have acknowledged that they have a greater ability to address. For example, the courtroom gallery is limited to 52 seats for those permitted to travel to NSGB. Additionally, all five CCTV sites are located within a span of 600 miles on the East Coast of the United States. However, victims and their family members\u2014the primary intended users of these sites\u2014often live a significant distance from these locations.", "A number of options may potentially address some of the public access challenges identified. DOD could potentially expand the viewing gallery to accommodate more people as part of an ongoing project to renovate the NSGB courtroom. However, DOD officials cautioned that it would require a commensurate increase in the lodging needed to house more visitors, which may not be supported by current levels of resources. Further, DOD has two potential options for addressing challenges with the remote viewing of proceedings. First, DOD could potentially increase the number and geographic dispersion of CCTV sites. Second, DOD could potentially maximize public access by broadcasting proceedings via the television or internet. DOD officials acknowledged that both options are possible and likely would require a relatively small outlay of resources. However, broadcasting proceedings via the television or internet is currently prohibited by DOD's regulation, and DOD officials were especially concerned with the security implications of this option.", "DOD has not assessed the tradeoffs nor identified or analyzed the risks of options for expanding public access to military commissions' proceedings. Consequently, DOD has not developed a strategy to address challenges or identified the resources needed to achieve its public access goals.

In addition, we attended military commissions\u2019 proceedings  on NSGB and while visiting relevant facilities, in April and May 2018. To  supplement our observations, we interviewed relevant DOD officials to  discuss how DOD facilitates public access to commissions\u2019 proceedings.  We also observed hearings at the Fort Meade, Maryland Closed Circuit  Television (CCTV) site, visited the Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia CCTV  site, and interviewed DOD officials working at both locations to  understand and observe how the public utilizes these facilities to view  commission s\u2019 proceedings remotely. Further, we reviewed relevant  documentation on DOD\u2019s assistance to victims and family members and  discussed these efforts with department officials. Also, we reviewed a  variety of content on the Office of Military Commission\u2019s (OMC) website to  determine what information is available to the public about access to  military commissions\u2019 proceedings and how it is organized.", "For our second objective, we reviewed applicable sections of the United  States Constitution, U.S. statute, and relevant case studies of terrorism  trials in federal court (case studies), executive orders, DOD guidance and  policy, and relevant reports to understand the legal and policy issues  related to public access to both military commissions\u2019 proceedings and  certain terrorism trials conducted in federal court. In addition, we  gathered information from DOD officials, victims and family members, and  non-government stakeholders to identify whether there are any  challenges that DOD faces in facilitating public access. Specifically, we  conducted a non-generalizable survey of victims and their family  members to determine the extent to which respondents support various  potential options for expanding public access and their views on the  timeliness of court document postings to OMC\u2019s website. Of the 2,640  victims and family members that we surveyed, 248 responded. We  anticipated a fairly low response rate because of sensitivities related to  surveying victims and family members about terrorist events. Therefore  the survey results reflect the views of only those who responded, who  provided relevant and important views, which we combined with  information gathered through additional methodologies. Also, we informed  our methodology approach and survey development through interviews and other communications with representatives from eight victim\u2019s  organizations. Further details regarding the survey methods are  described in appendix II.", "As discussed previously, for the purposes of this report, we defined  victims as those who were directly affected by the attack on the USS  Cole, the events of 9/11, or other terrorist attacks associated with  commissions\u2019 cases in the scope of our review. We defined a family  member as a person who is related to a victim. Similarly, we developed a  standardized set of 10 questions that was used to obtain the perspectives  of 55 selected non-government stakeholders on challenges to public  access to military commissions\u2019 proceedings. We analyzed responses  from the completed questionnaires to determine the extent to which  respondents support various potential options for expanding public  access as well as their views on other issues, such as the timeliness with  which court documents are posted to OMC\u2019s website. Our analyses of  both groups\u2019 responses were incorporated into each objective to  supplement our observations, as appropriate.", "Also, we gathered data from an inter-agency review team that reviews  documents to be posted on OMC\u2019s website, as well as the website itself,  and analyzed these data to determine the timeliness of information  posted to the website. In regard to data from the inter-agency review  team, we obtained and analyzed data on when court documents were  filed with OMC and the date on which the inter-agency review team  returned them to OMC for posting, comparing that amount of time to a  timeliness standard laid out in DOD\u2019s Regulation for Trial by Military  Commission (Regulation). According to the Regulation, DOD is  supposed to post documents to the OMC website generally no later than  15 business days after documents have been filed with OMC\u2019s Trial  Judiciary, known as the \u201cfile date.\u201d We performed reliability assessments  on the data obtained from the inter-agency review team on the posting of  court documents on the commissions\u2019 website.

We selected  these two dates because it allowed us to compare the time DOD took to  post court documents to its website with the department\u2019s timeliness  standard. Using our analysis of data obtained from the inter-agency  review team as well as from OMC\u2019s website, we determined the extent to  which DOD posted court documents in a timely manner.", "For our third objective, we reviewed relevant reports to identify potential  options for expanding public access to commissions\u2019 proceedings and  any concerns associated with doing so, and discussed these issues with  DOD officials, victims and family members, and non-government  stakeholders. We also met with DOD officials to discuss any efforts the  department had underway to determine the tradeoffs associated with  potential options. We then compared these efforts with Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, which state an agency should  identify and analyze risks related to achieving its defined objectives, and  to leading practices for sound strategic management planning. We also  compared these DOD efforts to selected principles of effective federal  strategic planning that state, among other things, that it is good practice  for agencies to develop a strategy to address management challenges  and to identify resources needed to achieve goals.

Similarly, a member of the media told us that the conditions of  reporting the commissions\u2019 proceedings are \u201can extreme hindrance.\u201d This  member of the media noted that while at NSGB, visitors have access to  limited and unreliable internet and telephone service. This has made  covering the trials \u201cextremely difficult,\u201d according to the freelance  journalist because the cost, lack of resources and unreliable schedule  make it increasingly difficult to take a week away from reporting on other  events \u201cin order to cover only a couple of days of open hearings.\u201d", "For many of the non-government stakeholders included in our review,  their role as observers, scholars, or reporters on the commissions\u2019  proceedings is not their full-time job. Instead, they do so as one part of  their professional responsibilities or as volunteers. In this context, they  told us generally that the time required to travel to NSGB due to  infrequent flights, the difficulty of working there, and the frequent closings  or cancellations of hearings discourage non-government oversight and  reporting on the proceedings. This, in turn, reduces the amount and  quality of the information that they can provide to the public.", "Also, while selected victims and family members and non-government  stakeholders are able to view proceedings in-person on NSGB, the vast  majority of the general public cannot, due to DOD policy. The exceptions  are\u2014according to a DOD official\u2014civilians traveling to NSGB on official  business and those who have a sponsor living at NSGB."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remote Viewing of Commissions\u2019 Proceedings", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s decision to locate all CCTV sites on military bases on the East  Coast of the United States has resulted in several challenges that limit the  current usefulness of CCTV sites in facilitating public access to  commissions\u2019 proceedings. First, all five CCTV sites are concentrated  within a 600 mile span on the East Coast of the United States. However,  victims and their family members\u2014the primary intended users of these  sites\u2014are located throughout the world or are concentrated in areas of  the United States that are a significant distance from one of these five  locations. According to our survey of victims and their family members, a  majority of those who responded (71 percent) said that it was important to  have the location of the hearings close to where they live. For example,  the victim and family member population served by DOD\u2019s Victim and  Witness Assistance Program has a significant presence in California and  Florida, as well as smaller populations in eight other countries. Further,  survey respondents from Texas, Florida, and the United Kingdom noted  that it was impractical for them to travel to the current CCTV sites,  especially considering the unpredictable hearing schedule. Figure 7  shows the location of the CCTV sites along with the dispersion of victims  and their family members served by DOD\u2019s Victim and Witness  Assistance Program.", "The logistics of traveling to the CCTV site at Fort Meade, Maryland\u2014the  only location open to non-government stakeholders and the general  public\u2014is also a factor that limits the public\u2019s access to information about  commissions\u2019 proceedings. For example, non-government stakeholders  who observe the commissions\u2019 proceedings and were included in our  review explained that the majority of their organizations are located in  cities that either do not have a CCTV site, or are not near a site to which  they have access. Examples include Los Angeles, California, and New  York City, New York. Non-government stakeholders also expressed that  there are challenges associated with the amount of time and travel it  takes to get to Fort Meade, which can be difficult especially when  hearings are often cancelled or closed with little or no notification,  according to these stakeholders. Further, although the CCTV site at Fort  Meade is open to the general public, DOD officials acknowledged that  there is no practical way for the department to advertise the availability of  the opportunity to view proceedings at the CCTV site on Fort Meade.", "In addition to the challenges of traveling to CCTV sites, some victims and  family members and non-governmental stakeholders noted challenges  regarding their ability to access military bases that host these sites. For  example, some victims and family members told us that they or their  relatives had been denied access to certain CCTV sites because,  according to DOD, they did not meet the department\u2019s definition of a  victim or family member. Further, non-government stakeholders who are  foreign nationals are required to be escorted while on Fort Meade, per  DOD policy. However, DOD officials told us that Fort Meade does not  always have the personnel necessary to escort these individuals, which  could preclude certain non-government stakeholders from being able to  access the site. Further, a senior DOD official acknowledged that by  locating CCTV sites on military bases, DOD is running the risk that\u2014in  certain scenarios\u2014no member of the public would be able to access the  sites. This is because, in the event of a threat to base security, it may be  closed to civilians who do not live or work on the installation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timeliness of Information Posted to the Commissions\u2019 Website", "paragraphs": ["As discussed previously, OMC\u2019s website is a key enabler of public access  to information about commissions\u2019 proceedings because it provides the  public with a way to retrieve unclassified court documents related to the  commissions\u2019 proceedings, such as legal motions and transcripts, and a  schedule of the proceedings\u2019 hearings. According to DOD\u2019s Regulation for  Trial by Military Commission (Regulation), court documents are provided  by OMC to an inter-agency review team, which examines them and  removes any classified or protected information that is identified. Once  this examination is completed, the inter-agency review team returns the  document to OMC to be posted to its website. DOD\u2019s Regulation\u2019s sets  a timeliness standard for reviewing and posting court documents\u2014noting  that the entire process generally should take no longer than 15 business  days. However, based on our analysis of available data, we determined  that DOD has generally not met this standard for the timely posting of  documents, which substantially limits public access to information about  proceedings.", "Specifically, we obtained and analyzed data on when court documents  were filed with OMC and the date on which the inter-agency review team  returned them to OMC for posting and found that from October 2011 to  October 2018, DOD frequently missed the timeliness standard laid out in  its Regulation. For example, since 2011, we found that 8 percent of court  documents reviewed by the inter-agency review team were returned to  OMC after the 15 business day standard. Further, we found that\u2014since  2015\u2014DOD missed its timeliness standard with greater frequency. For  example, approximately 7 percent of documents reviewed in 2015 were  returned to OMC after the 15 business day standard whereas in 2018,  more than 50 percent of the documents submitted for review missed the  timeliness standard. Our analysis of data from the inter-agency review  team is summarized in table 2.", "In addition to the data provided by the inter-agency review team, we  independently collected and analyzed data from the commissions\u2019  website on the filing and posting dates for more than 11,000 court  documents filed between June 19 and November 19, 2018. Our  analyses of these data further demonstrate DOD\u2019s challenges with timely  posting of court documents. For only one category of court documents\u2014 unofficial, unauthenticated transcripts from open hearings\u2014our analysis  of data collected from the website from June to November 2018 show that  these transcripts were posted in a timely manner. For the remainder, over  a five month period, nearly 1,300 court documents either remained  unposted or were posted to OMC\u2019s website after the 15 day business  standard. Furthermore, the total for the median number of business  days these documents were filed after the 15 business day standard  ranged from 90-103.5 days\u2014that is, from almost four months to more  than five months past DOD\u2019s timeliness standard. Table 3 summarizes  our analysis for the five cases in the scope of our review.", "We reviewed relevant case studies in federal criminal proceedings  involving both terrorism charges and certain matters related to  commissions\u2019 cases, and identified instances in which federal judges  adopted processes for review and release of classified documents that  are similar to processes specified in DOD\u2019s regulation. However, we also  identified differences, such as shorter timeframes in the federal court  systems for the government\u2019s review and public release of documents  with the potential for classified information. For example, in one case,  court security experts had 48 hours\u2014and in another, 72 hours\u2014to  complete this process.", "According to various non-government stakeholders, DOD\u2019s inability to  post court documents in a timely manner has negatively impacted their  ability to perform their role in facilitating public access to information  about commissions\u2019 proceedings. For example, according to our analysis,  DOD posted legal motions filed by the prosecution and defense teams a  median of 97 business days past DOD\u2019s timeliness standard; military  judges\u2019 rulings were posted a median of 69 days past DOD\u2019s timeliness  standard. One member of the media explained that DOD\u2019s delayed  posting of court documents limits their access to information needed to  justify travel to NSGB. They further explained that not being able to travel  to NSGB impedes their ability to conduct interviews and research about  the proceedings, which are needed to inform the general public. Similarly,  other stakeholders told us that they believe the delays in posting docket- related documents have made it difficult for them to assess the  proceedings and communicate their assessments to the public. According  to our analysis, DOD posted these documents a median of 99 business  days past DOD\u2019s timeliness standard. Further, for hearings held between  June 19, 2018 and November 19, 2018, we found that of the 74 docket- related documents filed with the court, three were posted in advance of  the hearing.", "We also found that the hearing schedule posted on the commissions\u2019  website\u2014the only official, publicly-accessible schedule of proceedings,  according to DOD officials\u2014frequently is not updated in a timely manner  to reflect schedule changes. According to DOD officials, this is because  information on schedule changes is often not provided to the webmaster  for timely updates, as the inter-agency review team is examining it; much  like the inter-agency review team does with court documents. As a result,  several non-governmental stakeholders told us that it is difficult to justify  the time and costs of traveling to Fort Meade, Maryland\u2014the only CCTV  site open to them\u2014given the risk of arriving only to learn that the  scheduled hearing has been canceled or closed to the public. We  observed the effect of these cancellations on public access firsthand  during our review. For example, we attempted to attend hearings at Fort  Meade on various occasions. On several of those occasions, the hearing  was canceled. While we learned this information directly from our DOD  contact, none of these changes were reflected on the website\u2019s schedule.  Also, when we asked for updates on scheduled hearings, multiple DOD  officials told us that we should not bother checking the website\u2019s hearing  schedule. Instead, they recommended that we check the Twitter feed of a  certain reporter who spends a lot of time at NSGB and routinely provides  updates on hearings. In addition, according to DOD officials, victims and  family members who attempt to access the website from certain locations  outside of the United States are sometimes unable to do so. OMC  officials are aware of this issue and an OMC information technology  expert told us that while OMC has tried to fix this issue several times, it is  based on security for the website.

OMC officials are aware of this issue and an OMC information  technology expert told us that while OMC has tried to fix this issue several  times, restricting access from certain locations outside of the United  States is based on security for the website.", "DOD officials acknowledged that they are regularly not meeting their  timeliness standard for posting court documents to OMC\u2019s website\u2014 something that they largely attribute to the volume of documents  submitted and the government-wide security classification review process  to which they are subjected. Specifically, in this process for the military  commissions\u2019 proceedings, there are two DOD and two non-DOD  intelligence agencies with the chief responsibility for conducting the  security classification review of court documents filed for commissions\u2019  proceedings. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is responsible for  coordinating the process and all four agencies may be required to review  a document depending on the type of information it contains.", "In accordance with DOD\u2019s Regulation and the interests of national  security, a review of certain documents submitted must be conducted to  confirm that such filings are in publicly releasable form. Due to the  multiple levels of review and depending on the amount and complexity of  classified information involved, intelligence agency officials told us that\u2014 in the course of the inter-agency review team\u2019s efforts\u2014it can take  anywhere from one day to several weeks to review a single document.  These officials also told us that it is very difficult to hire personnel with the  requisite expertise and experience to serve as reviewers, given that  classified information that may be in these documents can be complex,  esoteric, and decades old. Thus, it is unlikely that a significant number of  new reviewers could be hired to help expedite the review team\u2019s  processes. According to our review of available information from  intelligence agency officials, the agencies have a relatively small number  of personnel reviewing large numbers of documents.", "Further, those personnel responsible for reviewing OMC-related  documents spend only a portion of their time reviewing court documents  for the purpose of posting them on the commissions\u2019 website. This is  because inter-agency review team personnel are also responsible for  reviewing documents not released on the commissions\u2019 website.  According to a senior official from the review team, it has been tasked  with competing requests for document reviews that have impacted the  team\u2019s ability to review court documents for posting on OMC\u2019s website.  For example, the official explained that\u2014from May 2017 to February  2018\u2014the review team completed seven of these large-scale, time- sensitive tasks, involving about 31,400 pages of document review,  according to the official\u2019s estimate.", "Table 4 summarizes available information about the agencies\u2019 review of  court documents to be posted on the website.", "Based on our discussions with officials from DOD and the inter-agency  review team, factors such as\u2014the complexity of documents, relative  scarcity of qualified reviewers, and other document review tasks  unrelated to web posting\u2014are somewhat out of DOD\u2019s control. For  example, a senior official from the inter-agency review team explained,  the complexity of court documents is the responsibility of the prosecution  and defense teams that write them; the other document review tasks are  often driven by the schedule of individual cases or military judges\u2019 rulings.  However, there is a key factor driving the timeliness challenge that may  be in the department\u2019s control. According to our discussions with DOD  officials, they attributed document posting delays to a policy decision by  the department to subject the extremely large volume of court documents  filed\u2014including schedule changes\u2014to the same type of security review."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "A Number of Options Exist to Potentially Address Public Access Challenges, However Each Option Has Tradeoffs That Have Not Been Assessed by DOD", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Options Exist to Address Challenges That Are Well Supported by Victims, Their Family Members, and Non-Government Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["Through our review of agency documentation and discussions with DOD  officials, victims and family members, and non-government stakeholders,  we identified a variety of potential options for expanding access to  commissions\u2019 proceedings. We have organized these options into three  categories, as shown in table 5.", "The majority of both victims and family members who responded to our  survey and non-government stakeholders who responded to our  questionnaire support most potential options for expansion of public  access. Specifically, the majority of victims and family members who  responded to our survey supported six of the seven potential options  about which we asked. The majority of non-government stakeholders  supported seven of the ten potential options. There was general  agreement between these two groups on the potential options they  supported. This information is summarized in figures 8 and 9.", "Options exist that may potentially help DOD address the challenges the  public faces attending hearings at NSGB. Specifically, a physical  expansion of the courtroom viewing gallery that increases the number of  seats open to the public, along with a change in DOD policy to allow more  visitors, would enable NSGB to accommodate more people wishing to  view proceedings in-person. An OMC official responsible for management  of the office\u2019s infrastructure at NSGB acknowledged that an expansion of  the NSGB gallery and the number of the people it can accommodate is  theoretically possible, potentially in the context of an ongoing project to  renovate the complex of buildings that contains the courtroom, gallery,  and other facilities that support the commissions\u2019 proceedings.", "DOD officials expressed a number of concerns with this option. First, an  OMC official cautioned that expanding the gallery\u2019s capacity would likely  increase the cost of the current $14 million expansion project, though the  official was unable to estimate by how much. Second, an increase in the  number of visitors would require a commensurate increase in logistical  support\u2014for example, more lodging and utilities\u2014which an OMC official  said may not be supported by the current level of resources. Third,  according to an OMC official, an expansion of the gallery would require it  to be temporarily closed, thus delaying commissions\u2019 proceedings. This is  because, the official explained, the current courtroom is the only venue at  NSGB that can accommodate a multi-defendant trial and any highly  classified evidence required for the proceedings. Further, according to a  senior DOD official, renovation of the gallery will require it to be re- accredited before DOD could resume discussing highly classified  evidence in the adjoining court room. This could result in a substantial  increase in both the period of time in which the gallery and court room are  unavailable, as well as the cost of a renovation.", "In our review of DOD documents and discussions with department  officials, we learned that there may be ways to address some of these  concerns. For example, DOD is planning to accommodate at least some  additional visitors to NSGB. According to OMC documentation, it is  planning to support about 350 total attendees per week of hearings during  the trial phase of Khalid Shaikh Mohammad et al (2). This is an increase of about 260 percent, compared to the average total number of visitors for  a week of pre-trial hearings in this case."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Remote Viewing of Proceedings", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of relevant court documents and discussions with  DOD officials and stakeholders, we identified two broad categories of  potential options that may help DOD address the public access  challenges associated with CCTV sites: (1) adding or changing the  locations of CCTV sites and (2) broadcasting video from NSGB using  other technologies, such as the internet.", "CCTV sites: Additional CCTV sites\u2014that are more evenly distributed  across the country\u2014could potentially be established for the general public  or for use solely by victims and their family members. DOD officials  acknowledged that most military bases have the requisite technology and  physical infrastructure to host a CCTV site and that expanding the  number of CCTV sites would require a relatively small outlay of  resources. Further, they also acknowledged that there may be  opportunities to establish CCTV sites at locations other than military  bases, such as federal courthouses, which may help address the public  access challenges posed by bases\u2019 security procedures, such as foreign  nationals\u2019 difficulty when serving as observers or reporters.", "DOD officials noted however, that expanding CCTV sites would require  approval by the Secretary of Defense or a military judge, because\u2014 according to DOD\u2019s Manual for Military Commissions\u2014the broadcasting  of proceedings in the court room, to include video and audio recording or  television broadcasting, shall not be permitted. The military judge,  however, may permit contemporaneous closed-circuit video or audio  transmission. For example, the prosecution requested this permission in  2012 and the military judge authorized the transmission of all open  proceedings, by CCTV, to several sites. Similarly, based on our review  of relevant selected case studies of terrorism trials in U.S. federal court,  there are previous examples of federal terrorism trials using CCTV sites  for the benefit of the public, victims and family members. Further, DOD  officials were hesitant to support such an expansion based on their  perception that relatively few people have utilized the current CCTV sites,  but they were unable to provide complete or fully accurate and reliable  data on attendance of certain groups, such as the media and general  public. In addition, according to DOD officials, the demand for public  access during the current cases\u2019 decade-long pre-trial phase likely does  not represent the magnitude of future public interest, which DOD officials  believe will increase significantly once the trial phase begins.", "Television and internet broadcast: Broadcasting video of hearings via  other technologies, such as the television or internet would increase  opportunities for the general public to view commissions\u2019 proceedings  remotely. An OMC information technology expert told us that it would be  relatively simple and inexpensive to transmit the existing video feed from  the proceedings on NSGB to either television stations, such as C-SPAN,  or through the internet using the same cyber security protocols used for  CCTV sites. Further, internet broadcasts could either be password- protected so that they could be viewed only by a specific group, such as  victims and family members, or they could be made available to the  general public.", "This option raised mixed views from the experts and officials we  interviewed. According to Rule 806(c) of the Manual for Military  Commissions, television or internet broadcasting would require express  authorization by the Secretary of Defense\u2014and as previously noted\u2014this  rule is consistent with federal criminal practice which prohibits the  broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom. Legal experts  who we contacted had varying perspectives on this issue. For example,  officials from the Office of the Chief Prosecutor had concerns that parallel  those of the Judicial Conference of the United States\u2014the national policy- making body for the federal courts\u2014on the negative impact of cameras in  the courtroom on jurors and witnesses, among other reasons.  Specifically, the Judicial Conference cited concerns such as publicity that  could threaten jurors\u2019 privacy and witnesses that could be by subjected to  distractions, intrusions or influences. In contrast, a senior official in the  Military Commissions\u2019 Defense Organizations generally supported  television and internet broadcasting of proceedings. This perspective was  shared by the American Bar Association, which stated that it would  support adoption of such an initiative in the future to protect the integrity  of the military commissions\u2019 process and better educate the public about  these proceedings.", "Also, in our discussions with DOD officials, they too expressed mixed  perspectives regarding internet or television broadcast of proceedings  from NSGB. On one hand, according to an OMC information technology  expert, broadcasting is technologically possible and could use certain  existing security procedures. Specifically, because safeguarding  classified information is critical, any television or internet broadcast of  proceedings would use the same video feed currently transmitted to the  NSGB gallery and CCTV sites, and thus would use the same safeguards  provided by the 40-second delay previously discussed. Further, DOD  information technology experts suggested that using a limited internet  broadcast, it could be possible for DOD to create temporary viewing sites  almost anywhere they are needed; for instance, in a hotel conference  room. On the other hand, senior DOD officials expressed several  concerns regarding the security implications of broadcasting video  outside of the current CCTV framework. For example, they highlighted the  potential for adversaries of the United States to copy and alter the video  feed from an unsecured broadcast\u2014thus creating a new and inaccurate  record of proceedings that could be used as propaganda. Further, while  internet broadcasts could be password-protected for victims and their family members only, DOD officials were concerned that the size of the  group may make it more likely that the password would be shared with  people outside of the group.", "In regard to these concerns, DOD\u2019s technology experts suggested that  they could potentially be addressed, at least in part, by using security  procedures already in place at the NSGB gallery and CCTV sites.  Specifically, at the temporary viewing sites they proposed, DOD officials  would not allow recording of the video feed, following the rules currently in  place at NSGB and CCTV sites. However, regarding this proposal, senior  DOD officials conveyed force protection concerns for government  personnel and any attendees. For example, an official noted that there  have been investigations into allegations that OMC personnel have been  surveilled by unknown persons, both in the United States and overseas,  when on official travel. Also, in a relatively unsecure civilian location like a  hotel, DOD would not be able to enforce the rules of the commissions.  For instance, according to this official, if someone wanted to attend a  temporary viewing site but refused to relinquish their electronic recording  devices, per rules currently in place at NSGB and CCTV sites, DOD\u2019s  only recourse would be to call local law enforcement authorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timeliness of Posting Information to the Commissions\u2019 Website", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s Regulation suggests two possible approaches the department can  take when reviewing court documents, prior to posting on the website,  and one of these could help the department post court documents in a  timelier manner. The first approach would allow for an OMC security  classification expert to independently determine whether a court  document may contain classified information. If it is determined that the  document does not contain classified information, the document is to be  posted within 1 business day of it being filed. In contrast, according to  OMC officials, the second approach provided by the Regulation\u2014and  since at least 2014\u2014has been interpreted as directing that every  document filed must undergo a security review before it is posted to the  OMC website. As discussed previously, DOD officials told us that they  attributed the department\u2019s document posting delays to DOD\u2019s policy  decision to subject the extremely large volume of court documents filed,  including schedule changes, to the same type of security review. DOD\u2019s  practice has resulted in nearly every document filed with the commission  undergoing a security review before it could be posted to the OMC  website.", "However, at the end of our review, a military judge\u2019s ruling on a pre-trial  motion in the case of U.S. v. Khalid Shaikh Mohammad et al.(2) is  expected to substantially change DOD\u2019s previous practice of submitting  every document for security review prior to posting to the OMC website.  Specifically, in December 2018, a military judge found that DOD\u2019s  practice, based on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the  Regulation by the previously assigned military judge and the office of the  convening authority, resulted in all pleadings\u2014classified or not\u2014 undergoing a more laborious classification review intended for classified  (or arguably classified) filings. As a result, the military judge found that  compliance with DOD\u2019s timeliness standard has, since at least 2017,  been the exception rather than the rule. In this ruling, the military judge  ordered that commencing on January 16, 2019, the OMC Trial Judiciary\u2019s  Chief Clerk will instead send all filings that do not require a classification  security review directly to the OMC Webmaster for posting within one  business day of filing. Further, per the regulation, filings requiring a  classification security review will be sent to the inter-agency review team  to coordinate the classification review. Implementation of the military  judge\u2019s ruling is expected to reduce the volume of documents submitted  for security classification review and thus may improve the timeliness of  posting information to OMC\u2019s website."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Each Potential Option for Expanding Public Access Has Tradeoffs That DOD Has Not Yet Assessed", "paragraphs": ["Current law and DOD guidance establish a framework in which DOD and  military judges are to weigh the interests of public access to commissions\u2019  proceedings against other considerations, including national security. For  example, paralleling the statutory requirement for public access found in  the Military Commissions Act of 2009, DOD\u2019s Regulation for Trial by  Military Commission states that its goal is to make commissions\u2019  proceedings accessible to the public to the maximum extent possible,  consistent with the interests of national security, the rights of the accused,  and other interests protected by law. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government state that agencies should identify and analyze risks  related to achieving their defined goals. These standards also maintain  that\u2014based on an agency\u2019s assessment of risks\u2014it should design  specific actions as part of their response to the risks. However, DOD has  not yet assessed the tradeoffs made by maintaining its current approach  in pursuit of its goal of maximizing public access to the extent possible  versus expanding public access by implementing other options. This is  because the department has not yet identified these options and analyzed  the risks associated with them for expanding public access.", "For example, we spoke to senior DOD officials who expressed strong  support for public access to commissions\u2019 proceedings. While they were  not necessarily opposed to the concept of expanding public access, they  did express concerns about the potential risks and challenges associated  with how it may be achieved. Specifically, according to the former Acting  Convening Authority, open and transparent commissions\u2019 proceedings  are \u201cvery important,\u201d adding that public access must be weighed against  the need to protect the proceedings\u2019 large amounts of classified  information. Similarly, the current Chief Prosecutor for Military  Commissions stated that public access to commissions\u2019 proceedings is  \u201chugely important\u201d and that they are \u201cowned by the American People,\u201d but  also noted the importance of protecting classified information, especially  the sources and methods of the intelligence community. Further, the  current head of the Military Commissions Defense Organization, while  acknowledging the necessity of processes to protect classified  information, stated that \u201cnothing is more important\u201d than public access to  the proceedings, calling them \u201cthe most important cases of our lifetime.\u201d  While these officials generally acknowledge that there are tradeoffs to be  made, for example, in facilitating public access while protecting classified  information, they have not identified how this could be accomplished or  assessed the extent of the tradeoffs associated with any potential options  for expanding public access to proceedings.", "As discussed previously, there are a number of potential options for  expanding public access\u2014well supported by victims, their family  members that we surveyed, and non-government stakeholders. However,  DOD officials have cited various tradeoffs, in the form of concerns over  resources and national security, among others. While DOD officials\u2019  concerns may be warranted, until it fully assesses these tradeoffs by  identifying and analyzing the potential risks and challenges, it may be  missing an opportunity to expand public access. For example, DOD  officials have expressed concern with the potential cost and logistical  challenge of expanding the viewing gallery on NGSB. However, DOD  officials have not assessed such options for increasing public access to  proceedings at NSGB while weighing the risks of doing so\u2014such as cost  or potentially delaying hearings\u2014and not doing so\u2014such as the current  situation, with hundreds of victims and family members who have not  been able to attend hearings.", "Our prior work on leading practices for effective strategic planning has  also shown that agencies should define strategies that address  management challenges and identify resources needed to achieve their  goals. However, according to DOD officials, the department has not  developed a strategy that explains how DOD will achieve its goal of  maximizing public access to the military commissions\u2019 proceedings in the  context of public access challenges and the expected increase in demand  for public access, once the cases\u2019 trial phases begin. For example, DOD  officials acknowledged that there are large populations of victims and  family members who are \u201cunderserved\u201d by the current number and  locations of CCTV sites and that they need to be expanded. Further, the  former acting convening authority noted that there would be a substantial  amount of time required to plan for additional sites. Some DOD officials  estimate that there will likely be 12-24 months advance notice before  trials are held and therefore believe that this will provide sufficient time to  develop a strategy that addresses challenges with opening additional  sites. However, based on our discussions with DOD officials, this may not  be enough time given the substantial planning and coordination that will  need to take place within and outside the department on such efforts and  the lengthy lead time typically needed to secure additional resources  through DOD\u2019s budget process.", "For example, DOD officials told us that they do not have many facilities  anymore in urban communities, which necessitates that they have  partners in these areas to facilitate additional CCTV sites. DOD officials  said that they have tried working with government officials in New York  City\u2014a city with a high concentration of victims and family members\u2014to  identify ways to expand options for remote viewing of proceedings.  However, DOD officials said that the coordination has been challenging,  given management challenges\u2014such as finding adequate space that is  accessible for victims, family members, and the media\u2014and required  resources\u2014such as reimbursing the City of New York for required  security. In addition, while other agencies\u2019 facilities could potentially be  used, DOD officials noted that they have not begun coordinating with  other agencies because the trial dates are currently unknown. But, given  the logistical constraints and budget challenges, if DOD waits until the  announcement of a trial dates, the department runs the risk of not having  adequate time to plan and budget for a new CCTV site in New York City  or any other appropriate location.", "This example illustrates the complexities of addressing public access, the  usefulness of assessing the tradeoffs between DOD\u2019s current approach to  public access and options for expanding access, and a strategy that  addresses management challenges and identifies needed resources.  Until DOD comprehensively identifies and analyzes the risks of  maintaining its current approach compared with those posed by potential  options for expanding public access, it cannot be assured that it has met  its objective of maximizing public access to the extent possible.  Furthermore, until DOD develops a strategy, as appropriate, to deal with  potential options and describes how the department plans to achieve its  public access goals, it cannot ensure that it is well-positioned for the  substantial increase in demand for public access that is anticipated when  the commissions\u2019 proceedings move into the trial phase."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With the responsibility to carry out military commissions\u2019 proceedings for  cases that many believe to be the most consequential in United States  history, DOD also has\u2014according to its guidance\u2014the responsibility to  provide the public with as much access as possible, consistent with  national security interests. Although this is a complex set of  responsibilities, DOD has facilitated public access to commissions\u2019  proceedings in a variety of ways. These complexities and constraints  notwithstanding, there are a number of challenges posed to the public\u2019s  ability to access commissions\u2019 proceedings and obtain information about  the proceedings. While there are potential options to address these  challenges, there are also potential risks that need to be assessed.  Whether or not DOD should expand public access\u2014as outlined by these  potential options\u2014is a determination the department must make. Given  that the public\u2019s demand for access will most likely increase substantially  when the commissions\u2019 enter into their trial phases, the longer DOD waits  to determine its strategy, the greater the risk of not fully meeting the  demand from victims and family members, non-government stakeholders,  and the general public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Deputy Secretary of  Defense assesses the tradeoffs of potential options for expanding public  access to military commissions\u2019 proceedings by identifying and analyzing  associated risks, and, as appropriate, developing a strategy to implement  any viable options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the DOD, Department of Justice, and  relevant intelligence agencies for review and comment.

We attended military commissions\u2019 proceedings at U.S.  Naval Station Guantanamo Bay (NSGB) from April 30, 2018, to May 4,  2018 to observe how the public accessed and viewed the proceedings, in  person. During this visit we also visited the facilities relevant to public  access. For example, in the Expeditionary Legal Complex, where  proceedings are held, we inspected the courtroom where hearings occur,  discussing the equipment used to facilitate the 40-second delay used to  ensure that classified information is not transmitted to Closed Circuit  Television (CCTV) sites during open hearings. We also inspected the  gallery, from which the public watches hearings. In addition, we visited  facilities where certain of the accused are detained, discussing with DOD  officials the access granted by the department to visiting victims and  family members and non-government stakeholders. We also discussed  key issues with DOD officials, such as the Chief Prosecutor and the  Military Commissions Defense Organization.", "To observe how the public utilized remote viewing sites we viewed  military commissions\u2019 proceedings remotely at one CCTV site, and visited  another. These include Fort Meade, Maryland, which is a site for victims  and their family members, as well as being the site for use by the media,  non-governmental organizations, and members of the general public. In  addition, we visited the Norfolk Naval Station, Virginia CCTV site, which is  open to victims and family members only. In addition to watching the  hearings, we spoke with Office of Military Commissions (OMC)  representatives at the sites regarding their responsibilities and they  provided us with an overview of how the sites operate. In addition, to  determine what information was available on OMC\u2019s public website and  how it is organized, we reviewed its content, including the portion of the  site reserved for victims and their family members. Further, to obtain  information on how public access is provided in federal criminal courts,  we conducted interviews with officials from the Department of Justice and  the Administrative Offices of the U.S. Courts, also discussing with these  organizations whether they provided support to DOD\u2019s public access  procedures for the commissions\u2019 proceedings.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed applicable sections of the  U.S. Constitution, relevant case law, executive orders, DOD guidance  and reports from experts on public access to military commissions\u2019  proceedings to understand the role that current laws, policies, and judicial  precedence play in decisions about public access to military  commissions\u2019 proceedings. We then took selected examples of public  access issues at military commission proceedings and compared them to  the access afforded to the public at terrorism trials held in U.S. federal  courts. To identify and understand any challenges facing public access,  we obtained the perspectives of both victims and their family members  and other non-government stakeholders on any challenges associated  with public access to commissions\u2019 proceedings. We developed a non- generalizable survey to obtain perspectives on public access from a  sample population of victims and their family members associated with  terrorist attacks being adjudicated by military commissions\u2019 proceedings, such as the attacks on the USS Cole and September 11, 2001. See  appendix II for further details regarding our survey of victims and family  members.", "We also developed a standardized set of 10 questions that was used to  obtain the perspectives of 55 selected non-government stakeholders on  challenges to public access to military commissions\u2019 proceedings. The  questions were delivered to these stakeholders in the form of a self- administered questionnaire. To identify the non-government  stakeholders included in our review, we first obtained a list of the non- governmental organizations that DOD has approved to observe military  commissions\u2019 proceedings in-person at NSGB. These organizations  include victim advocacy groups, universities, civic organizations, and  independent professional associations. During the course of our review,  we identified additional individuals with relevant expertise, such as legal  and national security policy experts and members of the media whom we  also asked to complete our self-administered questionnaire.", "We pre-tested the self-administered questionnaire with four non- government stakeholders to ensure functionality and ease of  understanding\u2014after which we distributed the questionnaires via email to  the remaining non-government stakeholders included in our review. Of  the 55 non-government stakeholders who received our questionnaire, 25  completed it. The analysis was conducted by two analysts who reviewed  and coded responses according to a pre-determined coding scheme. A  third analyst was used to reconcile any conflicting conclusions from the  first two analysts. The results of our analysis were used to describe non- government stakeholders\u2019 perspectives in the report, as appropriate. We  supplemented data obtained through our survey and self-administered  questionnaire with interviews of victims and their family members, DOD  officials, and observers from non-governmental organizations to better  understand their perspectives.", "To assess the timeliness of information posted on OMC\u2019s website, we  gathered and analyzed data from an inter-agency review team that  reviews documents to be posted on OMC\u2019s website, as well as the  website itself. In regard to data from the inter-agency review team, we  obtained and analyzed data on when court documents were filed with  OMC and the date on which the inter-agency review team returned them  to OMC for posting; comparing that amount of time to a timeliness  standard laid out in DOD\u2019s Regulation for Trial by Military Commission  (Regulation). According to the Regulation, DOD is supposed to post  documents to the OMC website generally no later than 15 business days  after documents have been filed with OMC\u2019s Trial Judiciary, known as the  \u201cfile date.\u201d In regard to our analysis of data from OMC\u2019s website, we  collected this information using a \u201cweb-scraping tool\u201d that we developed  to regularly visit OMC\u2019s website and capture data about a court  document\u2019s file date and the date on which it was posted on OMC\u2019s  website. We selected these two dates because they allowed us to  compare the time DOD took to post court documents to the department\u2019s  timeliness standard. Using our analysis of data from the review team and  OMC\u2019s website, we determined the extent to which DOD posted court  documents in a timely manner. Please refer to appendix III for additional  details on the scope and methodology for our collection of data using the  web-scraping tool and our analysis of these data.", "For data provided by DOD, we performed a number of assessments. As a  result of discussions with the Defense Intelligence Agency about the  timeframes and completeness of available data, the agency clarified  timeframes and explained why the data are not fully complete. As a result  of these assessments, we determined that data from DOD on timeliness  of information posted to the commissions\u2019 website are sufficiently reliable to serve as one of several sources of information used to determine that  DOD faces challenges in the timeliness with which it posts court  documents to the commissions\u2019 website. In addition, through discussions  with OMC officials about the way information is added to the  commissions\u2019 website, we determined that the data we independently  collected and analyzed from the website are sufficiently reliable to serve  as another source of information used in our determination of challenges  that DOD faces.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed relevant reports to identify  potential options for expanding public access to commissions\u2019  proceedings and any concerns associated with doing so. To determine  potential options for expanding public access to the commissions\u2019  proceedings, we obtained the perspectives of victims and their family  members, other non-government stakeholders, and DOD officials on (1)  what potential options for expansion or improvement exist, and (2) any  associated concerns with potential options for expansion or improvement.  We conducted a survey of victims and their family members to determine  the extent to which respondents support various options for expanding  public access and their views on the timeliness of court document  postings to OMC\u2019s website. Similarly, we provided standardized question  sets to non-government stakeholders and analyzed responses from the  completed questionnaires to determine the extent to which respondents  support various options for expanding public access as well as their views  on other issues, such as the timeliness with which court document are  posted to OMC\u2019s website.", "Further, to examine the potential risks associated with these options for  expansion\u2014and ways to mitigate those risks\u2014we discussed these  potential options with DOD officials. Finally, we asked OMC officials to  identify any DOD-led efforts to assess the current level of public access to  commissions\u2019 proceedings. We then compared any related efforts with  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which state  that agencies should identify and analyze risks related to achieving its  defined objectives, and to develop leading practices for sound strategic  management planning. Further, we compared any related DOD efforts to leading practices of effective federal strategic planning, which we derived  in part from the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), as  updated by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, associated guidance,  and our prior work. To assess the extent to which DOD has applied  selected principles of effective federal strategic planning in its facilitation  of public access to military commissions\u2019 proceedings, we compared  actions DOD has taken to address challenges that it faced with meeting  its goal of maximizing public access, consistent with the interests of  national security, to these leading practices of effective federal strategic  planning.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to February  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Our survey population  was composed of the memberships of the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) Victim and Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) (1,928 eligible  members), which includes victims who were impacted by the attack on  the USS Cole, the events of 9/11, or other terrorist attacks, for which Hadi  Al-Iraqi is accused, as well as Massachusetts 9/11 Fund, Inc. (470 eligible  members), and 9/11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows (200 eligible  members). Membership in these organizations, and inclusion in our  survey population, was limited to those family members or surviving  victims who chose to join one or more of these organizations. In addition,  we added 42 other qualifying victims and family members (who may not  have been members of the three organizations) that we identified in  answers to a survey question that respondents were asked. Our survey\u2019s  population totaled 2,640 victims and family members, and we attempted  to contact each one in our survey.

All three of the organizations  preferred to retain their member contact information citing privacy  concerns, but agreed to send their membership unique usernames and  passwords provided by GAO via email that their members could use to  access the survey. Additionally, DOD VWAP also agreed to send postal  mail questionnaires provided by GAO to approximately 500 of their  members who did not have email addresses on record. GAO also  provided an introductory email or letter, and postal questionnaires. Survey  respondents received the email and used their associated username and  password to access the survey website, and before opening their  questionnaire, were required to change their password to further prevent  unauthorized access to their responses. Those respondents who received  postal mail questionnaires were given the option to complete the paper  questionnaire or to log into and complete the web-based version.
