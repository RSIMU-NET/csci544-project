As required, NNSA and its contractor developed a plan for starting operations at the UPF, which officials stated will likely occur in 2026. According to NNSA's plan, attaining full UPF operational capability will be the final step to enable NNSA to stop certain operations in Building 9212\u2014the oldest building with the highest nuclear safety risk at the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12)\u2014and turn it over to the Department of Energy (DOE) for final disposition by 2035.", "In managing the UPF project, NNSA obtained independent cost estimates for the four largest UPF subprojects whose total estimated costs exceeded $100 million. Such estimates are required by DOE policy and to satisfy limitations in appropriations laws. Moreover, based on its review of NNSA documents, GAO found NNSA used those estimates to help inform the UPF's approved cost and schedule baseline estimates. NNSA officials stated that they used information from the independent cost estimate and other sources to help negotiate remaining work with the contractor and finalize the overall UPF's baseline estimates before starting construction.", "Since GAO last reported on NNSA's broader uranium program in September 2017, NNSA identified and made progress in implementing the uranium program's scope of work that includes capabilities and other activities that are not part of the UPF project but are needed for weapons program.

NNSA conducts the vast majority of its uranium  processing at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge,  Tennessee. Several of Y-12\u2019s uranium processing facilities are  deteriorating to the point that they may pose risks to safety and NNSA\u2019s  future ability to meet its missions. For example, Building 9212, which  houses many key uranium processing operations (e.g., uranium  purification and casting), was built in 1945 and does not meet modern  nuclear safety requirements to withstand a seismic event (i.e., earthquake  and aftershock activity) or high-wind event.

In doing so, it redirected some processing  equipment and capabilities initially planned for the UPF to existing Y-12  buildings, which NNSA intended to upgrade. NNSA shifted the work and  costs of needed repairs and upgrades for these existing Y-12 buildings  into its broader uranium program rather than including them as part of the  UPF project. NNSA\u2019s uranium program consists of the following elements:  (1) new construction with the re-scoped UPF project; (2) technology  development projects that are expected to increase the efficiency and  effectiveness of uranium processing capabilities; (3) infrastructure  investments to extend the lives of its older facilities\u2014which NNSA calls  extended life programs; and (4) reduction of the amount of uranium  stored and used in its older facilities\u2014which NNSA calls a reduction in  material at risk.", "According to NNSA\u2019s high-level strategic plan for the uranium program,  NNSA\u2019s overarching objectives for the uranium program are to complete  the re-scoped UPF project for $6.5 billion by the end of 2025 and phase  out mission dependency on Building 9212\u2014the oldest building with the  highest nuclear safety risk.

In June 2012, the Deputy  Secretary of Energy approved an updated cost estimate range for the  UPF of $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion, with the latter being the project\u2019s  maximum allowable cost. However, by August 2012, the UPF contractor  concluded that the UPF as designed would not provide enough space to  house all of the uranium processing and other equipment.

Because of these risks, NNSA is  implementing a four-phase exit strategy to systematically phase out  mission dependency on Building 9212. According to NNSA\u2019s  September 2018 implementation plan for the exit strategy, the first  three phases focus on reducing inventory, system isolation and clean  out, and relocating capabilities from Building 9212 to other existing Y- 12 facilities or to the UPF once startup is complete. Building 9212 will  then enter a phase of post-operational clean out, during which  operations will be limited to simple processing, recovery, and  inventory accountability.

Constructed in the 1950s, the building\u2019s design  predates modern nuclear safety codes. It consists of three main  structures, and its current primary function is fabrication, which  involves metal machining operations for enriched uranium. As part of  the Building 9212 exit strategy, NNSA plans to move capabilities into  Building 9215, such as the uranium purification and the processing of  uranium metal scraps resulting from machining operations.

Further, appropriations acts since  fiscal year 2012 have included a limitation that prohibits the use of funds  to approve CD-2 (approval of the project\u2019s performance baselines for cost  and schedule) or CD-3 (approval to start construction) for capital asset  projects where total project costs exceed $100 million until a separate  independent cost estimate has been developed.

The  methodology outlined in the guide is a compilation of best practices that  federal cost-estimating organizations and industry use to develop and  maintain reliable cost estimates throughout the life of a government  acquisition program. According to the guide, developing accurate life- cycle cost estimates has become a high priority for agencies in properly  managing their portfolios of capital assets and in decision-making  throughout the process. A life-cycle cost estimate provides an exhaustive  and structured accounting of all resources and associated cost elements  required to develop, produce, deploy, and sustain a particular program.

According to the schedule guide, a well- planned schedule is a fundamental management tool that can help government programs use funds effectively by specifying when work will  be performed and by measuring program performance against an  approved plan. An integrated master schedule integrates all of the  planned work in the program, the resources necessary to accomplish that  work, and the associated budget, and it should be the focal point for  program management. This schedule can show, for example, the  completion dates for all activities leading up to major events or  milestones, which can help determine if the program\u2019s parameters are  realistic and achievable. An integrated master schedule may consist of  several or several hundred individual project or other activity schedules  that represent the various efforts within a program.

This plan outlines  three major risks associated with the UPF project that NNSA will need to  address so that the project can attain full operational capability:  1.  Capabilities and systems integration within the UPF. Addressing  this risk includes actions to ensure that all of the UPF\u2019s systems, and  the capabilities that those systems provide (e.g., casting, oxide  production), can function together as designed through testing.  2.  Process prove-in and design authority qualification. Addressing  this risk includes actions to ensure that the UPF\u2019s systems meet  certain metrics and are qualified for mission work. Aspects of this  include laboratory analysis, statistical validation of repeatability, and  engineering evaluations.  3.  Integration of UPF with other facilities. Addressing this risk  includes actions to ensure that the UPF systems can interface with  other facilities\u2019 systems (e.g., those in Buildings 9215, 9204-2E, and  9995) as designed and that all systems are able to support full-scale  operations.", "NNSA officials estimated that construction of the UPF will be completed in  2022.

In  November 2016, DOE-PM completed the independent cost estimate for  the Mechanical Electrical Building, which was the only estimate to include  a single UPF subproject. NNSA officials explained that they handled the  estimate for this subproject differently because work for the Mechanical  Electrical Building could be separated easily from the other subprojects,  and it was largely designed as a commercial-grade building. Lastly, in  November 2017, DOE-PM completed the independent cost estimate for  the majority of the work for the Process Support Facilities, Salvage and  Accountability Building, and Main Process Building subprojects.
