In two of the three countries GAO visited, it found that host governments--which bear ultimate responsibility for combating trafficking within their borders--have passed national antitrafficking laws and enacted national action plans. However, organizations continue to face numerous challenges when collaborating to combat human trafficking, including varying levels of government commitment and capacity. For example, some governments treat foreign trafficking victims as illegal immigrants and deport rather than protect them. In addition, according to officials in two of the three countries GAO visited, the ministries responsible for coordinating antitrafficking efforts have limited authority and capacity. U.S. government-funded antitrafficking projects often lack some important elements that allow projects to be monitored, and little is known about project impact due to difficulties in conducting evaluations. Project documents GAO reviewed generally include monitoring elements, such as an overarching goal and related activities, but often lack other monitoring elements, such as targets for measuring performance. To oversee projects, State officials supplement their efforts with assistance from U.S. embassy staff, but have not established written guidance for oversight. Officials said that they are working to improve performance measures and develop monitoring guidance. Conducting impact evaluations of antitrafficking projects is difficult due to several factors, including questionable project-level estimates of the number of trafficking victims. These estimates are needed for baselines by which to evaluate how effectively specific interventions are reducing trafficking. Elements in the design of certain projects, such as objectives that are too broad, further impede evaluation. Because of these difficulties, few impact evaluations have been completed, and little is known about the impact of antitrafficking interventions. A GAO-convened panel of experts identified and discussed ways to address the factors that make it difficult to monitor and evaluate antitrafficking projects. Panelists' suggested approaches included improving information on the nature and severity of trafficking and addressing monitoring and evaluation in project design. To improve information on trafficking, panelists suggested methods that have been used to sample other hard-to-reach populations, including domestic violence victims. One suggested method is sampling of \"hot spots\"--an intensive search for victims in areas known to have high concentrations of victims. To address weaknesses in project design that impede monitoring and evaluation, panelists suggested that officials design projects that clearly link activities to intended outcomes, identify measurable indicators, and establish procedures for setting and modifying targets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Human trafficking\u2014a worldwide crime involving the exploitation of men,  women, and children for others\u2019 financial gain\u2014is a violation of  fundamental human rights.

The use of fraud, force, or coercion typically  distinguishes human trafficking victims from individuals who are  smuggled. In some cases, individuals may enter freely into agreement with  and pay smugglers to help them cross international borders.

Victims may be  forced to work in legal or illegal and often dangerous areas, including  brothels, sweatshops, agricultural businesses, and people\u2019s homes.  Documented human trafficking cases have involved victims such as  children forced to beg for money in cities, work in carpet shops, and  participate in pornography and sex acts with adults; women held in slavery- like conditions as domestic servants, strip club dancers, and prostitutes;  and men forced to perform work in the agricultural sector and on fishing  vessels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government and Multilateral Organizations\u2019 Projects Focus on Three Areas", "paragraphs": ["To combat the diverse forms of global human trafficking, 5 U.S.  departments, USAID, and at least 15 international organizations have  provided assistance to governments and civil society organizations in more  than 100 countries.

Monitoring includes, among other things, the development of indicators  that are linked as closely as possible to the variables identified in the logic  framework. These indicators are to be used throughout implementation to  assess whether the project is likely to achieve the desired results.

The Paris Declaration of Aid Effectiveness establishes the  importance of donor coordination, stating that excessive fragmentation of  aid at the global, country, or sector level impairs its effectiveness. It further  states that a pragmatic approach to the division of labor and burden  sharing increases complementarity and can reduce costs. Through the  declaration, donors committed to make use of their respective comparative  advantage at a sector or country level by delegating authority to lead  donors for the execution of projects, activities, and tasks. To draw on the  collective strengths of the UN agencies and programs operating in a  country, UN country teams and the host government develop a national  analysis, called a common country assessment.

For  example, governments might not recognize trafficking as a problem.  They may treat foreign trafficking victims as illegal immigrants and  deport them back to their home countries, rather than protect them.  They also may not recognize trafficking within their own borders as a  problem. Moreover, some government officials are themselves involved  in human trafficking.", "Government capacity varies. Governments with greater resources and  more established institutions have a greater capacity to address  trafficking than countries that are poorer or less stable. In addition,  changes in government leadership and personnel, due to elections,  coups, assassinations, or other events, may result in the loss of expertise  in combating human trafficking. Furthermore, governments may put  trafficking under the purview of ministries with limited authority, such  as women\u2019s ministries.", "Organizations that combat trafficking vary in perspective and may be  in competition for limited funds.

In addition, they vary in number of participating  members from as few as 6 countries in the Mekong subregion to as many as  56 countries in Europe, Asia, and North America. For example, the  governments involved in a UN project that specifically focused on  strengthening cooperation to combat trafficking in the Mekong subregion  have agreed to undertake 18 actions to combat human trafficking, as part  of an effort called the COMMIT process. Officials stated that this  agreement strengthens these countries\u2019 incentives to undertake the actions  through mutual accountability. In addition, COMMIT developed an action  plan that groups existing activities into a single framework delineating  roles and responsibilities of UN organizations, implementing partners, and  governments in the six Mekong countries. Officials contrasted the  COMMIT process, which includes a small group of countries in one region  with interconnected trafficking problems, to larger organizations such as  the Bali Process, which approaches trafficking issues in conjunction with  issues related to smuggling in the Asia-Pacific region and has a larger  geographic scope, consisting of 38 governments across several regions.  These officials stated that having a larger geographic scope makes it more  difficult for the governments of these countries to hold each other  accountable for implementing the regional action plan. In addition to these  examples, OSCE initiated the Alliance against Trafficking in Persons, which  established a partnership with major actors working to combat human  trafficking to, among other things, develop joint strategies and provide  OSCE participating states and others with harmonized decision-making  aids.

However,  the office has not established written guidance for conducting such  oversight. During our fieldwork, an embassy official expressed frustration  at the lack of clear guidance and procedures. Embassy officials also told us  that they meet with project staff, but have other responsibilities that limit  the time they can devote to overseeing antitrafficking projects.

Without estimates of  the scope of human trafficking to use as baselines in project locations, it is  very difficult to determine where interventions are most needed or where  interventions would have the greatest impact. Developing baseline  estimates is difficult for the following reasons:  Victims are a hidden population. Victims may be unaware, unwilling,  or unable to acknowledge that they are trafficking victims. Therefore, it  is difficult to reach them to collect information using standard sampling  techniques.", "Service providers may be unwilling to share victim data due to  confidentiality concerns.

For example, some antitrafficking projects have very  high-level goals or objectives, such as \u201ccreating an environment for  effective action against trafficking,\u201d or \u201cstrengthening the initiatives of  government and others against human trafficking\u201d and contain activities  covering 2 or more of the 3 key types of antitrafficking interventions\u2014 prevention, protection, and prosecution. Of 153 U.S. international  antitrafficking projects funded in fiscal year 2004, 2005, or 2006, 56 percent  included 2 or more of these interventions and 29 percent included all 3  interventions. Activities included public awareness campaigns, victim  assistance, and training for law enforcement officials.", "While projects funded with greater resources could lead to more noticeable  longer-term changes, the impact of a shorter-term, smaller-scale  intervention may be difficult to attribute and quantify. Antitrafficking  projects vary significantly in terms of their time frames and funding levels.  For example, the projects we reviewed varied in duration from 1 year to  about 4 years, and projects\u2019 funding levels varied from $15,000 to $6  million.

Overall, experts told us that organizations also have  generally limited funding for impact evaluations and for research on the  nature and scope of human trafficking.", "Experts stated that another factor impeding evaluations is that little  attention has generally been devoted at the start of projects to evaluation  design. For example, questions related to determining the control group,  the type of design for impact evaluation, the data that would be collected,  and the analytical methods that would be most suitable are often not  addressed before implementation. Furthermore, experts stated that  although projects target several groups of beneficiaries, it is generally  unclear how they can be reached and to which group they would be  compared.

For example, IOM\u2019s Office of Inspector General has carried  out impact evaluations of a select number of antitrafficking projects. Our  review of these evaluations shows that they covered interventions in  various parts of the world funded by different donors. All of the available  evaluations applied qualitative methodologies, consisting of document  reviews, site visits, interviews, and focus groups with stakeholders. In  addition, in a USAID-funded assessment of child trafficking victims  residing at a shelter in Nepal, an evaluator used qualitative methods, such  as observations and interviews, to collect information on their daily lives,  needs, and preparation for reintegration into the community. The evaluator  concluded that skill-based training provided by the shelter does not  adequately prepare the girls for their reintegration into their communities;  however, this qualitative result could not be generalized to the national  level.", "Completed evaluations also typically focused on process rather than  impact. Process evaluations are an important tool for improving service  delivery and assessing program effectiveness by assessing whether  activities conform to program design. Impact evaluations assess the net  effect of a program by comparing program outcomes with an estimate of  what would have happened in the absence of the program. However,  impact evaluations are an emerging field in antitrafficking interventions.  For example, a process evaluation of a Labor-funded project aimed at  reducing the victimization of minors who have been trafficked or are at risk  of being trafficked in Thailand focused on the project\u2019s planning,  implementation, and management. This process evaluation was designed to  monitor implementation and assess project outcomes. However, the  evaluation did not ultimately assess the project\u2019s impact in reducing the  victimization of minors.", "Finally, our review identified few evaluations that track individual victims  who have been reintegrated into their communities over time. For example,  ILO is currently pilot-testing an application of a tracer study methodology  in the context of trafficking prevention. In addition, according to Labor  officials, in some cases the office has conducted follow-up studies that  examine a sample of beneficiaries to document changes that have  occurred. Furthermore, IOM officials noted that several of its missions  provided statistical information to gauge the success of its victim  reintegration efforts over time based on specific indicators.

Panelists stated  that it is necessary to understand the nature of trafficking in terms of its  underlying conditions and the types of traffickers and victims.  Trafficking is a multidimensional, complex problem that involves a wide  range of victims; recruiters, brokers, and intermediaries; and abusive  employers and sexual exploiters. Understanding the incentives of the  people engaged in trafficking is an important first step.", "The severity of human trafficking can be measured by using qualitative  and quantitative methodologies. Panel members suggested several  sampling methods that have been used to sample other hard-to-reach  populations, including the homeless, hidden migrants, missing and  exploited children, domestic violence victims, inmates, and drug users.  One suggested method is sampling of \u201chot spots\u201d\u2014an intensive search  for victims in areas known to have high concentrations of victims or in  areas to which many victims return. Other methods include adaptive  cluster, double, indirect, and snowball sampling. (For a more detailed  discussion of sampling methods, see app. III.) These methods could be  used individually or in combination. Panelists further emphasized that,  whenever feasible, it is important to use methodologies that are  appropriate for the location sampled. In addition, it is critical to  determine whether the results are unique to a certain location or  whether they can be generalized to other locations. Panelists  recommended that research start at the local level. Such research would  identify successful small-scale interventions, increase the knowledge of  victims\u2019 needs, and develop meaningful performance measures. Lessons  learned at the local level could then be expanded to national and  regional levels.", "What is the projects\u2019 estimated effect on the nature and severity of  human trafficking? Panelists emphasized the necessity of designing  rigorous methods to evaluate antitrafficking projects, such as  randomized control trials. For example, as baseline estimates in  trafficking hot spots are obtained and interventions are undertaken in  that location to reduce trafficking, the use of \u201cplace-randomized trials\u201d  for evaluation would become possible. To determine the interventions\u2019  impact, data obtained from interventions in hot spots could then be  compared with locations where there had been no interventions.  Although randomized trials may be difficult to execute for many  trafficking projects, they are important ways to generate evidence about  interventions\u2019 effectiveness. Randomized trials should be pilot-tested in  carefully chosen settings so that the evaluator can identify and correct  any problems encountered before expanding the trials to larger  populations or areas. Panelists pointed out that such rigorous evaluation  has occurred in the fields of public health and criminal justice.

Given the weaknesses of some  antitrafficking projects that have overly broad objectives across a  diverse range of activities, panelists suggested that officials design  projects with a logic framework that has clear objectives and narrow the  focus of interventions. They also recommended that officials design  projects that clearly link activities to intended outcomes, identify  measurable indicators, and establish procedures for setting and  modifying targets. Measurable indicators with mutually agreed-upon  targets allow project officials to assess how a project is achieving its  overall goals and objectives. For example, a Labor-funded project  implemented by ILO in Mexico includes a logic framework that links  project activities and outputs to outcome objectives, and includes clear  indicators and means of verification. The project\u2019s overall goal of  eliminating the commercial sexual exploitation of children in Mexico  links to four immediate objectives that, in turn, link back to project  activities and outputs. One objective\u2014that at least 300 child victims of  sexual exploitation or at-risk children and their families receive  assistance\u2014is linked to 28 activities and 8 outputs, such as increasing  families' employment opportunities. These 28 activities include  disseminating employment promotion programs, organizing  employment training, and monitoring and analyzing the impact of these  dissemination and training efforts. Panelists emphasized that donors  and implementers should agree on the project\u2019s logic framework during  the design phase.", "Determine whether a project is ready to be evaluated. Given the  significant variance in project duration and funding levels, panelists  emphasized that evaluators would not be able to evaluate all existing  projects, but should first determine which projects are ready to be  evaluated. In conducting such \u201cevaluability assessments,\u201d evaluators  determine, among other things, whether (1) the project is large enough,  has sufficient resources, and has been implemented long enough to  make an impact; (2) the project is reaching its target population; (3)  project documents specify and clearly link objectives, goals, and  activities; and (4) sufficient information exists to determine impact. For  example, larger, long-term projects are more likely to have an impact  and, thus, may be better candidates for evaluation than smaller, short- term projects. Because larger antitrafficking projects generally include a  diverse range of interventions, panelists suggested narrowing the  evaluation to focus on discrete interventions or aspects of the project.", "Build monitoring and evaluation into project design. Given that  evaluation is not generally considered during design, panelists  emphasized that project officials should consider how the project will  be evaluated before the project is implemented. Most importantly,  organizations need to define the project\u2019s intended impact and how that  impact will be measured. To do this, organizations would have to  determine the project beneficiaries and to which group they would be  compared, the data they would have to collect, and how they would  analyze those data.
