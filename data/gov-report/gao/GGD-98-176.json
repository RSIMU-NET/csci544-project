Credit bureaus develop scores by assessing various types of information collected from a large pool of borrowers, including borrowers with good payment histories and others with poor payment histories, to estimate the credit risk associated with different types of loans. Credit scoring systems use statistical analysis to identify and weigh the characteristics of borrowers who have been most likely to make loan payments. For example, borrowers with little or no history of delinquent payments receive higher credit scores than borrowers with many delinquent payments. Most widely used credit scoring systems have a range of scores from 350 to 900.

Prior to selection, recipients had demonstrated their ability to manage debt by having satisfactory payment histories. According to Fleet and Chase officials, interest rates on loans resulting from live loan checks have ranged from 12.9 percent to 15.9 percent. The repayment terms for these loans ranged from 48 months to 60 months and are amortized.

The executive director of CFA said that live loan checks would only compound the problems created by the abundance of unsecured, high-cost credit card debt. Two lenders, however, said that there was no evidence to show that borrowers would file for bankruptcy quicker as a result of accepting live loan checks instead of using credit cards.", "To date, it does not appear that many potential borrowers have been exposed to the risk of fraudulently cashed loan checks. Lenders we spoke with told us that the bank does not hold a consumer responsible if the check mailed to that consumer is deposited or forged by another individual. For example, Chase officials told us that, in the event that a live loan check were stolen, the intended recipient would not be charged if he or she signed an affidavit stating that the check had not been cashed by him or her.", "AFSA officials said that state and federal laws shield consumers from liability related to live loan checks and that lenders\u2019 credit selection practices help reduce the rate of fraud.

OCC had no reported cases of fraudulent acts of cashing a live loan check. Federal Reserve officials said they do not believe that there is a significant problem with losses associated with live loan checks. Federal Reserve officials noted that the primary reason for the low rate of fraud is that rules governing check cashing practices act to deter fraud. The recipient\u2019s rights in the case of a forged endorsement are generally governed by state law. Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code have been adopted in almost every state and determine check negotiation procedures and liability for invalid checks. FTC and Federal Reserve officials said that they had not received many complaints about live loan checks that involved theft and fraud issues over a 2-year period.

Fleet officials said that live loan checks were moderately profitable loans. They said that the results of these loans were provided monthly to senior management to assess the results against expectations. Chase officials said that a benefit of the bank\u2019s loan check program was that the net interest margin for live loan checks was higher than that for mortgage lending. Chase officials told us that prepayment rates for live loan checks are lower than those for mortgages. When interest rates decline, lower payments help cash flows remain more stable, which helps Chase to better manage its loan portfolio. In contrast, a decline in interest rates generally results in a rise in prepayments of some other loans.

With 155,000 loans accepted between 1995 and 1997, for example, Fleet reported 68 confirmed cases of fraud. Generally, in these cases, an unauthorized household member cashed the check. In order to prevent fraud, Fleet required that the borrower access funds only by depositing a check into a personal bank account. Once the live loan check was cleared, Fleet created an installment loan for the borrower. To reduce the risk of fraud, Fleet\u2019s live loan check offers were only valid for 6 weeks.", "Federal bank regulators do not have any special supervisory programs for live loan checks.

Fleet projected its 1998 live loan check losses to be similar to the credit card industry\u2019s at 5 percent. Fleet officials said that they had set aside adequate reserves to cover anticipated losses. Fleet officials explained that the reason for the reported loss increase for live loan checks from 1996 to 1997 is that, typically, there are not many losses in the early years with a new loan product, and that Fleet was more cautious in marketing live loan checks. In the first year, 1995, Fleet marketed all of its live loan checks to its bank customers.
