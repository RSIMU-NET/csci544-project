SSA is responsible for administering federal disability programs that provide cash and medical assistance to blind, aged, or disabled people. Between 1985 and 1995 SSA\u2019s blind and disabled enrollment increased about 50 percent. At the same time, SSA\u2019s staff decreased, from 77,741 to an estimated 64,000. In 1995 SSA paid over $61.3 billion in cash benefits to program recipients.", "SSA is redesigning its disability claims process to make it more customer focused and efficient. Currently, disability claimants frequently wait almost a year for a final disability decision. Further, disability claimants are dissatisfied with the lack of personal, specifically, face-to-face, contact with SSA staff who make the disability decisions. SSA\u2019s redesign plan encompasses the disability determination process: A potential claimant files for disability benefits; he or she is then assigned benefits or is found ineligible and files an administrative appeal of a denial of benefits.", "A key initiative in SSA\u2019s redesign plan is the establishment of the disability claim manager (DCM) position. The person in this position would have total responsibility for adjudicating disability claims and authorizing the payment of benefits. This is a major change from current practice: An SSA claims representative makes the initial contact with the claimant and determines nonmedical eligibility for the program. Then, a state disability examiner and a medical consultant determine medical eligibility for the claim, usually without ever seeing the claimant in person. The goal of the redesign plan is to give the claimant access to the decisionmaker, the person who makes the determination, and allow for dialogue between them. SSA\u2019s initial efforts do not include full implementation of the DCM position before 2001.", "In its 1994 redesign plan, SSA intended to move toward the DCM position in phases, first implementing several initiatives that would (1) improve service to the public and (2) provide SSA information on ways to facilitate interaction and teamwork between claims representatives and disability examiners. Among these initiatives is sequential interviewing, in which there is an immediate handoff of a portion of the initial claim from a claims representative to a disability examiner; the latter would obtain the necessary medical information directly from the claimant. Another initiative, the Early Decision List, would assess the effect of claims representatives, rather than disability examiners, making medical determinations on disabilities that are included in some categories of severe impairments. However, SSA\u2019s redesign plan has evolved; as of June 1996, SSA expects to concurrently test the DCM position, as well as related initiatives.", "Given your interest in SSA\u2019s redesign plan, you asked us to evaluate (1) SSA\u2019s efforts to test and implement the DCM position, (2) the major concerns about the position, and (3) SSA\u2019s efforts to staff the position. We performed our work between June 1995 and June 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Our scope and methodology are discussed in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["SSA provides assistance to people who qualify as disabled under two programs: (1) Disability Insurance (DI), which provides benefits to people who have worked and paid Social Security payroll taxes, and (2) Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which is an assistance program for people with limited income and resources who are blind, aged, or disabled.", "Currently, the disability determination process starts when a person first applies for DI or SSI disability benefits. To apply for benefits, he or she calls the national toll-free telephone number and is referred to a local SSA field office or visits or calls one of 1,300 local field offices. Claims representatives in field offices assist with the completion of claims, obtain detailed medical and vocational history, and screen nonmedical eligibility factors.", "Field office staff forward the claim to a DDS. At the DDS, medical evidence is developed by a disability examiner and a medical consultant; a final determination is made as to the existence of a medically determinable disability. The DDSs then send allowed claims to SSA field offices or SSA processing centers for payment and storage. Files for denied cases are retained in field offices, pending possible appeal. According to SSA, in part because of the numerous handoffs among staff involved in processing a disability claim, a claimant can wait, on average, between 78 and 94 days from the time of filing with SSA until receiving an initial claim decision notice\u2014when in fact only 13 hours is actually spent working on the claim.", "In 1994, SSA released its redesign plan for receiving and deciding disability claims. The plan aims to improve the current process, which is labor intensive and slow, so as to increase claimant and staff satisfaction. To develop the plan, SSA created a Disability Process Reengineering Team, charged with producing a new process that is customer-focused, operationally feasible, and an improvement over the current process. A Disability Process Redesign Team (DPRT) was later formed to implement the Reengineering Team\u2019s plan.", "In developing its redesign plan, Reengineering Team members solicited views from customer focus groups, frontline staff, managers and executives, and parties outside of SSA. The Reengineering Team found that claimants were frustrated with the fragmented nature of the current process and wanted more personalized service. In addition, some SSA staff were frustrated because they were not trained to answer claimants\u2019 questions about medical disability decisions or about the status of cases while in DDS offices. To address these concerns, SSA created the DCM position as the cornerstone of its redesign plan.", "Under SSA\u2019s redesign plan, the DCM\u2014a single decisionmaker located at either an SSA or a DDS office\u2014would be solely responsible for processing the initial disability claim and making the decision, thereby assuming functions currently performed by at least three federal and state workers. The DCM would conduct personal interviews, which could be face-to-face, by telephone, or by video conference; develop evidentiary records; and determine medical and nonmedical eligibility. Specifically, the DCM would gather and store claim information; develop both medical and nonmedical evidence; share necessary facts in a claim with medical consultants and specialists in nonmedical or technical issues; analyze evidence; prepare well-reasoned decisions on both medical and nonmedical issues; and produce clear, understandable notices to convey information to claimants. In addition, the DCM would authorize payment of the claim. Although DCMs would still have access to medical and technical support personnel, they alone would make the final decision on both medical and nonmedical aspects of a disability claim. A medical consultant\u2019s signature would no longer be required on decisions.", "The DCM would also serve as a single, personal point of contact for claimants. When filing claims, claimants could first speak in person with a DCM to obtain information about the process. In addition, a claimant would be entitled to contact the DCM throughout the process and meet personally with the DCM to provide additional evidence if the DCM expected to deny a claim. See appendix II for a comparison of the tasks currently assigned to claims representatives and disability examiners with those expected of the DCM.", "Recognizing the complexity of the DCM position responsibilities, the redesign plan calls for implementing several new support features that SSA considers critical to the DCM position: (1) SSA plans to develop a simplified decision methodology that would provide a less complex, more structured approach for DCMs to use when deciding claims. (2) New hardware and software would automate most aspects of the process and allow SSA to move from a process that depends on paper folders to one that depends on electronic records. These records would be easy to transmit between headquarters, field offices, and state DDSs. (3) In order to address the perception that different policy standards are applied at different levels of disability decision-making, SSA intends to develop a process that generates similar decisions for similar cases at all stages of the disability process through consistent application of laws, regulations, and rulings. SSA refers to this feature as process unification. Without these new features, SSA managers do not expect that DCMs would be able to handle the broad range of activities that the position requires. However, as of July 1996, none of these support features were available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Test Results Should Be Used to Provide Basis for Decision on DCM Continuance", "paragraphs": ["During the next few years, SSA expects to test the DCM position and several DCM-related initiatives. Some of the related initiatives, which SSA believes will immediately improve customer service, are being tested because SSA initially thought that the DCM position could not be immediately implemented. Other tests, which had been planned prior to redesign, are designed to provide information on various functions now incorporated into the DCM position. These tests are described below. Appendix III provides information on their status."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA Implementing Early Decision List, Sequential Interviewing, and Model Sites", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s initial 1994 redesign plan called for testing and implementing alternative ways of serving claimants, based on teams of claims representatives and disability examiners. Currently, a disability claim is handled primarily by two staff members (the claims representative and the disability examiner), each working independently of the other, with minimal coordination. As part of the redesign plan, SSA expects to team its claims representatives and DDS disability examiners so they can process claims in a coordinated manner. SSA also expects that this team environment would allow claims representatives and disability examiners to share skills and enhance communication, thus better preparing them for the transition to the DCM position.", "Following this initial teaming of claims representatives and disability examiners, SSA plans to build on teaming by implementing the Early Decision List and sequential interviewing initiatives. SSA envisions that the Early Decision List and sequential interviewing would provide claims representatives and disability examiners with opportunities to (1) expedite the processing of disability claims by streamlining the interview process and (2) expand the claims representatives\u2019 skills and experience in the medical area and that of the disability examiners in the nonmedical area.", "The Early Decision List identifies severe disabilities that can be adjudicated by claims representatives with minimal training and documentation. The Early Decision List will allow a claims representative to approve certain types of claims. After approving a claim, the claims representative would forward the case to a medical consultant for final approval. Currently, only the disability examiner and the medical consultant approve these claims. SSA expects that initially, about 100,000 claims per year might be approved under the Early Decision List. Eventually, the number of Early Decision List cases will expand as claims representatives\u2019 skills and knowledge base increase. This expansion will result from (1) phasing in additional categories of disabilities and (2) the option for claims representatives to issue denials.", "The sequential interviewing initiative is designed to provide disability examiners with preliminary interviewing experience for certain categories of disability claims. Additional categories will be phased in over time as the examiners\u2019 experience increases. Under sequential interviewing, after the claims representative completes the nonmedical portion of the claim, he or she will turn the claimant over to the disability examiner, who will complete the medical portion of the application. The disability examiner will either talk with the claimant by telephone before he or she leaves the field office or talk by telephone at a later date.", "According to SSA\u2019s plan, the Early Decision List and sequential interviewing are modeled on existing teaming initiatives in field offices and state DDSs. For example, some offices have already experimented with sequential interviewing; in other offices, SSA claims representatives already assist DDSs by making medical determinations for some categories of severe disabilities. Preliminary results from these local initiatives indicate that they can improve customer service, work flow, and job satisfaction. For example, one field office that used sequential interviewing processed initial claims in 46 days, well below the current average of between 78 and 94 days. Customer surveys indicate that claimants served in these efforts were pleased with the sequential interviewing. In addition, claims representatives and disability examiners participating in these initiatives were satisfied with the team tests, they said.", "Currently, SSA expects to conduct formal testing and evaluation of the Early Decision List, but it will rely on states to test sequential interviewing. SSA also expects to make available its Office of Workforce Analysis and Office of Program and Integrity Reviews to provide test assistance to states. According to the DPRT director, SSA made this decision because (1) of resource constraints and (2) sequential interviewing is viewed as only a temporary measure, which will lead to the DCM position. However, the director acknowledged that formal testing of sequential interviewing would be necessary to allow for a comparison of this initiative with the proposed DCM position.", "In addition to sequential interviewing and Early Decision List initiatives, SSA expects to test modifications to the disability determination process at model sites in federal offices and state DDSs. One model site test\u2014the single medical decisionmaker\u2014exemplifies the concept of the disability examiner making eligibility decisions alone, except in cases for which medical consultant involvement is required by statute. SSA considers this test useful because it analyzes the aspects of the redesign plan that have DCMs making eligibility decisions without necessarily soliciting medical consultants\u2019 input for all cases. In this test, a disability examiner will be authorized to make medical eligibility decisions without obtaining a medical consultant\u2019s signature, on the SSA form, certifying the determination.", "In other model site tests, scheduled for completion in late 1998, SSA will expand the single medical decisionmaker test to evaluate other aspects of the disability process. In the expanded test, SSA will consider the effect of allowing claimants to have a personal predecision interview with the decisionmaker, in order to provide additional evidence if a denial is imminent. This is an opportunity not available under the existing system. As of June 1996, SSA was testing the single medical decisionmaker at DDSs in eight states and was developing the expanded test for implementation in seven states and two SSA offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Plans to Test and Evaluate the DCM Position Incrementally", "paragraphs": ["In its original redesign plan, SSA intended to test the DCM position only after testing was under way on the Early Decision List, sequential interviewing, and initiatives being explored at the model sites.

However, in October 1995, SSA decided to initiate DCM testing in 1996, even though SSA had not yet (1) implemented these other initiatives or (2) developed any of the support features that had been included in the redesign plan as critical to the position.", "According to the DPRT director, SSA management accelerated DCM testing to address several factors that might impede the overall redesign plan. For example, the DPRT director became concerned that delaying DCM testing until critical support features were in place would slow the momentum for the redesign plan, particularly because delays were already occurring in SSA\u2019s original schedule to implement these features. SSA also wanted to gain endorsement from its federal employee union, which originally was concerned about the DCM position.", "The DPRT director further cited state DDS directors\u2019 concerns\u2014about providing disability examiners with little opportunity to gain nonmedical case development experience\u2014as a factor influencing his decision to begin testing the DCM position. According to the DPRT director, the tests will provide states with additional time to become accustomed to the DCM concept and with the opportunity to address concerns about the position. However, state DDS directors\u2019 representatives said, DPRT misunderstood their concerns. DDS directors oppose SSA\u2019s plan to accelerate implementation of the DCM position without the necessary critical support features and are concerned that SSA is beginning to give a workload to federal employees that is currently states\u2019 responsibility.", "According to the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923, the union would have opposed the DCM position if SSA attempted to implement it as a grade 11. Under a memorandum of understanding between the union and SSA, people who are assigned to DCM positions will receive temporary promotions to grade 12, one grade higher than the journeyman level for the claims representative position.

During the first phase, scheduled to last for 18 months, SSA would test 150 federal and 150 state DCM positions. At the end of this phase, SSA would evaluate the results to determine whether it should continue, modify, or terminate the DCM test. For the second phase, if SSA decides to continue the test, it would then introduce an additional 200 federal and 200 state DCMs. After this phase, SSA would again evaluate the results to determine whether the agency should continue, modify, or terminate the test.

At this time, the claimant could provide additional evidence if the DCM expects to deny the claim. The predecision interview is a key factor of the DCM position, one that (1) could easily be tested without waiting for the critical support features and (2) many claims representatives and disability examiners would prefer not to do.", "Further, even though DDS representatives were work group participants, they did not support SSA\u2019s proposal to test 1,500 DCM positions.

When processing an initial disability claim, a claims representative, through interviews, obtains and clarifies information from a disability claimant. The claims representative assists claimants with securing necessary additional evidence. Ultimately, the representative (1) determines whether claimants meet nonmedical requirements for benefits, using a series of administrative publications, including SSA\u2019s Program Operations Manual System that interprets federal laws and regulations, (2) calculates benefit amounts, and (3) authorizes payments for allowed claims. Because of voluminous, detailed, and complicated program guidelines, some claims representatives specialize in processing claims for a specific SSA program, such as SSI.", "State DDS disability examiners also perform a wide range of complex tasks to determine whether a claimant\u2019s disability meets SSA\u2019s medical criteria for benefits eligibility. The disability examiner reviews claims forwarded by SSA field offices, obtaining additional medical records and vocational documentation on claimants as necessary. In making a medical determination, a disability examiner must establish the date of onset, duration, and level of severity of the disability; the prognosis for improvement; and the effect of the disability on a claimant\u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment. As with guidelines for claims representatives, the complicated disability program guidelines lead some disability examiners to specialize in processing either child or adult claims.", "The complexity of disability examiners\u2019 and claims representatives\u2019 responsibilities is evidenced by the training required for the positions. Newly hired SSA claims representatives typically take 13 weeks of classroom training, followed by on-the-job training and mentoring. They reach journeyman level after a minimum of 2 years on the job. Similarly, the state DDS examiners go through a formal 2-year training program that includes classroom training and close individual supervision and guidance from unit supervisors; only then are examiners able to make medical eligibility determinations independently.", "According to some SSA and DDS managers and employees, the DCM position may stretch staff to the point that they cannot competently manage all the required tasks. For example, in one state that we visited, a local demonstration project has claims representatives approving disability decisions for some categories of claims\u2014those for which the disability is easily determined. According to quality assurance staff reviewing these decisions, claims representatives are beginning to make errors on nonmedical portions of claims, possibly because these representatives are branching out into areas beyond their knowledge and experience.", "Although the DPRT director agreed that the responsibilities of the DCM position are complex, he stated that SSA designed it in response to claimants\u2019 concerns that the existing process did not meet their needs.

In addition, state staff said, some disability examiners chose their profession partly because it did not involve face-to-face interviews with claimants. Consequently, claims representatives and disability examiners may be reluctant to become DCMs because of such safety and job preference concerns.", "SSA\u2019s plan to provide claimants an opportunity to meet face-to-face with decisionmakers differs from the approach used by many private companies that provide disability and workers compensation insurance. In these organizations, face-to-face interviews are generally used only under specific conditions, such as to investigate potential fraud or to help facilitate rehabilitation. According to officials from various private companies, direct personal contact with claimants generally is not economically viable because such meetings take a considerable amount of time. Further, these officials said, face-to-face meetings provide little additional information besides that which can be obtained by phone and mail and that they often create stress for staff who deny claimants\u2019 benefits.", "Further, under the existing system, different groups of federal and state staff\u2014including claims representatives, disability examiners, and claims authorizers\u2014are responsible for making eligibility decisions, medical determinations, and claim payment authorizations.

The DCM work group\u2019s proposal\u2014calling for evaluating the activity of the first group of DCMs 18 months into the test and using the evaluation results to make a decision on whether to proceed with additional testing, modify the DCM position, or cancel the position entirely\u2014is sound.", "However, there are some limitations on what SSA can actually test relative to the DCM position at this time. Because the critical support features are not ready for testing, the test will not provide a complete picture of the DCM position\u2019s feasibility, nor will it allow SSA to assess the relative costs and benefits of implementing the position. SSA will also not be able to assess the effects that improvements, such as technological enhancements and a simplified decision methodology, will bring to the overall disability claims process. The DCM work group\u2019s consideration of delaying the predecision interview may also limit the value of the test.", "As SSA attempts to make a sound decision about further DCM testing or implementation of the DCM position, SSA would benefit from systematically assessing the results from all its DCM-related initiatives\u2014the DCM tests, the model site tests, the Early Decision List, and sequential interviewing\u2014and comparing their relative effects on SSA\u2019s workforce, work flow, operating costs, and service to claimants. SSA may find that the results of some of these initiatives (1) increase decision-making efficiency and satisfy claimants more effectively than the DCM position or (2) may suggest better ways to satisfy claimant needs and reduce processing time. To facilitate the evaluation of all these initiatives, SSA needs to ensure that it has comparable test results for each of them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration assess current efforts to test the DCM position, so as to ensure that SSA is provided with the best possible information for making future decisions about the position. Specifically, the Commissioner should include, in the test of the DCM position, a personal predecision interview that provides an opportunity for claimants to meet with the DCM in person, by video conference, or by telephone, and continue testing of sequential interviewing, Early Decision List, and model site initiatives throughout the DCM test.", "Testing and subsequent evaluations should document the extent to which the DCM position and the other initiatives increase service to the public and decrease processing time. At the end of the initial 18-month testing period and, if appropriate, at subsequent decision points, SSA should compare the evaluation results of the DCM and other initiatives with respect to their relative benefits and costs. SSA should consider these results before deciding to increase the number of DCM test positions and before approving the DCM position permanently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its comments on this report, SSA generally agreed that we have identified the issues and concerns raised by the establishment of the new disability claims manager position.

We also conducted site visits in California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, where we (1) interviewed staff and managers of SSA field offices and state DDSs and (2) analyzed documents they provided. We judgmentally selected these locations because local SSA field offices and DDSs in these states have already experimented with a teaming initiative, so as to facilitate closer interaction between SSA claims representatives and DDS disability examiners. Although these initiatives were not part of SSA\u2019s redesign plan, we believe the results provide some insight on how SSA could implement the DCM position.", "To identify the concerns associated with the DCM position, we spoke with the following during our site visits: DPRT members, SSA regional and field office managers and staff, employee union representatives, and DDS managers and staff. We also reviewed documents they provided us, which summarized their views on the DCM position.", "To determine whether SSA had ensured that it had an adequate staff to implement the DCM position, we interviewed and analyzed information from DPRT members, SSA field office managers and staff, and state DDS officials and staff.

We modified our recommendation to reflect the different ways that a DCM could conduct a predecision interview with a claimant: face-to-face, by video conferencing, or by telephone contact. 2. We continue to believe that SSA should incorporate the predecision interview into the DCM test, beginning with the initial 18-month phase, to make the test as comprehensive as possible. Incorporating the predecision interview into the DCM test would provide SSA with valuable information for making future decisions about the feasibility of the DCM position and whether testing should continue beyond the first phase. In particular, testing the predecision interview could provide information about the effect of face-to-face interviews on office security, a main area of concern raised about the DCM position. SSA should not wait for the predecision interview to be tested as part of the expanded model site test. Results from this test are not expected until late in 1998 and may not be available in time for SSA to consider when it makes its decision about further testing or implementation of the DCM position. 3. We support SSA\u2019s decision to provide an opportunity for the claimant to readily and easily contact DCMs participating in the test. Since SSA had already decided that claimants would have this access to the DCM, we modified one of the recommendations in the report. 4. We continue to be concerned that SSA may not have all the test results it needs to decide whether the DCM position should be fully adopted. SSA needs to ensure that states\u2019 evaluation of sequential interviewing initiatives can be compared with the results from the initiatives that SSA is conducting and analyzing itself.
