GAO's prior work examining the quality of the data reported under the act found significant challenges that limit the usefulness of the data for Congress and the public. These data quality challenges underscore the need for OMB and Treasury to make progress on addressing GAO's prior recommendation to establish a set of clear policies and processes for developing and maintaining data standards.", "The DATA Act includes a provision for GAO to report on the implementation and use of data standards, and on the quality of the data reported using those standards.

Since enactment, OMB has relied on a shifting array of advisory bodies to obtain input on data standards. As of December 2018, some governance procedures are in place, but others continue to evolve. OMB staff told us that the governing bodies involved in initial implementation efforts had been disbanded, and that the functions previously performed by these advisory bodies over governance of DATA Act data standards would be accomplished within the broader context of the cross-agency priority goals established under the 2018 President's Management Agenda (PMA). However, the documentation of the governance structure established for these goals does not make explicit how it would apply to the data standards established under the DATA Act. Clarifying the connection between this governance structure and the DATA Act could help stakeholders understand how governance of the DATA Act standards is accomplished within the broader context of the PMA.", "With regard to one specific data governance function\u2014making changes to existing standards\u2014GAO found that OMB does not have procedures for managing changes to the web page it identifies in guidance as the authoritative source for data definition standards. The DATA Act requires, to the extent reasonable and practicable, that data standards be capable of being continually upgraded. In addition, key practices for data governance state that organizations should document policies and procedures for making decisions about changes to standards. In June 2018, revisions were made to the Primary Place of Performance Address data element without following a documented process. OMB staff described these revisions as minor technical corrections to align the definitions with the technical guidance agencies were already using to report data. However, without documented procedures for revising the definitions, needed changes may not be made in a timely manner, which could lead to inconsistent reporting.", "OMB also did not transparently communicate to stakeholders these changes to data definition standards. Along with the corrections to definitions, in June 2018 OMB changed introductory text on the data definitions web page to clarify policy about how agencies should use DATA Act definitions. However, OMB did not publicly announce this clarification or identify on the website that changes had been made. Without transparent communication of changes to data definition standards, stakeholders\u2014including staff at federal agencies required to report data according to these definitions\u2014may miss important information relating to changes in how, when, and by whom data definitions are to be applied.", "Although OMB lacks procedures governing changes to DATA Act data definitions, Treasury has established a process for changing related technical guidance in consultation with stakeholders.

In the  almost 5 years since the law was enacted, OMB, Treasury, and other  federal agencies have made significant strides to address many of the  policy and technical challenges presented by the act\u2019s requirements.

Specifically, we identified issues and challenges with  the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted, use of data  elements, and presentation of the data on USAspending.gov. These  challenges limit the usefulness of the data for Congress and the public.  The DATA Act holds each agency accountable for submitting accurate  and complete data. To ensure that they are able to do so, it is critically  important for OMB and Treasury to make additional progress in  addressing our 2015 recommendation that they establish clear policies  and processes for governing data standards. Such policies and processes are needed to promote data quality and ensure that the  integrity of data standards is maintained over time.", "This is one in a series of products we have provided to Congress on the  implementation of the DATA Act.

As Treasury and OMB implemented the  DATA Act\u2019s requirement to create and apply data standards, the overall  data standardization effort has been divided into two distinct, but related,  components: (1) establishing definitions which describe what is included  in each data element with the aim of ensuring that information will be  consistent and comparable, and (2) creating a data exchange standard  with technical specifications which describe the format, structure, tagging,  and transmission of each data element.", "In the implementation of the DATA Act, OMB took principal responsibility  for the definitions, while Treasury took principal responsibility for the  technical standards that express these definitions, which federal agencies  use to report spending data for publication on USAspending.gov.

The need for a data governance structure is underscored by our previous  analyses of the quality of the federal spending data available on  USAspending.gov and inconsistencies we identified in how agencies  report data according to data standards. A data governance structure  could be useful for adjudicating revisions, monitoring, and ensuring  compliance with the standards over time. As we have noted, such a  structure, if properly implemented, would greatly increase the likelihood  that the data made available to the public will be accurate.", "A data governance structure can also provide consistent data  management during times of change and transition.

According to OMB staff, the working  group includes four subgroups, which focus on Policy, Internal Controls  and Data Quality, Audit Coordination, and the DATA Act Information  Model Schema (DAIMS), respectively.", "OMB staff also told us that by December 2018 an interagency board and  council, both led by the General Services Administration (GSA), had  begun to advise OMB on policy matters. According to an action plan that  OMB and GSA released along with the March 2018 PMA, the new  interagency Shared Solutions Governance Board (SSGB) and Business  Standards Council (BSC) are responsible for setting goals and providing  advice to promote a government-wide marketplace for shared services.  Specifically, they cover mission-support services such as human  resources and financial management that a small number of providers  offer to many agencies. According to OMB staff, this oversight function  involves creating and administering government-wide data standards,  including data standards established to support the DATA Act. The SSGB  includes executives from across the federal government and is  responsible for making recommendations to OMB on shared services  policy. The BSC provides expertise on various subject matter areas (e.g.,  procurement and financial assistance) to promote the development of  common business capabilities and data standards.", "The action plan does not discuss how the functions carried out by the  SSGB and BSC apply specifically to the data standards established under  the DATA Act.

Further, the group is  considering making recommendations to OMB regarding changes to data  definitions and other policy matters. For example, Treasury officials told  us that in fall 2018, the DAIMS Subgroup identified difficulties in aligning  different definitions of Period of Performance Start Date used for  procurement and in financial assistance awards, and plans to elevate this  issue to the Policy Subgroup for review. Specifically, the DAIMS  Subgroup found that it is not always clear whether the start date should  be reported as the date when a specific transaction occurred or the date  when the original underlying award was made. This choice about how to  interpret the data element can have substantial consequences for the  consistency of the data reported.

In July 2018, OMB staff told us that governance  over the DATA Act data standards would be accomplished within the  broader context of the CAP goals established under the PMA. For  example, OMB established a governance structure to achieve the  objectives of CAP goals related to \u201cResults-Oriented Accountability for  Grants.\u201d As part of this broader effort to standardize grants management  business processes and data to increase efficiency and reduce reporting  burden, OMB, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other  federal agencies have published a list of draft grants management data  standards for public comment.", "However, published documents describing this effort do not explain how  the process for developing grants management standards under this CAP  goal would apply specifically to the data standards established under the  DATA Act.

Such  inconsistent reporting can undermine the transparency goals of the DATA  Act, particularly when it affects key data elements, such as those  describing geographical information.

However, OMB staff stated that in  certain places the report did not fully capture the extent of OMB\u2019s actions  related to data governance for the DATA Act data standards.", "According to OMB staff, the Shared Solutions Governance Board  (SSGB), under OMB\u2019s direction, plays an important role in governing  DATA Act data standards. OMB staff said that this relationship exists  because the same agencies and staff participate in both the SSGB and  the governance of the DATA Act data standards.", "In addition, OMB staff confirmed that descriptions of the specific roles and  responsibilities of the SSGB, CFOC Working Group, and the Treasury  office that manages the DAIMS have not been documented. OMB staff  said that many of the same agency personnel participate in all of these  groups, and therefore work closely together on a regular basis. OMB staff  stated that this close involvement results in effective communication and  a consistent approach to governance, and ensures an understanding of  the procedures for changing data standards even though those  procedures are not formally documented.", "We acknowledge OMB\u2019s assertion that the various groups for creating  and administering government-wide data standards (including data  standards established to support the DATA Act) share many of the same  staff. However, OMB\u2019s approach relies on the continued participation of  the same staff in order to maintain continuity rather than relying on  documented policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities for data  governance functions. A key benefit of having a robust, institutionalized  data governance structure is to provide consistent data management  during times of change and transition, such as during staffing transitions  or administration changes. It is important for OMB to clearly delineate  roles and responsibilities so stakeholders understand how governance of  the DATA Act standards is accomplished within the broader context of the  PMA and other efforts.", "OMB staff also said they have communicated all changes to DATA Act  data standards that have been made since the standards were created.  OMB staff told us that the DAIMS is the official data standard for DATA  Act reporting and, as such, includes logs that record all changes to the  standards. According to OMB staff, OMB updated its public data  standards web page on www.max.gov in June 2018 to fix an error and  ensure that the page matched the DAIMS. Staff stated their belief that  such a correction did not represent an actual change to a data standard  and therefore did not need to be recorded in the DAIMS change log or  communicated publicly.", "However, guidance issued in June 2018, OMB Memorandum M-18-16,  identifies the MAX.gov web page as the official repository of the data  standards. Specifically, the guidance directs agencies to report data in  accordance with the standards maintained by OMB and Treasury  pursuant to FFATA, as amended by the DATA Act, and provides a link to  the OFFM website\u2019s listing of data standards definitions.  If OMB chose to  identify the DAIMS\u2014instead of the MAX.gov page\u2014as the official source  of data standards, then the issue about changes not being identified on  the MAX.gov page would not be important. Although OMB made  conforming changes based on our input to align the definition of Primary  Place of Performance on the MAX.gov web page, having clearly  documented procedures for making changes to the data standards and  for ensuring that changes are communicated widely is important for  ensuring the consistent and comparable reporting envisioned under the  act.", "Additionally, in June 2018, OMB made an important change to the  explanatory text that precedes these official data definitions as posted on  the MAX.gov website, clarifying OMB\u2019s policy regarding the use of the  DATA Act data definitions. OMB staff acknowledged that that this  clarification could have been publicized more effectively, which is why we  continue to believe that our second recommendation\u2014to include a  revision history along with the current version of the DATA Act data  definitions\u2014remains valid.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury and  the Acting Director of OMB, as well as interested congressional  committees and other interested parties.
