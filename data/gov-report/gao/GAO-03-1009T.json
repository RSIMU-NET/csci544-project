Both State and USAID face significant management challenges in carrying out their respective missions, particularly in areas such as human capital management, performance measurement, and information technology management. Despite increased funding, resources are not unlimited. Thus, State, USAID, and all government agencies have an obligation to ensure that taxpayer resources are managed wisely. Long-lasting improvements in performance will require continual vigilance and the identification of widespread opportunities to improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of State's and USAID's existing goals and programs. GAO was asked to summarize its findings from reports on State's and USAID's management of resources, actions taken in response to our reports, and recommendations to promote cost savings and more efficient and effective operations at the department and agency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall, State has increased its attention to managing resources, and its efforts are starting to show results, including potential cost savings and improved operational effectiveness and efficiency. For example, in 1996, GAO criticized State's performance in disposing of its overseas property. Between fiscal years 1997 through 2002, State sold 129 properties for more than $459 million with plans to sell additional properties between fiscal years 2003 through 2008 for approximately $300 million. Additional sales would help offset costs of replacing about 160 unsecure and deteriorating embassies. State is now taking a more businesslike approach with its embassy construction program, which is estimated to cost an additional $17 billion beginning in fiscal year 2004. Cost-cutting efforts allowed State to achieve $150 million in potential cost savings during fiscal year 2002. State should continue its reforms as it determines requirements for, designs, and builds new embassies. The costs of maintaining staff overseas are generally very high. In response to management weaknesses GAO identified, State has begun addressing workforce planning issues to ensure that the government has the right people in the right places at the right times. State should continue this work and adopt industry best practices that could reduce costs and streamline services overseas. GAO and others have highlighted deficiencies in State's information technology. State invested $236 million in fiscal year 2002 on modernization initiatives overseas and plans to spend $262 million over fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Ongoing oversight of this investment will be necessary to minimize the risks of spending large sums of money on systems that do not produce commensurate value. State has improved its strategic planning to better link staffing and budgetary requirements with policy priorities. Setting clear objectives and tying resources to them will make operations more efficient. GAO and others have also identified some management weaknesses at USAID, mainly in human capital management and workforce planning, program evaluation and performance measurement, information technology, and financial management. While USAID is taking corrective actions, better management of critical systems is essential to safeguard the agency's funds. Given the added resources State and USAID must manage, current budget deficits, and new requirements since Sept. 11, 2001, oversight is needed to ensure continued progress toward effective management practices. This focus could result in cost savings or other efficiencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of State\u2019s and the  U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) stewardship of their  resources and areas within their budgets where applying strong  management practices has the potential to produce efficiencies that could  result in cost savings.

We have reported that the management of overseas real estate has  been a continuing challenge for State, although the department has made  improvements in recent years.  One of the key weaknesses we found was  the lack of a systematic process to identify unneeded properties and to  dispose of them in a timely manner.  In 1996, we identified properties  worth hundreds of millions of dollars potentially excess to State\u2019s needs or  of questionable value and expensive to maintain that the department had  not previously identified for potential sale.  As a result of State\u2019s inability  to resolve internal disputes and sell excess property in an expeditious  manner, we recommended that the Secretary of State appoint an  independent panel to decide which properties should be sold.  The  Secretary of State created this panel in 1997.  As of April 2002, the Real  Property Advisory Board had reviewed 41 disputed properties and  recommended that 26 be sold.  By that time, State had disposed of seven of  these properties for about $21 million.", "In 2002, we again reviewed State\u2019s processes for identifying and selling  unneeded overseas real estate and found that it had taken steps to  implement a more systematic approach that included asking posts to  annually identify properties for disposal and increasing efforts by OBO  and officials from State\u2019s OIG to identify such properties when they visit  posts.  For example, the director of OBO took steps to resolve disputes  with posts that have delayed the sale of valuable property.  OBO has also  instituted monthly Project Performance Reviews to review all aspects of  real estate management, such as the status of acquisitions and disposal of  overseas property.  However, we found that the department\u2019s ability to  monitor property use and identify potentially unneeded properties was  hampered by errors and omissions in its property inventory.  Inaccurate  inventory information can result in unneeded properties not being  identified for potential sale.  Therefore, we recommended that the  department improve the accuracy of its real property inventory.  In  commenting on our report, OBO said that it had already taken action to  improve its data collection.  For example, State sent a cable to all overseas  posts reminding them of their responsibilities to maintain accurate real  estate records.", "State has significantly improved its performance in selling unneeded  property.  In total, between fiscal years 1997 through 2002, State sold 129  properties for more than $459 million.  Funds generated from property  sales are being used to help offset embassy construction costs in Berlin,  Germany; Luanda, Angola; and elsewhere.  State estimates it will sell  additional properties between fiscal years 2003 and 2008 valued at  approximately $300 million.  More recently, State has taken action to sell  two properties (a 0.4 acre parking lot and an office building) in Paris  identified in a GAO report as potentially unneeded.  After initially resisting  the sale of the parking lot, the department reversed its decision and sold  both properties in June 2003 for a total of $63.1 million\u2014a substantial  benefit to the government.  The parking lot alone was sold conditionally  for $20.7 million.  Although this may be a unique case, it demonstrates  how scrutiny of the property inventory could result in potential savings.   The department should continue to look closely at property holdings to  see if other opportunities exist.

In 1998, State  embarked on the largest overseas embassy construction program in its  history in response to the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa.  From  fiscal years 1999 through 2003, State received approximately $2.7 billion  for its new construction program and began replacing 25 of 185 posts  identified as vulnerable by State.  To better manage this program, OBO has  undertaken several initiatives aimed at improving State\u2019s stewardship of  its funds for embassy buildings, including cutting costs of planned  construction projects, using standard designs, and reducing construction  duration through a \u201cfast track\u201d process.  Moreover, State hopes that  additional management tools aimed at ensuring that new facilities are built  in the most cost-effective manner, including improvements in how  agencies determine requirements for new embassies, will help move the  program forward.

As of February 2003, State had begun  replacing 25 of 185 posts identified by State as vulnerable after the 1998  embassy bombings.  To avoid the problems that weakened the previous  embassy construction program, we recommended that State develop a  long-term capital construction plan that identifies (1) proposed  construction projects\u2019 cost estimates and schedules and (2) estimated  annual funding requirements for the overall program.

These measures have the potential to result in significant cost savings and  other efficiencies.  For example, OBO has    developed Standard Embassy Designs (SED) for use in most embassy  construction projects. SEDs provide OBO with the ability to contract for  shortened design and construction periods and control costs through  standardization;   shifted from \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d contracting toward \u201cdesign-build\u201d  contracts, which have the potential to reduce project costs and  construction time frames;   developed and implemented procedures to enforce cost planning during  the design phase and ensure that the final designs are within budget; and  increased the number of contractors eligible to bid for construction  projects, thereby increasing competition for contracts, which could  potentially result in lower bids.", "OBO has set a goal of a 2-year design and construction period for its mid- sized, standard embassy design buildings, which, if met, could reduce the  amount of time spent in design and construction by almost one year.  We  reported in January 2003 that these cost-cutting efforts allowed OBO to  achieve $150 million in potential cost savings during fiscal year 2002.   These savings, according to OBO, resulted from the application of the  SEDs and increased competition for the design and construction of these  projects.", "Despite these gains, State will face continuing hurdles throughout the life  of the embassy construction program.  These hurdles include meeting  construction schedules within the estimated costs and ensuring that State  has the capacity to manage a large number of projects simultaneously.

Embassy  buildings that are designed too small may require additional construction  and funding in the future; buildings that are too large may have unused  space\u2014a waste of government funds.  State\u2019s construction program in the  late 1980s encountered lengthy delays and cost overruns in part because it  lacked coordinated planning of post requirements prior to approval and  budgeting for construction projects.

OBO now requires that  all staffing projections for new embassy compounds be finalized prior to  submitting funding requests, which are sent to Congress as part of State\u2019s  annual budget request each February.", "In April 2003, we reported that U.S. agencies operating overseas, including  State, were developing staffing projections without a systematic  approach.  We found that State\u2019s headquarters gave embassies little  guidance on factors to consider when developing projections, and thus  U.S. agencies did not take a consistent or systematic approach to  determining long-term staffing needs.  Based on our recommendations,  State in May 2003 issued a \u201cGuide to Developing Staffing Projections for  New Embassy and Consulate Compound Construction,\u201d which requires a  more serious, disciplined approach to developing staffing projections.

As a result, OPAP recommended that  agencies be required to pay rent in government-owned buildings in foreign  countries to cover operating and maintenance costs.  In 2001, an  interagency group put forth a proposal that would require agencies to pay  rent based on the space they occupy in overseas facilities, but the plan was  not enacted.  In 2002, OMB began an effort to develop a mechanism that  would require users of overseas facilities to share the construction costs  associated with those facilities.  The administration believes that if  agencies were required to pay a greater portion of the total costs  associated with operating overseas facilities, they would think more  carefully before posting personnel overseas.  As part of this effort, State  has presented a capital security cost-sharing plan that would require  agencies to help fund its capital construction program.

In 2002, the average annual cost of placing one full-time direct-hire  American family of four in a U.S. embassy was approximately $339,000.   These costs make it critical that the U.S. overseas presence is sized  appropriately to conduct its work.

In fiscal year 2002, Congress  allocated nearly $107 million for the DRI. State requested nearly $100  million annually in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to hire approximately 400  new staff each year.", "The DRI has enabled the department to boost recruitment.  However, State  has historically lacked a systematic approach to determine the appropriate  size and location of its overseas staff.  To move the rightsizing process  forward, the August 2001 President\u2019s Management Agenda identified it as  one of the administration\u2019s priorities.  Given the high costs of maintaining  the U.S. overseas presence, the administration has instructed U.S. agencies  to reconfigure the number of overseas staff to the minimum necessary to  meet U.S. foreign policy goals.  This OMB-led initiative aims to develop  cost-saving tools or models, such as increasing the use of regional centers,  revising the Mission Performance Planning (MPP) process, increasing  overseas administrative efficiency, and relocating functions to the United  States.  According to the OPAP, although the magnitude of savings from  rightsizing the overseas presence cannot be known in advance, \u201csignificant  savings\u201d are achievable.  For example, it said that reducing all agencies\u2019  staffing by 10 percent could yield governmentwide savings of almost $380  million a year.", "GAO\u2019s Rightsizing Framework  In May 2002, we testified on our development of a rightsizing framework.   The framework is a series of questions linking staffing levels to three  critical elements of overseas diplomatic operations: security of facilities,  mission priorities and requirements, and cost of operations.  It also  addresses consideration of rightsizing options, such as relocating  functions back to the United States or to regional centers, competitively  sourcing functions, and streamlining operations.  Rightsizing analyses  could lead decision makers to increase, decrease, or change the mix of  staff at a given post.  For example, based on our work at the U.S. embassy  in Paris, we identified positions that could potentially be relocated to  regional centers or back to the United States. On the other hand,  rightsizing analyses may indicate the need for increased staffing,  particularly at hardship posts.  In a follow-up report to our testimony, we  recommended that the director of OMB ensure that our framework is used  as a basis for assessing staffing levels in the administration\u2019s rightsizing  initiative.", "In commenting on our rightsizing reports, State endorsed our framework  and said it plans to incorporate elements of our rightsizing questions into  its future planning processes, including its MPPs.

In addition, State has already taken some  rightsizing actions to improve the cost effectiveness of its overseas  operating practices.  For example, State    plans to spend at least $80 million to purchase and renovate a 23-acre,  multi-building facility in Frankfurt, Germany\u2014slated to open in mid- 2005\u2014for use as a regional hub to conduct and support diplomatic  operations;   has relocated more than 100 positions from the Paris embassy to the  regional Financial Services Center in Charleston, South Carolina; and is working with OMB on a cost-sharing mechanism, as previously  mentioned, that will give all U.S. agencies an incentive to weigh the high  costs to taxpayers associated with assigning staff overseas.", "In addition to these rightsizing actions, there are other areas where the  adoption of industry best practices could lead to cost reductions and  streamlined services.  For example, in 1997, we reported that State could  significantly streamline its employee transfer and housing relocation  processes.  We also reported in 1998 that State\u2019s overseas posts could  potentially save millions of dollars by implementing best practices such as  competitive sourcing.", "In light of competing priorities as new needs emerge, particularly in Iraq  and Afghanistan, State must be prepared to make difficult strategic  decisions on which posts and positions it will fill and which positions it  could remove, relocate, or regionalize.

Meanwhile, USAID\u2019s program budget has increased from $7.3 billion in  2001 to about $12 billion in fiscal year 2003, due primarily to significant  increases in HIV/AIDS funding and supplemental funding for emerging  programs in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The combination of continued attrition  of experienced foreign service officers, increased program funding, and  emerging foreign policy priorities raises concerns regarding USAID\u2019s  ability to maintain effective oversight of its foreign assistance programs.", "USAID\u2019s lack of progress in institutionalizing a workforce planning system  has led to certain vulnerabilities.  For example, as we reported in July  2002, USAID lacks a \u201csurge capacity\u201d that enables it to quickly hire the  staff needed to respond to emerging demands and post-conflict or post- emergency reconstruction situations.  We also reported that insufficient  numbers of contract officers affected the agency\u2019s ability to deliver  hurricane reconstruction assistance in Latin America in the program\u2019s  early phases.", "USAID is aware of its human capital management and workforce planning  shortcomings and is now beginning to address some of them with targeted  hiring and other actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement", "paragraphs": ["USAID continues to face difficulties in identifying and collecting the data it  needs to develop reliable performance measures and accurately report the  results of its programs.  Our work and that of USAID\u2019s OIG have identified  a number of problems with the annual results data that USAID\u2019s operating  units have been reporting.  USAID has acknowledged these concerns and  has undertaken several initiatives to correct them. Although the agency  has made a serious effort to develop improved performance measures, it  continues to report numerical outputs that do not gauge the impact of its  programs.", "Without accurate and reliable performance data, USAID has little  assurance that its programs achieve their objectives and related targets.  In  July 1999, we commented on USAID\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan  and noted that because the agency depends on international organizations  and thousands of partner institutions for data, it does not have full control  over how data are collected, reported, or verified.  In April 2002, we  reported that USAID had evaluated few of its experiences in using various  funding mechanisms and different types of organizations to achieve its  objectives.  We concluded that with better data on these aspects of the  agency\u2019s operations, USAID managers and congressional overseers would  be better equipped to analyze whether the agency\u2019s mix of approaches  takes full advantage of nongovernmental organizations to achieve the  agency\u2019s purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Technology and Financial Management", "paragraphs": ["USAID\u2019s information systems do not provide managers with the accurate  information they need to make sound and cost-effective decisions.   USAID\u2019s OIG has reported that the agency\u2019s processes for procuring  information technology have not followed established guidelines, which  require executive agencies to implement a process that maximizes the  value and assesses the risks of information technology investments.  In  addition, USAID\u2019s computer systems are vulnerable and need better  security controls. USAID management has acknowledged these  weaknesses and the agency is making efforts to correct them.", "Effective financial systems and controls are necessary to ensure that  USAID management has timely and reliable information to make effective,  informed decisions and that assets are safeguarded.  USAID has made  progress in correcting some of its systems and internal control  deficiencies and is in the process of revising its plan to remedy financial  management weaknesses as required by the Federal Financial  Management Improvement Act of 1996.  To obtain its goal, however,  USAID needs to continue efforts to resolve its internal control weaknesses  and ensure that planned upgrades to its financial systems are in  compliance with federal financial system requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Democracy and Rule of Law Programs", "paragraphs": ["Our reviews of democracy and rule of law programs in Latin America and  the former Soviet Union demonstrate that these programs have had  limited results and suggest areas for improving the efficiency and impact  of these efforts.", "In Latin America, we found that U.S. assistance has helped bring about  important criminal justice reforms in five countries.  This assistance has  also help improve transparency and accountability of some government  functions, increase attention to human rights, and support elections that  observation groups have considered free and fair.  In several countries of  the former Soviet Union, U.S. agencies have helped support a variety of  legal system reforms and introduced some innovative legal concepts and  practices in the areas of legislative and judicial reform, legal education,  law enforcement, and civil society.  In both regions, however,  sustainability of these programs is questionable.  Establishing democracy  and rule of law in these countries is a complex undertaking that requires  long-term host government commitment and consensus to succeed.   However, host governments have not always provided the political  support and financial and human capital needed to sustain these reforms.   In other cases, U.S.-supported programs were limited, and countries did  not adopt the reforms and programs on a national scale.", "In both of our reviews, we found that several management issues shared  by USAID and the other agencies have affected implementation of these  programs.  Poor coordination among the key U.S. agencies has been a  long-standing management problem, and cooperation with other foreign  donors has been limited. U.S. agencies\u2019 strategic plans do not outline how  these agencies will overcome coordination problems and cooperate with  other foreign donors on program planning and implementation to  maximize scarce resources.  Also, U.S. agencies, including USAID, have  not consistently evaluated program results and have tended to stress  output measures, such as the numbers of people trained, over indicators  that measure program outcomes and results, such as reforming law  enforcement practices.  Further, U.S. agencies have not consistently  shared lessons learned from completed projects, thus missing  opportunities to enhance the outcomes of their programs.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
