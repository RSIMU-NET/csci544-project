Progress includes the issuance of common federal adjudicative guidelines and updated strategic documents to help sustain the reform effort. However, agencies face challenges in implementing certain aspects of the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards\u2014criteria for conducting background investigations\u2014including establishing a continuous evaluation program, and the issuance of a reciprocity policy to guide agencies in honoring previously granted clearances by other agencies remains incomplete. Executive branch agencies have taken recent steps to prioritize over 50 reform initiatives to help focus agency efforts and facilitate their completion. In addition, while agencies have taken steps to establish government-wide performance measures for the quality of investigations, neither the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) nor the Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council (PAC) have set a milestone for their completion. Without establishing such a milestone, completion may be further delayed and agencies will not have a schedule against which they can track progress or to which they are accountable.", "The number of executive branch agencies meeting established timeliness objectives for initial security clearances decreased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and reporting has been limited. For example, 59 percent of the executive branch agencies reviewed by GAO reported meeting investigation and adjudication timeliness objectives for initial top secret clearances in fiscal year 2012, compared with 10 percent in fiscal year 2016. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) required the executive branch to submit an annual report, through 2011, to appropriate congressional committees on, among other things, the time required to conduct investigations, adjudicate cases, and grant clearances. Since the requirement ended, reporting has been limited to a portion of the intelligence community. Without comprehensive reporting, Congress will not be able to monitor agencies' progress in meeting timeliness objectives, identify corrections, or effectively execute its oversight role.", "The National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), within the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), has taken steps to improve the background investigation process, but it faces operational challenges in addressing the investigation backlog and increasing investigator capacity. While NBIB has taken positive steps to improve its oversight of background investigation contracts, it faces operational challenges in reducing the investigation backlog\u2014which grew from 190,000 cases in August 2014 to more than 709,000 in September 2017. To increase capacity NBIB has hired additional federal investigators and increased the number of its investigative fieldwork contracts, but it has not developed a plan for reducing the backlog or established goals for increasing total investigator capacity. Without such a plan and goals, the backlog may persist and executive branch agencies will continue to lack the cleared personnel needed to help execute their respective missions. The bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, passed by Congress in November 2017, would authorize DOD to conduct its own background investigations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider reinstating the IRTPA requirement for clearance timeliness reporting.

In 2014, emphasis on security clearance reform was renewed  following high-profile events. These events included the June 2013  disclosure of classified documents by a former National Security Agency  contractor, and the September 2013 shooting at the Washington Navy  Yard by an individual who had both access to the facility and a security  clearance. However, these reform efforts immediately faced significant  challenges. In 2014, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)   experienced issues with respect to its largest background investigation  contractor, and it did not exercise an option to extend the contract.  According to OPM, it conducts about 95 percent of the federal  government\u2019s background investigations. Additionally, in 2015, OPM was  subjected to a massive security breach of its information technology (IT)  systems.

For example, in 2017, we reported on  challenges related to the implementation of an executive branch-wide  continuous evaluation program, and in 2015 we reported on the need to  take steps to improve the reciprocity of security clearances among  executive branch agencies. Appendix I provides the status of  recommendations we have made to improve the personnel security  clearance process. Moreover, in our 2015 and 2017 updates to our High- Risk series, we identified the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) personnel  security clearances as a previous high-risk area that we continue to  monitor to determine whether the improvements we have noted are  sustained and whether any new issues have emerged.", "We began our work under the authority of the Comptroller General to  conduct evaluations on his own initiative.

Additionally, we  interviewed PAC Program Management Office officials as well as officials  from OMB, OPM, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  (ODNI), and DOD, due to their roles as principal members of the PAC.  We also interviewed officials from the Departments of Homeland Security,  Justice, and State with regard to their plans to implement continuous  evaluation\u2014a key reform effort. We compared this information against  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to the  identification of risks and monitoring activities; criteria for assessing high- risk areas, such as leadership commitment; and best practices for  comprehensive and effective IT strategies identified in our prior work.  We also reviewed the executive branch\u2019s guide for quality standards and  tools, and we identified and applied criteria developed from our body of  work on using results-oriented management tools to help achieve desired  program outcomes.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed relevant statutes and  ODNI guidance addressing the timeliness of background investigations  and adjudications as well as reporting requirements. We also reviewed  available executive branch reports on timeliness. We obtained data from  ODNI on the timeliness of initial personnel security clearances for fiscal  years 2012 through 2016 for specific executive branch agencies. We  excluded the data reported by State to ODNI from our analysis due to a  July 2017 report by the State Office of Inspector General, which identified  a number of errors in the department\u2019s security clearance timeliness  data. As such, we reported on the timeliness of the remaining executive  branch agencies for which ODNI provided data. To assess the reliability  of the data for the remaining executive branch agencies, we reviewed  relevant documentation and interviewed officials about data quality  control procedures. Based on these steps, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For that reason,  we did not independently test the accuracy of the agencies\u2019 databases.", "We selected the fiscal year 2012 through 2016 timeframe for our analysis  because the executive branch has not publicly reported on the timeliness  of individual executive branch agencies since fiscal year 2011. We  analyzed the data to determine the extent to which agencies are meeting  IRTPA timeliness objectives for completing the fastest 90 percent of initial  secret clearance determinations within 60 days (40 days to investigate and 20 days to adjudicate). Appendix II provides additional details on  IRTPA as it relates to personnel security clearances. We also analyzed  the extent to which agencies are meeting ODNI revised timeliness  objectives for completing the fastest 90 percent of initial top secret  clearance determinations. In addition, we reviewed relevant ODNI and  PAC reports for information regarding the timeliness of investigations and  compared it against criteria for assessing high-risk areas such as  monitoring and demonstrated progress. Finally, we interviewed PAC,  ODNI, and NBIB officials regarding timeliness challenges, efforts to  improve timeliness, and the reporting of timeliness information.", "To address our third objective, we analyzed studies, organizational  charts, plans, and other documents related to the establishment,  transition, oversight, and operation of NBIB. We compared these  documents against key principles of strategic workforce planning that we  have identified in prior work, such as determining the critical skills and  competencies needed to achieve current and future programmatic results  and developing strategies that are tailored to address gaps in numbers of  people, skills and competencies, and deployment of the workforce;  selected OPM workforce planning best practices; OMB policy that  requires agencies to take actions to ensure that they have sufficient  internal capability to maintain control over functions that are core to the  agency\u2019s mission and operations; and criteria for assessing high-risk  areas such as leadership commitment, capacity, action plans, monitoring,  and demonstrated progress. Additionally, given the OPM data breach in  2015 and a decision to shift security clearance IT functions to a new  DOD-developed and -operated National Background Investigation  System (NBIS), we examined efforts to operationalize the new system  and leveraged our recent work examining IT security at OPM. Further,  we reviewed and analyzed current and former NBIB/ Federal Investigative  Services (FIS) background investigation fieldwork services contracts to  determine investigative capacity and steps taken to improve timeliness.  FIS is the prior entity within OPM that conducted background  investigations for the federal government. We interviewed NBIB officials  to determine how NBIB was providing oversight of investigative contracts  and how that process changed in the wake of the 2014 issues related to a  major investigative service provider.

These standards outline criteria  for conducting background investigations to determine eligibility for a  security clearance and are intended to ensure cost-effective, timely, and  efficient protection of national interests and to facilitate reciprocal  recognition of the resulting investigations. In April 2015, we reported  that executive branch agencies with responsibilities for security  clearances and suitability determinations had twice approved updated  Federal Investigative Standards to replace the 1997 Standards, but that  progress in implementing the updated standards had been limited.  Specifically, as part of the reform effort that began after the passage of  IRTPA, the Director of National Intelligence and the Acting Director of  OPM, in their roles as Security and Suitability Executive Agents, signed  new Federal Investigative Standards on December 13, 2008, and stated  that the anticipated initial deployment of the standards was to begin in the  third quarter of fiscal year 2009. However, the 2008 Federal Investigative  Standards were not implemented, according to ODNI officials, because  key terms were not clearly defined and required further clarification.", "In December 2012, the Director of National Intelligence and Director of  OPM approved updated Federal Investigative Standards. Among other  things, the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards identify five investigative  tiers. According to OPM Federal Investigations Notice 16-02, tier 3  investigations are required for eligibility for access to secret and  confidential information, or for noncritical sensitive positions, or \u201cL\u201d  access. OPM Federal Investigations Notice 16-07 indicates that tier 5  investigations are required for eligibility for access to top secret or  Sensitive Compartmented Information, or for critical sensitive or special  sensitive positions, or \u201cQ\u201d access. The updated standards also changed  the frequency of periodic reinvestigations for certain clearance holders.  The Federal Investigative Standards milestone for full operating capability  is the end of fiscal year 2017. Specific details on this topic were omitted  because the information is sensitive. See figure 1 for a timeline of efforts  made since 1997 to implement updated Federal Investigative Standards.", "The 2012 standards include continuous evaluation as a new requirement  for certain clearance holders. This is a key executive branch initiative to  more frequently identify and assess security-relevant information between  periodic reinvestigations. Efforts to implement a continuous evaluation  program were included in the implementation documents from the prior  reform effort following approval of the 2008 Federal Investigative  Standards, including an operational milestone for implementing a  continuous evaluation program by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.  ODNI has adjusted the milestones for implementing the program and  issuing a Security Executive Agent Directive for continuous evaluation  several times. For example, in April 2015, we reported that ODNI planned  to issue a continuous evaluation policy by September 2016 and to  implement a continuous evaluation capability for certain clearance  holders by December 2016. However, in November 2017 we found that  while ODNI has taken an initial step to implement continuous evaluation  in a phased approach across the executive branch, it has not yet issued a  Security Executive Agent Directive for continuous evaluation or  determined when the future phases of implementation will occur.  According to ODNI officials, as of August 2017, this directive was  undergoing interagency coordination and would be issued upon  completion of that process. As of August 2017, continuous evaluation had  not yet been fully implemented and ODNI had not set a new milestone for  when it would occur. In November 2017, we recommended, among other  things, that the Director of National Intelligence issue a continuous  evaluation directive and develop an implementation plan. ODNI generally  concurred with those recommendations. Figure 2 provides an overview  of the adjusted executive branch milestones for issuing a continuous  evaluation policy and implementing a continuous evaluation program,  including developing a technical capability.", "Reciprocity policy. In 2004, IRTPA required that all security clearance  background investigations and determinations completed by an  authorized investigative agency or authorized adjudicative agency be  accepted by all agencies, subject to certain exceptions. As reported in a  cross-agency priority goal quarterly update in fiscal year 2016, the  milestone for ODNI to issue and promulgate an updated national security  reciprocity policy was September 2016. Security clearance reciprocity is  statutorily required by IRTPA, subject to certain exceptions, and it is  currently implemented by executive orders and guidance across  executive-branch agencies. To consolidate existing reciprocity guidance,  ODNI planned to issue a comprehensive, national-level security  clearance reciprocity policy intended to resolve challenges associated  with consistent, timely reciprocity processing across the executive branch.  However, the issuance date has been postponed multiple times\u2014the  original milestone was September 2013\u2014and as of July 2017, ODNI had  not yet issued a reciprocity policy or identified a new milestone for its  issuance. In July 2017, ODNI officials stated that a draft reciprocity policy  was pending entry into the formal interagency coordination process and  would be issued upon completion of that process. However, ODNI  officials were unable to provide an estimated issuance date because,  according to the officials, the length of the interagency coordination  process can vary. PAC Program Management Office officials noted that  issuance delays are due, in part, to the development of related personnel  security policies, including continuous evaluation, with which the  reciprocity policy must be aligned. Figure 3 shows milestones for the  issuance of the reciprocity policy.", "In November 2010, we found that although executive-branch agency  officials stated that reciprocity is regularly granted, agencies did not have  complete records on the extent to which previously granted security  clearance investigations and adjudications are honored government- wide. Further, we found that agencies lacked a standard metric for  tracking reciprocity. We recommended that the Deputy Director for  Management, OMB, in the capacity as chair of the PAC, develop  comprehensive metrics to track when reciprocity is granted and report the  findings from the expanded tracking to Congress. OMB concurred with  our recommendation. However, in April 2015, we found that executive  branch agencies still did not consistently track when reciprocity is or is not  granted, nor did they have metrics in place to measure how often  reciprocity occurs. ODNI officials stated that they planned to develop  them by 2016. Although the Director of National Intelligence had  requested Intelligence Community elements take steps to begin capturing  reciprocity data in December 2014, such baseline data needed to support  measures for reciprocity were not being collected government-wide. We  recommended, in 2015, that the Director of National Intelligence require  the development of baseline data to support measures for reciprocity.", "These data would help to identify and monitor changes in reciprocity  government-wide. ODNI did not state whether it concurred with the  recommendation, and as of November 2017, it had not been  implemented.", "PAC officials stated that the greatest challenge of the reform effort is the  breadth and complexity of the issues it is trying to resolve, noting that the  reform effort involves nearly every executive branch agency. In addition,  these officials stated that sometimes agencies focus on short-term high- visibility issues instead of longer-term efforts, which are needed for  systemic change. ODNI officials also noted the complexities of reforming  the personnel security clearance process and working toward a whole-of- government solution. These officials noted that the reform efforts involve  coordination among a number of agencies across the executive branch,  which is both time and resource intensive. Both PAC Program  Management Office and ODNI officials also identified limited agency  resources and competing priorities\u2014across executive branch agencies\u2014 as additional challenges.", "The PAC has taken recent steps to help address some of these  challenges to continued progress, which could facilitate the completion of  the key initiatives discussed above. For example, in its Implementation  Plan the PAC has identified approximately 50 initiatives on which it will  focus its work over the next 5 fiscal years and has aligned those activities  with its four strategic categories of initiatives\u2014trusted workforce, modern  vetting, secure and modern mission-capable IT, and continuous  performance improvement. However, according to ODNI officials, during  their review of a draft of the Implementation Plan, they raised concerns  about the number of initiatives and highlighted the need to provide greater  prioritization of the initiatives to help better focus efforts. For example,  some agencies are assigned as a primary owner of multiple initiatives.  Specific details of the number of initiatives to which agencies are  assigned were omitted because the information is sensitive.", "PAC Program Management Officials stated that, to alleviate these  concerns, they subsequently identified two to four priority initiatives within  each of the four categories to help focus agency efforts. These officials  further stated that the PAC intends to update and reissue a condensed  version of its Implementation Plan annually so that it can make revisions  as issues that affect these priorities, such as reduced budgets, occur.  These 11 priority initiatives are identified in the PAC\u2019s Implementation  Plan which, according to PAC Program Management Office officials, the  PAC finalized and circulated to executive branch agencies in February  2017. For example, establishing a continuous evaluation capability and  strengthening and aligning guidelines for the reciprocal recognition of  existing vetting decisions are listed among the PAC\u2019s priority initiatives.  Given the limited agency resources cited by ODNI and PAC Program  Management Office officials and other key competing efforts, such as  improving investigation timeliness, the PAC\u2019s prioritization of initiatives  could help to refocus efforts on the most critical areas of the reform effort,  and could provide agencies with a manageable number of initiatives on  which to prioritize their efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Executive Branch Has Taken Steps to Establish Government-wide Performance Measures for the Quality of Background Investigations, but It Is Unclear When This Effort Will Be Completed", "paragraphs": ["Our prior work on personnel security clearances has identified concerns  about the quality of background investigations and has highlighted the  need to build quality throughout the process for almost 20 years.  Additionally, we found that executive branch reports on the personnel  security clearance process contained limited information on quality in the  process. In May 2009, we recommended, among other things, that the  Deputy Director for Management of OMB, in the capacity as Chair of the  PAC, include in an IRTPA-required report to Congress quality metrics to  provide more transparency on personnel security clearances. OMB  concurred with that recommendation. However, the 2010 report to  Congress did not include quality metrics, and the IRTPA reporting  requirement expired in 2011.

This body of work provides agencies with a framework for  effectively managing program performance to achieve desired outcomes,  including establishing performance measures. In addition, Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management  should establish and review performance measures and monitor internal  control systems. Further, we found in previous work that interim  milestones can be used to show progress toward implementing efforts or  to make adjustments when necessary.

First, as previously discussed, ODNI and OPM issued Quality  Assessment Standards for background investigations in January 2015 to  establish standard criteria for agencies to consistently evaluate complete  investigations. The standards were developed through an interagency  effort chaired by ODNI, OPM, and DOD. These standards define  complete investigations as those in which all required components were  obtained in full and any known issues\u2014such as criminal activity\u2014were  resolved per the standards. DOD officials highlighted issue resolution\u2014 having enough useful information about the circumstances surrounding a  given issue to make an adjudicative determination\u2014as a persistent  challenge with background investigations for personnel security  clearances, and as key to determining investigation quality.", "Second, ODNI developed the QART, through which agencies will be able  to report on the completeness of investigations, to include whether  adjudicators considered issues identified during an investigation to have  been sufficiently resolved. According to ODNI officials, they began to  implement the QART in October 2016, and full implementation is  expected by the end of calendar year 2017.", "ODNI officials stated that they are collecting sufficient data from the  QART in order to develop measures for the quality of investigations. In  ODNI\u2019s review of a draft of this report, officials stated that it is premature  to set a milestone for completing government-wide performance  measures for the quality of investigations and that ODNI will set such a  milestone when the QART data have been fully analyzed.

Figure 4  provides an overview of the timeline for the executive branch\u2019s three-step  process to develop measures for the quality of investigations.", "Although ODNI has developed the QART, and ODNI and OPM have  issued the Quality Assessment Standards, there are still challenges to  resolve as measures for the quality of investigations are established. For  example, DOD officials stated that they do not intend for all of their  adjudicators to use the QART, and that they have not developed an  interface between their Rapid Assessment of Incomplete Security  Evaluations system and the QART. DOD officials also stated that they  will continue to use their tool until the QART is automated for use in a  new Defense Information System for Security. If DOD investigations\u2014 which represent the majority of the background investigations conducted  by NBIB\u2014are not captured by the QART, it is unclear how ODNI will have  sufficient data to develop government-wide measures for the quality of  investigations. Further, NBIB officials noted that if their largest customer  is not utilizing the QART, they are not positioned to receive  comprehensive feedback.", "In April 2015 we recommended, among other things, that the Director of  National Intelligence, in his capacity as Security Executive Agent,  develop, implement, and report to Congress on government-wide, results- oriented performance measures for security clearance background  investigation quality. ODNI did not state whether it concurred with that  recommendation, and the recommendation has not been implemented.  We continue to believe that measures for the quality of background  investigations are needed to provide decision-makers, including OMB and  Congress, with information on the quality of personnel security clearance  background investigations, and to help ensure the quality of  investigations.

Specifically, these officials stated  that they have discovered that NBIS may require many more inter- connections to OPM legacy systems than originally planned. According to  these officials, NBIB will continue to rely on OPM legacy systems for  investigations of any complexity until NBIS becomes fully operational.", "Further, according to DOD CIO officials, when the executive branch  begins to use NBIS, complex background investigations would begin in  NBIS\u2019s electronic application, but would then need to pass through or  draw data from multiple OPM legacy systems before returning to NBIS for  adjudication. According to DOD CIO officials, since OPM has 43 back- office functions fed by various systems that are often inter-related, a  simple one-to-one system swap of NBIS for an OPM legacy system is not  feasible. DOD CIO officials stated that the project management team  building NBIS is currently working to fully understand how OPM\u2019s various  back-office functions are tied together, and also evaluating the cyber- security risks inherent in connecting to OPM\u2019s legacy systems. DOD CIO  officials explained that this connection, as well as logistical challenges  associated with data migration from the legacy systems to NBIS, raises  concerns about risks to NBIS. Until these risks are properly evaluated,  any connection to the legacy systems could present vulnerabilities,  according to DOD CIO officials. OPM officials disagreed, stating that  OPM and DOD already have IT connection points with the OPM legacy  systems, and that the security of OPM\u2019s systems and data continues to  be an OPM priority.", "Securing the legacy systems will be a joint effort by DOD and OPM,  according to an October 2016 Memorandum of Agreement between the  two agencies regarding the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of  each party throughout the entire lifecycle of OPM\u2019s use of DOD\u2019s IT  systems in support of the background investigation process. Under the  agreement, OPM will retain ownership and responsibility for the operation  and performance of all system authorization activities for OPM legacy  systems throughout their lifecycle. The agreement provides that OPM will  maintain security documentation and information and interconnection  exchange agreements, own control selection and security role  assignment processes, and perform risk executive functions. The  memorandum further states that the security of the legacy OPM IT  environment will be a joint effort between OPM and DOD, with DOD  assisting in a comprehensive security assessment of all OPM legacy IT  systems and related infrastructure on a reimbursable basis. According to  DOD CIO and NBIB officials, there is close coordination on a technical  level between the two agencies on securing the OPM legacy systems  used by NBIB. The officials said that weekly coordination meetings are  held between the two agencies, and that DOD has embedded staff at  OPM who are under the direct supervision of the OPM CIO.", "Both GAO and the OPM Inspector General have raised concerns on  multiple occasions about various aspects of IT security at OPM, including  OPM legacy systems used by NBIB. For example, in August 2017, we  reported on OPM\u2019s progress in implementing 19 recommendations made  by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team to bolster its  information security practices and controls in the wake of the 2015  breaches. We found that, as of May 2017, OPM had fully implemented  11 of the recommendations. For the remaining 8 recommendations,  actions for 4 were still in progress, and for the other 4, OPM indicated it  had completed actions to address them, but we noted further  improvements were needed.", "We further reported that since the 2015 data breaches, which included a  compromise of OPM\u2019s systems and files related to background  investigations for 21.5 million individuals, OPM has made progress in  improving its security to prevent, mitigate, and respond to data breaches  involving sensitive personal records and background investigations  information. However, we also found that OPM did not effectively  monitor actions taken to remediate identified weaknesses. OMB requires  agencies to create a Plan of Action and Milestones to track efforts to  remediate identified weaknesses, such as those leading to the 19  recommendations made by the United States Computer Emergency  Readiness Team. In addition, OPM\u2019s policy requires that scheduled  completion dates be included in the plan. The policy also requires a  system\u2019s Information System Security Officer to develop a weakness  closure package containing evidence of how an open Plan of Action and  Milestones has been remediated before the issue, or recommendation in  this case, can be closed. Although OPM has a Plan of Action and  Milestones to address the 19 recommendations, we found that it had not  validated actions taken in a timely manner or updated completion dates in  the plan. Because the United States Computer Emergency Readiness  Team recommendations are intended to improve the agency\u2019s security  posture, we recommended that more timely validation of the effectiveness  of the actions taken is warranted. Until closure packages are created and  the evidence of such actions is validated, OPM has limited assurance that  the actions taken have effectively mitigated vulnerabilities that can  expose its systems to cybersecurity incidents.", "Additionally, in May 2016 we reported on the implementation of OPM\u2019s  information security program and the security of selected high-impact  systems. We found that OPM, one of four agencies reviewed, had  implemented numerous controls to protect selected systems, but that  access controls had not always been implemented effectively. We  reported that weaknesses also existed in patching known software  vulnerabilities and planning for contingencies, and that an underlying  reason for these weaknesses was that OPM had not fully implemented  key elements of its information security program. We recommended that  OPM fully implement key elements of its program, including addressing  shortcomings related to its security plans, training, and system testing.  According to OPM officials, the agency is taking actions to address these  recommendations. In August 2016, we issued a restricted version of our  May 2016 report that identified vulnerabilities specific to each of the two  systems we reviewed and made recommendations to resolve access  control weaknesses in those systems. In December 2016, OPM indicated its concurrence with the recommendations and provided  timeframes for implementing them. OPM officials expressed concern that  the information from our 2016 reports was now dated, stating that it no  longer reflects the current security posture at OPM, and said that they  had taken actions to address these recommendations. However, all of the  recommendations directed to OPM from the two reports remained open  as of November 2017. We had not received any documentation regarding  these actions as of November 2017 and thus could not validate the extent  that any of these recommendations have been addressed.", "OPM\u2019s Office of the Inspector General has also raised related concerns,  most recently in its October 2017 report on OPM\u2019s security program and  practices. Overall, the OPM Inspector General found that OPM\u2019s  cybersecurity maturity level was measured at a level 2, \u201cDefined\u201d,  meaning that its policies, procedures and strategy were formalized and  documented but were not consistently implemented. According to the  report, OPM has made improvements in its security assessment and  authorization program, and its previous material weakness related to  authorizations is now considered a significant deficiency for fiscal year  2017. The report noted that there are still widespread issues related to  system authorizations, primarily related to documentation inconsistencies  and incomplete or inadequate testing of the systems\u2019 security controls. In  addition, the report identified a significant deficiency in OPM\u2019s information  security management structure, and found that OPM was not making  substantial progress in implementing prior Inspector General  recommendations. The report noted that OPM had only closed 34 percent  of its findings issued in the past 2 years.", "In addition to these IT security concerns, funding uncertainties have also  complicated the development of NBIS. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2017  budget included $95 million for the development of the system; however,  according to DOD CIO officials, of the $95 million that was appropriated,  DOD had provided only $31 million for NBIS as of June 2017.  According to DOD CIO officials, the fiscal year 2017 continuing resolution  had complicated decisions about the funding and disbursement schedule  with consequences for planning and the apportioning of resources.

As currently  structured, NBIB officials stated that there are now about 350 federal  employees within NBIB\u2019s Quality Oversight department who conduct  these reviews for both contractor- and federal investigator-conducted  cases to determine whether an investigation meets investigative  standards for completeness before being released to the customer  agency for adjudication.", "Using an internal database, OPM reviewers identify what, if any, elements  of the investigative reports are incomplete and do not meet standards,  and they return cases to the investigators for rework as necessary. When  OPM reviewers determine that a case meets investigative standards, they  close the case and submit it to an adjudicator. Contractors are evaluated  for quality performance based on the number of times a case is returned  by OPM reviewers for rework as a percentage of the total number of  cases completed.

CORs, who are designated in writing by contracting officers,  assist in the technical monitoring or administration of a contract. Under  NBIB\u2019s current background investigation fieldwork contracts, the COR  provides technical direction and control during contractor performance,  monitors contract progress, and determines for payment approval  purposes whether performance is acceptable with respect to content,  quality of services and materials, cost, and timeliness. NBIB officials  stated that prior to the establishment of the inspections branch, the CORs  were responsible for monitoring all aspects of contract compliance as well  as a range of administrative duties, such as tracking performance data, IT  support, and billing.

NBIB officials  explained that they do not plan to increase the federal investigator  capacity beyond the currently approved 1,975 because they do not have  the ability to absorb more staff. According to the officials, new  investigators must be trained by experienced investigators which reduces  the amount of time the experienced investigators have to conduct  investigative work. When estimating federal investigator capacity, NBIB  assumes it will have 277 full-time equivalent vacancies at any given time  due to high attrition rates. Further, NBIB officials could not project the  federal investigator workforce past April 2018 due to high attrition rates.", "Given challenges with increasing its federal investigative staff, NBIB  continues to rely on contractors to conduct the majority of investigations.  NBIB officials noted that contractors perform about 60 percent of NBIB\u2019s  total investigative cases.

In July 2017, OPM  officials told us that the contractor and federal staff capacity they currently  possess enables them to complete a sufficient number of investigations to  prevent the number of pending investigations from increasing further.  However, they acknowledged that the four contracts and federal  investigator staff do not currently provide OPM enough capacity to reduce  the pending number of investigations to the \u201chealthy\u201d inventory level of  180,000 cases.", "NBIB officials have conducted analyses to determine how changes in the  total number of investigators could affect the backlog over time,  accounting for current and projected investigator capacity, prior time  studies, historical data, geographic location, and other factors.  Specifically, NBIB officials assessed four scenarios, from the status quo\u2014 assuming no additional contractor or federal investigator hires\u2014to an  aggressive contractor staffing plan beyond January 2018, but in July 2017  they determined that the aggressive plan was not feasible. The two  scenarios that NBIB identified as most feasible would not result in a  \u201chealthy\u201d inventory level until fiscal year 2022 at the earliest. For example,  under one scenario, each contractor would increase investigator capacity  under current staffing projections through early 2018. Assuming that the  contractors adhere to these projections, NBIB would have the capacity to  address incoming cases and begin to reduce the backlog, but the backlog  would not reach a \u201chealthy\u201d inventory level until sometime after fiscal year  2022. However, NBIB leadership has not determined whether the costs  and benefits of any one scenario are preferable to the costs and benefits  of the others.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government establishes that  management should clearly define objectives to enable the identification  of risks and define risk tolerances. In addition, our high-risk criteria for  capacity call for agencies to ensure they have the capacity, in terms of  people and resources, to address and resolve risks. We have also  found in previous work that milestones can be used to show progress  toward implementing efforts, or to make adjustments when necessary.  Developing and using specific milestones to guide and gauge progress  toward achieving an agency\u2019s desired results informs management of the  rate of progress toward achieving goals or whether adjustments need to  be made in order to maintain progress within given timeframes. However,  NBIB leadership has not established goals or milestones for reducing the  size of the investigation backlog, or goals for increasing total investigator  capacity\u2014for both federal employees and contractor personnel. As a  result, the value of NBIB\u2019s backlog analysis is limited, because it is not  part of a broader plan to address the backlog and achieve timeliness  objectives. Further, the extent to which NBIB should adjust its investigator  capacity in the future remains unclear, as the currently projected capacity  levels are not tied to any established goals or milestones to address the  backlog or achieve the timeliness objectives.", "In addition to increasing investigative capacity, NBIB personnel are  attempting to decrease the backlog by making the background  investigation process more effective and efficient. To do so, NBIB  conducted a business process reengineering effort that was intended to  identify challenges in the process and their root causes. This effort  identified 57 challenges, which were divided into five main categories that  affected multiple phases of the background investigation process. NBIB  then developed five portfolios, with 21 initiatives, to address the identified  challenges. For example, one of the categories of challenges was poor  data quality at the start of the investigation, which was described as  related to issues such as no auto-validation of information, no pre- population of forms, and variable quality of submissions. NBIB developed  four initiatives related to automation and digitization to improve the quality  of this information. NBIB officials said that this business process  reengineering effort is working to reduce the investigative level of effort  across the community. Specifically, NBIB officials cited efforts that have  been implemented to reduce the number of personnel hours necessary to  complete an investigation, such as centralizing interviews and using  video-teleconferencing for overseas investigations (to decrease travel  time), automated record checks, and focused writing (to make reports  more succinct and less time-consuming to prepare). However, NBIB has  not identified how the implementation of the business process  reengineering effort will affect the backlog or the need for additional  investigators in the future.", "Without a plan, including goals and milestones, for reducing the backlog,  which includes a determination of the effect of the business process  reengineering efforts on the backlog, NBIB will lack the information and a  course of action needed to effectively manage the inventory of pending  investigations it conducts on behalf of other executive branch agencies.  Further, without establishing goals for increasing total investigator  capacity\u2014for both federal employees and contractor personnel\u2014in  accordance with the plan for reducing the backlog, NBIB may not be  positioned to achieve the goals and milestones outlined in that plan.  Ultimately, if NBIB is unable to reduce the backlog, executive branch  agencies will continue to lack the cleared personnel needed to help  execute their respective missions, which could decrease the agencies\u2019  overall effectiveness and efficiency, and pose risks to national security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NBIB Has Identified Some Workforce Needs but Does Not Have a Strategic Workforce Plan", "paragraphs": ["Our review of NBIB planning and workforce documents indicates that it  has taken workforce planning steps. For example, the bureau developed  a transition plan to help guide the transition from FIS to NBIB. This plan  includes a request for a personnel study for its new Contracting and  Business Solutions department to determine any needs or realignment of  resources, skills, or qualification gaps; however, the transition plan does  not mention a personnel study to address the needs of any other  departments within NBIB. NBIB officials stated that the bureau conducted  this study in early fiscal year 2017, and those results are being used to  build the Contracting and Business Solutions department. NBIB officials  said that NBIB plans to conduct a personnel study for its other  departments once there is greater clarity and direction regarding the  conduct of background investigations as a result of the plan developed by  DOD to conduct its own investigations and any subsequent direction from  Congress and the Administration. The officials stated that the personnel  study was needed for the contracting department because this work had  not been done in NBIB before and so they needed to establish a baseline  for staffing it.", "As previously discussed, section 951 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required, among other things, the  Secretary of Defense to develop an implementation plan for the Defense  Security Service to conduct background investigations for certain DOD  personnel\u2014presently conducted by OPM\u2014after October 1, 2017.   Additionally, in November 2017, as this report was in its final stages,  Congress passed a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018, which includes a provision that, among other things,  would authorize DOD to conduct its own background investigations.  It  would also require DOD to begin carrying out the implementation plan  developed in response to section 951 by October 1, 2020. The  legislation would further require the Secretary of Defense, in consultation  with the Director of OPM, to provide for a phased transition of the conduct  of investigations from NBIB to the Defense Security Service. Moreover,  this legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to conduct a  comprehensive assessment of workforce requirements for both DOD and  NBIB as part of planning for the transfer of certain functions from OPM to  DOD.", "In addition, the NBIB transition team developed a talent acquisition  strategy for the establishment of the bureau; however, this strategy was  focused solely on filling nine key leadership positions (according to NBIB  officials, four positions are senior executive service positions, and five are  general schedule grade 14 and 15 positions). As of July 2017, NBIB  officials said that six of these positions had been filled, and that another  position was in the process of being staffed. The only mention of other  positions in this strategy was a statement that once these key leadership  positions have been filled, executives should build their respective  departments consistent with mission needs and aligned with the NBIB  strategic plan, and that NBIB use current FIS leadership for field  operations, engagements and customer service, and integrity assurance.  According to NBIB officials, NBIB has 3,260 positions authorized by OPM  but had 495 vacancies as of July 1, 2017\u2014approximately a 15 percent  vacancy rate. NBIB officials said that most positions were not affected by  the recent executive-branch hiring freeze, including investigators and  investigative assistants, because they qualified for national security  waivers; however, some positions, such as administrative support, were  not covered by the waivers.", "The greatest total number of vacancies within NBIB is in its field  operations department, which as of July 2017 had almost 400 vacancies,  or a vacancy rate of about 17 percent. The Field Operations department  provides contractor oversight, including program and project managers  for fieldwork and CORs; it also includes federal investigator staff. NBIB  officials stated that their greatest challenge in filling vacancies has been  with their investigative workforce, and that as they fill their investigator  positions, they will be able to better perform their mission of delivering  completed background investigations in a timely manner due to having  greater capacity. NBIB officials told us that they plan to hire another 200  federal investigators in fiscal year 2017 to help address the backlog of  investigations; however, hiring 200 new federal investigator positions was  not listed as a step on the transition plan for the Field Operations  department, and these new investigator positions also are not included in  the planned new hires listing of personnel hiring priorities. NBIB officials  said that these new investigator positions were not included in the  transition plan because the decision to hire for these positions had  already been made and the hiring was being executed when the transition  plan was developed.", "Furthermore, NBIB has developed detailed plans to hire new personnel.  NBIB\u2019s listing of personnel hiring priorities showed that NBIB initially  planned to hire 155 new personnel. NBIB officials explained that in  developing this initial hiring plan, organizational leaders assessed OPM  legacy resources that would align with NBIB\u2019s mission, roles and  responsibilities, and identified gaps. These officials stated that at a  leadership offsite held in December 2016, small groups identified existing  and notional resources, prioritized resource gaps for identified programs,  and briefed out their assessment of priorities. These officials said that the  offsite participants then selected the top priorities for fiscal years 2017  and 2018, and that NBIB leadership subsequently developed  individualized proposals outlining revisions and changes to personnel  requirements and organization of each of the program areas. NBIB  officials said that they subsequently refined these plans and reduced the  number of planned new hires. The officials stated that in 2017, NBIB  established a transitional hiring committee to further prioritize and select  the final NBIB personnel structure, and that through a series of meetings  in March, May, and June 2017, they refined their plans to reduce the  number of planned new positions. As of July 2017, they said that NBIB  planned to create and fill 49 new positions. According to NBIB officials, 13  of the new positions would involve an increase to the budget. Of those  49 new positions, they said that 21 had been filled as of July 2017.", "In addition, NBIB uses contractor support to fill some positions in its Field  Operations, Federal Investigative Records Enterprise, and customer  service departments, but NBIB officials did not provide documentation  explaining the determinations for which tasks should be performed by  contractors versus federal employees. NBIB officials stated that they  followed a deliberative process requiring a thoughtful assessment of the  personnel resource skills and competencies required to address the new  NBIB objectives, but they could not provide any supporting  documentation to that effect.", "A key principle of strategic workforce planning is determining the critical  skills and competencies needed to achieve current and future  programmatic results, such as identifying how the agency will obtain the  workforce skills and competencies that are critical to achieving its  strategic goals. In addition, OPM\u2019s workforce planning best practices  include forecasting the optimal headcount and competencies needed to  meet the needs of the organization in the future, and a gap analysis to  identify headcount surpluses and deficiencies for current and future  demand levels. Further, OMB policy requires agencies to take actions  to ensure they have sufficient internal capability to maintain control over  functions that are core to the agency\u2019s mission and operations.", "However, NBIB officials were unable to provide us with documentation  that identified any of the gaps or explained the rationale for its  determinations about the specific number and positions of additional staff  needed. The documents they did provide appeared to be summaries of  the revisions and changes decided upon, and included detailed  information about the identified staffing requirements, such as information  about the number of positions, position titles and types, grade levels, and  hiring priority. While this information reflects detailed planning and  thought, it does not illuminate whether the quantities and types of  positions identified are the appropriate positions with the right critical skills  and competencies needed to address any gaps in the bureau\u2019s  workforce. NBIB officials said that the hiring plans were originally  determined at the leadership offsite, where the rationale for the specific  number and positions of additional staff was discussed orally, and then  further refined at a series of meetings beginning in March 2017. The  officials told us that extensive review went into determining the rationale  for the requests for new staff, and that these requests were the subject of  robust and sometimes contentious debate, after which the requests were  voted on by senior leadership.", "Although NBIB has taken some steps to develop and implement certain  strategic workforce planning elements, it has not created a  comprehensive, formal workforce plan that is focused on workforce needs  to reduce the backlog. Such a plan should include the workforce skills  and competencies that are critical to achieving NBIB\u2019s strategic goals. As  we previously reported, the most important consideration in identifying  needed skills and competencies is that they are clearly linked to the  agency\u2019s mission and long-term goals developed jointly with key  congressional and other stakeholders during the strategic planning  process. If an agency identifies staff needs without linking the needs to  strategic goals, or if the agency has not obtained agreement from key  stakeholders on the goals, the needs assessment may be incomplete and  premature. In addition, a strategic workforce plan could enable NBIB to  (1) develop hiring, training, staff development, succession planning,  performance management, use of flexibilities, and other human capital  strategies and tools that could be implemented with the resources that  can be reasonably expected to be available; and (2) eliminate gaps and  improve the contribution of critical skills and competencies that they have  identified between the future and current skills and competencies needed  for mission success. NBIB officials explained that a strategic workforce  plan is something they should create, but that as a new organization the  bureau was focused on other priorities, such as hiring a director, selecting  the headquarters location, addressing the backlog, and filling vacant  positions. However, after being operational for almost a year, NBIB still  lacks a comprehensive workforce plan.", "While it has taken several other steps intended to strengthen the  background investigation process, without a formal strategic workforce  plan, NBIB does not know whether the identified needs in its new hires,  transition plan, and overall workforce vacancies will provide the  appropriate mix of personnel. Specifically, it does not know whether it has  the appropriate mix of federal employees and contractors, with the right  critical skills and competencies, to address any staffing gaps and better  enable the bureau to fulfill its mission. A comprehensive strategic  workforce plan that focuses on the workforce and organizational elements  needed and addresses capacity issues related to its vacancies would  better position NBIB to address its investigation backlog. Additionally, a  comprehensive strategic workforce plan would better position the bureau  to execute its roles and responsibilities related to overseeing the  background investigations for DOD and other executive branch agencies  that rely on NBIB as their investigative service provider."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The PAC has made progress in reforming the personnel security  clearance process.

Even  though it has made significant attempts, the executive branch has still not  established government-wide performance measures for the quality of  background investigations to help ensure that critical security-relevant  information is identified and mitigated when granting a security clearance.  Over the past 2 years, the executive branch has taken steps toward  establishing such measures. However, ODNI, as the Security Executive  Agent, and the PAC have not prioritized setting a milestone for their  completion. Without a milestone for establishing government-wide  performance measures for the quality of investigations, their completion  may be further delayed, and executive branch agencies will not have a  schedule against which they can track progress or to which they are  accountable.", "Executive branch timeliness in completing initial secret and initial top  secret clearances has declined over the past 5 years. While ODNI has  taken some steps to correct this downward trend on an agency-by- agency basis, neither ODNI nor the PAC have led a government-wide  approach to improve the timeliness of initial personnel security  clearances. While ODNI requests that agencies submit corrective action  plans when they are not meeting timeliness objectives, it has not  developed a comprehensive, government-wide plan with goals and  milestones. A government-wide plan would help position ODNI, as the  Security Executive Agent, as well as the PAC, to better identify and  address systemic issues across the executive branch that affect the  ability of agencies to meet timeliness objectives.", "IRTPA also created greater transparency and oversight of the overall  reform effort by mandating annual reports to the appropriate  congressional committees on the progress made toward meeting the act\u2019s  requirements, including reporting timeliness data. However, since the  IRTPA reporting requirement ended in 2011, executive branch reporting  has been limited, which makes it difficult to thoroughly evaluate and  precisely identify where and why delays exist within the process, as well  as to direct corrections as necessary. Without transparent reporting on  investigation and adjudication timeliness, for both initial investigations and  periodic reinvestigations, Congress will not be able to effectively execute  its oversight role and monitor individual executive branch agency  progress in meeting timeliness objectives.", "The establishment of NBIB in 2016, to strengthen the background  investigation process, involved a number of organizational changes and  efforts to improve the process. While NBIB has taken steps to increase its  investigative capacity, it faces challenges in developing a comprehensive  plan, with goals and milestones, to address the investigation backlog.  Without such a plan, NBIB lacks a necessary course of action to reduce  the backlog to a manageable level. Relatedly, NBIB has not established  goals for increasing total investigator capacity. Establishing such goals, in  accordance with the plan for reducing the backlog, may better position  NBIB to achieve the goals and milestones outlined in that plan. Ultimately,  if NBIB is unable to reduce the investigation backlog, executive branch  agencies will continue to lack the cleared personnel needed to help  execute their respective missions, which poses potential risks to national  security.

OMB, ODNI, OPM, and the Department of Homeland Security provided  additional technical comments, which we incorporated in the report as  appropriate. DOD and the Department of Justice did not provide  comments. OMB and OPM concurred with the recommendations directed  to them. ODNI stated that it did not concur with the report\u2019s conclusions  and recommendations, but did not specifically state with which  recommendations it did not concur.", "In comments e-mailed to us on November 9, 2017, the Acting Deputy  Director for Management of OMB concurred with the report\u2019s findings,  conclusions, and recommendations. The comments also stated that the  administration is committed to renewing public reporting of security  clearance timeliness, once the government-wide reform initiatives are  announced in early 2018, either as one of the administration\u2019s cross- cutting priority goals or via another approach. While the PAC\u2019s prior public  reporting on the status of security clearance reform efforts was beneficial  and helped to provide for transparency of the process, we believe that  security clearance timeliness information should be reported\u2014whether  publicly or via reporting to Congress\u2014broken out by individual executive  branch agency and not only as an executive branch-wide average, as  noted in our Matter for Congressional Consideration. As discussed in the  report, such detailed reporting could help congressional decision-makers  and OMB to thoroughly evaluate and precisely identify where and why  delays exist within the process, as well as to direct corrections as  necessary. In addition, OMB stated that the PAC is committed to ensuring  that its Implementation Plan is continually updated to reflect the current  status of reform efforts and that it incorporates any new initiatives arising  from our review.", "In its written comments, ODNI stated that the report appears to draw  negative inferences from the facts and that the conclusions do not  present an accurate assessment of the current status of the personnel  security clearance process. ODNI also stated that the conclusions do not  include the significant progress ODNI has achieved in coordination with  executive branch agencies. We disagree with these statements. The  report discusses in detail the progress that the PAC\u2014of which ODNI is a  Principal member\u2014has made to reform the personnel security clearance  process, including the implementation of recommendations and  milestones from the 120-day and 90-day reviews, and cross-agency  priority goal updates. The report also discusses areas of progress  highlighted by ODNI officials, such as the development of seven Security  Executive Agent Directives, the issuance of Quality Assessment  Standards for background investigations, and the implementation of the  QART.", "In its comments, ODNI further stated that while it generally concurred with  the factual observations in the report, it did not concur with our  recommendations. While ODNI did not specifically state with which  recommendations it disagreed, it discussed each of the three  recommendations addressed to it. In addition, ODNI stated that it did not  concur with our conclusions, and provided specific observations in the  following three areas, which lead to the three recommendations.", "First, ODNI disagreed with our conclusion that it has not prioritized setting  a milestone for the completion of government-wide performance  measures for the quality of background investigations. ODNI also stated  that the report ignores significant progress that ODNI has made in this  area; specifically, the approval of Quality Assessment Standards for  background investigations and the implementation of the QART. We  disagree with ODNI\u2019s position, as the report discusses in detail both the  Quality Assessment Standards and the QART, and identifies these as the  two steps toward the development of performance measures for the  quality of background investigations. Additionally, ODNI stated that it has  the ability to determine trends in background investigative quality from the  data collected by the QART. However, as we note in the report, DOD  background investigations\u2014which represent the majority of the  investigations conducted by NBIB\u2014are not captured by the QART. We  further noted that according to NBIB officials, they are not positioned to  receive comprehensive feedback if their largest customer, DOD, is not  utilizing the QART. Therefore, as we concluded in the report, it is unclear  how ODNI will have sufficient data to develop government-wide measures  for the quality of investigations since it will lack data for a significant  portion of the executive branch\u2019s background investigations.", "Regarding our recommendation that the Director of National Intelligence,  in coordination with the other PAC Principals, establish a milestone for  the completion of government-wide performance measures for the quality  of investigations, ODNI stated that it is premature to do so and that it will  set a milestone once the QART metrics discussed above have been fully  analyzed. However, in its written comments, ODNI did not state when it  anticipates the QART metrics will be fully analyzed. We recognize that  fully analyzing the QART data may take time and that initial performance  measures may be refined as ODNI collects and assesses data regarding  the quality of background investigations. However, setting a milestone\u2014 that takes into consideration the amount of time needed to analyze QART  data\u2014will help to ensure that the analysis is completed, that initial  performance measures are developed, and that agencies will have a  greater understanding of what they are being measured against. We  identify in the report that the executive branch previously set a milestone  for the completion of government-wide performance measure for quality,  which was adjusted over time and most recently set as October 2015. We  further identify that the PAC has set milestones for the completion of  nearly 50 other initiatives in its Implementation Plan, and that in the  aftermath of the 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting, the PAC (which  includes ODNI) issued a 120-day review report that, among other things,  recommended reporting on measures for quality. We continue to believe  that setting a milestone could help to prevent further delays to their  completion and provide the executive branch with a schedule against  which it would be accountable.", "Second, ODNI did not agree with our conclusion that neither ODNI nor  the PAC have led a government-wide approach to improve timeliness of  initial personnel security clearances. In its written comments, ODNI  discusses actions it has taken to improve timeliness since the passage of  IRTPA, including resetting timeliness goals for certain clearances in 2012,  in coordination with interagency stakeholders, issuing annual  memorandums to agencies on their performance, and requesting that  agencies develop agency-specific corrective action plans. We discuss all  of these actions in the report and while we agree that they are positive  actions, the executive branch would further benefit from a more  coordinated approach. For example, even with the cited actions, the  executive branch is experiencing significant challenges related to the  timely processing of initial personnel security clearances. Specifically, as  discussed in the report, in fiscal year 2016, only 2 percent of the agencies  for which ODNI provided timeliness data met the 40-day IRTPA- established investigation objective for at least three of four quarters for  the fastest 90 percent of initial secret cases; and only 12 percent met  ODNI\u2019s revised investigation objective for at least three of four quarters  for the fastest 90 percent of initial top secret cases. In addition, as  discussed in the report, timeliness challenges are not only an issue for  agencies that use NBIB as their investigative service provider. Agencies  with delegated authority to conduct their own investigations have also  experienced timeliness challenges over the past 5 fiscal years. Further,  the timeliness challenges cited by agencies to GAO include government- wide challenges, such as the increased investigative requirements\u2014not  just agency-specific challenges, such as staffing shortfalls. A government- wide plan would better position ODNI to identify and address any  systemic government-wide issues.", "Regarding our recommendation that the Director of National Intelligence,  in coordination with the other PAC Principals, conduct an evidence-based  review of the timeliness objectives for completing initial secret and initial  top secret security clearances, and take action to adjust the objectives if  appropriate, ODNI stated that it is premature to revise the existing  timeliness goals until NBIB\u2019s backlog is resolved. In its written comments,  ODNI states that while timeliness has exceeded the established  standards, this is not necessarily an indication of a flaw in timeliness  goals, but an indicator of the impact of the backlog and that as such, the  current challenge in meeting timeliness should not serve as the sole basis  for modifying existing goals. Our recommendation is to conduct an  evidence-based review of the timeliness objectives, through which ODNI  could determine whether there are any issues with the timeliness goals  or, as ODNI suggests, whether the timeliness challenges are just a  reflection of the backlog. At the conclusion of that review, ODNI can  determine if it is appropriate to adjust the timeliness objectives, and take  action if necessary. We do not suggest that ODNI should immediately  revise the timeliness objectives without first determining if there is an  evidence-based need to do so. ODNI further notes that other agencies  that are not supported by NBIB are still achieving or very close to  achieving current standards. However, as discussed in the report, even  agencies with delegated authority to conduct their own investigations are  experiencing challenges meeting established timeliness objectives.", "ODNI further stated in response to our recommendation that the Director  of National Intelligence will continue to assess the impact of the  implementation of the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards and modify  the timeliness goals as appropriate. Given that ODNI has not  comprehensively revisited the investigation or adjudication timeliness  objectives for initial security clearances since 2012 despite the increased  investigative requirements stemming from the implementation of the 2012  Federal Investigative Standards, we continue to believe that our  recommendation to conduct an evidence-based review, using relevant  data, is valid.", "Third, ODNI disagreed with our conclusion that demonstrated leadership  from ODNI, in the capacity as the Security Executive Agent, and the PAC,  by assisting NBIB as it works to reduce the investigation backlog could  better position NBIB to reach a manageable level of investigations. ODNI  stated that it has demonstrated leadership in this area and has worked  closely as the Security Executive Agent with NBIB to reduce its  investigation backlog and noted recent efforts by the Director of National  Intelligence and the other PAC Principals to help reduce the backlog. We  believe that these recent actions, which have taken place since the  completion of our review, are positive steps that, along with our  recommendations to NBIB, could help to reduce the backlog of  background investigations. However, as discussed in the report, prior to  these recent actions, ODNI had not demonstrated the leadership  necessary to improve executive branch timeliness, as evidenced by the  decrease in the number of agencies meeting timeliness objectives from  fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and a backlog of over 700,000  investigations as of September 2017. Additionally, while the recent  actions could help to reduce the backlog, sustained demonstrated  leadership by the Director of National Intelligence and the other PAC  Principals will be crucial to maintaining and increasing momentum, and  ultimately critical to comprehensively addressing the current timeliness  challenges and reducing the investigation backlog.", "Regarding our recommendation that the Director of National Intelligence  develop a government-wide plan, including goals and interim milestones,  to meet timeliness objectives for initial personnel security clearances,  ODNI stated that it has already established timeliness goals for the  security clearance process and that prior to the investigation backlog,  which was created, in part, due to a loss of OPM investigator capacity,  the executive branch met those goals. ODNI further stated that until NBIB  reduces its backlog, departments and agencies that use NBIB cannot  accurately predict budgetary requirements for the phases of the security  clearance process under their control, which complicates the  development of a government-wide plan at this time. However, as  discussed in the report, the most feasible date by which NBIB could  reduce the backlog of background investigations to a \u201chealthy\u201d inventory  level is fiscal year 2022 at the earliest. Given the significant timeliness  challenges that the executive branch is currently experiencing, agencies  would benefit from developing a government-wide plan now, rather than  waiting at least 5 years for the reduction of the backlog to do so. In  addition, through the development of a government-wide plan, ODNI  could help to identify additional actions to more quickly reduce the  investigation backlog. Without such a plan, continued delays in  processing clearances may leave agencies unable to fill critical positions  that require a security clearance. Ultimately, developing a government- wide plan, including goals and interim milestones, will better ensure timely  determinations of individuals\u2019 eligibility for access to classified  information. As such, we continue to believe that the recommendation is  valid.", "In its written comments, OPM concurred with the three recommendations  directed to NBIB, and described some actions it plans to take to address  them. Separate from the recommendations, OPM also provided  comments related to the discussion in the draft report regarding DOD\u2019s  development of NBIS and the security of OPM\u2019s IT systems and data.  Specifically, OPM expressed concerns about some of the statements by  DOD officials, stating that they were unverified opinions. We agree that  including the countering views of OPM officials could provide some  helpful context. As a result, we have added language to the report to  include OPM\u2019s perspectives on the statements made by the DOD CIO  officials.", "In addition, OPM stated that the prior GAO and OPM Inspector General  audits referenced in the IT discussion were outdated audit assessments.  We agree that some information in the draft report from the prior audits  was based on reports from 2016 or earlier in 2017, and we understand  that circumstances may have changed since those reports were issued.  Specifically, the OPM Inspector General released a new audit report in  October 2017, when this report was with the agency for comment,  regarding the state of security of OPM IT systems. Accordingly, we  replaced the discussion of the older OPM Inspector General reports in the  draft report with a discussion of the OPM Inspector General\u2019s October  2017 report. This latest OPM Inspector General report found, among  other things, that OPM had made improvements in its security  assessment and authorization program, and its previous \u201cmaterial  weakness\u201d related to authorizations has been upgraded to a \u201csignificant  deficiency\u201d for fiscal year 2017. Overall, the OPM Inspector General  found that OPM\u2019s cybersecurity maturity level was measured at a level 2,  \u201cDefined\u201d, meaning that its policies, procedures and strategy were  formalized and documented, but were not consistently implemented. We  also added language to emphasize the date of the 2016 GAO reports,  and added information about the status of the recommendations from  those two reports, because none of the recommendations directed to  OPM from the two 2016 GAO reports had been closed as implemented  as of November 2017.", "OPM further stated that it has implemented critical enhancements to  strengthen the security of OPM\u2019s networks and has improved its security  and assessment authorization process. In the draft report, we stated that  OPM has strengthened the security of its networks, and we noted that\u2014 as stated in our 2017 report\u2014OPM has made progress in improving its  security to prevent, mitigate, and respond to data breaches involving  sensitive personal records and background investigations information.  However, as we noted our 2017 report, we also found that OPM did not  effectively monitor actions taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and  we continue to believe that discussion of the deficiencies we identified in  our prior reports is appropriate in this report.", "In November 2017, after the conclusion of our audit work, Congress  passed a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2018. Among other things, the bill includes a provision that would  authorize DOD to conduct its own background investigations and require  DOD to begin carrying out the implementation plan required by section  951 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 by  October 1, 2020. It would also require the Secretary of Defense, in  consultation with the Director of OPM, to provide for a phased  transition.  While this pending legislation may affect how some  background investigations are conducted, we believe that our  recommendations remain important points on which the executive branch  should focus in order to help improve the security clearance process as  these legislative changes are implemented.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of  Defense, the Director of OMB, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the  Director of OPM, the Director of NBIB, the Attorney General of the United  States, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Intelligence, and the Director  of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.

As of November 2017, these agencies had  implemented 12 of those recommendations; we closed 4 due to the  inaction of the responsible agencies; and 21 remained open. Examples of  implemented recommendations include DOD\u2019s issuance of adjudication  guidance related to incomplete investigative reports, ODNI and OPM\u2019s  jointly proposed chapter and part to the Code of Federal Regulations  clarifying, among other things, the position sensitivity designation of  national security positions, and DHS\u2019s issuance of new standards for  tracking information on security clearance revocations and appeals.", "The 21 recommendations that remain open as of November 2017  focused on different aspects of the personnel security clearance process.  First, in February 2012, we reported on background investigation pricing  and costs, and we found, among other things, that the Performance  Accountability Council had not provided the executive branch with  guidance on cost savings. Second, in September 2014, we reported on  the security clearance revocation processes at DHS and DOD. We found  that DHS and DOD data systems did not track complete revocation  information; there was inconsistent implementation of the requirements in  the governing executive orders by DHS, DOD, and some of their  components; and there was limited oversight over the revocation process,  among other things. Third, in April 2015, we reported on the status of  government-wide security clearance reform efforts. We found, among  other things, that limited progress had been achieved in implementing  updated Federal Investigative Standards, and that the extent to which  reciprocity is granted government-wide was unknown. Fourth, in  November 2017, we found that ODNI had taken an initial step to  implement continuous evaluation across the executive branch, but it had  not yet determined key aspects of the program; and it lacked plans for  implementing, monitoring, and measuring program performance.

Specifically, the act required the entity selected  under section 3001(b) to develop a plan to reduce the length of the  personnel security clearance process, in consultation with appropriate  committees of Congress and each authorized adjudicative agency. To the  extent practical, the plan was to require that each authorized adjudicative  agency make a determination on at least 90 percent of all applications for  a personnel security clearance within an average of 60 days after the  date of receipt of the completed application by an authorized investigative  agency\u2014not longer than 40 days to complete the investigative phase and  20 days to complete the adjudicative phase.
