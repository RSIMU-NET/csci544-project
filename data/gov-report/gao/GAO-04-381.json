Many of DOD's largest contractors participate in the program. A lthough the Test Program was started more than 12 years ago, DOD has yet to establish metrics to evaluate the program's results and effectiveness. As a result, there is no systematic way of determining whether the program is meeting its intended objectives and whether further changes need to be made. DOD contracted for an assessment of the Test Program in 2002, but the results of the assessment are considered preliminary and, therefore, have not been reported. DOD is required to report the results of the Test Program in 2005, when the program is set to expire. DOD contractors participating in the Test Program have experienced mixed success in meeting their various small business subcontracting goals. DOD and contractor officials noted that a changing acquisition environment has added to their challenge in meeting small business goals. Two of the major challenges they identified include (1) the increased breadth, scope, and complexity of DOD prime contracts that require, among other things, teaming arrangements with other, typically large contractors and (2) prime contractors' strategic sourcing decisions to leverage their purchasing power by reducing the number of their suppliers including small businesses. DCMA plays a key role in overseeing the performance of contractors in the Test Program and has made significant changes to its policy and guidance. The revised approach is designed to better monitor contractors' efforts, provide more consistency in assessing contractor performance, and hold contractors accountable for achieving their subcontracting goals. DCMA is still in the process of revamping its oversight activities. GAO could not assess the full extent contractors used firms performing outside the U.S. because of data reliability concerns. Contractors in GAO's review reported several reasons for awarding subcontracts to firms performing outside the U.S., such as fulfilling commitments included in offset agreements or executing teaming arrangements for major defense programs.

The purpose of the Test Program  is to increase subcontracting opportunities for various types of small  businesses while reducing the administrative burdens on contractors. The  companies that participated in this Test Program in fiscal year 2002  accounted for about 41 percent of DOD\u2019s subcontracting activity in that  same fiscal year.

LMI attributed the decline to factors external to the  program\u2014some of which we discuss later. Most of its recommendations  dealt with addressing ways of improving small business achievements, but  also included program-specific recommendations, such as  increasing visibility of subcontracting activity at the corporation\u2019s division  and program level, where feasible;    deducting directed-source procurements from subcontracting    allowing subcontracting plan renegotiations to reflect major contract  awards that occur after negotiations;    establishing annual meetings of program participants and DCMA to allow  exchange of ideas, best practices, and lessons learned;    permitting removal of poor performing participants after appropriate  notice;  requiring participants to track and annually report administrative savings  and costs and results of their outreach activities; and  limiting enrollment to 20 participants.", "While the final report has not been issued, DOD officials said they have  taken into consideration a number of the recommendations from the study  by LMI. For example, DCMA has taken steps to improve oversight of  contractor performance and hold contractors more accountable for  achieving their subcontracting goals, and DOD has chartered a council to  share Test Program knowledge and experience.

DOD officials told  us they are uncertain how they will measure contractors\u2019 performance to  meet their reporting requirement and assess trends over time. This  uncertainty is in part due to not having the original participants in the  program to establish a baseline to evaluate performance and changes in  company compositions.

In fact, one contractor recently stopped participating in the  program because of the lost ability to monitor individual contract  performance.

According to officials, this has had several consequences,  which have limited the opportunities for small businesses. First, prime  contractors are increasingly relying on teaming arrangements to win  contracts. Their teaming partners, typically large businesses, receive a  sizable portion of the first-tier subcontracts. For example, under a major  defense contract, the contractor awarded about 56 percent of its total  subcontract dollars to its teaming partners, significantly reducing the  opportunities of small businesses to win first-tier subcontracts. Also,  prime contractors are increasingly serving as systems integrators instead  of systems manufacturers and are buying major assemblies rather than  parts and components. Systems integrators are often responsible for the  development, management, and eventual delivery of a large weapon  system. Consequently, as in the case of teaming arrangements, systems  integrators often use large businesses as first-tier subcontractors.  Contractor officials said that although small businesses may still be  receiving contract dollars through second- or lower-tier subcontracts,  contractors could only count their first-tier subcontract awards towards  their small business goals.", "In addition, many contractors have made the strategic-sourcing decision to  reduce the number of suppliers in their supplier base. Contractors report  reducing their supplier bases by as much as 50 percent over the past   5 years in a move to leverage their purchases, cut costs, and improve  performance to remain competitive in the world market. Contractors also  noted that by reducing the number of contractors, they often relied on  larger corporatewide contracts, which could also affect their small  business suppliers. For example, officials of one contractor noted that  when it went to a single information systems contractor, it no longer  contracted with a number of small firms.", "Finally, contractors report difficulty in finding qualified small businesses  to provide the goods and services needed. Contractor officials said this is  particularly true for small business programs with certification  requirements\u2014such as the programs for small disadvantaged businesses  and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses\u2014and  for very recent programs, such as the service-disabled veterans program.  The Small Business Administration has certified significantly fewer small  disadvantaged businesses and HUBZone firms than hoped. Consequently,  contractors often have difficulty meeting small disadvantaged business  goals, and few have met their HUBZone goals. Further, according to  DCMA officials responsible for on site monitoring of subcontracting plans,  qualified businesses in different small business categories usually compete  for the same type of work. Consequently, according to these DCMA  officials, contractors have difficulty meeting goals for all small business  types and often report wide fluctuations in subcontracting achievements  among the groups, depending on which ones win contracts in a given year.  The categories of small business that DOD uses include small businesses,  small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, veteran- owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone  businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority  Institutions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DCMA Is Taking Steps to Improve Oversight of the Subcontracting Program", "paragraphs": ["Since 2002, DCMA has taken steps to help improve its oversight of DOD\u2019s  small business program.
