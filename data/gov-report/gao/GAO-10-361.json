Pursuant to a requirement in the HITECH Act, GAO is reporting on practices implemented by health information exchange organizations, providers, and other health care entities that disclose electronic personal health information. GAO's specific objectives were to describe (1) the practices implemented for disclosing personal health information for purposes of treatment, including the use of electronic means for obtaining consent, as reported by selected health information exchange organizations, their participating providers, and other entities; and (2) the effects of the electronic sharing of health information on the quality of care for patients as reported by these organizations. To address both objectives, GAO conducted case studies of 4 of more than 60 operational health information exchanges and a selection of each of the exchanges' participating providers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The health care entities GAO studied reported that they implement disclosure practices that reflect widely accepted practices for safeguarding personal information-the Fair Information Practices-to help ensure the appropriate use and disclosure of electronic personal health information for treatment purposes. For example, providers in the study described various implementations of practices that require direct interaction with patients, such as informing patients of the use and disclosure of personal health information and providing patients access to their own records. Some of them inform patients that their electronic personal health information may be shared through health information exchanges-entities that were formed to facilitate the electronic sharing of patients' health information among providers. Both the providers and exchanges in the study described practices that limit disclosure of information, secure electronic information that they store and transmit, and help ensure accountability for safeguarding electronic personal health information. Although the health information exchanges reported that they have not conducted formal studies or evaluations of the overall effect of electronically sharing personal health information, both the exchanges and providers reported examples of ways that sharing electronic personal health information about patients has had a positive effect on the quality of care that providers deliver to patients. (1) Officials from two exchanges stated that they provide a direct connection from participating hospitals to their state's Department of Public Health for real-time reporting of conditions and for supporting the early detection of disease outbreaks. According to one of these officials, this service facilitated the state's ability to obtain information about cases of H1N1 more quickly than other states. (2) A large hospital that participated in one of the exchanges reported that a cardiologist was able to obtain an abnormal laboratory result electronically from the exchange one day earlier than they would have otherwise. This timely access to the patients' electronic health information allowed the provider to perform earlier intervention for a potentially life-threatening condition. (3) Another hospital reported that information obtained through its health information exchange helped its emergency department physician ascertain that a patient who was requesting medication for pain had been in five area hospitals in seven nights seeking pain medication. As a result, the physician did not prescribe any additional pain medication."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Studies published by the Institute of Medicine and other organizations  have shown that the fragmented and inaccessible state of medical  information can adversely affect the quality of health care and  compromise patient safety. This is important because patients may visit a  variety of different health care providers to meet their health care needs.  For example, for treatment of a chronic condition, a patient could visit a  primary care doctor, a specialist, a clinical laboratory, an imaging center,  and a pharmacy. Each of these providers may maintain records of medical  treatment, laboratory results, medications, and health history and personal  information about the patient that may also be needed by other providers  but is not readily available except in printed form. As a result, providers  may not have access to critical information needed to treat patients, such  as allergies to medicines, timely lab test results, and medical histories.", "The use of information technology to electronically collect, store, and  share patients\u2019 personal health information could help providers obtain  information about patients more quickly than they can in the current  medical records environment. Over the past several years, an increasing  number of organizations have implemented technology to enable the  electronic exchange of personal health information among providers,  including health information exchanges (HIE). These exchanges provide  the technology and facilities needed to support the electronic sharing of  data among hospitals, physicians, clinical laboratories, radiology centers,  pharmacies, health plans (insurers), and public health departments. Other  types of entities, such as integrated health care delivery systems, have  also increased the extent to which they share patients\u2019 personal health  information electronically among providers.", "While sharing health information electronically can help providers obtain  more timely and accurate information about the patients they are treating,  it may also increase the potential for misuse of personal health  information for illegal purposes, such as discriminatory employment  practices and health identity theft. Additionally, health information  exchanges report challenges in implementing practices that not only  enable the effective sharing of data but also ensure the appropriate use  and disclosure of personal health information. These factors may limit the  extent to which health care providers participate in electronic sharing of  their patients\u2019 health information.", "However, providers and patients have reported some benefits resulting  from the electronic sharing of health information, such as increased  patient safety, improved quality of health care, enhanced efficiency of  administrative functions, and reduced costs. Additionally, in a 2008 report  the Congressional Budget Office described benefits resulting from the  electronic sharing of personal health information, including decreases in  the duplication of diagnostic procedures and prevention of medical errors.", "To promote the use of information technology for the electronic exchange  of personal health information among providers and other health care  entities, Congress passed the Health Information Technology for  Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act as part of the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which the President signed into  law on February 17, 2009. HITECH provides financial incentives, in the  form of grants and Medicare reimbursements, to promote the widespread  adoption of technology that supports the electronic sharing of personal  health information among health care entities, such as hospitals,  physicians, clinical laboratories, and public health agencies. In response to  the need to better define practices for ensuring that this information is  appropriately disclosed to authorized entities, the HITECH Act extends  existing federal privacy and security requirements to certain organizations,  such as health information exchanges, that facilitate the sharing of  electronic personal health information.", "The HITECH Act requires us to report on practices implemented by health  information exchange organizations, providers, and other health care  entities for disclosing electronic personal health information.

These providers were identified by the  exchanges as active users of the HIEs\u2019 services. In conducting the case  studies, we identified ways the exchanges and their participating providers  addressed selected disclosure practices, but we did not assess the  implementation of these practices. We also used the case studies to obtain  information on the effect that the electronic sharing of health information  had on the quality of care.", "To supplement the information we collected through the case studies, we  gathered information from and conducted interviews with other health  care entities (two integrated health care delivery systems), two  professional associations (eHealth Initiative and Healthcare Information  Management and Systems Society), and one state\u2019s electronic health  collaborative, an organization focused on developing and enforcing  statewide health information sharing policy.

In addition to being slow and cumbersome, these methods of  transferring health information can result in loss or late delivery of the  information, which may require the requesting provider to conduct  duplicate tests, or may contribute to medical errors due to the lack of  information needed to properly treat the patient. Additionally, the phys delivery of paper health records typically does not provide an effective  means for securing the information while it is being transferred, nor does it provide ways to identify who accesses the records or discloses the  information contained in the records.", "In part to address these types of deficiencies, health care providers have  been adopting electronic health information systems to record, store, and  maintain patients\u2019 information. As more providers have adopted and used  these systems, additional capabilities have been developed and  implemented, including the ability to electronically share patients\u2019  information from a provider directly to other providers, or among  providers participating in an HIE.", "HIEs facilitate the sharing of electronic health information by providing  the services and technology that allow providers (such as physicians,  hospitals, laboratories, and public health departments) to request and  receive information about patients from other providers\u2019 records. For  example, when a provider requests information through the exchange, the  HIE identifies the source of the requested data, then initiates the  electronic transmission that delivers the data from the provider that is  disclosing the patient\u2019s information to the provider that requested the  information. A simplified model of this exchange activity is shown in  figure 1.", "Research indicates that most HIEs were formed to share information  among health care providers and organizations within a geographic area  (e.g., metropolitan area, state, region, or nation). However, others were  designed for unique purposes, such as to collect and share information  about participants involved in a state Medicaid program or to aggregate  information about patients within a community, state, or region in support  of efforts to improve the health of a population.", "The ways that HIEs are established and managed vary. Some are  established by state governments, while others are established by private  organizations. They may be managed by public-private partnerships or  other organizations that were created to promote collaboration among  health care providers.", "Efforts in the United States to establish organizations that facilitate the  sharing of electronic health information among providers began in the  early 1990\u2019s. These organizations, called Community Health Information  Networks, evolved into Regional Health Information Organizations  throughout the early to mid 2000s. Since then, there has been a steady  increase in the number of HIEs that are fully operational and actively  facilitate the electronic sharing of patients\u2019 health information. In 2007, the  eHealth Initiative reported that, in a nationwide survey, it had identified 32  operational HIEs. One year later, its survey identified 42 operational  exchanges, representing a 31 percent increase. Then, in 2009, the survey  identified 57 operational exchanges, a nearly 36 percent increase from  2008.", "Most of the nearly 150 exchanges that responded to the eHealth Initiative\u2019s  2009 survey reported that they were not yet engaged in the electronic  exchange of health information but were involved in activities such as  defining a business plan, identifying participants\u2019 information  requirements, and securing funding. Others responded that they were in  the process of defining and implementing technical, financial, and legal  procedures. The 57 operational HIEs that responded to the survey  reported that they support a variety of information-sharing services for  their participating providers. The most common services included the  delivery of laboratory and test results and clinical documentation,  electronic health records, electronic prescribing, and alerts about critical  conditions, such as adverse drug interactions.

Further, two of the exchanges limit the amount and types of patient  information shared with their participating providers to certain types of  data, such as those specified in standard continuity of care documents or  in summary reports defined by the HIEs and their participating providers.  Fifteen providers stated that when they receive requests for a patient\u2019s  information directly from other providers (that do not participate in the  HIE), they examine requests on a case-by-case basis.

All the exchanges in our  study allow authorized emergency department physicians full access to  data for patients they treat. One also allows providers broader access to  patient information for some non-emergency situations, such as when  obtaining historical information about new patients.

Officials stated that they anticipate  beginning this evaluation in 2010. er  Additionally, the participating providers in our study\u2014all of whom wer e  identified as active users of an exchange\u2014reported that, because they ar part of an HIE, they have had more comprehensive and timely patient  health information available at the point of care, which they believe has  had a positive effect on the quality of care. Providers said that they can access information about their patients through their exchange that is no otherwise available in their own records, including information about  medications and test results obtained from other providers, which gives  them more comprehensive information about the status of their patient health. Additionally, providers save time by obtaining patients\u2019 informati from the exchange rather than by contacting other providers by fax or  mail, or by repeating tests that other providers have already conducted,  allowing for more timely information at the point of care. Some pr also told us that they use the HIE to obtain patient laboratory results more  quickly than by the traditional methods of mail or fax, which has  facilitated earlier intervention for patients.

Officials with one of  the integrated health care systems said that they joined an exchange  recently because they felt it would provide physicians and other health  care providers with a more complete picture of a patient\u2019s health  information regardless of where the patient obtains care, which could help  to eliminate unnecessary or duplicative care, including tests that may have  already been performed by other providers. Officials from the second  integrated health care delivery system told us that they were considering  joining an exchange because it could provide them with information about  care\u2014such as medications prescribed\u2014obtained from providers outside  of their system.

We selected four  operational health information exchanges and a sample of participating  providers for each of the four exchanges. To select the case study health  information exchanges, we compiled a list of 68 health information  exchanges that were reported to be operational and actively sharing data  among providers. From this list, we selected a judgmental, non- generalizable sample of four exchanges. Each exchange we selected met  two of the following three characteristics:    had an interstate data exchange and the need to address different state  laws and regulations applicable to the disclosure of protected health  information; included varying numbers, sizes, and types of provider organizations that  disclose health information through the exchange; and   operated with some degree of state involvement such as a state-led or  state-level health information exchange.", "To identify exchanges with the selected characteristics, we reviewed our  prior reports, and reports on outcomes of relevant Department of Health  and Human Services projects such as the Nationwide Health Information  Network, the State-level Health Information Exchange Consensus Project,  and the Health Information Security and Privacy Collaboration. We also  reviewed published research identifying active health information  exchanges and relevant policy issues, and research published by health  information technology professional associations and other health  information privacy experts having data and knowledge about active  health information exchange organizations. Finally, we considered the  geographic location of the exchanges when making our final selection.", "We worked with each health information exchange to select a judgmental  sample of participating providers. The categories of providers we used to  ensure that we would have a variety in our sample included:    small and medium hospitals with 199 beds or fewer;  large hospitals with 200 beds or more;   small physician practices with fewer than 10 full-time equivalent  large physician practices that have 10 or more full-time equivalent  employees; and   other types of organizations, including long-term care facilities, public  health facilities, pharmacies, laboratories, and insurance plans.", "We were unable to include all categories of participating providers for  each exchange in our sample because some exchanges did not include  providers from each category. We studied various types of providers that  were active users of health information exchanges and that shared  information directly with other providers (that are not members of the  exchange). Because each health information exchange defined parameters  for and tracked usage of the exchanges differently, we relied on officials  from each exchange to identify providers from each category that were  active users of the HIE\u2019s services.", "For each of the four case studies, we    gathered documentation and conducted interviews with the exchanges to  determine the practices they implemented for disclosing personal health  information, including electronic means of obtaining consent, practices  they required for participating providers, and reported effects of sharing  health information electronically on the quality of care; and    gathered documentation and conducted interviews with officials from  selected participating providers to determine the practices they  implemented as part of the health information exchange and the practices  they had implemented in their own organization for disclosing personal  health information. In addition, we interviewed officials from these  participating providers to determine how and to what extent the electronic  sharing of health information affected the quality of care.", "At the conclusion of our study, we validated the information that we  included in this report with the exchanges and providers to confirm that  their disclosure practices and examples of the effects of electronic sharing  of personal health information were accurately portrayed.
