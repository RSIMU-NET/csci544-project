Since 2006, Congress has provided nearly $16 billion to counter improvised explosive devices alone. GAO and others have reported funding, organizational, acquisition, and oversight issues involving DOD's processes for meeting warfighters' urgent needs. The Senate Armed Services Committee asked GAO to determine 1) the extent to which DOD has a means to assess the effectiveness of its urgent needs processes, and 2) what challenges, if any, have affected the overall responsiveness of DOD's urgent needs processes. To conduct this review GAO looked at three urgent needs processes--joint, Army, and the Marine Corps processes--visited forces overseas that submit urgent needs requests and receive solutions, and conducted 23 case studies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has taken steps to create urgent needs processes that are more responsive to urgent warfighter requests than traditional acquisition procedures, DOD is unable to fully assess how well the processes address critical deficiencies or to measure the effectiveness of solutions fielded in the theater because it has not established an effective management framework for those processes. GAO found that DOD's guidance for its urgent needs processes is dispersed and outdated. Further, DOD guidance does not clearly define roles and responsibilities for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating all phases of those processes or incorporate all of the expedited acquisition authorities available to acquire joint urgent need solutions. Data systems for the processes lack comprehensive, reliable data for tracking overall results and do not have standards for collecting and managing data. In addition, the joint process does not include a formal method for feedback to inform joint leadership on the performance of solutions. In one case, a solution for a joint request was fielded for 18 months without meeting warfighter needs. In the absence of a management framework for its urgent needs processes, DOD lacks tools to fully assess how well its processes work, manage their performance, ensure efficient use of resources, and make decisions regarding the long-term sustainment of fielded capabilities. In conducting field work in Iraq as well as 23 case studies, GAO found several challenges that could hinder DOD's ability to rapidly respond to urgent warfighter needs. First, not all personnel involved in the initial development and review of urgent needs documentation receive adequate training. DOD policy states that deploying personnel should receive priority for training and be responsive to the needs of the combatant commander; however, officers responsible for drafting, submitting, and reviewing Army and joint urgent needs requests are not likely to receive such training. Hence, once in theater, they often face difficulties processing the large volume of requests, in a timely manner. Second, in 11 of 23 cases GAO studied, challenges obtaining funding were the primary factor that increased the amount of time needed to field solutions. Funding has not always been available for joint urgent needs in part because the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has not assigned primary responsibility for implementing the department's rapid acquisition authority. Congress provided OSD with that authority to meet urgent warfighter needs, but OSD has played a reactive rather than proactive role in making decisions about when to invoke it. In addition, DOD can reprogram funds appropriated for other purposes to meet urgent needs requests, but authority for determining when and how to reprogram funds has been delegated to the services and combatant commands. Prior GAO work has shown that strong leadership from OSD over resource control is critical, and midlevel agencies such as the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, which is responsible for facilitating urgent needs requests, including funding, cannot guide other agencies at a high enough level to promote effective interagency coordination. Finally, GAO found that attempts to meet urgent needs with immature or complex technologies can result in significant delays."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The dynamic nature of the enemy and tactical conditions encountered by  forces in Iraq and Afghanistan have prompted the Department of Defense  (DOD) to rapidly identify and field new capabilities as quickly as possible  in order to prevent mission failure or loss of life.

With the shift in priority for overseas operations from Iraq to  Afghanistan\u2014a theater that may pose more complex long-term  challenges\u2014deployed or soon-to-deploy units will likely continue to  request critical capabilities to help them accomplish their missions.  Warfighters currently rely on several processes, such as the Army, Marine  Corps, and joint urgent needs processes, to request such critical  capabilities.", "The Army\u2019s urgent needs process was established in 1987 but has been  expanded since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism and  currently receives an average of almost 300 requests per month. The  Marine Corps established its process in 2003. In 2002, Congress directed  the Secretary of Defense to create a process to rapidly meet the urgent  needs of combatant commands and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 2004, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) established the Joint Rapid  Acquisition Cell (JRAC)  to overcome institutional barriers and provide  timely, effective support to facilitate meeting the urgent material and  logistics requirements which combatant commanders certify as  operationally critical. Until 2008, OSD directed that the JRAC report to the  Secretary of Defense, through the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) and the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), for monitoring and tracking joint urgent needs,  facilitating the identification and resolution of issues, and providing  regular status reports to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Since 2008, the Under Secretary realigned the JRAC within the Office of  the Director for Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E) and the cell  resides currently under the Director, Rapid Fielding.", "Congress provides funding for joint urgent needs related to countering  improvised explosive devices through the Joint Improvised Explosive  Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), to which it has appropriated nearly  $16 billion through fiscal year 2009. In our prior work, we have raised  concerns about JIEDDO\u2019s management and operations and found that the  organization lacks full visibility over all counter-IED initiatives throughout  DOD, faces difficulties with transitioning its counter-IED initiatives to the  military services, and lacks criteria for counter-IED training initiatives it  will fund which affects its training investment decisions. We have  recommended that DOD improve its visibility over all DOD\u2019s counter-IED  efforts, work with the military services to develop a complete transition  plan for initiatives, and define criteria for funding training initiatives.", "The possibility of similar issues involving DOD\u2019s process for meeting joint  urgent needs that are not necessarily related to IEDs has raised  congressional concerns about making similar resource investments in the  JRAC at this time. In October 2008, Congress directed DOD to commission  a study to assess the effectiveness of the department\u2019s processes for the  generation of urgent operational need requirements, and the acquisition  processes used to fulfill such requirements. In July 2009, the Defense  Science Board issued its report and made several findings regarding  organizational, funding, acquisition, and oversight issues. In addition to  our work on JIEDDO, we have also reported on challenges in the Army\u2019s  and Marine Corps\u2019 processes to address urgent force protection needs,  such as truck armor. Further, we reported on DOD\u2019s challenges to field  Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles.", "In light of Congress\u2019 continuing interest in the joint and military services\u2019  urgent needs processes to address requests for force protection  capabilities, you asked us to review DOD\u2019s processes. Our objectives for  this review were to determine 1) the extent to which DOD has a means to  assess the effectiveness of its urgent needs processes and 2) what  challenges, if any, have affected the overall responsiveness of DOD\u2019s  urgent needs processes.", "To conduct this review, we visited forces conducting operations in the  U.S. Central Command\u2019s theater of operations and gathered information  on how they identify, document, and submit urgent needs to their chain of  command, and on the fielding and assessment of solutions in the theater.  We reviewed existing policy and guidance applicable to joint, Army, and  Marine Corps urgent needs processes, and compared them to our  standards for internal control in the federal government. We analyzed  joint, Army, and Marine Corps data management systems in order to  review the data collected on the time frames between decision points and  to determine the responsiveness of each process in providing solutions to  urgent warfighter needs. While our assessment of databases and systems  used to process urgent needs requests showed that some data elements  were accurate and supported by sufficient documentation, we found that  other items for reporting specific urgent needs requests were incomplete,  and not sufficiently reliable for reporting specific results here, or to  support accurate, useful management reports related to overall results. As  a result, we conducted our own case study reviews to assess DOD\u2019s  responsiveness to urgent needs for a select sample of requests. We used  data elements from the information systems that we had determined were  sufficiently reliable to support the selection of case study candidates from  the universe of joint, Army, and Marine Corps urgent needs requests. We  selected a nonprobability sample of 23 cases\u201411 joint, 6 Army, and 6  Marine Corps\u2014for review based on criteria that included the variety of  needs, high visibility and priority of the needs, and needs submitted in  more than one process. For each case study, we interviewed responsible  officials at the appropriate joint or service organizations and collected key  documentation related to seven phases of the process we identified:  initiation of a request from a warfighting unit, endorsement of a need by  theater command, validation by command-level leadership, approval of a  solution at the headquarters level, identification and execution of a  funding strategy, awarding of a contract, and production and initial  fielding of urgent need solutions. We interviewed DOD and military service  officials who are responsible for or are participants in the urgent needs  processes, and we collected guidance and documentation on each process  and the associated milestones and decision points. Although the Navy and  Air Force each have their own urgent needs processes, the Army and  Marine Corps have been the principle providers of U.S. ground forces  conducting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and their respective  processes as well as the joint process have received the majority of  warfighter urgent needs requests. Therefore, we have focused our review  on those three processes. We conducted this performance audit from June  2008 through March 2010 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

First, the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)  is a requirements system used to assess gaps in warfighting capabilities  and recommend solutions to resolve those gaps. Second, the Defense  Acquisition System is used to manage the development and procurement  of weapon systems and other equipment. Third, the Planning,  Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process is used to allocate  resources and is intended to provide a framework from which the  department can articulate its strategy; identify force size, structure, and  needed equipment; set program priorities; allocate resources to individual  programs; and assess program performance. All three of these systems can  incur lengthy time frames. For example, the requirements system can take  an average of up to 10 months to validate a need. The acquisition system  involves large budgets and generally meets materiel warfighter needs in 2  or more years, with some systems taking decades to develop and procure.  The budgeting process is calendar driven, taking nearly 2 years from  planning to the beginning of budget execution.

Our review focuses primarily on the following:    The Army established its Operational Needs Statement process in 1987  to provide a way for unit commanders to identify urgent needs for new  materiel or new capabilities. The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff  G3/5/7 oversees the process. Prior to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,  the Army received about 20 requests per year. From September 2006 to  February 2010 the Army\u2019s database shows 6,712 Operational Needs  Statements containing 21,864 urgent needs requests that have been or  are being processed to support operations in those two theaters. The  Army\u2019s process supports deployed units, deploying units, and units  conducting their assigned missions, and responds to a variety of urgent  needs, from new capabilities to shortfalls of existing equipment in  theater, to requests for training equipment for mobilizing units in the  United States. Operational field commanders also use the Army\u2019s  process to document the urgent need for a materiel solution to correct  a deficiency or to improve a capability that impacts upon mission  accomplishment. In September 2006, the Equipment Common  Operating Picture, an automated processing tool for Army urgent  needs, became operational. This data management tool is a classified,  Web-based application for processing urgent needs from the unit  submitting the request through all phases of the process. According to  the user\u2019s guide, the tool was designed to simplify requests, consolidate  existing sources of information, and significantly speed the approval  process while providing situational awareness to all involved in a  request.", "The Marine Corps created its Urgent Universal Needs Statement  process in November 2003 to meet the immediate operational needs of  deployed forces or forces preparing to deploy. The Marine Corps  Combat Development Command oversees this process. The command  establishes guidance and direction, and provides oversight to ensure  solutions are effectively and efficiently delivered to the warfighter.  The Marine Corps received 574 requests through the process between  December 2001 and November 2009. In August 2007, the Marine Corps\u2019  Virtual Universal Urgent Needs Statement data management system for  processing urgent needs requests became operational. The Corps  developed this system as a result of a Lean Six Sigma continuous  improvement initiative to replace the manually updated Combat  Development Tracking System.", "In addition to the military services\u2019 urgent needs processes, The Bob  Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (the Fiscal  Year 2003 NDAA) directed the Secretary of Defense to create a process to  rapidly meet the urgent needs of combatant commands and the Joint  Chiefs of Staff. Specifically, Section 806 of the act required the Secretary  of Defense to prescribe procedures for the rapid acquisition and  deployment of items that are currently under development by DOD or  available from the commercial sector, and that are urgently needed to  react to an enemy threat or to respond to significant and urgent safety  situations. According to the legislation, the procedures should include a  process for demonstrating, rapidly acquiring, and deploying items that  meet the needs communicated by the combatant commanders and the  Joint Chiefs of Staff. In September 2004, the Deputy Secretary of Defense  directed the Under Secretary of Defense (AT&L) and the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller) to create the Joint Rapid Action Cell (JRAC),  later renamed the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell, to facilitate meeting the  urgent material and logistics requirements which combatant commanders  certify as operationally critical. Subsequently, in November 2004, the  Deputy Secretary of Defense provided guidance on the procedures, roles,  and responsibilities of the JRAC and on the identification and validation of  urgent operational needs. The Deputy Secretary\u2019s memo defines urgent  operational needs as urgent, combatant commander-prioritized  operational needs that, if left unfilled, could result in loss of life and/or  prevent the successful completion of a near-term military mission. The  memo defines immediate warfighter needs as urgent operational needs  requiring a timely materiel or nonmateriel solution in 120 days or less that,  if left unfilled, could result in loss of life and/or prevent the successful  completion of a near-term military mission. An executive director leads  JRAC and reports to the Director, Rapid Fielding, within DDR&E and  under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (AT&L). JRAC\u2019s Core  Group consists of full-time professional staff and part-time senior  executives and military officers from the offices of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), DOD General Counsel, and Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff. An Advisory Group supports the Core Group and includes  pertinent Under or Assistant Secretaries based on the specific need.", "Just weeks before the Deputy Secretary issued the November 2004  guidance, the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2005 (the Fiscal Year 2005 NDAA) was enacted.  It amended  section 806 of the Fiscal Year 2003 NDAA by providing the Secretary of  Defense with a rapid acquisition authority to respond to combat  emergencies. Under that authority, when the Secretary of Defense, without  delegation, determines in writing that equipment is urgently needed to  eliminate a combat capability deficiency that has resulted in combat  fatalities, the Secretary is to use procedures developed under this section  to accomplish the rapid acquisition and deployment of the needed  equipment. The amendment states that whenever the Secretary makes the  above determination, the Secretary shall designate a senior official to  ensure that the needed equipment is acquired and deployed as quickly as  possible, with a goal of awarding a contract within 15 days. Also, under the  amendment, the Secretary is to authorize the senior official to waive  certain provisions of law, policy, directive, or regulation that would  unnecessarily impede the rapid acquisition and deployment of the needed  equipment. The amendment also stated the \u201cauthority of this section may  not be used to acquire equipment in an amount aggregating more than  $100,000,000 during any fiscal year.\u201d In addition, the amendment stated  that \u201cor acquisitions of equipment under this section during the fiscal  year in which the Secretary makes the determination [that equipment is  urgently needed to eliminate a combat capability deficiency that has  resulted in combat fatalities] with respect to such equipment, the  Secretary may use any funds available to the Department of Defense for  that fiscal year.\u201d", "The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) issued an instruction in  July 2005 establishing policy and procedures to facilitate the assessment,  validation, sourcing, resourcing, and fielding of operationally driven  urgent, combatant command needs during the same fiscal year that a  request is made. According to the instruction, combatant commanders  involved in ongoing operations identify joint urgent needs as life- or  combat mission-threatening needs based on unforeseen military  requirements that must be resolved in days, weeks, or months. Under the  instruction, a joint urgent need must be considered inherently joint in  nature; for example, the need is theaterwide and/or spans multiple military  services. Joint urgent needs must also fall outside of DOD\u2019s established  guidance for weapon systems acquisition and the military services\u2019  established urgent operational needs processes. JRAC has applied its  guidance to process joint urgent needs meeting these criteria. The  instruction delegates shared oversight responsibility of the process to the  Joint Staff J-8 Director for Force Structure, Resources and Assessment;  the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Deputy Comptroller for  Program and Budget; and JRAC within the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (AT&L). Data for joint urgent needs are managed through the  CENTCOM Requirements Information Manager database system, which  the command added to a preexisting Web site it managed in 2005.

These phases are: initiation, theater  endorsement, command validation, headquarters approval, funding,  contract award, and initial fielding. Urgent needs requests that result in  fielded solutions typically move through the process as follows:  Initiation: Any of the three urgent needs processes can begin when  either a warfighter in the theater of operations or an official at the  theaterwide or combatant command level identifies a need and an  officer with a rank of Colonel or higher submits the request into the  relevant Army, Marine Corps, or joint process. The request could be for  either a known, specific piece of equipment or for an unknown materiel  or nonmateriel solution based on a description of a capability gap.", "Theater Endorsement: Theater command leadership reviews, endorses,  and forwards a request for component or combatant command  validation. For example, a joint urgent needs request from a warfighter  in Iraq would be reviewed and endorsed by the theater commands such  as Multi National Force-West, Multi-National Corps-Iraq, or Multi  National Force-Iraq.", "Command Validation: Endorsed urgent needs requests from Iraq or  Afghanistan are elevated to the appropriate commandwide  leadership\u2014U.S. Central Command, U.S. Army Forces Central, or U.S.  Marine Corps Central Command\u2014 for validation or rejection.", "Headquarters Approval: Validated Army urgent needs requests are sent  to the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for the Army G3/5/7  directorate, while Marine Corps urgent needs are sent to the Marine  Corps Requirements Oversight Council for its headquarters approval.  The combatant commander sends joint urgent needs to the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, who send the need to JRAC concurrently in order to alert it of  the impending request. Upon headquarters approval, JRAC assigns the  requests for capabilities related to countering improvised explosive  devices to JIEDDO. For all other joint urgent needs, JRAC designates a  military service to sponsor the procurement and fielding of a solution.", "Funding: The military service or joint sponsor applies funds to the  program office to begin the procurement of approved solutions. When  funds are not already available, the services may obtain funding for an  urgent need through the annual budget process, by reprogramming  funds from other programs during the current fiscal year, or by  requesting the Secretary of Defense to invoke the department\u2019s rapid  acquisition authority. For joint urgent needs requests, JRAC may assist  in identifying available funding as needed. In previous years, sponsors  have also requested funding for urgent needs through the wartime  supplemental appropriation.", "Contract Award: The appropriate military service or joint program  office develops and executes an acquisition strategy in order to procure  the solution. Among other options, a new contract may be awarded  using competitive procedures or as a sole source, as provided in the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), or an existing contract could be  amended or modified.  The rapid acquisition authority may be  available for the acquisition and deployment of some equipment.", "Production and Initial Fielding: The program office manages the  production and fielding of solutions to the theater. Some solutions may  be readily available from current DOD inventory or from commercial  vendors, while others may require modifications to existing equipment  or substantial efforts to research, develop, and produce new  technologies.", "Combatant commanders have sometimes made strategic or tactical  changes that eliminate the need for a solution. Also, an urgent needs  request could be addressed by existing equipment that was previously  unavailable until changes in the combatant commander\u2019s plans and  priorities resulted in the availability of the equipment in the theater.

For example, OSD\u2019s guidance describing how joint  urgent needs should be processed is contained in memoranda issued in  September and November 2004, and March 2005. In addition, the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an instruction in July 2005 establishing  the policies and procedures for warfighters in the theater and combatant  commanders to identify, review, and approve joint urgent needs.

Once  received and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a joint urgent need is  handed off to JRAC for disposition through additional phases of the  process that address funding, acquisition, and fielding as outlined in  Deputy Secretary of Defense memoranda. The Deputy Secretary of  Defense memo from November 15, 2004, outlined procedures for JRAC to  follow in facilitating joint urgent needs and included a provision directing  that the guidance remain in effect for 3 years after it had been approved, at  which time a determination will be made as to the continued existence of  JRAC. However, OSD has not released additional guidance or amended the  current guidance to address this provision, and JRAC continues to operate  and facilitate the urgent needs process, more than 5 years after the  guidance was issued.", "According to GAO\u2019s Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool,  one of the steps management can take to ensure consistency with internal  controls is to periodically evaluate the organization structure and make  changes as necessary in response to changing conditions. Neither the  November 2004 memo nor the Chairman\u2019s instruction have been updated  to incorporate guidance regarding how the rapid acquisition authority is to  be implemented. Among other things, the operational guidance for the  joint urgent needs process could delineate for potential requestors the  advantages of using the authority, the circumstances under which a  request for the use of the authority should be contemplated, what factors  might persuade the Secretary that a given request is a good candidate for  the use of the authority, as well as how and when the use of waivers would  be appropriate under the rapid acquisition authority. This kind of  information could be useful to officials assigned the responsibility of  processing urgent need requests and finding funds for those requests.", "In addition, the Deputy Secretary of Defense memo defines immediate  warfighter needs as urgent operational needs requiring a timely solution  within 120 days or less. According to JRAC officials, because they have  found it difficult to complete all phases of the joint process and field a  solution in 120 days, in practice, they have modified this time frame by  extending it to between 120 days to 2 years. The modification of this time  frame occurred informally, and has not been documented in guidance.  Also, it remains unclear whether OSD approval is required to change the  time frame or whether authority is delegated to JRAC to make this change,  which affects the standard for timeliness in meeting urgent warfighter  needs. Additionally, the November 2004 Deputy Secretary of Defense  memorandum defines differently the terms urgent operational need and  immediate warfighter need. Officials relate that, in practice, there is no  longer a distinction between the two and both have been subsumed in the  term joint urgent operational need, and are treated as one and the same.  JRAC staff completed a Lean Six Sigma study of the joint urgent needs  process. According to JRAC officials, they plan to use the findings of that  study to guide improvements to the process. However, because this effort  is still ongoing, it is unclear to what extent any actions taken as a result of  this study will address the issues we have identified.

For  example, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instruction directed the  creation of the Budget Office Director\u2019s Board within the Joint Staff to  adjudicate funding during the same fiscal year that a request is made for  solutions for joint urgent needs. According to the Chairman\u2019s instruction,  the board is responsible for reviewing and approving recommendations to  fund joint urgent needs, and to direct the reprogramming of funding from  military services\u2019 or agencies\u2019 budgets to do so. However, this board has  never convened, and JRAC has assumed responsibility for identifying  funding to procure solutions to joint needs. The November 2004 Deputy  Secretary of Defense memorandum states that the JRAC is to assist in  resolving issues impeding the resolution of joint urgent needs, but the  memorandum does not give JRAC the authority or responsibility for  identifying funding for solutions. Rather, the guidance states that the  military services, defense agencies, and combatant commands are  responsible for funding solutions.", "Further, the Chairman\u2019s instruction and the November 2004 Deputy  Secretary of Defense memorandum are inconsistent regarding the scope of  solutions for joint urgent needs. For example, the Chairman\u2019s instruction  includes criteria for the scope of solutions to joint urgent needs,  stipulating that they should not involve the development of a new  technology or capability. The instruction further states that the  acceleration of a new technology in progress or the minor modification of  an existing system to adapt to a new or similar mission is within the scope  of solutions to joint urgent needs.

In addition, those  standards call for the proper classification of transactions and events that  includes appropriate organization and formatting of information from  which reports and statements are prepared. Relevant, reliable, and timely  communications and effective information technology management are  critical to achieving useful, reliable, and continuous recording and  communication of information. However, the milestone data located in the  joint and Army databases are often incomplete and unreliable. Although  both joint and Army systems generally contain documentation to support  completion of milestones at the early phases of the processes such as  theater command endorsement and headquarters leadership approval,  once a request is delegated to the acquisition community for procurement  and fielding, visibility into subsequent actions is largely lost. For example,  the joint system rarely contains detailed information and support  documentation regarding the funding, contract award, or production and  fielding of solutions. Additionally, the Army database does not contain  information regarding acquisition milestones following the approval of a  funding strategy. As a result, data limitations can prevent managers and  decision makers of the urgent needs processes from assessing the overall  responsiveness and effectiveness of their processes.", "Further, Army policy instructs system managers to close out requests 120  days after the scheduled fielding date if no information regarding actual  fielding is received. This may result in the closure of some requests  without confirmation of whether or not solutions were actually fielded.  Although the joint system contains the most detailed qualitative data of  any of the three systems we reviewed, the dates cited for specific  milestones do not reflect the dates on which those milestones were  achieved, and instead reflect the dates the milestones were recorded in the  joint system\u2019s electronic record. Consequently, the dates regarding the  funding, acquisition, and fielding of solutions are vague or inaccurate, and  the database usually lacks documentation to support the dates listed.  Additionally, the joint and Army systems lack a capability to produce  either management summary reports or complete historical information  regarding the completion of phases, which prevents DOD from measuring  responsiveness over time and initiating process improvements.  Furthermore, managers of the Army, Marine Corps, and joint urgent needs  processes lack visibility into other urgent needs data systems across the  department, which limits their ability to determine if possible solutions to  their urgent needs might have already been developed through other  processes.

However neither service\u2019s assessment  process includes a mechanism for providing actionable performance  feedback to joint decision makers.

We have previously reported that the  department\u2019s established requirements process, JCIDS, has not met its  objectives to identify and prioritize warfighting needs from a joint  capability perspective. In 2008, we reported that capabilities continue to  be driven primarily by the individual services and that DOD may be losing  opportunities to improve joint warfighting capabilities. In responding to  our 2008 report, DOD stated that identifying and prioritizing joint  capabilities occurs through multiple processes within and outside JCIDS,  including the joint urgent needs process. However, without a joint  warfighter perspective on performance, there is not sufficient information  to adequately assess whether a capability should transition to an  acquisition program, particularly when the sponsoring service would like  to phase out or terminate support of the capability.", "Joint Chiefs of Staff officials recognize the need for performance feedback  on joint solutions; however, its previous attempt to establish a process for  collecting performance feedback was unsuccessful. In 2007, the Joint  Chiefs of Staff attempted to craft a feedback loop as part of an update to  the Chairman\u2019s instruction for joint urgent needs. The draft revision failed  to obtain DOD-wide approval and was canceled\u2014in part due to  disagreement over the feedback process outlined in the draft instruction.  According to Joint Staff and JRAC officials, the combatant commands  contended that their resources were focused on planning and managing  contingency operations, and that providing feedback was a military  service responsibility under Title 10. Conversely, according to officials the  military services believed that since solutions addressed joint urgent  needs, feedback should be provided by the user, the combatant command.  Nevertheless, in 2008, the Joint Staff reinitiated its effort to revise the  Chairman\u2019s instruction and establish a feedback mechanism for joint  urgent needs solutions. The draft revision was in coordination within the  department at the time of our report.", "In May 2009, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed U.S. Central  Command to establish a joint requirements liaison office as a pilot  program within its Afghanistan joint task force to assist in processing  Army and joint urgent needs statements. At the time of our report the  program had not begun operations, and it was unclear whether it would  collect performance feedback on joint solutions as part of its operations.  Without adequate feedback information from the theater that addresses  how well fielded solutions address the risks to warfighters and to their  missions and whether solutions will be necessary for the future, DOD  cannot assess the performance of the joint urgent needs process in  meeting immediate and future warfighter needs. Feedback provided by  commanders in the field would better enable Joint Staff and military  service officials to determine if solutions are effective, and whether they  need to be sustained, adopted as a formal acquisition program, or  suspended. In one case, DOD fielded a solution to a joint need for an  airborne counter-improvised explosive device for more than 18 months,  although it did not meet the warfighters\u2019 needs. Joint officials stated that  the service did not track the operational effectiveness of the solution,  called Angel Fire, and failed to provide feedback after initial fielding. The  Angel Fire system provided a daytime-only solution, and did not meet the  warfighter\u2019s request for a 24-hour surveillance capability. The warfighter  then rescinded the urgent needs request in December 2008 and the Angel  Fire aircraft were scheduled for removal from the theater to the United  States.

For example, an artillery unit  deploying as an infantry unit will need fewer howitzers, but will need a  greater number of armored vehicles.

The highest potential for extended  response times occurred in the initiation and funding phases due to  insufficient training, the lack of timely funding decisions, and other  factors.

According to Army  theater command officials, some warfighters who need to request a critical  capability do not know how to select the process most appropriate for  their situation, and officers responsible for reviewing and processing the  documentation in the theater do not receive adequate training on how the  processes should function, which may result in inefficiencies and delays in  fielding solutions to critical needs.", "In addition, the Army has expanded the scope of its urgent needs process  beyond the requests for new solutions to address capability gaps, to  address equipment shortfalls resulting from units deploying in  nonstandard roles. For example, an artillery unit may be deployed to  perform a force protection mission, requiring a different mix of equipment  than what is authorized to carry out its artillery mission. As we have  previously reported, units are currently being deployed in nonstandard  roles, and this has caused challenges across the force, in part because  deploying units in nonstandard roles often encounter unanticipated  equipment needs. According to Army requirements officials, the result  has been a dramatic increase in the volume of urgent needs requests from  10 per year prior to September 11, 2001, to about 290 per month in 2009.  However the Army has not increased the number of staff available from  prewar levels to provide support at headquarters despite the rising volume  of requests. With the expansion of the scope of the urgent needs process,  the Army found an increasing number of invalid requests because users do  not understand what type of equipment can be requested through this  process. According to Army requirements officials, about 97 percent of the  Army urgent needs statements are requests for the reallocation of  equipment already available. They estimated over 557,000 pieces of  equipment have been requested through the Army process alone. Further,  theater command officials stated that the increased number of requests  has also contributed to processing backlogs of urgent needs in theater,  when the requests might have been more quickly addressed by theater- provided equipment or by the weapons loan program. Army officials stated  that prior to deployment, replacement personnel are informed that a user\u2019s  guide and help desk are available for the Army\u2019s Equipment Common  Operating Picture data system used to process Army urgent needs  requests. Theater command officials said uncertainty over how to address  needs often results in officers submitting a larger number of urgent needs  requests early in a unit\u2019s deployment. This uncertainty, combined with  confusion regarding the different sources and processes available to  address capability gaps or equipment shortfalls, can result in the  inefficient use of resources and prolonged amounts of time needed to  request and receive critical capabilities.", "According to DOD\u2019s strategic plan for transforming training, deploying  personnel should receive priority for training and be responsive to the  needs of the combatant commander across the full spectrum of  operations.  The prevailing principle of this strategic plan states that no  one should experience a task in a real-world operation without having  previously experienced that task in training or education. However, during  our field work in Iraq we found that the requirements officers who prepare  urgent needs requests at the brigade level\u2014where most urgent needs  requests originate\u2014are not well trained in the processes. Marine Corps  officials told us that they provide insufficient predeployment training on  preparing and reviewing urgent needs documentation for their own and  joint processes, and Army officials told us that Army requirements officers  responsible for drafting and submitting urgent needs requests at the  brigade level do not receive formal training on these processes prior to  deployment. According to theater command officials, requirements  officers deploying overseas must learn the process on the job. Frequent  rotations of force management officers at the division level responsible for  reviewing brigade-level requests further increase the likelihood of  extended time frames for approving urgent needs and fielding solutions, as  the already steep learning curve recurs each time a new reviewing official  is deployed into the theater. We found that lack of knowledge about how  and under what circumstances to prepare an urgent needs request,  especially among recently deployed personnel, may cause reviewing  officers to initially reject requests. In turn, some reviewing officers, who  themselves have not received adequate training, may reject urgent needs  applications based on personal preferences. As a result, reviewers may  receive multiple resubmissions of requests related to the same urgent  need, increasing the overall amount of time needed to field solutions to the  theater. Although information that would have allowed us to determine  what factors contributed to the time frames for processing urgent needs in  the theater was unavailable, in the 13 case studies for which we were able  to obtain documentation, we observed that the time between the creation  of a joint urgent need document and theater command-level endorsement  varied widely from as few as 6 days to as many as 446 days.", "Moreover, senior force management officers in theater at the division level  or higher who are responsible for reviewing and processing urgent needs  requests may have received limited exposure to the urgent needs process  as part of force management training.  In some cases, force management  officers in theater, who are trained in the organization and execution of  requirements determination, force structuring, and combat development,  are employed in the urgent needs review process either on a part-time or  full-time basis. However, the formal urgent needs process training they  receive is limited to an hour-and-a-half introductory segment within a 14- week course. In addition, officials responsible for the force management  training course stated that the course focuses on duties performed in the  United States, rather than those that will be required as part of a deployed  task force. Further, the division-level training segment on the urgent needs  process has only been included in the course since 2005 and officers who  completed the 14-week course prior to 2005 are exempt from repeating it.  According to Army training officials, no provision has been made to  update force management officers on the urgent needs elements of the  course or to train them on the joint urgent needs process. As a result, most  force management officers arriving in theater to review and process urgent  needs requests at the division level or higher, like their counterparts at the  brigade level, must learn about reviewing and processing urgent needs on  the job, and likewise this pattern tends to repeat itself with each rotation  of new forces to the theater.", "The previous commander of the Multi-National Forces-Iraq recognized in  2008 that warfighters in the theater needed assistance in requesting critical  capabilities. On September 16, 2008, he wrote a memorandum to the  Deputy Secretary of Defense that recommended the establishment of a  joint requirements liaison office in theater to assist the warfighter in  identifying capability or equipment shortfalls and in preparing Army and  joint urgent needs statements. On April 20, 2009, the Deputy Secretary of  Defense responded by directing the Commander, U. S. Central Command;  in coordination with the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; Under Secretaries  of Defense (for Personnel and Readiness, and Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics); and the Commander, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, to create a  pilot joint requirements liaison program in Afghanistan to assist in the  identification of capability and equipment needs via the military services\u2019  and joint urgent needs processes. Officials in theater said that these liaison  offices would function at the division level or higher; however, since most  urgent needs requests are generated at lower levels, the joint requirements  liaison office will not eliminate the need to address the lack of training at  both the division and brigade levels. We have reported in the past that  military personnel have received limited or no training on key operational  functions\u2014such as using and managing deployed contractors\u2014as part of  their predeployment training or professional military education.  Similarly, improved training on the appropriate use of the urgent needs  process and how to craft urgent needs documentation can improve the  overall timeliness of addressing capability gaps and delivering solutions to  help ensure that warfighters receive critical capabilities as quickly as  possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Has Not Always Been Available to Field Urgent Needs Solutions in Part Because OSD Has Not Taken Actions to Ensure Timely Funding Decisions", "paragraphs": ["After urgent needs requests have been approved by service headquarters  or by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the funding needed to field solutions to  those needs has not always been provided in a timely manner.

In a representative example from  our case studies (which comprised a nonprobability sample, and thus are  not representative of urgent needs requests as a whole), it took 474 days to  field communications equipment to warfighters in Afghanistan after the  request was endorsed by theater command. During that time, JRAC  delayed assigning a sponsor for that joint urgent need for 131 days  because it was unable to resolve which service would fund the solution.  JRAC officials told us that, although the services and components assigned  to sponsor joint urgent needs solutions have never refused to fill that role,  assigned sponsors sometimes allow requests to wait\u2014up to 2 years\u2014until  the next budget cycle. In one of the more extreme cases we found, it took  509 days for the Army to field a solution to a joint urgent need for mobile  explosive scanning equipment. Within that time, the Army took 293 days  after the solution was approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to reprogram  the necessary funding and an additional 4 months to award a contract for  the equipment. In another joint case, it took almost a year after theater  endorsement to field an aerial surveillance capability known as Angel Fire.  Of that time, approximately 5 months was spent awaiting funding\u2014in  addition to 2 months the Marine Corps spent pursuing its own funding  strategy prior to approval of the joint request. The Marine Corps began  efforts to fund Angel Fire in July 2006, with the intent of seeking full  funding from JIEDDO. However, a Deputy Secretary of Defense decision  prevented JIEDDO from funding the purchase of platforms, such as  vehicles or aircraft, so this urgent need request was split into two\u2014$19.5  million for the development of surveillance sensors and platform  integration submitted through the joint process and approximately $15  million for aircraft and services through the Marine Corps process.  Funding of approximately $34.5 million was finally arranged in February  2007.", "The Deputy Secretary of Defense assigned JRAC the responsibility of  helping to resolve issues that could prevent timely and effective  warfighting support but did not give JRAC the authority to allocate funding  for solutions. As a general rule, JRAC forwards approved solutions aimed  at countering IEDs to JIEDDO, which receives funding through its own  direct appropriation. According to JRAC officials, 123 or approximately  55 percent of the estimated 225 joint urgent needs requests it has received  since 2004 have been related to IEDs. JRAC delegates the other 45 percent  of approved joint solutions for critical needs, such as intelligence  surveillance and recognizance, biometerics, communications, and force  protection, to the military services, geographic combatant commands such  as U.S. Central Command, the U.S. Special Operations Command, or other  DOD components who sponsor the funding and fielding of solutions. In  addition to the department\u2019s annual budget process and congressional  appropriations dedicated to efforts to counter IEDs, DOD may rapidly  fund non-counter IED joint urgent needs by invoking the rapid acquisition  authority granted by Congress, by using the department\u2019s authority to  reprogram funds except as otherwise precluded by law, or by using any  applicable statutory authority to transfer funds from another  appropriation.

Under this authority, OSD can use any funds available to the Department  of Defense for that fiscal year to accomplish the rapid acquisition and  deployment of equipment that is urgently needed to eliminate a combat  capability deficiency that has resulted in combat fatalities.", "Our review of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s use of rapid acquisition authority  over the past 5 years shows that DOD has used that authority four times to  obligate $170 million for three projects, as shown in table 2.", "OSD plays a reactive, rather than proactive, role in the use of its rapid  acquisition authority, while many approved urgent needs requests aimed  specifically at preventing combat fatalities wait for funding. Rather than  identifying cases eligible for funding through the rapid acquisition  authority at a high level, the Office of the Secretary of Defense issued an  implementing memorandum for its rapid acquisition authority that  directed JRAC to recommend cases for the use of this authority to the  Under Secretary of Defense (AT&L), based on requests from the military  departments, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Under  Secretaries of Defense, and other OSD directorates, agencies, and  activities. Consequently, the services are in a position to limit the number  of funding requests for urgent needs that reach OSD. Moreover, JRAC  officials we spoke with said that the services have shown little interest in  requesting the use of rapid acquisition authority to begin funding joint  urgent needs because the acquisition strategy and funding of existing  programs could be disrupted, preferring instead either to reprogram funds  themselves or, in most cases, to await funding through DOD\u2019s annual  budget for overseas contingency operations. As a result, OSD is  effectively taken out of the process of deciding which urgent needs  request should be considered for funding through the rapid acquisition  authority.

Military service officials we spoke with said that they are reluctant to use  their own funds to initiate acquisition of a joint urgent need without first  receiving assurance that funding will be replaced during the next budget  cycle. According to those officials, without such assurance, the acquisition  strategy of existing programs could be disrupted. Our prior work on  interagency collaboration has shown that top-level leadership\u2014such as  that provided by OSD and its Deputy or Under Secretaries\u2014is a necessary  element for sustaining collaboration among federal agencies, including  among DOD components, particularly when effective interagency  coordination is needed to better leverage resources.  This work has also  found that midlevel agencies, such as JRAC, can not guide policies at a  high enough level to promote effective interagency cooperation.", "Although JRAC was initially created with direct reporting responsibility to  the Under Secretary of Defense (AT&L), the Under Secretary realigned  JRAC in March 2008 to report to the Director of the Rapid Reaction  Technology Office, within the Office of the Director for Defense Research  and Engineering (DDR&E). In July 2009, JRAC and the Rapid Reaction  Technology Office were both realigned under the Director of Rapid  Transition to accomplish the responsibilities of DDR&E, which were  expanded to include oversight of the Systems Engineering Development  Test and Evaluations functions. Currently, the JRAC resides under the  Director, Rapid Fielding. According to JRAC officials, the most recent  realignment will help the department better anticipate emerging threats  and ensure the technology needed to counter urgent threats is mature  before the threat fully materializes, as well as improve the synergy  between the requirements, acquisition, and research communities.  However, JRAC\u2019s most difficult challenge, according to its Director,  continues to be prioritizing needs and quickly identifying the resources  needed to execute a solution, which is the responsibility of the DOD  components.", "Referring to JRAC as \u201cmission essential\u201d for effective coordination with  the services, JIEDDO, and other agencies addressing urgent warfighter  needs, the Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command has called for a  permanent organizational structure led by a senior leader capable of  coordinating, influencing, and directing actions. We and others have found  that establishing a senior executive council is a best practice that can  provide an implementation team\u2014such as JRAC\u2014access to senior  leadership while reinforcing the team\u2019s accountability for successfully  implementing the program. An executive council can set policies, ensure  that decisions are made quickly, resolve conflicts that arise, review and  approve plans, and monitor and report progress back to top leaders of the  organization. Members of such a council, which could include both  political and career executives within the organization, would work with  the department Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and other high-level  appointees to develop a leadership direction and communicate the  leadership\u2019s position.", "Without a departmentwide approach to addressing its funding challenges,  DOD will continue to struggle to field timely solutions to problems that  create risk to warfighter lives or mission failure. Further, extended time  frames in identifying and securing funding for solutions to joint urgent  needs and challenges to JRAC\u2019s mission will persist. Conversely, a JRAC  with support from an interagency executive council with the means to  better leverage funding from across DOD, all under the oversight of top- level DOD officials, would be in an improved position to provide timely  solutions to meet the urgent needs of warfighters while assuring effective  use of DOD resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Technological Immaturity or Complexity of Potential Solutions Can Lead to Longer Response Times", "paragraphs": ["In 14 of 23 case studies we conducted (8 joint, 2 Army, and 4 Marine  Corps), technological immaturity or complexity was a factor that led to  longer time frames for fielding solutions to urgent needs. In the 8  technologically challenged joint urgent needs cases we found, solutions  for 2 requests\u2014both related to the Active Denial System\u2014were never  fielded because the capability was technologically immature and could not  be adequately sized or adapted for operational use in a wartime  environment and under changing theater conditions. Solutions for the  remaining 6 technologically challenged joint urgent needs were eventually  fielded, but the average response time from theater endorsement to  fielding ranged from 320 to 497 days with an average of 393 days. In one of  the more protracted cases, the Combined Joint Task Force\u201382 in  Afghanistan endorsed a request on October 20, 2007, for an improvised  explosive device detection system capable of detecting devices that were  buried underground. However, following JRAC\u2019s request that JIEDDO  accept responsibility for providing a solution, 497 days passed before  JIEDDO began initially fielding a solution because additional time was  required to develop the experimental Husky Mounted Detection System. In  a recent DOD Inspector General report, the Inspector General determined  that JIEDDO decided to produce the system in large numbers before  determining its operational effectiveness and suitability. Nevertheless,  while these cases exceeded the original 120-day fielding target expressed  in both Joint Chiefs of Staff and OSD guidance, they fall within the 2-year  time frame used by JRAC and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.", "Guidance for the Army process does not address the technological  complexity or maturity of a potential solution to an urgent need. Guidance  for the Marine Corps process states that capability gaps and solutions to  urgent needs are not restricted to commercially available equipment or  technologies and may require the rapid development of new capabilities.  Conversely, when Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to prescribe  procedures for the rapid acquisition and deployment of urgently needed  items in the Fiscal Year 2003 NDAA, it specified that those items should be  either currently under development by DOD or already available from the  commercial sector. Further, DOD guidance on the scope of its joint urgent  needs process states that urgent operational solutions should not involve  the development of a new technology or capability. However, the  acceleration of an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration or the  minor modification of an existing system to adapt to a new or similar  mission is within the scope of the joint process.", "According to JRAC and military service sponsors for solutions to joint  urgent needs, requests are becoming increasingly more technologically  complex. As of June 2, 2009, JRAC indicated that approximately 20 joint  urgent needs were sufficiently impacted by technological development  concerns that their projected fielding date is uncertain. For example, one  urgent need request asked for explosive ordinance disposal suits and  helmets equipped with night vision capability. The Multi-National Force  Iraq submitted the request in May 2005. Initially, the Army worked with the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and  Low Intensity Conflicts to develop a prototype to meet the warfighter\u2019s  need, but this effort proved unsuccessful. In March 2007, U.S. Central  Command consolidated the initial urgent need with two additional urgent  needs requests it had received from the theater for bomb suit helmets with  night vision capability. In April 2007, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and JRAC  validated and approved the urgent need request and assigned it to  JIEDDO, which has thus far been unable to develop a successful  prototype.", "We have reported on the department\u2019s success in fielding MRAPs in  response to an urgent need, and stated that, among several factors  contributing to the success of the program were that 1) DOD kept the  requirements simple, clear, and flexible and did not dictate a single  acceptable solution, and 2) the department made sure that only mature  technologies and stable designs were used by setting a very short and  inflexible schedule. In addition, the Defense Science Board reported  recently that any rapid response to an urgent need must be based on  proven technology and robust manufacturing processes because attempts  to squeeze new technology development into an urgent time frame create  risks for delays and ultimately may not adequately address an existing  capability gap. The board stated in its report that, in order to achieve  initial deployment of a solution in weeks or months, technology must be  sufficiently mature and likely filled by commercial or government off-the- shelf products, or foreign government sources. Further, the board stated  that needs that cannot be met with mature technology should be handed  to the defense science and technology community as a high priority for  further development. Sponsors for joint solutions we spoke with  expressed concerns that the maturity of the technology associated with  approved urgent needs solutions is often overstated, ultimately requiring  further integration, development, and testing before the solutions can be  successfully acquired and produced. The board advocated a triage process  to differentiate between different urgent needs and determine whether an  urgent need should be addressed through expedited acquisition  procedures or the department\u2019s traditional acquisition system.", "Both of the services\u2019 processes include procedures for reviewing whether  a potential solution that requires the development of a new technology  should be sustained for the long term, across the service, as a formal  acquisition program. Army and Marine Corps officials involved in their  respective urgent needs processes stated that they prefer urgent needs  requests that cite capability gaps rather than specific solutions in order to  provide the warfighter with flexibility to utilize creative solutions that may  be inexpensive and readily available but unknown to the warfighter. CJCSI  3470.01 is unclear about who should be responsible for applying the  technological maturity criteria, and based on our case studies it remains  unclear who is responsible during the review, endorsement, and approval  phases to apply the criteria, remove those urgent needs that fall outside of  the scope of the process, and recommend a different approach. Based on  the results of our case studies, we found that attempts to meet urgent  needs with technologically complex or immature technologies risk  prolonging the fielding of solutions, and could result in fielding a  capability too late to effectively address rapidly changing theater  conditions. As we state earlier in this report, DOD lacks clearly defined  roles and responsibilities for managing DOD\u2019s urgent needs processes in  general. As a result, the department faces difficulty in ensuring that the  joint process is implemented efficiently and effectively and in identifying  the appropriate personnel who are accountable for operations,  stewardship of resources, and achieving results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Due to rapidly changing battlefield threats in Iraq and Afghanistan,  Congress has recognized DOD\u2019s need to be more nimble in its response to  warfighter requests for urgently needed capabilities than the department\u2019s  usual acquisitions process allows. Similarly, DOD\u2019s leadership has  recognized the importance of rapidly procuring solutions to meet  warfighter needs during contingency operations. Although the  establishment of the Army, Marine Corps, and joint urgent needs  processes improved capabilities available to the warfighter, without  improvements to the management framework to incorporate additional  internal control standards, DOD risks fielding solutions that are either too  late to do good or that do not successfully meet warfighter needs. In the  absence of consolidated and updated departmentwide guidance  permanently establishing its joint urgent needs process, and clearly  delineated roles, responsibilities, and authorities of various stakeholders,  the department will continue to face challenges implementing the process,  monitoring the process to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in each of its  phases, and evaluating results. In addition, unless DOD\u2019s joint urgent  needs guidance and acquisition policy clearly communicate the availability  of the rapid acquisition authority that the services and the JRAC can use to  meet urgent needs, the services could continue to miss opportunities to  quickly field urgently needed solutions to the theater of operations and  inadvertently increase costs by unnecessarily prolonging the acquisition  process. Furthermore, without more comprehensive, complete, and  reliable data that can be used to accurately track and document key  process milestones, as well as to create reports for management review,  DOD will continue to lack the ability to oversee and track the progress of  individual requests or to determine which phases of the process, if any,  might need adjustments to prevent unnecessary delays. Finally, a formal  mechanism for soliciting and collecting feedback from servicemembers in  theater is essential for determining how well fielded solutions are meeting  warfighter requests as well as ensuring that the resources invested in the  urgent needs process are achieving the desired results.", "For the Army, Marine Corps, and joint urgent needs processes, challenges  in the initiation and funding phases, in particular, can significantly  increase the number of days\u2014or weeks, or months\u2014that elapse between  the time a warfighter submits an urgent request and the time a solution is  fielded. When the personnel responsible for documenting and reviewing  urgent needs requests do not receive needed training before arriving in the  theater of operations, they can become quickly overwhelmed by the  volume of requests, leading to backlogs, errors, and delays. Unless DOD  takes steps to ensure that both unit requirements officers and senior force  management officers responsible for processing urgent needs requests  receive training on appropriate uses of the service and joint processes, as  well as how to craft related documentation, before they arrive in theater,  warfighter requests are likely to continue to face delays early in those  processes. More consistent predeployment training would be an important  step toward ensuring that warfighters receive critical capabilities as  quickly as possible. Moreover, in the absence of OSD leadership on  recommending when to use the rapid acquisition authority Congress  provided the department specifically for the purpose of funding solutions  to urgent needs, some requests that have been validated as urgent may  continue to experience increasing time frames during the funding phase of  the process. Until OSD begins to play a proactive, rather than a reactive  role in the use of its rapid acquisition authority, urgent requests that have  been assigned to one of the services or components for funding are likely  to continue to compete with longer-term service programs and, in some  cases, wait until the next annual budget process to be funded from the  base budget for the next fiscal year. Similarly, without a means to secure  cooperation from the services and other DOD components to reprogram  and transfer funds to meet joint urgent needs, JRAC will continue to face  challenges in providing timely solutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following nine  actions:  To improve the department\u2019s ability to fully assess how well the urgent  needs processes are addressing critical warfighter deficiencies and to  measure the effectiveness of solutions fielded in the theater, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the  Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commands, military services,  and other DOD components, as necessary, take the following actions to  permanently establish the joint urgent needs process and to improve  consistency with federal internal control standards:    Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military services, and  other DOD components, as necessary, through the issuance of new or  updated OSD and Joint Chiefs of Staff guidance, to identify who is  accountable for implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of all  phases of the process\u2014including applying the technological maturity  criteria.

During this review we  focused on urgent wartime needs submitted through the joint, Army, and  Marine Corps urgent needs processes as these are the processes most  frequently used, and commanders used the Air Force and Navy urgent  needs processes much less frequently. Air Force officials stated they had  one active request under their urgent needs process when we began our  review, and Navy officials stated they had eight active requests under their  urgent needs process when we began our review. We visited forces  conducting operations in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility  and gathered information on how they identify, document, and submit  urgent requests through the urgent needs processes, and on the fielding  and assessment of solutions in the theater. We conducted site visits to  joint, Army, and Marine Corps offices responsible for the respective urgent  needs processes, as well as offices of officials who participate in reviewing  urgent needs requests and developing funding strategies and solutions to  be fielded. We reviewed existing policy and guidance applicable to joint,  Army, and Marine Corps urgent needs processes, and compared them to  our standards for internal control in the federal government. We also  compared actual practices, tools, and data systems used to manage the  joint, Army, and Marine Corps urgent needs processes to our internal  control standards. We assessed the reliability of the databases and  information systems used to process urgent needs requests by 1)  interviewing knowledgeable officials, 2) reviewing data system guidance  and procedures when they were available, and 3) conducting limited  electronic testing that included comparing values from source  documentation with data elements in the data systems. While our  assessment of databases and systems used to process urgent needs  requests showed that some data elements were accurate and supported by  sufficient documentation, we found that other items for reporting specific  urgent needs requests were incomplete, and not sufficiently reliable for  reporting specific results here, or to support accurate, useful management  reports related to overall results. As a result, we determined that we would  conduct case studies of selected urgent needs requests to provide insights  related to this, and the following objective. We used data elements from  the information systems that we had determined were sufficiently reliable  to support the selection of case study candidates from the universe of  joint, Army, and Marine Corps urgent needs requests.", "To determine what challenges, if any, have affected the overall  responsiveness of DOD\u2019s urgent needs processes we analyzed joint, Army,  and Marine Corps data management systems in order to review the data  collected on the time frames between decision points and determine how  timely and effective each process was for providing solutions to urgent  warfighter needs. To conduct this analysis we selected a nonprobability  sample of cases to review from a universe of 49 Joint Urgent Operational  Needs, 4,054 Army Operational Needs Statements, and 524 Marine Corps  Universal Urgent Need Statements. Our selected cases included 11 joint, 6  Army, and 6 Marine Corps for a total of 23 urgent needs cases reviewed.  To ensure that the case studies reflect the current DOD urgent response  processes as much as possible, we selected cases that were submitted  after the latest iteration of updates in each process. We considered urgent  needs requests initiated in the Marine Corps process after September 1,  2006; initiated in the Army process after October 1, 2006; and initiated in  the joint process after August 1, 2006. We then eliminated 1) requests for  which solutions have not been fielded and 2) requests for items that the  Army already procures. We selected cases for which solutions have not  been produced in order to explore aspects of the process based on their  visibility, cost, and scope. We selected cases in order to represent distinct  types of needs such as: Command and Control; Force Protection;  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Counter-Improvised  Explosive Device; Logistical Support; and Miscellaneous (such as  nonlethal weapons or other items not so easily categorized). We also  selected cases where duplication of effort appeared possible, and urgent  needs requests that commanders in Iraq or Afghanistan identified as high  priority. Assessments of the selected cases were based on a comparison of  the time required to achieve key objectives in completing the urgent needs  process against stated goals and interviewing knowledgeable officials  regarding the relative ease or difficulty in accomplishing these objectives,  as well as end users in theater regarding the sufficiency of fielded  solutions. In order to allow for comparison across the joint and service  urgent needs processes, we constructed a chronology of each urgent need  beginning with initiation of the urgent needs process and culminating with  the initial fielding of a solution in theater, if applicable. Since each urgent  needs process within DOD is distinct and uses differing terms and  procedures, we used a consistent approach to demonstrate progression  between key events and decision points across time lines from initiation of  an urgent need request to initial fielding of a solution However, in  collecting data for our case studies, we found that documentation  regarding the initial theater recognition of an urgent need was inconsistent  and often unavailable.

Although each of these urgent needs processes is distinct, we identified  seven broad phases that we used to track the progression of each request  over time and to compare performance across the Army\u2019s Operational  Needs Statement process, the Marine Corps\u2019 Urgent Universal Needs  Statement process, and the Joint Urgent Operational Needs processes.  These phases are: initiation, theater endorsement, command validation,  headquarters approval, funding, contract award, and initial fielding. Figure  1 illustrates these phases.", "For each of our 23 case studies, we tracked the progress of an urgent need  request beginning with the initiation of an urgent needs process and  culminating with the initial fielding of a solution, if any. Each of the figures  that follow represents the case studies we selected, describing an  identified need or capability gap, the proposed solution, and a brief  description of challenges, if any, affecting the ability of the urgent needs  process(es) in question to rapidly field a response to that request, and a  photograph. Although each urgent needs request is unique some of the  requests we reviewed were closely related. Where appropriate we  combined these case studies in our discussion below. Challenges, if any,  to providing a solution for an urgent needs request were identified in  discussions with agency officials and supported by our review of the  request\u2019s progress through each phase of the process. Further information  on our methodology can be found in appendix I. Issues associated with  funding and technical complexity were the most frequent challenges  affecting the response or causing delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For further information please contact William Solis, (202) 512-8365 or  solisw@gao.gov."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Cary B.
