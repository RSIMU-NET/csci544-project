Over 100,000 of the approximately 700,000 Gulf War veterans have participated in health examination programs established by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Many of those examined reported health complaints, including fatigue, muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal problems, headaches, depression, neurologic and neurocognitive impairments, memory loss, shortness of breath, and sleep disturbances. Many veterans claim that their medical symptoms, some of them debilitating in nature, were not present before their service in the Persian Gulf War. Some veterans suspect that their health problems may be linked to chemical or biological warfare agents that Iraq may have used during the Gulf War.", "Various organizations have researched the causes of Gulf War illnesses\u2014the source of much controversy over the past 7 years. By the end of 1996, DOD and the VA together had funded 82 research projects related to Gulf War illnesses. Despite these efforts, it remains unclear why some Gulf War veterans became ill following their service in the Persian Gulf War. It also remains unclear whether the rates of reported illnesses for veterans that deployed to the Gulf are higher overall than the rates for those that did not deploy or than the rates for the civilian or military population as a whole. Also unexplained are differences in the frequency of symptoms reported by reserve units and active duty units and any correlations between the location of units and the occurrence of particular illnesses. Research designed to answer these and many other Gulf War illnesses-related questions will not be completed for years. Of the 151 current federally sponsored research projects, less than 25 percent have been completed, and many are not scheduled for completion until after 2000."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishment of the Persian Gulf Illnesses Investigation Team", "paragraphs": ["Prompted by the continuing controversy over Gulf War illnesses, President Clinton, in 1995, ordered DOD and other federal agencies to reexamine whether possible exposure to chemical or biological agents occurred during the Gulf War. In March 1995, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established the Persian Gulf Illnesses Investigation Team within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to explore this question. The Investigation Team was established as DOD began to lose credibility among veterans and veterans\u2019 groups in its efforts to determine the causes of Gulf War illnesses and to support the problems experienced by veterans. The 12-member team included intelligence officers, an Army Chemical Corps officer, a pilot, a chemist, a physician, and a criminal investigator. Beginning in 1991, senior Defense officials had taken the position, in testimony before the Congress and in press interviews, that Iraq did not use chemical or biological weapons during the Persian Gulf War and that no U.S. forces were exposed to chemical or biological agents. DOD officials maintained this position as late as 1994. This position came under attack because both U.S. and foreign detection teams had reported that chemical warfare agents were present on the battlefield. In 1995 and 1996, Central Intelligence Agency and U.N. reports established that during the Gulf War, Iraq had stored rockets filled with sarin, a deadly chemical warfare agent, at an ammunition storage site located at Khamisiyah, Iraq, about 60 miles from Kuwait\u2019s border. In June 1996, DOD announced that U.S. troops at Khamisiyah in March 1991 were likely to have destroyed a bunker of rockets containing chemical agents. By July 1997, DOD acknowledged that U.S. troops near Khamisiyah may have unknowingly been exposed to low levels of sarin when they used demolitions to destroy these rockets.", "In the midst of this controversy, DOD became dissatisfied with the results of the Investigation Team\u2019s efforts. The Investigation Team did not have the resources needed to accomplish its mission. For example, it was unable to follow up on more than 1,200 toll-free calls received on DOD\u2019s hot line with Gulf War veterans. In addition, its operation was criticized in the December 1996 report by the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans\u2019 Illnesses. The report cited, for example, the Investigation Team\u2019s failure to take advantage of its unique access to classified and routine military records to fully investigate and help answer the public\u2019s questions about veterans\u2019 possible exposure to chemical and biological warfare agents.", "A DOD team asked by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to evaluate DOD\u2019s responses to Gulf War illnesses concluded that DOD\u2019s work in this area needed a broader focus, a strategy for systematically examining the various theories concerning the nature and causes of Gulf War illnesses, and a method of effectively communicating DOD\u2019s findings to U.S. veterans and the public. On November 12, 1996, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established the Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses (OSAGWI)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSAGWI\u2019s Mission and Implementation Strategy", "paragraphs": ["The goal of restoring public confidence in DOD shaped the mission and organizational focus of OSAGWI. OSAGWI\u2019s mission was broadly defined as ensuring that (1) veterans of the Gulf War are appropriately cared for, (2) DOD is doing everything possible to understand and explain Gulf War illnesses, and (3) DOD puts into place all required military doctrine and personnel and medical policies and procedures to minimize any future problems from exposure to chemical and biological warfare agents and other environmental hazards.", "Although OSAGWI\u2019s mission statement charges it with ensuring that veterans are appropriately cared for, specific responsibility for providing health care to servicemembers still on active duty and for conducting the health research program continues to reside with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. Similarly, VA remains the primary health care provider for those who have left military service. OSAGWI officials told us, however, that they assist servicemembers and veterans with health care matters related to Gulf War illnesses by providing them with referrals to sources of health care or helping them with the registration and examination processes associated with DOD\u2019s Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program or the VA\u2019s Persian Gulf Registry. OSAGWI also works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs to (1) help ensure that reservists receive all entitled benefits and (2) recommend changes to legislation or rules where needed.", "At the time of our review, OSAGWI believed that its core activity involved investigating and reporting on incidents of possible exposure to chemical and biological warfare agents and investigating related military operations during the Gulf War. After OSAGWI has completed its investigation of an incident, the investigator writes a summation document called a case narrative. The purpose of OSAGWI\u2019s case narratives is essentially to get all of the facts before the American people about what OSAGWI has learned from its investigation of an incident. The case narrative, a document updated as new evidence becomes known, is to contain all important investigative facts and OSAGWI\u2019s assessment\u2014in terms of \u201cdefinitely,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cindeterminate,\u201d \u201cunlikely,\u201d or \u201cdefinitely not\u201d\u2014of the likelihood that servicemembers were exposed to chemical or biological warfare agents. The standard OSAGWI used for its assessments was whether all available facts would lead a reasonable person to conclude that a chemical or biological warfare agent was or was not present.", "As of January 1, 1999, OSAGWI had published a total of 19 reports\u201413 case narratives, 2 environmental exposure reports, and 4 information papers.

We did not review OSAGWI activities to coordinate and monitor research on the causes of Gulf War illnesses because this subject is addressed by other reviews. To determine DOD\u2019s progress in establishing an organization to address Gulf War illnesses issues, we obtained briefings from OSAGWI officials covering the range of activities performed to fulfill their mission objectives and reviewed associated documentation.", "OSAGWI had issued eight case narratives at the time we began our review. It pursued these eight cases first because they involved incidents that were the most prominent and controversial at the time. To evaluate the thoroughness of OSAGWI\u2019s investigations and reporting on veterans\u2019 possible exposures to chemical or biological warfare agents, we reviewed six of these eight case narratives. The case narratives we selected for review were (1) \u201cReported Mustard Agent Exposure\u201d; (2) \u201cU.S. Marine Corps Minefield Breaching\u201d; (3) \u201cFox Detections in an Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) Orchard\u201d; (4) \u201cAl Jubayl, Saudi Arabia\u201d; (5) \u201cAl Jaber Air Base\u201d; and (6) \u201cReported Detection of Chemical Agent, Camp Monterey, Kuwait.\u201d We did not review the case narrative about the alleged exposure to chemical warfare agents at Khamisiyah, Iraq, because it was already being heavily reviewed by other organizations, such as the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans\u2019 Illnesses and the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs\u2019 Special Investigation Unit. We also did not review the \u201cPossible Chemical Agent on SCUD Missile Sample\u201d case narrative because it appeared to be less controversial than the other case narratives.", "In reviewing each case narrative, we generally used as criteria OSAGWI\u2019s methodology, which had itself been derived from the United Nations and other international community protocols for investigating chemical warfare incidents. This methodology included (1) substantiating the incident by searching for documentation from operational, intelligence, and environmental logs; (2) documenting the medical reports related to the incident; (3) interviewing appropriate people; (4) obtaining information available to external organizations; and (5) assessing the results. We also used the criterion that the case narrative should accurately and fully disclose all materially significant information relevant to the investigation of the incident in order to avoid any appearance that OSAGWI was selectively reporting what had actually happened.", "We initially traced each statement in the published case narrative to its underlying supporting document to identify the accuracy and completeness of the text in the narrative. For those statements missing adequate supporting documentation, we requested that OSAGWI provide us with the appropriate documentation. We also reviewed additional documentation collected by the OSAGWI investigators in performing the investigation, even though some of this documentation might not have been cited in the published narrative. We looked for any inconsistencies in information that was not addressed in the published narrative. In addition, for the selected case narratives, we contacted 71 individuals interviewed by OSAGWI that were key sources of information and requested that they verify the accuracy and completeness of both the OSAGWI case narrative and the OSAGWI write-up of the investigator\u2019s discussions. We also contacted some key participants not originally interviewed by OSAGWI to determine whether other relevant information was available that might affect OSAGWI\u2019s assessment of possible exposures to chemical warfare agents. Finally, we contacted several Gulf War veterans organizations, including the following: the American Legion; the Disabled American Veterans; the Veterans of Foreign Wars; the National Gulf War Resource Center; GulfWatch; the Desert Storm Justice Foundation; the Operation Desert Storm/Shield Association; the Gulf War Veterans of Long Island, New York; and the Chronic Illnesses Net for Persian Gulf Veterans. We asked them to provide us with any information they had that refuted or added to the OSAGWI information. We did not systematically approach veterans\u2019 groups to obtain their assessments of overall OSAGWI effectiveness because this was beyond the scope of our review.", "To further verify the case narratives, we interviewed officials and obtained pertinent documentary evidence from officials at the following locations: OSAGWI, located in Falls Church, Virginia; the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command at Aberdeen, Maryland; the U.S. Army Chemical Center and School at Ft. McClellan, Alabama; the Office of the Surgeon General of the Navy, Washington, D.C.; the Naval Health Research Center, San Diego, California; the Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C.; the Deployment Surveillance Team, which operates the Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program, Falls Church, Virginia; and the U.S. Army Gulf War Declassification Project, Falls Church, Virginia.", "We conducted our review from September 1997 to January 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSAGWI Has Made Progress in Addressing Issues Related to Gulf War Illnesses", "paragraphs": ["In the face of severe criticism by veterans, veterans groups, and others of its handling of Gulf War illnesses issues, DOD committed additional resources to its efforts to determine the cause of veterans\u2019 health problems.

In contrast, as of October 9, 1998, OSAGWI had a staff of about 200 persons and a fiscal year 1998 budget of $29.4 million. In addition, OSAGWI was given much broader authority than the Investigation Team. Finally, OSAGWI reports directly to the Deputy Secretary of Defense; the Investigation Team reported to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.", "OSAGWI officials said that with an adequate budget and sufficient operating authority within DOD, they were generally unconstrained in their efforts to pursue OSAGWI\u2019s mandate. According to these officials, OSAGWI\u2019s operations have been fully funded, and OSAGWI has had largely unrestricted access to personnel, files, and other data necessary for its work. For example, OSAGWI has had full access to classified information from the military services and intelligence agency sources.

Our review confirmed that OSAGWI has made significant progress in establishing communications with veterans and others.", "OSAGWI established an E-mail address and encouraged veterans and others to use both this and the DOD toll-free hotline to communicate with OSAGWI regarding Gulf War illnesses issues. Within the first year of operation, it received almost 1,200 letters and 2,700 E-mail messages. OSAGWI staff contacted over 3,900 veterans through personal telephone calls, which included the vast majority of the Investigation Team backlog of unanswered calls from 1,200 veterans. According to OSAGWI, as of January 1, 1999, it had received 2,850 letters and 4,906 E-mail messages and answered 2,803 and 4,866, respectively. OSAGWI used a staff specifically trained to deal with Gulf War veterans\u2019 concerns, obtain information from veterans, provide information about OSAGWI activities, and make referrals for those needing medical support from DOD or VA.", "OSAGWI uses a variety of methods to disseminate information on its operations. For example, it uses a Web site called GulfLINK on which it publishes its case narrative reports, information papers, and much of the supporting documentation used in its investigations. OSAGWI reports that this site typically receives over 60,000 inquiries each week. OSAGWI also publishes a bimonthly newsletter called GulfNEWS. Over 12,000 individuals receive the newsletter. OSAGWI\u2019s leadership and staff have met with veterans at 18 town hall meetings and made appearances at 41 national veterans conventions. In addition, OSAGWI officials frequently meet with veterans and military service organizations to discuss Gulf War illnesses topics of interest to them.", "Finally, OSAGWI communicates directly with veterans that are affected by its investigations. After OSAGWI completes an investigation and publishes the corresponding case narrative, it sends to each affected veteran a letter that contains a synopsis of the investigation\u2019s results. For example, following its investigation of the potential chemical warfare agent exposure in Khamisiyah, Iraq, OSAGWI sent letters to 97,837 veterans concerning the possibility that they might have been exposed to low levels of sarin, a chemical warfare agent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSAGWI Has Identified Chemical and Biological Warfare Force Protection Issues Requiring Attention", "paragraphs": ["According to OSAGWI officials, OSAGWI must go beyond investigating and reporting on possible veterans\u2019 exposures to chemical or biological warfare agents and identify ways to better protect servicemembers from nontraditional battlefield threats. From its investigations and reports on possible veterans\u2019 exposures to chemical, biological, or environmental agents, OSAGWI has identified force protection issues that need improvement. These lessons learned generally fall into the following three categories: how to build trust and confidence in DOD, how to better account for what happened on the battlefield, and how to better protect servicemembers on the battlefield. Specific examples of the lessons learned include the need for institutionalizing a veterans\u2019 outreach capability after OSAGWI is disestablished; improving systems for tracking troop movements during a conflict so that accurate data is available to show where individuals or units were located on the battlefield at any point in time; improving wartime records development and post-war records management systems and addressing issues such as the lack of a uniform records management program for joint commands; improving chemical and biological warfare agent detection equipment to make it less prone to false alarms and requiring doctrinal changes to collect and retain detector-produced printouts of detections; implementing techniques to better safeguard the health of deployed troops, such as deploying forward field laboratories early and taking samples to determine whether contamination may have occurred subsequent to the use of depleted uranium ammunition; and improving and implementing depleted uranium training programs.", "OSAGWI is presently working with DOD agencies to implement the lessons learned. Discussions by the Special Assistant with the Director of the Joint Staff and the military service Chiefs of Staff resulted in revised Joint Staff policy concerning record-keeping by joint commands. OSAGWI was also instrumental in developing a DOD-initiated requirement for the military services to review their depleted uranium training programs. We did not review what impact OSAGWI\u2019s lessons learned have had toward making changes within DOD. Until recently, OSAGWI had no office for monitoring and measuring the extent to which OSAGWI lessons learned were being acted upon.

Also, OSAGWI did not use DOD or Department of Veterans Affairs medical databases on Gulf War illnesses in conducting any of the six investigations.

About 8 hours later, he began to experience a stinging pain on the skin of his left upper arm. Three hours later, blisters had formed there. About 15 hours after the exposure, the company medic checked the soldier\u2019s blisters and suspected a heater burn. Eight hours later, after more blisters had formed on the soldier\u2019s arm, aid station medical personnel suspected he might be a casualty of blister agent, treated him, and evacuated him to the company support battalion. There, an Army physician photographed the blisters and confirmed the diagnosis of exposure to a blister agent.", "An Army chemical officer also observed the soldier\u2019s blisters and examined his clothing. He observed a wet spot on the soldier\u2019s coveralls. The officer took the coveralls to a Fox vehicle for testing. From its tests on March 2, 1991, the Fox vehicle reportedly confirmed the presence of a mustard chemical warfare agent. After this positive test, the soldier\u2019s coveralls were buried at the scene in Iraq as contaminated waste.", "On March 3, 1991, a senior medical officer (a physician and an expert in chemical warfare agents who was also at the time the Commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense) examined the soldier\u2019s blisters and concluded that they had been caused by exposure to a liquid mustard agent. This officer based his diagnosis largely on (1) the latent period of 8 hours between exposure and the first symptoms, which is characteristic of mustard exposure and (2) the absence of any other known chemical compounds present on the battlefield that have this characteristic.", "On March 4, 1991, following an order from chemical officers at the division level to confirm the positive results from the first day of Fox vehicle testing, tests on the soldier\u2019s flak vest were performed by two Fox vehicles\u2014apparently because the vest had not been buried along with the coveralls. Initially, both Fox vehicles registered the potential presence of chemical warfare agents, but only one was apparently able to confirm the presence of mustard agent.

Instead OSAGWI relied upon the senior medical officer\u2019s testimony to the Presidential Advisory Committee, his medical journal article, and his review of OSAGWI\u2019s draft case narrative. However, this procedure failed to identify important information. In early 1998, our subsequent interviews with the senior medical officer and OSAGWI\u2019s interviews with him revealed that he was unaware of the existence of any in-theater urinalysis involving the soldier. He also stated that, because of his position in the theater as the head of a team of scientists responsible for assessing any chemical casualties, he would have known about the existence of any positive urinalysis performed there. We then contacted the officer who had written the Army Central Command message and asked him about his basis for reporting the positive urinalysis. He told us that his message was based on 3rd Armored Division reports that the senior medical officer had found thiodiglycol in the soldier\u2019s urine specimen. The available evidence is thus contradictory and insufficient to establish that this test actually occurred.", "Second, the results of the tests conducted on March 2, 1991 (the first day of testing), for mustard agent on the soldier\u2019s clothing cannot be confirmed with the available documentation, and OSAGWI did not interview some key officials involved in the case about the tests. According to the Commander of the Fox vehicle involved, the Fox tests on the soldier\u2019s clothing conducted on March 2, 1991, indicated the presence of blister agent on the soldier\u2019s coveralls. However, the Fox printout of the test results was apparently lost. We located and interviewed the Fox test operator involved, who told us that several tests were conducted on the soldier\u2019s clothing that day and that there was one positive confirmation for mustard agent. During our review, OSAGWI found a printout from one of these tests in its files, but it was negative for chemical agent. We noted that this printout had not been logged into OSAGWI\u2019s document receipt system. We also noted that OSAGWI had never interviewed the Fox vehicle Commander in person or the operator who conducted the tests. OSAGWI relied upon information provided by E-mail from the Commander of the Fox vehicles involved because he was then stationed in Germany and could not easily be interviewed in person. OSAGWI said it did not interview the test operator because it could not locate him.", "On the second day of Fox testing, the Fox Commander returned with both the original and a second Fox vehicle to confirm the positive test results from the first day of Fox testing of the soldier\u2019s clothing. One of the Fox vehicles was unable to confirm the presence of mustard agent on the soldier\u2019s flak vest because of a high concentration of oil products on the vest. The other Fox vehicle, whose detailed confirmatory procedure was videotaped by a crewmember but for which the printout is unavailable, did show the presence of mustard agent. DOD sent the printout from the original Fox vehicle and the videotape from the second one to the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for analysis. A Command expert found that the surviving printout did not confirm the presence of chemical warfare agent when the detailed confirmatory procedure was performed. However, after examining the printout and viewing the videotape, this official concluded that the incident had involved an actual mustard agent detection.", "We found other procedural discrepancies that raise questions regarding this case. First, DOD did not adequately identify or ensure the validity of important physical evidence. We noticed a difference between the inventory of items that the Commander of the Fox vehicles had reportedly packaged for shipment back to the United States for analysis and the items that were received at the U.S. Army Chemical Research, Development and Engineering Center. The Commander reported on his inventory list that he did not include samples from the soldier\u2019s coveralls since they were unavailable; however, the Center\u2019s inventory showed receipt of such samples. When we interviewed the Commander, he told us that he believed the sample material was in fact from the Commander\u2019s own protective suit that he wore during the Fox vehicle testing. These discrepancies raise the possibility that either someone recovered the soldier\u2019s coveralls and then repackaged the contents for shipment to the United States or that at least some of the clothing sent back to the United States for testing was not the soldier\u2019s. The circumstances surrounding the testing of the soldier\u2019s clothing in-theater thus remain unclear. It is impossible to determine whether the samples are actually from this soldier.", "In discussing the investigative weaknesses we found, the OSAGWI lead investigator told us that this investigation had begun under the Investigation Team before OSAGWI was established and that the case was carried over to OSAGWI. She said that the case\u2019s outcome appeared to be obvious on the surface\u2014particularly since the soldier had received a medical diagnosis indicating exposure to mustard agent. She said that the investigation process at OSAGWI has matured since this case narrative was published. She also said that OSAGWI would do more cross-checking of the facts if this investigation were being done today.", "Despite the investigation\u2019s shortcomings, we believe that OSAGWI\u2019s assessment of \u201clikely\u201d exposure to a chemical warfare agent in this case is reasonable. The senior medical officer\u2019s clinical diagnosis that the soldier\u2019s injuries were caused by exposure to mustard agent is significant in that this expert in chemical warfare agents made his assessment contemporaneously at the time of the injury and continues to believe that the latent period of 8 hours from exposure to the first symptoms supports his diagnosis. In addition, an expert at the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command, after reviewing the Fox vehicle printout and viewing a videotape of another Fox vehicle conducting tests, concluded that this incident involved a valid detection of mustard agent.

The detection by the 1st Division\u2019s Fox vehicle was described as a trace detection of such a small magnitude that no official report of the detection was made and no Fox printout was kept to document the detection. OSAGWI concluded that the presence of chemical warfare agents in the 1st Division area was \u201cunlikely.\u201d", "The detection by the 2nd Division\u2019s Fox vehicle, however, indicated the potential presence of mustard, sarin, and lewisite\u2014all chemical warfare agents.

However, the validity of this reported injury was controversial. Some witnesses supported the Marine\u2019s claim that his hands were blistered, but the examining physician stated that the Marine had no injury of any kind.", "In investigating the breaching incident, OSAGWI interviewed key participants in the breaching operations, including members of the Fox vehicle crews, chemical warfare specialists, some unit commanders, the Marine who claimed to have been injured, other Marines from the injured man\u2019s unit, and the medical personnel who examined him. The investigators also reviewed unit logs and other pertinent documentation, including classified data, and consulted with Fox vehicle and chemical weapons technical experts.", "On the basis of reviews of the 2nd Division Fox vehicles\u2019 printouts by three different laboratories, OSAGWI concluded that the Fox vehicle detections were false alarms, probably caused by the high concentrations of smoke from oil well fires and petroleum particles in the atmosphere.

In its overall assessment of the incident, OSAGWI stated that the presence of chemical warfare agent was \u201cunlikely.\u201d In supporting its assessment, OSAGWI stated that since no chemical land mines were ever found in Kuwait and since no artillery fire was encountered by the Marines who breached the first row of mines, there was no delivery mechanism for chemical warfare agents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Review of OSAGWI\u2019s Investigation", "paragraphs": ["OSAGWI overlooked a key piece of evidence and did not report other significant information in its case narrative.

This conclusion was based on comments made by the commanding officer and others of the Marine company that carried out the minefield breach where the 2nd Division Fox vehicle reported the presence of a chemical warfare agent. However, our review of OSAGWI files disclosed a Marine Corps unit log entry indicating that Iraqi artillery and mortar fire was present during the first minefield breach. The OSAGWI investigator told us that he had inadvertently overlooked this information during his investigation. We also interviewed Marines who told us that Iraqi artillery and mortar fire was present as they passed through the first minefield. Consequently, we believe a delivery mechanism for chemical warfare agent may have been present.", "Also, the timing of events was significant. For example, the log entry indicating that enemy artillery was encountered was made around 6:15 a.m. on February 24, 1991. The Fox vehicle detection was made at 6:22 a.m. of that same day. The Marine who claimed to be injured was riding in an amphibious assault vehicle that was following the Fox vehicle. He said his injury occurred just after he heard the Fox vehicle\u2019s report of the chemical warfare agent detection over the radio.", "We also learned that the Commander of the 2nd Division\u2019s Fox vehicle told OSAGWI investigators that chemical detection paper taped to the outside of the Fox vehicle was noted to have changed colors after passing through the first minefield (indicating possible contact with a chemical agent). However, this information was not reported in OSAGWI\u2019s narrative. The OSAGWI investigator said that this information was omitted because technical experts had told him that the detection paper could change colors because of the heavy concentrations of petroleum products in the air coming from the oil well fires the Iraqis had set. Furthermore, as mentioned in the case narrative, three different laboratories had reviewed the Fox vehicle printout and concluded that the detections were probably false alarms. The narrative did not point out, however, that one of the three laboratories had also said that it could not rule out the possibility of the presence of a chemical warfare agent.", "Finally, a classified document in OSAGWI\u2019s files contained intelligence evidence not included in the narrative that could support the possibility of an Iraqi chemical attack. This information, some of which has since been declassified, refers to a report indicating the end of a chemical attack on February 24, 1991, the same date as this incident. OSAGWI was aware of this information, but because of its vagueness, unknown origin, fragmentary nature, and time of report (about 4 hours after the breaching event), it was not given much weight during OSAGWI\u2019s analysis.

While the information we found does not conclusively prove that chemical warfare agents were present, it does increase the potential that some might have been present. In our opinion, the weaknesses we found in this case narrative are sufficient to warrant OSAGWI\u2019s reconsideration of its assessment.

Units in the area subsequently reported additional explosions, went on alert, and conducted tests for the presence of a chemical warfare agent. A variety of confusing and contradictory actions subsequently occurred. All NMCB-24 tests for chemical warfare agent were officially reported as negative, but one member of this unit alleged that he had obtained positive test results for a chemical warfare agent in two of three attempts. British units in the vicinity initially reported positive tests for a chemical warfare agent, but detection teams sent to investigate these reports were unable to confirm any such agents. Some eyewitnesses from NMCB-24 reported a large fireball that illuminated the sky and medical symptoms such as runny noses, burning sensations, blisters, and numbness. They stated that those experiencing symptoms reported for medical attention within the next few days. However, other NMCB-24 personnel said that although they were unprotected during these events, they experienced no such symptoms.

The missile landed in the waters of Al Jubayl harbor, and the site of impact was quickly found and marked by Coast Guard and Navy boat crews. Later that day, a Navy explosive ordnance disposal team surveyed the marked area with an underwater television system and located missile debris on the harbor\u2019s bottom. Divers confirmed that the missile had broken apart and that the site contained an intact SCUD warhead, guidance section, rocket motor, and miscellaneous components. Recovery of the smaller SCUD components began on February 19 and concluded with the warhead on March 2. During the recovery operation, tests were conducted, but no evidence was found indicating the presence of chemical or biological agents.

A Patriot battery was defending Al Jubayl at the time. However, OSAGWI found and we confirmed that this battery was not operational for maintenance reasons at the time of the attack and therefore was not able to engage the SCUD.

The Navy\u2019s Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit No. 2 (EPMU-2) conducted an environmental/occupational hazard investigation and site visit to Al Jubayl in 1994. The resulting EPMU-2 study did not determine the source of the irritant. It noted, however, that the camp was located in a heavily industrialized area and that emissions from a petrochemical plant or from a spill within the camp\u2019s motor park could have been the source of the irritant. The T-shirts and the boots that changed color were given to unnamed U.S. military and Saudi officials.

OSAGWI officials told us that in this case they had expanded their methodology to include a considerable amount of information in the narrative regarding environmental cleanliness factors affecting the Al Jubayl area. They said they had done this in an effort to better explain the circumstances of the case because some veterans had expressed concern over the hazardous materials they could have been exposed to while they were in Al Jubayl. The narrative thus contained much information explaining that (1) Saudi environmental protection standards were equivalent to those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, (2) these standards were monitored and maintained by the Saudis throughout Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield, and (3) Saudi monitoring records indicate no detections that normal standards were exceeded on the date of the purple T-shirt incident. The environmental data included in the narrative, much of which was obtained by EPMU-2, thus indicated that Al Jubayl was no worse or better than comparable industrialized sites in the United States.", "We concur that OSAGWI\u2019s decision to expand its stated methodology in order to include this information was appropriate. As indicated at the beginning of the narrative, OSAGWI\u2019s charge is to investigate all possible causes of Gulf War illnesses. However, most of the information presented in this case narrative leads the reader to conclude that exposure to either chemical warfare agents or other chemical agents at Al Jubayl was \u201cunlikely\u201d and probably did not involve a health threat in the limited incident involving the purple T-shirts. The narrative mentions that some NMCB-24 veterans testified before the Congress (the Riegle Commission) but does not state why. The narrative text also contains no information regarding significant DOD actions taken to address the high incidence of post-war health problems reported by members of NMCB-24.", "DOD has long been aware of health problems reported by NMCB-24. In 1992, DOD began to identify clusters of military personnel who were complaining of medical symptoms they attributed to their Gulf War service. As a result, DOD initiated two field investigations. One of these, performed at the request of the Navy Surgeon General, was a study of illnesses reported by members and former members of NMCB-24 conducted during 1993-94 by the same unit (EPMU-2) that conducted the Al Jubayl environmental study. EPMU-2 personnel visited 6 of NMCB-24\u2019s 12 detachments during this period, conducted a questionnaire study, performed medical examinations, reviewed military and other medical records, interviewed veterans and family members, and otherwise attempted to identify prevalent symptoms experienced by the members of NMCB-24 and diagnoses of their illnesses. Much of the information they collected was computerized and used to produce a series of tables and other statistical data relevant to Gulf War illnesses issues and included in EPMU-2\u2019s final report. This report contained the following conclusions:", "A significant number of NMCB-24 veterans of the Gulf War have experienced an array of nonspecific symptoms since returning from the Persian Gulf. More than 41 percent of the veterans from three of the six detachments experienced 10 or more symptoms.", "No common syndrome or diagnosis was identified in these veterans.", "The diagnoses identified were the same as those that might be expected in a group of the same age that had not served in the Persian Gulf War.", "More research was needed.", "Our review of OSAGWI\u2019s files, our visit to EPMU-2, our interviews of current and former EPMU-2 officials, and our review of all remaining EPMU-2 documentation related to this study revealed additional information. For example, 44 of the 67 witnesses OSAGWI interviewed regarding the facts of the loud noise incident are now reporting health problems they attribute to their service during the Persian Gulf War. A former EPMU-2 physician directly involved in the EPMU-2 study told us that while he had no factual baseline for comparison, it appeared to him that the frequency of symptoms found in NMCB-24 veterans was greater than the frequency to be expected in the general population. This observation, along with the high symptom rates, was one of the reasons the EPMU-2 report recommended more research. NMCB-24 veterans have been involved in testimony before the Congress regarding health problems they attribute to their service in the Persian Gulf War, and the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, California, is currently performing a major, multiyear, Gulf War illnesses-related epidemiological study involving the vast majority of the Navy\u2019s Seabees. NMCB-24 veterans have also been the subject of several additional research studies related to Gulf War illnesses.", "OSAGWI was aware of the existence of the EPMU-2 medical study and had a copy on file that was originally obtained by its predecessor, the Persian Gulf Illnesses Investigation Team, in 1996. However, no OSAGWI investigators visited EPMU-2 to review files regarding this study. No information regarding this study, the Naval Health Research Center research project, or other epidemiological studies or research on Gulf War illnesses was included in the case narrative. A high-ranking OSAGWI official told us that OSAGWI investigators had been instructed to consider such medical information as outside their charter for inclusion in the case narratives. This official said that they had been so instructed because this line of inquiry was more appropriately the responsibility of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and because OSAGWI did not have the expertise to conduct or evaluate epidemiological studies such as the one performed by EPMU-2.", "We believe that much more information regarding the health complaints of NMCB-24 veterans should have been included in the case narrative. OSAGWI was aware of this information and could have included it without conducting or evaluating epidemiological studies. Including information developed by EPMU-2 regarding the environmental cleanliness of Al Jubayl but excluding EPMU-2\u2019s report and other information specifically related to post-war health complaints by NMCB-24 veterans makes OSAGWI vulnerable to an appearance of bias. Such omissions tend to reinforce the beliefs of some that DOD is inappropriately withholding information.", "We also found that some information developed by OSAGWI might have significantly added to what is known about Gulf War illnesses issues involving NMCB-24 had OSAGWI coordinated the information with the Naval Health Research Center for use in its currently ongoing Seabee epidemiological study. For example, as determined by OSAGWI and reported in the Al Jubayl case narrative, both NMCB-24 and NMCB-40 were located at Camp 13 during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Complaints by NMCB veterans regarding post-war medical problems they attribute to Persian Gulf service are well known, having been the subject of several congressional hearings, various research efforts, and other activities addressing Gulf War illnesses issues. An OSAGWI official told us that interviews with selected NMCB-40 personnel indicated that personnel from this unit were not experiencing health problems of the same nature and extent as those reported by NMCB-24 veterans.", "Since NMCB-24 and NMCB-40 occupied the same camp at Al Jubayl, we believe that a determination of whether NMCB-40 veterans are encountering medical problems similar to those being reported by NMCB-24 veterans would be of considerable interest to those concerned with resolving Gulf War illnesses issues. The Naval Health Research Center study is obtaining for analysis a wide range of Gulf War illnesses-related information from current and former Seabees and plans to perform a multifaceted analysis of the information collected.", "In August 1998, Naval Health Research Center officials told us they had coordinated with OSAGWI officials regarding the Seabee study on several occasions but that OSAGWI officials had not informed them of the relationship between NMCB-24 and NMCB-40. The study\u2019s methodology therefore did not include plans to specifically compare Gulf War illnesses information obtained from veterans of these two units. They acknowledged, however, that such comparisons could be conducted and that they might provide useful information. They said they would be willing to discuss adding such comparisons if OSAGWI officials requested that they do so. We believe such comparisons, especially regarding the extent and nature of post-war medical symptoms, might provide information important to OSAGWI\u2019s investigation and reporting of Gulf War illnesses issues involving the Al Jubayl and other case narratives.", "OSAGWI officials agreed that the Al Jubayl case narrative needed to be modified to acknowledge the high rate of symptoms reported by members of NMCB-24 and that they would modify the case narrative accordingly.

In this case, soldiers of the 8th U.S. Army Infantry Division were moving wooden Iraqi crates containing metal canisters out of a building in a bivouac area north of Kuwait City, Kuwait, so that it could be used to house troops. One of the canisters broke open, spilling a white powder-like substance and causing several soldiers to become ill. At the request of the local commander, two Fox vehicles tested the spilled substance. Both Fox vehicles initially reported detections of sarin, a deadly nerve agent, and this apparently led to some initial reports that soldiers had been exposed to a nerve agent. Later, mass spectrometer tests by these Fox vehicles confirmed that the substance was actually a relatively harmless riot control agent rather than sarin. OSAGWI found, and we confirmed, that after interviewing the personnel present (including the Fox crews) and after reviewing Fox crew and laboratory analyses of the Fox printouts, the initial alarm for sarin was an error. Similarly, in both the Al Jaber and ASP Orchard cases, initial Fox alarms for persistent chemical warfare agent could not be confirmed in some instances even by repeated attempts by the same Fox vehicles.

Consequently, certain enhancements are now in place that were not present when the six case narratives we reviewed were published. More specifically, OSAGWI now requires its investigators to prepare a written investigation plan. The investigation plan must specify the information that will be obtained, the direction the investigation will take, and the schedule. The plan is expected to mirror the overall methodology adopted by the division within the Investigation and Analysis Directorate for its investigations. The division chief is to review the investigation plan and provide feedback to the investigator on the scope and direction of the investigation and the proposed schedule. Following approval of the plan by the division chief, the investigator can begin the investigation.", "Also, the process now includes a requirement for a team directional guidance meeting when the investigation is 50- to 75-percent complete.

The purpose of the meeting is to identify at an early stage any problems in the direction of the investigation and to identify any major information sources that are not being used.", "According to OSAGWI, each case investigation is now periodically reviewed by the Director of the Investigations and Analysis Directorate to allow the Director to adjust, as necessary, the scope of the investigation and the case narrative development. Furthermore, the peer review process for case narratives is now more robust because the peer review team, comprising experienced individuals, reviews the completed case narrative along with the source materials. The peer reviewers are responsible for ensuring that the text in the case narrative is supported by the source material and also for identifying portions of the text needing footnotes to source materials.

In our opinion, the lack of effective quality assurance policies and practices within OSAGWI contributed to the weaknesses we noted. A stronger quality control mechanism for its investigations would provide greater assurance that all relevant facts are included and that the information presented is accurately and properly sourced. More consistent use of some types of medical information would also strengthen the rigor of OSAGWI\u2019s investigations. By querying available medical databases for all cases, OSAGWI investigators might have been able to better determine whether personnel at or near the sites of incidents had reported or been diagnosed with unusual health problems, thus helping indicate whether increased investigative efforts regarding the potential presence of chemical warfare agents or other environmental hazards in these incidents might be appropriate.", "OSAGWI\u2019s changes to its internal review process appear to be positive steps in ensuring the quality of investigations and the related case narrative reports. Because OSAGWI initiated these changes after the case narratives we reviewed were published, we could not determine their effectiveness in ensuring the quality of OSAGWI investigations and reports. However, the procedures should incorporate two features to enhance the credibility of the review process. First, it is critical that those named to review OSAGWI\u2019s investigations are independent of the team investigating the incidents to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Second, it is important that the procedures in place lead reviewers to thoroughly check to ensure that all relevant information obtained by the investigation teams has been included in the case narrative reports, that all important leads have been pursued, and that the investigation team has reached conclusions that are fully substantiated by the facts.", "Information about the potential for differences in the occurrence of Gulf War illnesses symptoms between NMCB-24 and NMCB-40 developed during the Al Jubayl case investigation was not shared with the Naval Health Research Center for consideration for inclusion in its ongoing Gulf War illnesses research.

In commenting on this report, DOD stated it was concerned that these databases might be inappropriately used to establish a causal relationship between an event and the medical findings of the registries. DOD therefore maintains it would be inappropriate for case investigations, which were designed to report simply on what happened on the battlefield, to make assumptions about the significance or validity of the data in these databases without the establishment of a causal association by scientific research. DOD also stated concerns about preempting scientific research in this area and drawing premature conclusions that would be fallacious. However, DOD agreed that these databases need to be examined and analyzed for what they can contribute to understanding the illnesses of Gulf War veterans, and noted that the Department has been involved in a number of research and other analyses of these databases.", "We agree that information from these databases should not be used by investigators to establish a causal association and/or conclusions as described by DOD, and did not intend that it should be used for this purpose.

For example, case investigators could use VA Registry and CCEP data, particularly where it shows that large numbers of individuals at or near a given site are reporting health problems, as an indicator for providing investigative leads and for use in establishing the nature and scope of an investigation. This does not mean, as implied in DOD\u2019s comments, that such use of these databases would entail routine inclusion of the reviewed data in the published case narratives, their use as a replacement for research activities, or that its use would result in interpretations of non-scientifically based cause and effect relationships.
