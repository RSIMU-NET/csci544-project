GAO reviewed documentation, information, and data provided by DOD and the military services, on women\u2019s health care services available as of July 2015, and interviewed officials from DOD, the military services and NCR, and six hospitals (selected based on military service, geographic diversity, and volume of deliveries)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Almost all of the domestic military hospitals in the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Military Health System (MHS) offered general women\u2019s health care services, including general maternity, neonatal, and gynecological care, with fewer offering specialty care services. Specifically, according to officials from the three military services and the National Capital Region (NCR) (which includes two military hospitals in the Washington, D.C. area), 37 of the 41 domestic military hospitals offered a basic or specialized level of maternity and neonatal care services, although fewer offered more specialized levels of these services. All of the 41 hospitals offered general gynecological care, including contraceptive services and cervical cancer screenings, while fewer offered more specialized care, such as treatment for gynecological cancers, according to officials.", "According to MHS officials, the MHS selects quality measures for women\u2019s health care services based on assessments and input from advisory groups at multiple levels of the MHS, including at the department, military service, and hospital levels. Members of these advisory groups participate in the activities of national clinical organizations and educate their colleagues within the MHS about new developments in health-care quality assessment, including new quality measures. According to officials from the MHS and all three services and NCR, coordination of the selection of quality measures for women\u2019s health care services across the military services and NCR has increased in the past several years, including for the selection of measures to include in a perinatal quality measures \u201cdashboard,\u201d which is being developed to provide more timely quality information to providers during the patient\u2019s stay in the hospital.", "In 2015, the MHS collected data for 90 quality measures related to maternity, neonatal, and gynecological care, a number of which related to areas that had been identified nationally as being problematic and associated with high rates of maternal morbidity. In maternity and neonatal care, for example, data was collected on elective deliveries (where the birth is facilitated, such as with medication or surgical cesarean section, without a medical indication). For gynecological care, the MHS collected data for quality measures related to prevention, such as screenings for breast and cervical cancer, and gynecological surgery, such as morbidity rates within 30 days following surgery. The MHS, the military services and NCR, and individual military hospitals used the data collected to identify areas for quality improvement and implement related improvement activities. For example, MHS officials told GAO that the MHS\u2019s 2015 Perinatal Quality Initiative was implemented across all military hospitals in response to a finding that postpartum hemorrhage rates were higher in military hospitals compared to certain civilian hospitals. This initiative included training for hospital staff, clinical simulation drills, and using quality tools to help providers prepare for and carry out steps to minimize the risk and negative outcomes of the condition. Officials reported that after implementation of the initiative, postpartum hemorrhage rates decreased, on average, across the MHS.", ""]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

This system provides a full  range of health care services to active-duty military servicemembers, their  dependents, and others, through both direct care (provided at military  hospitals and clinics located on military bases), as well as through care  purchased from civilian health care facilities. While the system as a whole  provides a full range of health care services, the specific services  available at each military hospital (including women\u2019s health care  services) vary depending in part on hospital size and staffing levels.  When needed health care services are not available at a military hospital,  the patient is referred to either another military hospital or a civilian  hospital for care.", "In recent years, questions have been raised about the quality of care,  including women\u2019s health care, provided at military hospitals. For  example, in 2014, DOD conducted a study of the quality of care in the  MHS, and found significant variability in the performance of military  hospitals on certain measures of quality related to maternity, neonatal,  and gynecological care. The study also found that military hospitals had  comparatively poorer performance on some of these measures than other  health care systems, and raised questions about the consistency of care  in the MHS.", "According to health care researchers, for any health system\u2014including  the MHS\u2014assessing the quality of care provided in its hospitals is key to  identifying potential problems and then to taking the appropriate steps to  mitigate the risks to patients. For example, to ensure that women receive  high-quality health care, it is essential that health systems such as the  MHS select and systematically monitor relevant quality measures.  Moreover, researchers also note that it is important that the measures  selected are based on a hospital\u2019s particular care delivery practices and  needs, which may change over time in response not only to changes in  the needs of an individual hospital, but also to evolving national trends in  clinical care.", "The Carl Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for GAO to  describe the availability of women\u2019s health care services at military  hospitals, particularly maternity care, and the measurement and  monitoring of the quality of these services.

Specifically, we obtained from the military services (Army,  Navy, and Air Force) and the National Capital Region (NCR) information  about the levels of maternity and neonatal care provided at each  hospital. The levels of maternity and neonatal care ranged from the most  basic (Level I) to the most specialized (Level IV). In addition, we  obtained information on the availability at each hospital of certain general  gynecological services, and specialized services associated with the  treatment of gynecological cancers. We also interviewed officials from  the military services and NCR about referrals of women to other hospitals  when needed services were not available. Further, we obtained data from  the MHS on the number of women, aged 18 or older, served in fiscal year  2014, including the number of inpatient hospitalizations and the number  of hospitalizations specifically related to maternity and reproductive  health. We reviewed related documentation about these data, interviewed  knowledgeable MHS officials, and determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objective.", "To describe how the MHS selects quality measures for women\u2019s health  care services, we analyzed related policies used by DOD, including the  MHS and each of the military services and NCR, and interviewed officials  representing each to learn about quality measure selection, and how  information is shared among different levels within the MHS. In addition,  we conducted site visits to six military hospitals selected to ensure we  included those representing each of the three military services, as well as  a mix of urban and rural geographic locations, and variation in the number  of deliveries. At each of these hospitals, we conducted interviews with:  the hospital\u2019s leadership; clinical leadership for women\u2019s health care  services; clinical providers such as obstetricians, certified nurse  midwives, and nurses; and quality management staff. Through these  interviews, we obtained information about the role of military hospitals in  selecting quality measures. Because the hospitals we visited were not  selected randomly, they do not constitute a representative sample of all  domestic military hospitals, and the information obtained from these  interviews cannot be generalized to other hospitals. We also interviewed  representatives of national health care quality organizations about the  processes that other hospital systems use to select quality measures.", "To describe the quality measures that the MHS has selected and how, if  at all, these measures are used to assess and improve the quality of care,  we reviewed documentation about which quality measures the MHS, the  military services, and NCR selected, and interviewed officials  representing each about how they use the measures to assess and  improve the quality of women\u2019s health care services. We also conducted  a literature search and interviewed representatives of national  organizations that focus on women\u2019s health to gain an understanding of  what types of quality measures are available and how they are used.

Over the past  two decades, based on such assessments, health services researchers  and national organizations that focus on women\u2019s health, among others,  have identified areas of concern related to women\u2019s health care services  in U.S. hospitals. Those findings have led to recommended changes in  clinical practice to achieve better outcomes. For example, researchers  found that there were increasing rates of elective cesarean sections\u2014 surgeries for which there is no clear medical indication that a cesarean  section is necessary\u2014and that this clinical practice may be associated  with increased rates of morbidity for both the mother and baby. In  response to this finding, the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine  issued a recommendation that obstetricians only perform cesarean  sections when there is a medical indication for them. In addition, in  response to findings of increased rates of postpartum hemorrhage and  other types of maternal morbidity, the National Partnership for Maternal  Safety, which started as a collaborative effort of more than 25  organizations including national women\u2019s health organizations, has  developed resources\u2014such as recommended checklists and other  clinical decision-making tools\u2014to help providers prevent common causes  of postpartum hemorrhage and other types of maternal morbidity.", "Health systems and hospitals use quality measures to assess  performance relative to national recommendations and compared to other  systems and hospitals. Each health system and hospital may select from  a variety of measures for women\u2019s health care services to assess the  quality of care they provide, and to initiate efforts to improve the delivery  of care. Among those measures, process measures may examine  whether a certain service is performed, while outcome measures may  identify the result of treatment. Some quality measures for women\u2019s  health care services have been developed, endorsed, recognized, or  used by relevant national organizations.

When needed women\u2019s  health care services for active duty military servicemembers are not  available at a military hospital, the provider is to try first to refer the patient  to another military hospital (keeping the patient in the direct care  system). Military service and military hospital officials told us that this  was done in order to facilitate continuity of care. Officials from the three  services and NCR told us that because all military hospitals use the same  electronic health records system, a referral within the direct care system  helps facilitate continuity of care, because the receiving military hospital  automatically has access to the patient\u2019s health records. Officials at one  hospital we visited also noted that referrals within the direct care system  are less expensive than purchasing care from civilian hospitals. If the  patient cannot be referred to another military hospital (for example,  because there are none nearby with the capacity or services needed), the  provider will make a referral to a civilian hospital through the purchased  care system. In this case, medical records are provided to the patient to  take with her to the receiving hospital, and with patient approval, faxed to  the receiving civilian hospital.", "Regardless of whether the referral is made through the direct care or  purchased-care system, the extent of communication with the receiving  hospital about the referral often depends on the acuity of the case,  according to military service officials. For example, in cases such as a  complicated pregnancy or a preterm infant, the provider will typically call  or e-mail the receiving provider, discuss the patient\u2019s health status, and  schedule an appointment for the patient. In more routine care cases, such  as an uncomplicated pregnancy, the referring provider is less likely to  reach out to the receiving provider and more likely to instead provide the  relevant contact information to the patient to make the appointment  herself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The MHS Draws on Expertise of Internal Advisory Groups and National Clinical Organizations to Select Quality Measures", "paragraphs": ["According to MHS officials, the MHS selects quality measures for  women\u2019s health care services based on assessments and input from  advisory groups at multiple levels of the MHS, including at the  department, military-service, and hospital levels. Department- and  military-service-level advisory groups track clinical developments in health  care and identify quality measures for the MHS and the services to use.

Based in part on this participation and  expertise, these members recommend quality measures to their advisory  groups for consideration. Officials told us that members of hospital-level  women\u2019s health advisory groups provide their perspectives about quality  measures and data through regular monthly or bi-monthly meetings  hosted by military-service-level clinical specialists. MHS officials  explained that the selection of quality measures for women\u2019s health care  services is also partly influenced by recommendations from the  organizations that collect quality measure data for the MHS. For example,  the National Perinatal Information Center (NPIC) periodically makes  recommendations to the MHS about quality measures to add or  discontinue for the quality performance reports that it generates for the  MHS. According to MHS and military service and NCR officials,  coordination of the selection of quality measures for women\u2019s health care  services across the military services has increased in the past several  years.", "MHS advisory groups related to women\u2019s health care services that are  involved in selecting quality measures are described below.", "Department-level advisory groups. MHS officials reported that at the  department level, there are four advisory groups involved in selecting  quality measures that include measures for women\u2019s health care  services. The Clinical Quality Integration Board (CQIB) is responsible for  the overall assessment of clinical quality across the entire MHS,  coordinates with multiple MHS advisory groups that focus on different  clinical areas, and regularly reports about quality issues to the MHS  Medical Operations Group. Under the CQIB are three advisory groups  that focus on quality measures that include measures for women\u2019s health  care services\u2014the Perinatal Advisory Group (PAG), the Clinical  Measures Working Group (CMWG), and the National Surgical Quality  Improvement Program (NSQIP) Working Group. Figure 2 depicts these  advisory groups. Each of these groups has representatives from the  military services and formally reports to the CQIB on an annual or  biannual basis.", "MHS officials told us that each of these department-level advisory groups  selects and reviews quality measures. For example, the PAG, which  coordinates the MHS\u2019s efforts to improve the quality of maternity and  neonatal care, annually reviews quality measures. In 2014, the PAG  added two quality measures that looked at newborn complications and  first-time cesarean deliveries. In addition, officials from MHS, all three  services, and NCR reported that coordination of the selection of quality  measures for women\u2019s health care services increased in the past several  years. For example, the PAG, using coordinated efforts across the three  military services and NCR, is selecting perinatal quality measures to  include in a \u201cdashboard\u201d that will be used throughout all domestic military  hospitals. The dashboard is intended to provide more timely quality  information to providers during a patient\u2019s hospital stay. MHS officials said  that the CMWG and NSQIP Working Group have similar processes  focused on broader clinical topics, of which women\u2019s health care services  are a subset.", "Military-service-level advisory groups. Each of the three military  services reported one or more advisory groups or offices responsible for  advising their respective service about women\u2019s health issues, including  those associated with the quality of care and measures.

Military service  officials explained that some members of these groups are also members  of the department-level advisory groups, such as the PAG. This dual  membership helps facilitate an exchange of information between the  department- and military-service-level advisory groups. These individuals  may recommend quality measures or tools for discussion at meetings of  the military services. In addition, military service officials told us that  members of these groups communicate regularly with women\u2019s health  clinical providers at individual hospitals through such means as e-mail,  memos, or conference calls, including discussion of quality data and  measures.

Gynecological surgery measures included 14 measures from  the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), which  identified the rate of different types of adverse outcomes within 30 days  following surgery. For example, NSQIP measures provided information  on morbidity rates for overall gynecological surgeries, as well as for  certain procedures, such as hysterectomies. In addition, in 2015, the  MHS collected data on three women\u2019s health care services quality  measures related to gynecological preventive screening.

Finally, officials from all three  military services and NCR reported that some of their military hospitals  opted to collect data on additional quality measures in 2015.

The MHS reviewed data on quality measures across all military  hospitals and identified areas in need of improvement. The military  services and NCR implemented MHS-wide quality initiatives to improve  their performance on these quality measures. For example, according to  MHS officials, the MHS 2015 Perinatal Quality Initiative was implemented  across all military hospitals in response to a finding that postpartum  hemorrhage rates were higher in military hospitals compared to certain  civilian hospitals. This initiative addressed various processes of care,  including training for military hospital staff, conducting postpartum  hemorrhage simulation drills, and implementing quality tools. One of the  tools was a quality bundle to guide providers in responding to cases  involving postpartum hemorrhage. According to MHS officials, the DHA  PAG developed this tool by combining and modifying tools from ACOG\u2019s  Safe Motherhood Initiative, the Council on Patient Safety in Women\u2019s  Health Care, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, and the  Air Force. Additionally, officials reported that in February 2015, the  military services and NCR implemented the use of postpartum  hemorrhage prevention and management carts that contained equipment,  supplies, protocols, documentation, and medication used to manage  postpartum hemorrhage. The MHS also took steps (beginning in 2014) to  improve the medical record coding related to postpartum hemorrhage,  ensuring more standardized coding of these events across all military  hospitals. After the implementation of the Perinatal Initiative and coding  standardization, the MHS\u2019s average postpartum hemorrhage rate  decreased from 5.03 percent in 2014 to 3.05 percent in June 2015, and  was lower than the average for all of NPIC\u2019s hospital clients (3.61  percent) during the first half of 2015.", "Additionally, according to military service and NCR officials, individual  military hospitals often use quality measurement data to identify and carry  out quality improvement activities. Officials at each of the military  hospitals that we visited described a variety of such activities for women\u2019s  health care services that they conducted. For example, officials at an  Army hospital that we visited told us that they conducted a quality  improvement project to respond to data that indicated relatively high rates  of third and fourth degree lacerations in deliveries. They conducted a  review of all related medical cases, shared data with obstetricians,  provided training, and adopted a quality tool called \u201cSafer Passages\u201d\u2014a  tool that highlighted 13 steps to guide labor and help reduce the risk of  perineal trauma, such as eliminating midline episiotomies from their  clinical practices. Hospital officials reported that these steps resulted in  decreased rates of episiotomies and third and fourth degree lacerations,  and increased rates of successful vaginal deliveries. Additionally, one  Navy hospital that we visited implemented a \u201cpregnancy passport\u201d quality  improvement project in 2015 in response to data on low compliance rates  with the nine-visit pathway. The passport provided detailed information  for each prenatal care visit\u2014time frames, discussion topics, medical  procedures, and follow-up services needed with the radiology and  pharmacy departments. One reported outcome of this effort was  improved continuity of care because the hospital\u2019s scheduling staff was  able to use the primary obstetrician\u2019s information listed on the passport  when scheduling patients\u2019 upcoming appointments, which resulted in  more patients seeing the same provider throughout the course of their  pregnancy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making recommendations in this report.
