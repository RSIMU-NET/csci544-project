The Department of Defense (DOD) has not comprehensively updated GFO requirements\u2014the number of GFOs needed to fill positions\u2014since 2003 to reflect changes in the active duty force nor has DOD defined circumstances under which such an update should occur. GFO population growth was generally consistent with the growth in GFO statutory limits. From FY 2001 through FY 2013 growth was not evenly distributed across all military ranks. For example, the GFO and non-GFO officer populations grew from 871 to 943 (8 percent) and from 216,140 to 237,586 (10 percent), respectively, while the enlisted population decreased from 1,155,344 to 1,131,281 (2 percent). DOD officials attributed these differences to the greater flexibility that military planners have to decrease the enlisted population. DOD guidance requires military personnel requirements to be periodically evaluated. DOD conducted a comprehensive update of GFO requirements in 2003 and concluded that the department needed more GFOs than were authorized by Congress. However, DOD officials said that they have not comprehensively updated the requirements since 2003 or advocated for an increase of GFOs because of fiscal constraints. Nevertheless, without periodically conducting a comprehensive update of DOD's GFO requirements, and defining when such an update should occur, it will be difficult for DOD to help ensure that the GFO population is properly sized and structured to meet its assigned missions.", "The full cost to DOD for GFOs from FY 2001 through FY 2013 is unknown because complete cost data for GFOs and their aides were not available and trends in available cost data varied. Certain cost data were fully available and complete for FY 2001 through FY 2013, while other cost data were either partially complete or unavailable because of reporting practices, retention policies, inconsistent definitions, and reliability factors. Also, the position of officer aide is not defined in departmental guidance and as a result all military services were not able to consistently track the number of personnel in these positions. Cost data related to GFO compensation and housing were readily available, and trends for these costs varied, with compensation increasing by 38 percent and housing decreasing by 67 percent from FY 2001 through FY 2013. Measured on a per capita basis, compensation costs grew by 18 percent for GFOs, 19 percent for non-GFO officers, and 32 percent for enlisted personnel over the same time frame. GAO assessed GFO commercial travel and per diem and GFO health care costs as partially complete because data were not available for FY 2001 through FY 2013. For the years in which complete data were available, travel and per diem costs increased by 4 percent from FY 2009 through FY 2013 and health care costs grew by 77 percent from FY 2003 through FY 2013. Other cost data, including data for GFO travel on military and government flights, GFO personal security details, and certain enlisted and officer aide costs, were not readily available or GAO determined them to be unreliable because of concerns regarding completeness or accuracy.

We used DOD\u2019s composite  standard pay rates to calculate the cost of compensation provided to  active duty GFOs and enlisted and officer aides from fiscal years 2001  through 2013. The composite rates are used by DOD when determining  the military personnel appropriations cost for budget and management  studies, but do not include compensation costs located in other budgets,  such as education benefits. We identified criteria in DOD guidance,  federal internal control standards, and federal accounting standards that  specify the need for full and reliable personnel and other cost data for the  purpose of making operating decisions and allocating resources, and  assessed the availability of GFO cost data against those criteria. We defined the GFO-related costs included in our scope as those costs that  were (1) specified in the congressional reports that mandated our work,  (2) consistent with our prior body of work on military compensation, or  (3) determined as GFO-related costs based on discussions with  knowledgeable officials.

For example, growth of the GFO population after fiscal year  2005 outpaced that of the enlisted active duty military population and has  remained higher through fiscal year 2013.

DOD officials stated that during military drawdowns,  population decreases in the officer population tend to lag behind those of  the enlisted population and attributed this to the greater flexibility that  military planners have to decrease the enlisted population by rotating  them out of the active duty force, while officers tend to remain in theater  to manage the drawdown effort.

Other GFOs are not designated as required use  travelers, but may use U.S. government aircraft for official travel when the  travel complies with specified criteria and when the demands of their  travel prevent the use of commercial aircraft. Similarly, while we  obtained personal security cost data covering 27 organizations\u2014including  the combatant commands, services, and other DOD organizations\u2014DOD  officials told us that the data were likely underreported, and the costs  could not be separated by fiscal year or adjusted for inflation. Further,  DOD officials said that when asked for these data, service officials did not  include consistent information (such as costs associated with  compensation and travel, equipment, weapons, and vehicles of security  personnel) because of the lack of a department-wide definition for  security detail costs. As a result, these cost data were excluded from our  analysis.", "Certain cost data related to enlisted and officer aides were also  unavailable. For example, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps did  not track enlisted and officer aides by name and fiscal year and were  therefore unable to provide complete and accurate aide travel and per  diem cost data. Similarly, the Army and the Navy were unable to provide  enlisted and officer aide population data of sufficient detail\u2014to include  names and duration in aide position\u2014to identify aide housing costs.  Although the Air Force provided detailed aide population data, it did not  track aide housing costs. An official from the Marine Corps told us that  Marine aides were generally receiving a basic housing allowance, with  one enlisted aide residing in the Commandant\u2019s quarters. In the absence  of enlisted and officer aide population data of sufficient consistency and  completeness, we were also unable to estimate the tax expenditure  associated with housing and subsistence allowances provided to aides.", "The availability of enlisted and officer aide cost data was affected by the  extent to which the services defined and tracked aide personnel. DOD  officials told us that there is no department-wide definition for the position  of officer aide, and the Air Force is the only service that has established a  definition. Prior to March 2011, the secretaries of the military  departments were required to provide the Principal Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness biannual reports of  enlisted aide authorizations by military service and by GFO position.", "However, that requirement was rescinded by the Secretary of Defense in  March 2011 as part of DOD\u2019s efficiencies initiatives, and officials from the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness  were not able to provide to us reports covering all of the years prior to the  removal of this requirement. Recognizing the need to improve oversight  of GFO costs, including costs associated with enlisted aides, DOD  officials stated that the department plans to reinstate the biannual  reporting requirement for enlisted aide authorizations in an upcoming  revision to the instruction, but has not established a time frame for  completing the revision. Reinstating this requirement could help DOD to  track the number of enlisted aides, along with certain related costs, such  as compensation. However, the department does not plan to include  officer aide population data in this instruction. Without a similar reporting  requirement for officer aide population data, DOD will not be able to  improve the availability of officer aide costs, such as compensation.", "DOD Instruction 7041.04, Estimating and Comparing the Full Costs of Civilian and  Active Duty Military Manpower and Contract Support, (July 3, 2013). guidance on certain cost elements, such as training; develop business  rules for estimating Reserve and National Guard costs; evaluate inclusion  or non-inclusion of cost elements related to retirement; assess cost  models being used across the department; and reassess sources for  contractor data.

We have placed DOD  on our High-Risk List for financial management beginning in 1995  because of financial management weaknesses that affect its ability to  control costs; ensure accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on  the budget; detect fraud, waste, and abuse; and prepare auditable  financial statements. We have reported that while DOD has made efforts  to improve financial management, it still has much work to do if it is to  meet its long-term goals of improving financial management and  achieving full financial statement auditability.

Per capita costs  represent averages of what it costs DOD to compensate military  personnel across different ranks and services. We reported in March  2012 that the costs of military compensation have grown significantly, in  part because of increases in basic pay and deferred compensation, such  as health care benefits, for which DOD officials anticipate significant  continued growth because of expansions in health care coverage. Such  increases may explain the growth in per capita costs for GFOs, non-GFO  officers, and enlisted personnel. Cost growth specific to the GFOs and  non-GFO officers may also be attributed in part to the growth in each of  these populations, which increased at rates of 8 percent and 10 percent,  respectively.

These costs include  operations, maintenance, utility, lease, and repair costs associated with  DOD-owned and leased properties, as well as certain costs associated  with privatized housing. According to DOD officials, DOD\u2019s housing  privatization initiative contributed to the cost decrease beginning in fiscal  year 2005. DOD policy establishes private sector housing as the  primary source of housing for military personnel within the United  States. However, the lack of suitable available housing in the  community, along with housing requirements for key personnel\u2014such as  GFOs\u2014may require military housing on an installation.

Military officers, including GFOs, are encouraged to enroll in  courses to further their military education. Two of these courses,  CAPSTONE and PINNACLE, are specific to GFOs and are administered  by the National Defense University. These courses are designed to  prepare senior officers of the U.S. armed forces for high-level joint,  interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational responsibilities.  CAPSTONE is a statutorily mandated course for newly selected GFOs  administered over 5 weeks involving travel to domestic and international  locations. The course objective is to make these individuals more  effective in planning and employing U.S. forces in joint and combined  operations. PINNACLE is a 1-week classroom course designed to  prepare GFOs for senior political and military positions and command of  joint and coalition forces at the highest level.

Enlisted aide compensation costs within each of these services  fluctuated from year to year but also increased overall during this period.  This is due in part to fluctuations in the overall number and rank  distribution of enlisted aides within each service. Specifically, during this  period the number of enlisted aides in the Army fluctuated from 70 to 97,  while the number of Air Force enlisted aides ranged from 73 to 88.

As DOD officials continue to manage  implementation of the fiscal year 2013 budget sequester, GFOs and  related support costs are one of the areas in which efficiencies and  reductions are being considered. However, DOD officials have voiced  concern about reductions in this area and the need to retain flexibilities in  staffing GFOs because of additional commands, joint responsibilities, and  the potential to respond to future contingencies. These competing needs  underscore the importance of DOD periodically conducting a  comprehensive update of GFO requirements to efficiently manage the  elite leaders of the military while also providing validation for existing and  emerging needs. Moreover, if DOD had complete information on the costs  of people and resources required to support the GFO corps (such as aide  compensation and travel costs), the department would have an improved  ability to manage these resources. More specific and complete definitions  of GFO- and aide-associated costs would better position DOD to have  more detailed and readily available information on these costs to help  decision makers in DOD and Congress to balance resource priorities in a  fiscally challenging environment.

The intent of the recommendation was to help ensure that  regular updates of GFO requirements are conducted\u2014as the report  notes, DOD last completed a comprehensive update of GFO  requirements in 2003. We believe that DOD can define the circumstances  for updating GFO requirements while retaining the ability to provide  flexibility on future requirements and engagements, for example, by  specifying conditions that may require a change to the frequency or scope  of requirements updates. We continue to believe that fully addressing this  recommendation by defining the circumstances under which periodic  updates should occur would allow the department to efficiently manage  the GFO population while also providing validation for existing and  emerging needs.", "DOD partially concurred with the second, third, and fourth  recommendations to establish guidance to finalize the enlisted aide  population data biannual reporting requirement in the revised DOD  Instruction 1315.09, define the position of officer aide, and require the  military departments to report on officer aide population data. In its  comments, DOD stated that the department concurred with providing  biannual reports on enlisted aides and is taking steps to incorporate a  new requirement for reports in the updated instruction governing the use  of enlisted aides. As noted in the report, DOD has not established a time  frame for completing the revision. DOD also stated that officer aide  assignments are more along the lines of professional development and  staff officer experience, allowing the services flexibility to ensure a broad  scope of professional development in an operational or training  environment. Further, DOD stated that the department will continue to  allow the services to manage officer aides at the local level. However, as  noted in the report, due to the lack of a department-wide definition for  officer aides, the military services were not able to provide consistent data  for these personnel, including cost data. Moreover, the report notes that  the lack of a definition for officer aides is preventing DOD from having  visibility over the costs associated with those personnel, and from  including such costs when calculating the full costs of the GFO  population.

However, DOD  did not concur with the modified recommendation.", "In its comments, DOD stated that the department did not agree with the  recommendation for two reasons. First, DOD stated it already defines the  full manpower costs associated with GFOs in DOD Instruction 7041.04  (Estimating and Comparing the Full Costs of Civilian and Active Duty  Military Manpower and Contract Support). Second, DOD stated that  security details and aides assigned to GFOs are managed by the services  and are included in their personnel costs, and that those billets should not  be included with the costs associated with GFOs. As stated in the report,  certain costs associated with GFOs\u2014such as security details and officer  aides\u2014were unavailable because the cost elements were not defined.  For example, we reported that, according to DOD officials, the military  services do not report security detail costs consistently because without a  department-wide definition such costs could include compensation, travel,  equipment, weapons, and vehicles. Moreover, the Federal Accounting  Standards Advisory Board has noted that a cost methodology should  include any resources directly or indirectly used to perform work, and  GFO\u2019s often rely upon security details and officer aides to carry out their  responsibilities. The report also stated that DOD Instruction 7041.04, and  the accompanying tool developed by CAPE, are intended to collect cost  elements required to estimate the full cost of military and civilian  personnel. In commenting on the draft report, DOD did not address the  issue of using these full costs to estimate and compare personnel costs  and to support workforce allocation decisions, for example, when deciding  whether a function should be performed by civilian or military personnel.  Without a department-wide definition of the costs associated with GFOs\u2014 such as security details, and other relevant costs\u2014the department is  unable to include the full costs of GFOs as specified by DOD Instruction  7041.04 when making workforce allocation decisions.

We identified  criteria in DOD guidance, federal internal control standards, and federal  accounting standards that specify the need for full and reliable manpower  and other cost data for the purpose of making operating decisions and  allocating resources, and assessed the availability of GFO cost data  against those criteria. We defined the GFO-related costs included in our  scope as those costs that were (1) specified in the congressional reports  that mandated our work, (2) consistent with prior GAO work on military  compensation, or (3) determined as GFO-related costs based on  discussions with knowledgeable officials. To determine the extent to  which data on GFO-related costs were available, we categorized each  cost element as \u201ccomplete,\u201d \u201cpartially complete,\u201d or \u201cunavailable\u201d based  on the availability, completeness, and reliability of data provided for fiscal  years 2001 through 2013. Cost data that were determined to be  \u201ccomplete\u201d were readily available for all of the years included in our  review. Cost data that were determined to be \u201cpartially complete\u201d were  either not available or not reliable for all years. \u201cUnavailable\u201d cost data  were either not readily available or were determined to be unreliable  across all of the years included in our review. Specifically, we took the  following steps to obtain, analyze, and assess the reliability of GFO and  aide cost data:  Compensation costs (GFOs, aides, non-GFO officers, and enlisted  personnel)", "We used DOD\u2019s composite standard pay rates to calculate the cost of  compensation provided to active duty GFOs and enlisted and officer  aides from fiscal years 2001 through 2013. The composite rates are used  by DOD when determining the military personnel appropriations cost for  budget and management studies. The rates include average basic pay  plus retired pay accrual; Medicare-eligible retiree health care accrual;  basic allowances for housing and subsistence; incentive, miscellaneous,  and special pays; and permanent change of station expenses. The  composite rates pool these cost elements together, as such trends for  discrete compensation cost elements could not be determined from these  data. Our previous work has recognized that there are multiple ways of  estimating the compensation costs of military personnel depending on the  mix of cash, such as basic pay; noncash benefits, like health care; and  deferred compensation, such as retirement pension. studies have used varying approaches to study military compensation,  certain elements of compensation are commonly incorporated into these  assessments\u2014for example, cash compensation beyond basic pay to  include housing and subsistence allowances, the federal income tax  advantage, and special and incentive pays. We used DOD\u2019s composite  rates to calculate compensation in part because they allowed us to obtain  data specific to the GFO population over the timeframe covered by our  review.", "GAO-10-561R. for officer and enlisted aides across all the services because of the limited  availability of aide population data. We normalized all compensation costs  that we were able to calculate to fiscal year 2013 dollars by using the  employment cost index published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "DOD\u2019s composite rate uses a standard factor to calculate deferred costs  (i.e., pension and retiree health care costs) for all active duty personnel,  which does not account for the significant differences in retirement rates  across ranks that we have previously reported. For example, we reported  in 2005 that an estimated 15 percent of new enlisted personnel and 47  percent of new officers become eligible to receive pensions and retiree  health care. Also, GFOs generally have already completed 20 years of  service at the time of their promotion to the GFO ranks, and as such the  retirement rate of GFOs is closer to 100 percent. Therefore, DOD\u2019s  approach to calculating the composite rate may significantly undercount  the cost of providing retirement benefits to GFOs.", "We also used data supplied by the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness) to estimate the tax expenditure  resulting from a portion of GFO compensation being tax exempt. value of tax-exempt allowances (basic allowance for subsistence, basic  allowance for housing) depends on a servicemember\u2019s pay grade, years  of service, and number of dependents. To estimate the tax expenditure  for each combination of pay grade (within the range of GFO pay grades),  years of service, and number of dependents, we estimated the amount  paid in taxes if the allowances are taxed and if they are not taxed, using  estimates of applicable marginal tax rates supplied by the National  Bureau of Economic Research. A weighted average of the differences in  tax liability was then created based on the proportion of GFOs in each  pay grade, years of service, and number of dependents category.", "The tax expenditure is the tax revenue forgone by the federal government by the policy of  not taxing the basic allowance for housing and the basic allowance for subsistence. reimbursement.in aggregate, by fiscal year, so we were not able to assess trends across  the military services. GFO travel costs prior to fiscal year 2009 were not  available because not all military services transitioned to the Defense  Travel System at the same time and not all legacy data were migrated to  the new system. Aide travel and per diem cost data reported by the Air  Force covered both enlisted and officer aides from fiscal years 2007  through 2013. The Marine Corps reported incomplete aide travel costs for  personnel who were still on active duty that we excluded from our  analysis, while the Army and the Navy did not report aide travel costs.  The travel costs we analyzed were normalized to fiscal year 2013 dollars  using the gross domestic product price index published by the U.S.  Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "GFO cost data from 2009 through 2013 were reported  GFO military/government air travel costs. We requested but did not  obtain costs for GFO travel on military aircraft for fiscal years 2001  through 2013 from the military services, U.S. Transportation Command,  the Defense Logistics Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It  is DOD policy that these data be retained for a period of 2 years, but cost  data were not readily available. Ancillary costs associated with these  flights, such as lodging, were included in our analysis of commercial  travel data.", "GFO housing. We obtained data on the costs of housing units used as  quarters for GFOs from fiscal years 2001 through 2013 from the annual  GFOs\u2019 quarters expenditure reports produced by the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)covering fiscal year 2001 Defense Logistics Agency costs, also provided  by the Comptroller\u2019s office. These costs include operations, maintenance,  utility, lease, and repair costs associated with DOD-owned and leased  properties, as well as certain costs associated with privatized housing.  The housing costs we analyzed were normalized to fiscal year 2013   and a supplementary data set  dollars using the gross domestic product price index published by the  U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "GFO health care. We obtained data on the costs of health care provided  to active duty GFOs and their dependents from fiscal years 2003 through  2013 from the Defense Health Agency. These costs include direct care  (i.e., medical care provided by the U.S. military health care system),  purchased care (i.e., medical care provided by private sector providers in  the networks outside of the military health care system), and pharmacy  costs for both GFOs and their dependents. These data include GFO  health care costs incurred at the Executive Medicine Clinic at Walter  Reed National Military Medical Center and the Executive Services Health  and Wellness Clinic at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. However, while  costs associated with executive medicine are included in the health care  cost data we obtained, executive medicine costs associated with GFOs  could not be separated from costs associated with other individuals  eligible for executive medicine care and are therefore not separately  reported. Cost data were normalized to fiscal year 2013 dollars using the  gross domestic product price index published by the U.S. Department of  Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. We determined that costs prior  to fiscal year 2003 were not reliable because legacy data were not  migrated into the new system when data formats in the Defense  Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System were changed in fiscal year 2003.", "GFO security details. We obtained data on the costs of security details  provided to GFOs from fiscal years 2001 through 2013 from 27 different  DOD organizations, including combatant commands, services, and other  DOD organizations. These data included costs such as pay, travel, and  equipment associated with personnel assigned to protective security  details. Some of the DOD organizations provided fiscal year expenditures  to us, while others reported a total sum of costs over a period covering  several fiscal or calendar years. DOD officials told us that the costs were  likely underreported. As a result, these data were excluded from our  analysis.", "GFO official representation. We obtained complete official  representation costs from the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps for fiscal  years 2008 through 2013. The Army provided cost data from fiscal years  2001 through 2013, but data for certain years were inaccurate and the  data set was therefore deemed unreliable for our purposes. The Navy  also provided cost data from fiscal years 2001 through 2007, but these  data were excluded from our department-wide analysis in order to present  a consistent range of data. Official entertainment and representation cost  data were reported in aggregate by service. As a result, costs attributable  to GFOs could not be separated from those attributable to senior civilian  officials. The cost data were normalized to fiscal year 2013 dollars using  the gross domestic product price index published by the U.S. Department  of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "GFO executive training. We obtained costs for the CAPSTONE and  PINNACLE training courses, which are specific to GFOs and are  administered by the National Defense University. The National Defense  University provided complete cost data for CAPSTONE from fiscal years  2001 through 2013. Cost data for PINNACLE were provided for fiscal  years 2005 through 2013, but data for fiscal years 2005 through 2007  were excluded from our analysis because during this time the National  Defense University combined costs for PINNACLE with another course  (KEYSTONE). As such, we determined that PINNACLE data from fiscal  years 2005 through 2007 were unreliable for our purposes. The cost data  were normalized to fiscal year 2013 dollars using the gross domestic  product price index published by the U.S. Department of Commerce,  Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "To assess the reliability of population and cost data obtained for GFOs  and other active duty personnel\u2014including non-GFO officers, enlisted  personnel, and officer and enlisted aides\u2014we interviewed, corresponded  with, or administered questionnaire(s) to ascertain the process by which  data were compiled and to identify data aggregation, storage, reporting,  and quality control processes. We also independently assessed the  completeness of the data and coordinated with the appropriate officials to  resolve any data anomalies, and reviewed available documentation  describing the processes or system(s) used to house relevant data and to  identify issues material to data reliability. We did not assess all of the  processes used to create or assemble certain data, such as data sets  assembled by DOD officials from multiple sources. We determined that  certain data were not sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our review  based on the presence of significant errors or incompleteness in some or  all of the key data elements, or because using the data might lead to an  incorrect or unintentional message. As discussed above, those data were  excluded from our analyses. We believe the cost and population data that  we did include in this report are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  assessing GFO and other active duty population trends and for  determining the costs associated with GFOs and other active duty  personnel from fiscal years 2001 through 2013.", "In addressing both of our audit objectives, we contacted officials from the  following DOD organizations:", "Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense  and Americas\u2019 Security Affairs", "The Joint Chiefs of Staff, Directorate for Logistics (J-4)", "National Defense University", "Defense Manpower Data Center", "Defense Health Agency", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)", "Defense Logistics Agency", "Defense Travel Management Office", "U.S. Army", "U.S. Navy", "U.S. Marine Corps", "U.S. Air Force  We conducted this performance audit from November 2013 to September  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
