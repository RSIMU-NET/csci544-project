Of this total, 35 transactions were allowed to proceed because the background checks found no prohibiting information, such as felony convictions, illegal immigrant status, or other disqualifying factors. Federal and state procedures--developed and disseminated under the Department of Justice's direction--do not address the specific types of information from valid-match background checks that can or should be provided to federal counterterrorism officials or the sources from which such information can be obtained. Justice officials told GAO that information from the background check system is not to be used for general law enforcement purposes but can be shared with law enforcement agents or other government agencies in the legitimate pursuit of establishing a match between the prospective gun buyer and a terrorist watch list record and in the search for information that could prohibit the firearm transfer. Most state agency personnel GAO contacted were not aware of any restrictions or limitations on providing valid-match information to counterterrorism officials. FBI counterterrorism officials told GAO that routinely receiving all available personal identifying information and other details from valid-match background checks could be useful in conducting investigations. As part of routine audits the FBI conducts every 3 years, the Bureau plans to assess the states' handling of firearm-related background checks involving terrorist watch list records. However, given that these background checks involve known or suspected terrorists who could pose homeland security risks, more frequent FBI oversight or centralized management would help ensure that suspected terrorists who have disqualifying factors do not obtain firearms in violation of the law. The Attorney General and the FBI ultimately are responsible for managing the background check system, although they have yet to assess the states' compliance with applicable procedures for handling terrorism-related checks. Also, more frequent FBI oversight or centralized management would help address other types of issues GAO identified--such as several states' delays in implementing procedures and one state's mishandling of a terrorism-related background check."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Terrorist and criminal watch lists\u2014sometimes referred to as watchout,  lookout, target, or tip-off lists\u2014are important tools for law enforcement  and homeland security purposes.

During the NICS check, descriptive data provided by an  individual\u2014such as name and date of birth\u2014are used to search databases  containing criminal history and other relevant records to determine  whether or not the person is disqualified by law from receiving or  possessing firearms.

Under the Brady Act, before a federally  licensed firearms dealer can transfer a firearm to an unlicensed individual,  the dealer must request a background check through NICS to determine  whether the prospective firearm transfer would violate federal or state  law. The Brady Act\u2019s implementing regulations also provide for  conducting NICS checks on individuals seeking to obtain permits to  possess, acquire, or carry firearms. According to the Department of  Justice, under current law, inclusion on a terrorist watch list is not a stand- alone factor that would prohibit a person from receiving or possessing a  firearm. Thus, if no other federal or state prohibitors exist, a known or  suspected terrorist can legally purchase firearms.", "Approximately 8.5 million background checks are run through NICS each  year, of which about one-half are processed by the FBI\u2019s NICS Section and  one-half by designated state and local criminal justice agencies. Under  federal and state requirements, prospective firearms purchasers must  provide information that is needed to initiate a NICS background check.  For example, in order to receive a firearm from a licensed dealer, federal  regulations require an individual to complete a Firearms Transaction  Record (ATF Form 4473). Among other things, this form requires  prospective purchasers to provide the following descriptive data: name,  residence address, place of birth, height and weight, sex, date of birth,  race, state of residence, country of citizenship, and alien registration  number (for non-U.S. citizens). A Social Security number is optional.  Firearms dealers use the Form 4473 to record information about the  firearms transaction, including the type of firearm(s) to be transferred  (e.g., handgun or long gun); the response provided by the FBI\u2019s NICS  Section or state agency (e.g., proceed or denied); and information  specifically identifying each firearm to be transferred (e.g., manufacturer,  model, and serial number), which shows whether the transaction involves  the purchase of multiple firearms. Individuals applying for state permits to  possess, acquire, or carry firearms also are required to provide personal  descriptive data on a state permit application. State laws vary in regard to  the types of information required from permit applicants.", "The purpose of the NICS background check is to search for the existence  of a prohibitor that would disqualify a potential buyer from purchasing a  firearm pursuant to federal or state law. During the NICS check,  descriptive data provided by an individual\u2014such as name and date of  birth\u2014are used to search databases containing criminal history and other  records supplied by federal, state, and local agencies. One of the  databases searched by NICS is the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information  Center database, which contains criminal justice information (e.g., names  of persons who have outstanding warrants) and also includes records on  persons identified as known or suspected members of terrorist  organizations. The terrorist-related records are maintained in the National  Crime Information Center\u2019s Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File  (VGTOF), which was designed to provide law enforcement personnel with  the means to exchange information on members of violent gangs and  terrorist organizations.", "Although NICS checks have included searches of terrorist records in  VGTOF, NICS personnel at the FBI and state agencies historically did not  receive notice when there were hits on these records. The FBI blocked the  VGTOF responses (i.e., the responses were not provided to NICS  personnel) under the reasoning that VGTOF records contain no  information that would legally prohibit the transfer of a firearm under  federal or state law. However, in November 2002, the FBI began an audit  of NICS transactions where information indicated the individual was an  alien, including transactions involving VGTOF records. In one instance  involving a VGTOF record, the audit revealed that an FBI field agent had  knowledge of prohibiting information not yet entered into the automated  databases checked by NICS. As a result, in November 2003, the  Department of Justice\u2014citing Brady Act authorities\u2014directed the FBI to  revise NICS procedures to better ensure that subjects of VGTOF records  who have disqualifying factors do not receive firearms in violation of  applicable federal or state law. Specifically, the Brady Act authority cited  allows the FBI up to 3 business days to check for information  demonstrating that a prospective buyer is prohibited by law from  possessing or receiving a firearm.", "Under revised procedures effective February 3, 2004, FBI and state  personnel who handle NICS transactions began receiving notice of  transactions that hit on VGTOF records. Also, under the revised  procedures, all NICS transactions with potential or valid matches to  VGTOF records are automatically delayed to give NICS personnel the  chance to further research the transaction before a response (e.g., proceed  or denied) is given to the initiator of the background check. For all  potential or valid matches with terrorist records in VGTOF, NICS  personnel are to begin their research by contacting the Terrorist Screening  Center (TSC) to verify that the subject of the NICS transaction matches  the subject of the VGTOF record, based on the name and other  descriptors. For confirmed matches, NICS personnel are to determine  whether federal counterterrorism officials (e.g., FBI field agents) are  aware of any information that would prohibit the individual by law from  receiving or possessing a firearm. For example, FBI field agents could  have information not yet posted to databases checked by NICS showing  the person is an alien illegally or unlawfully in the United States. If  counterterrorism officials do not provide any prohibiting information, and  there are no other records in the databases checked by NICS showing the  individual to be prohibited, NICS personnel are to advise the initiator of  the background check that the transaction may proceed.

TSC data also showed that state agency staff did not consistently  share the specific location or phone number of the gun dealer. TSC  officials told us they basically can identify the date and time of a firearm  transaction because TSC records the date and time NICS staff call TSC,  which occurs very shortly after the gun dealer initiates the NICS check.
