The program remains at high  risk today.  In fiscal year 2001, Medicare outlays totaled over $219 billion,  and the HHS/OIG reported that $12.1 billion in fiscal year 2001 Medicare  fee-for-service payments did not comply with Medicare laws and  regulations.  The Congress enacted HIPAA, in part, to respond to the  problem of health care fraud and abuse.  HIPAA consolidated and  strengthened ongoing efforts to combat fraud and abuse in health programs  and provided new criminal enforcement tools as well as expanded  resources for fighting health care fraud, including $158 million in fiscal year  2000 and $182 million in fiscal year 2001.", "Under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of HHS  (acting through the HHS/OIG), the HCFAC program goals are as follows:  coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement efforts to control  fraud and abuse associated with health plans;  conduct investigations, audits, and other studies of delivery and  payment for health care for the United States;  facilitate the enforcement of the civil, criminal, and administrative  statutes applicable to health care;  provide guidance to the health care industry, including the issuance of  advisory opinions, safe harbor notices, and special fraud alerts; and  establish a national database of adverse actions against health care  providers.", "Funds for the HCFAC program are appropriated from the trust fund to an  expenditure account, referred to as the Health Care Fraud and Abuse  Control Account, maintained within the trust fund.  The Attorney General  and the Secretary of HHS jointly certify that the funds transferred to the  control account are necessary to finance health care anti\u2013fraud and abuse  activities, subject to limits for each fiscal year as specified by HIPAA.   HIPAA authorizes annual minimum and maximum amounts earmarked for  HHS/OIG activities for the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  For example,  of the $182 million available in fiscal year 2001, a minimum of $120 million  and a maximum of $130 million were earmarked for the HHS/OIG.  By  earmarking funds specifically for the HHS/OIG, the Congress ensured  continued efforts by the HHS/OIG to detect and prevent fraud and abuse in  the Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "CMS performs the accounting for the control account, from which all  HCFAC expenditures are made.  CMS sets up allotments in its accounting  system for each of the HHS and DOJ entities receiving HCFAC funds.  The  HHS and DOJ entities account for their HCFAC obligations and  expenditures in their respective accounting systems and report them to  CMS monthly.  CMS then records the obligations and expenditures against  the appropriate allotments in its accounting system.", "At DOJ, payroll constituted 78 percent of its total expenditures in fiscal  year 2000 and 69 percent in fiscal year 2001.  Within DOJ, the Executive  Office for the United States Attorneys (EOUSA) receives the largest  allotment of HCFAC funds.  In EOUSA, each district is allocated a  predetermined number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions based on  the historical workload of the district.  Specific personnel who ordinarily  work on health care activities, such as the Health Care Fraud Coordinator,  are designated within the DOJ accounting system to have their payroll  costs charged to the HCFAC account.  In some districts, one FTE could be  shared among several individuals, each contributing a portion of time to  HCFAC assignments.  EOUSA staff track the portion of time devoted to  health care activity and other types of cases and investigations in the  Monthly Resource Summary System on a daily or monthly basis.  DOJ  monitors summary information from the Monthly Resource Summary  System to determine how staff members\u2019 time is being used.", "The HHS/OIG expenditures represented over 96 percent of HHS\u2019s total  HCFAC expenditures in fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  At HHS/OIG, HCFAC  expenditures are allocated based on relative proportions of the HCFAC  budget authority and the discretionary funding sources.  Table 1 below  identifies the relative percentages HHS/OIG used in fiscal years 2000 and  2001.", "HHS/OIG uses these percentages to compute the amounts of payroll and  nonpayroll expenditures to be charged to their two funding sources.   HHS/OIG tracks staff time spent on various assignments in separate  management information systems (MIS).  The information in the MIS is  summarized and monitored quarterly to adjust the type of work planned  and performed, if necessary, so that the use of the funds is consistent with  the funding sources\u2019 intended use.", "HIPAA also requires that amounts equal to the following types of  collections be deposited into the trust fund:  criminal fines recovered in cases involving a federal health care offense,  including collections pursuant to section 1347 of Title 18, United States  Code;  civil monetary penalties and assessments imposed in health care fraud   amounts resulting from the forfeiture of property by reason of a federal  health care offense, including collections under section 982(a)(7) of  Title 18, United States Code;   penalties and damages obtained and otherwise creditable to  miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury\u2019s general fund obtained under  the False Claims Act (sections 3729 through 3733 of Title 31, United  States Code), in cases involving claims related to the provision of health  care items and services (other than funds awarded to a relator, for  restitution, or otherwise authorized by law); and   unconditional gifts and bequests.", "Criminal fines resulting from health care fraud cases are collected through  the Clerks of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.   Criminal fines collections are reported to DOJ\u2019s Financial Litigation Unit  associated with their districts.  Based on cash receipt documentation  received from the Clerks, the Financial Litigation Units then post the  criminal fines collection to a database.  The database generates at least a  biannual report of the amount of criminal fines collected, which is sent to  the Department of the Treasury.  Treasury relies on this report to determine  the amount to deposit to the trust fund.  Civil monetary penalties for  federal health care offenses are imposed by CMS regional offices or the  HHS/OIG against skilled nursing facilities or long-term care facilities and  doctors.  CMS collects civil monetary penalty amounts and reports them to  the Department of the Treasury for deposit to the trust fund.  Penalties and  multiple damages resulting from health care fraud cases are collected by  DOJ\u2019s Civil Division in Washington, D.C., and by Financial Litigation Units  in the United States Attorneys\u2019 offices located throughout the country.  The  Civil Division and United States Attorneys\u2019 offices report collection  information to DOJ\u2019s Debt Accounting Operations Group, which reports  the amount of penalties and multiple damages to the Department of the  Treasury for deposit to the trust fund.

The HHS/OIG reported that  HCFAC funding allowed it to open 14 new investigative offices and increase  its staff levels by 61 during fiscal year 2000, with the result that OIG is  closer to its goal of extending its investigative and audit staff to cover all  geographical areas in the country.", "As shown in figures 2 and 3, we also found that DOJ and other HHS  organizations requested and were granted $38.9 million in fiscal year 2000  and $51.9 million in fiscal year 2001.

However, HIPAA does restrict the HHS/OIG\u2019s  use of HCFAC funds to Medicare and Medicaid programs.  According to  HHS/OIG officials, they use HCFAC funds only for audits, evaluations, or  investigations related to Medicare and Medicaid.  The officials also stated  that while some activities may be limited to either Medicare or Medicaid,  most activities are generally related to both programs.  Because HIPAA  does not preclude the HHS/OIG from using HCFAC funds for Medicaid  efforts, HHS/OIG officials have stated they do not believe it is necessary or  beneficial to account for such expenditures separately.", "Similarly, DOJ officials told us that it is not practical or beneficial to  account separately for non-Medicare expenditures because of the nature of  health care fraud cases.  HIPAA permits DOJ to use HCFAC funds for  health care fraud activities involving other health programs.  According to  DOJ officials, health care fraud cases usually involve several health care  programs, including Medicare and health care programs administered by  other federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the  Department of Defense, and the Office of Personnel Management.   Consequently, it is difficult to allocate personnel costs and other litigation  expenses to specific parties in health care fraud cases.  Also, according to  DOJ officials, even if Medicare is not a party in a health care fraud case, the  case may provide valuable experience in health care fraud matters,  allowing auditors, investigators, and attorneys to become more effective in  their efforts to combat Medicare fraud.  Since there is no requirement to do  so, HHS and DOJ continue to assert that they do not plan to identify these  expenditures in the future.  Nonetheless, attributing HCFAC activity costs  to particular programs would be helpful information for the Congress and  other decision makers to use in determining how to allocate federal  resources, authorize and modify programs, and evaluate program  performance.   The Congress also saw value in having this information  when it tasked us with reporting expenditures for HCFAC activities not  related to Medicare.  We believe that there is intrinsic value in having this  information.  For example, HCFAC managers face decisions involving  alternative actions, such as whether to pursue certain cases.  Making these  decisions should include a cost awareness along with other available  information to assess the case potential.

As we  discussed in the report, DOJ indicated it had already taken action to  address our recommendations by correcting the programming error to  address future amounts reported for criminal fines.  DOJ also stated that an  effort is currently under way to research the impact of the programming  error and plans to determine what, if any, adjustments or offsets are needed  to correct amounts previously reported to the Department of the Treasury.   DOJ indicated that it had already discovered and fixed the programming  error prior to our review.  However, as we reported, DOJ was not aware of  the errors we identified, nor did it call our attention to the possibility of  errors occurring due to this programming problem.  In addition, DOJ  acknowledged in its comments that errors have occurred in the recording  of valid HCFAC expenditure transactions and stated that corrections have  been made to address our related recommendation.", "Additionally, DOJ incorrectly interpreted our statement that the problems  identified in our review could impede its ability to account for growing  HCFAC expenditures.  In its comments, DOJ construed this to mean that  we concluded that program managers lack timely access to financial  reports or supporting transactions.  That was not our intent nor the focus  of our review.  As stated in our report, the problems we encountered  indicate that additional emphasis should be placed on DOJ\u2019s financial  management policies and procedures to minimize errors in recording  HCFAC transactions.  DOJ did state that it will continue its standing  practice of continually educating its staff and reinforcing its financial  management policies and procedures to minimize errors in recording  HCFAC and all other transactions within DOJ.  However, based on our  findings, this standing practice needs modification in order to bolster its  effectiveness.  DOJ also stated that our reference to the findings for  departmental systems as cited in the Audit Report: U.S. Department of  Justice Annual Financial Statement Fiscal Year 2001, Report No. 02-06,  was inapplicable.  To address DOJ\u2019s concerns, we clarified the report to cite  problems that its financial statement auditors found at entities within DOJ  that process HCFAC transactions.", "Finally, regarding our recommendation to both HHS and DOJ to assess the  feasibility of tracking cost savings and expenditures attributable to HCFAC  activities by the various federal programs affected, HHS/OIG stated in its  written comments that it had previously considered alternatives that would  allow it to track and attribute cost savings and expenditures but had  identified obstacles to doing so.  At the same time, HHS/OIG agreed with  our recommendation to perform an assessment of tracking cost savings  and expenditures by program, which is critical to developing effective  performance measures.  However, DOJ stated that it is neither practical nor  beneficial to track cost savings or non-Medicare expenditures associated  with HCFAC enforcement activities.  Without capturing such information,  the Congress and other decision makers do not have the ability to fully  assess the effectiveness of the HCFAC program.  Therefore, we continue to  believe that, at a minimum, DOJ should study this further, as HHS has  agreed to do.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of HHS, the Attorney  General, and other interested parties.  Copies will be made available to  others on request.  In addition, the report will be available at no charge on  the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

We obtained and recomputed  supporting documentation from various sources depending on the type  of collection/deposit.  We traced amounts reported on the supporting  documentation to reports and other records to confirm that proper  amounts were appropriately reported.  To perform these tests, we did  the following:  Drew dollar unit samples of 60 items from a population of 626  penalties and multiple damages (PMD), totaling $454,615,907, from  an electronic database for CMS PMDs and from the FMIS Dept  Management Transfer of Funds from the U.S. Department of  Justice Via OPAC Report for DOJ PMDs for fiscal year 2001, and 60  items from a population of 479 penalties and multiple damages,  totaling $147,268,092, from an electronic database for CMS PMDs and  from the FMIS Dept Management Detail Report for DOJ PMDs for  fiscal year 2000.", "Drew dollar unit samples of 58 items from a population of 179  criminal fines, totaling $2,894,234, from the Criminal Fines Report  for fiscal year 2001, and 58 items from a population of 178 criminal  fines totaling $57,209,390 from the Criminal Fines Report for fiscal  year 2000.", "Drew dollar unit samples of 29 items from a population of 2,381 civil  monetary penalties, totaling $6,060,481, from an electronic database  for fiscal year 2001, and 57 items from a population of 1,221 civil  monetary penalties, totaling $5,220,177, from an electronic database  for fiscal year 2000.", "Reviewed the entire population of four gifts and bequests, totaling  $5,501, for fiscal year 2001.  We obtained and analyzed supporting  documentation including the letters and checks retained at CMS.   There were no gifts and bequests reported for fiscal year 2000,  therefore none were tested.", "To accomplish our second objective, identifying and assessing the  propriety of amounts reported in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 as  appropriations from the trust fund for HCFAC activities, we did the  following:  Obtained the funding decision memorandum and reallocation  documents to verify the HCFAC funds certified by HHS and DOJ  officials.", "Analyzed the reasons for requesting HCFAC funds to determine that  amounts appropriated from the trust fund met the purposes stated in  HIPAA to, among other things, coordinate federal, state, and local law  enforcement efforts; conduct investigations, audits, and studies related  to health care; and provide guidance to the health care industry  regarding fraudulent practices.", "Compared allocations amount reported in the joint HCFAC reports to  the approved funding decision memorandum and reallocation  documents to verify the accuracy of amounts reported.", "To accomplish our third objective, identifying and assessing the propriety  of amounts for HCFAC expenditures at DOJ for fiscal years 2000 and 2001,  we obtained DOJ\u2019s internal financial report, the Expenditure and Allotment  Report, EA101, which detailed total expenditure data for each component  by subobject class for fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001.  To test our  population, we further requested that DOJ provide us with a complete  detailed population of transactions to support the summary totals on the  internal financial report.  Because the data were not provided to us on time,  nor were they fully reconciled, we could not statistically select a sample  and project the results to the population as a whole.  We modified our  methodology and nonstatistically selected 19 transactions, totaling  $2,695,211 in fiscal year 2000, and 38 transactions, totalling $1,362,579 in  fiscal year 2001, from DOJ focusing on large dollar amounts, unusual items,  and other transactions, which would enhance our understanding of the  expenditure process.  To determine whether these transactions were  properly classified as HCFAC transactions, we interviewed DOJ officials to  obtain an understanding of the source and processing of transactions and  reviewed, analyzed, and recomputed supporting documentation, such as  purchase orders, invoices, and receipts, to determine the propriety of the  expenditures.", "We performed analytical procedures and tested DOJ payroll on the largest  component, EOUSA offices. To assess the reasonableness of payroll  expenses, we performed a high-level analytical review.  To enhance our  understanding of how personnel record their work activity in the Monthly  Resource Summary System, we nonstatistically selected 20 individuals  from 10 districts for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  We interviewed these  individuals on their method for charging time to the HCFAC program for  fiscal year 2000 and 2001 and to verify whether time charged to the Monthly  Resource Summary System was accurate. In the interview, employees were  asked whether the time that was recorded in the system was accurate and  how and where they received guidance on charging of time.", "To accomplish our fourth objective, identifying and assessing the propriety  of amounts for HCFAC expenditures at HHS for fiscal years 2000 and 2001,  we  obtained internal reports generated from the agency\u2019s accounting  system to identify HCFAC expenditure amounts,  obtained detailed records to support HHS payroll and nonpayroll   tested selected payroll and nonpayroll transactions to determine  whether they were accurately reported.", "To evaluate payroll charges to the HCFAC appropriation by HHS/OIG  employees during fiscal years 2000 and 2001, we performed analytical  procedures.  We analyzed the methodology used by the HHS/OIG to verify  that expenditures were within the predetermined allocation percentages  for HCFAC and non-HCFAC expenditures.", "We also reviewed 10 HHS/OIG employee time charges for fiscal years 2000  and 2001.  The selected employees were interviewed regarding their time  charges for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  In the interview, employees were  asked to verify the time that was recorded by the department\u2019s  management information systems or timecards.  We also inquired as to how  and where employees received guidance on charging their time and  whether they understood the various funding sources used to support OIG  activities.  We verified that the pay rate listed on the employees Standard  Form 50 Notification of Personnel Action was the same as the amount  charged to the Department of Health and Human Services Regional Core  Accounting System Data Flowback Name List (CORE - Central Accounting  System).  We verified that the summary hours as recorded in the U.S.  Department of Health & Human Services Employee Data Report (TAIMS -  Time and Attendance application) traced to the management information  system or time and attendance records.  We interviewed the employees to  verify that the time charged to the management information system or time  and attendance records were accurate.", "We drew dollar unit samples of 44 items from a population of 36,380  nonpayroll expenditures, totaling $34,156,369, from HHS\u2019s internal  accounting records for fiscal year 2001, and 39 items from a population of  27,884 nonpayroll expenditures, totaling $32,914,328, for fiscal year 2000.   To assess the propriety of these transactions, we obtained supporting  documentation such as invoices, purchase orders, and receipts.  We  recomputed the documentation as appropriate to the transaction.", "We were unable to accomplish our fifth objective, to identify and assess the  propriety of amounts reported as fiscal years 2000 and 2001 expenditures  for non-Medicare anti\u2013fraud and abuse activities, because HHS/OIG and  DOJ do not separately account for or monitor such expenditures.  Even  though HIPAA requires that we report on expenditures related to non- Medicare activities, it does not specifically require HHS or DOJ to  separately track Medicare and non-Medicare expenditures.", "To accomplish our sixth objective, to identify and assess the propriety of  amounts reported as savings to the trust fund, we  obtained the fiscal years 2000 and 2001 HHS/OIG semiannual reports to  identify cost savings as reported in the joint reports and   tested selected cost saving transactions to determine whether the  amounts were substantiated.", "We were unable to attribute the reported cost savings to HCFAC  expenditures as well as identify any other savings from the trust fund  because, according to DOJ and HHS officials, any savings resulting from  health care anti\u2013fraud and abuse activities funded by the HCFAC program  in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 will likely not be realized until subsequent  years.", "We interviewed and obtained documentation from officials at CMS in  Baltimore, Maryland; HHS headquarters\u2013AOA, ASBTF, OIG and the OGC\u2013in  Washington, D.C.; HHS\u2019s Program Support Center in Rockville, Maryland;  and DOJ\u2019s Justice Management Division, EOUSA, Criminal Division, Civil  Division, and Civil Rights Division in Washington, D.C.", "We conducted our work in two phases, from April 2001 through June 2001  focusing primarily on fiscal year 2000 HCFAC activity, and from October  2001 through April 2002 focusing primarily on fiscal year 2001 HCFAC  activity, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
