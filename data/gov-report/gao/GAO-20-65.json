However, DFAS, DISA, and DLA have not provided transparent pricing to the military departments, which are their largest customers. Each agency annually develops budget proposals designed to recover projected costs and account for gains or losses from prior years. DFAS, DISA, and DLA have taken steps intended to establish an equitable pricing methodology. For example, DLA changed its pricing method for distribution services to align the rates customers pay with DLA's costs of providing the service. However, customers from the military departments said they lack visibility into the factors that determine their overall costs at one or more of the three defense agencies, including how indirect costs are allocated and included in the rates they are charged. GAO's review of cost and rate documentation provided to the military departments also found that they provide high-level information, such as the rates and estimated workloads, and did not include details about the types of costs included or how they are calculated. Specifically,", "(1) DFAS informational briefings do not describe the types of costs included in rates and how those costs are calculated and allocated. As a result, customers from the Army and Navy said they were confused about why declines in their use of DFAS's services have not resulted in reduced costs.", "(2) DISA does not include in its documentation the methodology it uses to calculate its rates, making it difficult for officials from the Air Force to determine how they can manage their costs with DISA.", "(3) DLA does not provide detailed information on the costs included in its rates, making it difficult for customers from the Navy and Air Force to determine how to lower their costs or, in the case of the Air Force, understand the cost implications of DLA's newly announced pricing initiative.", "Because DFAS, DISA, and DLA share only high-level information on their rate-setting methodologies, the military departments have been limited in their abilities to understand and manage the costs they pay for the services they obtain. By providing more complete information on rate setting, including the calculation and use of costs, DFAS , DISA , and DLA could help their customers better manage their costs and make more informed budgeting decisions. Improved transparency could also help customers anticipate how potential changes to the assumptions underlying rates could affect future costs.", "GAO also found that DFAS, DISA, and DLA clearly delineate roles and responsibilities, measure performance, and assess resource requirements and customer needs for goods and services, as called for by the three remaining key operating principles for effective working capital fund management.

The provision of shared services may be funded through direct  appropriations or through an intragovernmental revolving fund, such as a  working capital fund. Working capital funds operate as a self-supporting  entity that conducts a regular cycle of businesslike activities, and they are  intended to create incentives for customers and managers to control  costs.", "To control and account more effectively for the cost of programs and work  performed, the Secretary of Defense may establish working capital funds  to finance inventories of designated supplies and provide working capital  for industrial- and commercial-type activities that provide common  services within or among DOD components. The Defense-Wide Working  Capital Fund (DWWCF) satisfies recurring requirements for finance and  accounting services, management of parts and supplies, inventory and  fuel provision, information technology services, and other services  needed by DOD organizations. The DWWCF finances the activities of  the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the Defense  Information Systems Agency (DISA), and the Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA) (hereafter referred to collectively as the DWWCF agencies), which  provide goods and services to customers that include the military  departments, defense agencies and organizations, and non-DOD federal  agencies, among others.

We met with officials from these DWWCF agencies and the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and obtained  documentation outlining the agencies\u2019 rate-setting methodologies and the  types of costs that each agency charges to customers. We also met with  officials from six offices within the three military departments to obtain the  perspectives of the military departments as the three largest customers of  the DWWCF agencies.

Each of the  four key operating principles has three underlying components describing  specific actions agencies should take to adhere to the principle. Our  analysis focused on comparing the rate-setting processes of the three  DWWCF agencies against the key operating principle of self-sufficiency  rather than on assessing the results of those processes. Therefore,  although the components of this principle include the recovery of actual  costs and transparent and equitable pricing, we did not independently  verify whether the processes resulted in the recovery of actual costs or in  the equitable allocation of costs among customers.", "For our second objective, we obtained documentation from DFAS, DISA,  and DLA on their management practices and discussed the information  with knowledgeable agency officials and, where customers\u2019 perspectives  were needed, officials from the same offices in the military departments  we met with for our first objective.

Activities of the  DWWCF agencies operate on a break-even basis. As part of the annual  budget submission for each upcoming fiscal year, rates are required to be  established at levels estimated to recover the budgeted costs of goods  and services, including all general and administrative overhead costs,  prior period gains and losses, and applicable surcharges. Predetermined  or \u201cstabilized\u201d rates developed during the budget process are applied to  orders received from DWWCF customers during the fiscal year. The  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is responsible for  reviewing, coordinating, and publishing reimbursable rates for DOD.

In fiscal year 2018, the  reported total dollar value of goods and services ordered from DFAS,  DISA, and DLA was approximately $49.4 billion, with the military  departments collectively ordering about $36.3 billion (or 74 percent of the  total dollar value of orders in fiscal year 2018) in goods and services.  Most of the goods and services they purchased fell under two activity  groups\u2014supply chain management and energy management.  Specifically, approximately $29.4 billion (60 percent of the total dollar  value of orders in fiscal year 2018) were for supply chain management  and approximately $10.8 billion (22 percent of the total dollar value of  orders in fiscal year 2018) were for energy management, as shown in  figure 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operating Budgets and Cash Balance Requirements for DWWCF Activities", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, Annual Operating Budgets are  issued for each DWWCF activity group managed by DFAS, DISA, and  DLA.

In addition, each DWWCF agency is responsible  for maintaining positive cash balances sufficient to allow their operations  to continue uninterrupted. As of the end of fiscal year 2017, the DWWCF  as a whole held a reported cash balance of about $3.0 billion, which  decreased to $2.6 billion by the end of fiscal year 2018. According to  DWWCF agency officials, it can be challenging to maintain an appropriate  cash balance within the DWWCF because setting accurate rates that  reflect their agencies\u2019 actual costs is difficult. If rates are set too low  during the budget formulation process, higher-than-expected costs or  lower-than-expected sales of goods or services during the fiscal year may  result in losses for the DWWCF, which in turn may lead to insufficient  balances to meet the minimum current or future financing operational  requirements. Similarly, if rates are set too high, lower-than-expected  costs or higher-than-expected customer sales during the fiscal year may  generate excessive gains for the DWWCF. Excessive gains may be  transferred out of the DWWCF into other appropriation accounts or  rescinded by Congress.", "In 2017, we described the DWWCF\u2019s reported monthly cash balances  and the extent to which they fell within targeted upper and lower cash  requirements. We found that the DWWCF\u2019s reported monthly cash  balances were outside the targeted upper and lower cash requirements  for 87 of 120 months during that time frame. This was caused by DLA  charging its customers more or less than it cost to purchase, refine,  transport, and store fuel and by DOD transferring funds into or out of the  DWWCF to pay for combat fuel losses or other higher priorities, among  other things. As we noted in our report, DOD revised its cash  management policy to require a positive cash balance throughout the  year and an adequate ending balance to support continuing operations  into the subsequent year. According to this revised policy, in setting the  cash requirement goals, DOD working capital funds are to consider four  elements: (1) the rate of disbursement, which is the average amount  disbursed between collection cycles; (2) the range of operation, or the  difference between the highest and lowest expected cash levels based on  budget assumptions and past experience; (3) risk mitigation, which  requires some amount of cash beyond the range of operations to mitigate  the inherent risk of unplanned and uncontrollable events; and (4)  reserves, which are cash amounts held for known future requirements.", "DOD officials said they are in the process of adding additional guidance  to the DOD Financial Management Regulation about when DOD  managers should use available tools to help ensure that monthly cash  balances are within the targeted upper and lower cash requirements, as  we recommended in our 2017 report. For this report, we updated the  2017 analysis to include the DWWCF\u2019s reported monthly cash balances  and targeted upper and lower cash requirements for fiscal years 2017  and 2018, as shown in figure 3. For fiscal year 2017, the monthly cash  balances were above and below the targeted upper and lower cash  requirements one time each, and for fiscal year 2018 the targeted upper  cash requirement was raised and the monthly cash balances were all  within the revised targeted upper and lower cash requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Operating Principles for Effective Management of Working Capital Funds", "paragraphs": ["In our prior work, we identified four key operating principles to guide the  management of working capital funds.

All three agencies  include direct and indirect costs in their rates, and these costs vary due to  differences in the agencies\u2019 missions, including the goods and services  they provide. In general, the DWWCF agencies describe direct costs as  those costs that can be directly attributed to an output and a customer.  For example, DFAS officials told us that DFAS includes the cost of the  labor that supports civilian pay services for a customer as a direct cost.  DISA officials said that DISA includes the cost of servers as a direct cost.  DLA officials indicated that materiel costs, such as the cost to acquire fuel  or a spare part, are considered direct costs. Alternately, the three  agencies describe indirect costs as costs that cannot be attributed to one  specific output and customer. For example, costs for information  technology systems that support multiple customers, supervisory staff  that support more than one customer, and general and administrative  (overhead) costs such as a DWWCF agency\u2019s general counsel services  or physical facility maintenance are all indirect costs.", "DFAS, DISA, and DLA set rates during DOD\u2019s annual programming and  budget development process. The three DWWCF agencies begin the  process of setting rates approximately 18 months prior to the fiscal year in  which the rates will be applied.

The Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) reviews and approves finalized rates for a  particular fiscal year in a rate memo circulated during the prior fiscal year.  DFAS, DISA, and DLA use a combination of the following three  approaches when setting the rates. Table 2 shows instances in which each of the three DWWCF agencies use the following rate-setting  approaches.", "Per Unit: Determines a specific dollar rate per unit that, when  multiplied by the projected workload, will produce revenue sufficient to  recover the full costs, including direct and indirect costs, of providing  the good or service.", "Portion of Total Costs: Charges a portion of the agency\u2019s total costs  (both direct and indirect costs) of providing a service based either on  the proportion of total workload projected for a specific customer or a  uniform percentage across all customers.", "Percentage Markup on Direct Costs: Adds a fee based on a  percentage of the direct costs of a service as a proxy for expected  indirect costs.", "DFAS, DISA, and DLA officials described their approaches to allocating  costs when setting rates. DFAS allocates costs to each of the services it  provides and to each customer using those services through 29  predetermined business rules. DISA groups its services by the costs  associated with providing them and allocates these costs to the services  in each group based on factors such as the cost of equipment used to  provide each service. Similarly, DLA uses various methods to allocate  indirect costs to some or all of DLA\u2019s goods or services based on factors  such as the number of employees supporting the provision of a given  good or service and the total sales of that good or service.

Previously, the costs for each DFAS facility were  charged directly to the customers whose work was performed in that  facility. Since the costs of facilities differ and customers do not choose  the location that provides their service, DFAS changed this  methodology so that customers now pay a uniform percentage of their  direct costs to cover the total cost of DFAS facilities.", "DISA, for fiscal year 2017, changed the pricing structure for Defense  Information System Network Infrastructure Services in response to  recommendations from two DOD internal reviews. The structure  changed from one designed to encourage adoption of the network  across DOD to a consumption-based model that aligns customer  billing with consumption so that customers have greater control over  their costs. According to DISA officials, this change has enhanced  collaboration between DISA and its customers, providing customers  more frequent inventories of the services they require so that the  customers can determine that the bills for those services reflect their  requirements.", "DLA is implementing two changes to the pricing methodology it uses  for distribution services, part of its Supply Chain Management activity  group. The first change, which DLA refers to as distribution price  equitability, was implemented during fiscal year 2017. This pricing  methodology allocates overhead costs to reimbursable distribution  services (special services not included in DLA\u2019s standard rate  structure). Previously, only rate-driven distribution services were  charged for overhead. DLA proposed the second change, market  basket pricing, for implementation in fiscal year 2020. Market basket  pricing changes this pricing from being based solely on the weight of  the items being distributed to a method that considers the level of  effort required by DLA to distribute the items. For example, bulky,  fragile, and hazardous items will be charged higher rates than small,  easy-to-ship items.", "While we found that DFAS, DISA, and DLA have taken steps intended to  establish an equitable pricing methodology, military department officials  from the offices we contacted said that they lack visibility into the factors  that determine their costs at one or more of the three defense agencies.

They also said this lack of information prevents them from determining  whether the rates they pay actually reflect the costs of the services  they use, as intended. Similarly, the Air Force officials told us that  DLA\u2019s communication regarding its market basket pricing initiative,  discussed during the DLA briefings, was confusing and did not include  all the information they needed to prepare their budget, such as when  the change would be implemented and how the initiative would affect  the Air Force\u2019s costs. Officials noted that, despite initially being told by  DLA that the Air Force would experience a reduction in its distribution  costs as a result of this initiative, they subsequently learned through a  Resource Management Decision that the Air Force\u2019s costs would  increase instead.", "DFAS, DISA, and DLA officials told us they make efforts to communicate  with their customers and to improve the transparency of their rates. For  example, DFAS officials noted that they have one-on-one discussions  with each of their customers during the customer rate briefings.
