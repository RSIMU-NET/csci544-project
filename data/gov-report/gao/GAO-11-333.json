For those in a pension plan, there is concern that these incentives accrue primarily to higher income employees and do relatively little to help lower income workers save for retirement. The financial crisis and labor-market downturn may have exacerbated these difficulties. Therefore, we examined (1) recent trends in new private pension plan formation, (2) the characteristics of defined contribution plan participants contributing at or above statutory limits, (3) how suggested options to modify an existing credit for low-income workers might affect their retirement income, and (4) the long-term effects of the recent financial crisis on retirement savings. To answer these questions, GAO reviewed reports, federal regulations, and laws, and interviewed academics, agency officials, and other relevant experts. We also analyzed Department of Labor and 2007 Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) data, and used a microsimulation model to assess effects of modifying tax incentives for low-income workers. We incorporated technical comments from the departments of Labor and Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Net new plan formation in recent years has been very small, with the total number of single employer private pension plans increasing about 1 percent from about 697,000 in 2003 to 705,000 in 2007. Although employers created almost 180,000 plans over this period, this formation was largely offset by plan terminations or mergers. About 92 percent of newly formed plans were defined contribution (DC) plans, with the rest being defined benefit (DB) plans. New plans were generally small, with about 96 percent having fewer than 100 participants. Regarding the small percentage of new DB plans, professional groups such as doctors, lawyers, and dentists sponsored about 43 percent of new small DB plans, and more than 55 percent of new DB plan sponsors also sponsored DC plans. The low net growth of private retirement plans is a concern in part because workers without employer-sponsored plans do not benefit as fully from tax incentives as workers that have employer-sponsored plans. Furthermore, the benefits of new DB plans disproportionately benefit workers at a few types of professional firms. Most individuals who contributed at or above the 2007 statutory limits for DC contributions tended to have earnings that were at the 90th percentile ($126,000) or above for all DC participants, according to our analysis of the 2007 SCF. Similarly, consistent with findings from our past work, high-income workers have benefited the most from increases in the limits between 2001 and 2007. Finally, we found that men were about three times as likely as women to make so-called catch-up contributions when DC participants age 50 and older were allowed to contribute an extra $5,000 to their plans. We found that several modifications to the Saver's Credit--a tax credit for low-income workers who make contributions to a DC plan--could provide a sizeable increase in retirement income for some low wage workers, although this group is small. For example, under our most generous scenario, Saver's Credit recipients who fell in the lowest earnings quartile experienced a 14 percent increase in annual retirement income from DC savings, on average. The long-term effects of the financial crisis on retirement income are uncertain and will likely vary widely. For those still employed and participating in a plan, the effects are unclear. Data are limited, and while financial markets have recovered much of their losses from 2008, it is not fully known yet how participants will adjust their contributions and asset allocations in response to market volatility in the future. In contrast, although data are again limited, the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, may be at risk of experiencing significant declines in retirement income as contributions cease and the probability of drawing down retirement accounts for other needs likely increases. The potential troubling consequences of the financial crisis may be obscuring long standing concerns over the ability of the employer-provided pension system in helping moderate and low-income workers, including those with access to a plan, save enough for retirement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For nearly a century, qualified pension and retirement plans meeting  certain qualifications have received favorable federal tax treatment with  deferral of taxes on contributions and investment earnings until benefits  are received in retirement. Today, these pension tax incentives are the  second largest tax expenditure and the associated income tax revenue  losses are estimated to amount to approximately $105.1 billion in fiscal  year 2011 and a total of $602.2 billion from fiscal years 2012 to 2016. The  purpose of favoring private pensions through the tax code is to encourage  employers to form new plans or maintain existing plans for their  employees and to encourage workers to save for retirement. At the same  time, the favorable tax treatment includes requirements to help ensure  that the accrual of benefits would be broadly based among their workforce  and not accrue solely to higher income employees.", "Yet, there has been growing concern that many millions of working  Americans remain largely outside the private pension system. The  percentage of workers participating in employer-sponsored plans has  peaked at about 50 percent of the private sector workforce for most of the  past two decades. Many employers\u2014often those of lower income  workers\u2014continue to choose not to offer a pension or other retirement  savings plan to their employees. For those fortunate enough to be covered  by a pension, there is a concern that much of the tax benefits flow to  higher income employees, and in many instances the financial constraints  on lower wage workers limit their ability to contribute to tax-qualified  plans and thus, to benefit from those subsidies.", "Since 2001, additional tax-related incentives have been enacted that could  help encourage retirement savings and address these distributional issues,  including a tax credit\u2014the Saver\u2019s Credit\u2014to encourage those with low  earnings to contribute to a retirement plan or an individual retirement  account (IRA) and a \u201ccatch-up\u201d provision permitting those employees  more than 50 years of age to make additional tax-deferred contributions.  Also enacted were provisions increasing the limits on the annual  contribution to qualified defined contribution (DC) plans that are tax  deferrable, a step that some hoped might spur employers to form new  plans.", "The distributional issues concerning the pension tax expenditure have  become more salient in light of the recent financial crisis, subsequent  recession, and continued high unemployment. These difficult economic  conditions have heightened worries as to whether workers, particularly  lower income workers, will have the resources they need to save for  retirement. Thus, given the limits of private pension coverage, the cost of  tax incentives to promote retirement saving, and the effects of the recent  recession on long term retirement security, this report addresses the  following questions:  1.  What has been the trend in new private pension plan formation in  recent years?  2.  What are the characteristics of DC participants contributing at or  above the statutory DC contribution limits and how might this have  changed as the limits have increased?  3.  How might incentives to increase retirement saving by low-income  workers through modifications of the Saver\u2019s Credit affect retirement  income?  4.  What might be the long-term effect of the recent financial crisis on  retirement savings for U.S. workers?", "To address our objectives we employed a variety of methods, including  interviewing pension and retirement experts, reviewing and analyzing  databases, and reviewing relevant studies. We used the Department of  Labor\u2019s data from the Form 5500 as well as published data from the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) on plan formation. We also  used data from the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to examine  characteristics of DC participants. We used a microsimulation model to  assess the possible effects of modifying existing tax incentives for low- income workers. To evaluate the effects of the financial crisis on  retirement savings, we reviewed and synthesized recent studies and  interviewed retirement and financial experts. We also reviewed relevant  federal laws and regulations.", "We conducted our work from February 2010 to March 2011 in accordance  with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant  to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the  engagement to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in  our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the  analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and  conclusions in this product."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Pension tax preferences are structured to provide incentives for  employers to start and maintain voluntary, tax-qualified pension plans and  to ensure that participants receive an equitable share of the tax-favored  benefits. The tax treatment for DC and defined benefit (DB) plans are  similar. However, DC plan contributions are subject to specific limits and  DB plans allow deductions for contributions to fund future benefits (plus  a cushion amount), which may total several times the DC tax-deferred  contribution dollar limit. Importantly, such benefits cannot exceed the  maximum yearly benefit\u2014which is $195,000 per participant per year\u2014 and the allowable contribution in any year also depends on a variety  of  actuarial factors, including the ages of the participants and the funded  status of the plan. (See table 1 for a summary of DC contribution limits.)", "One important requirement for tax-qualified pension plans of private  employers is that contributions or benefits be apportioned in a  nondiscriminatory manner between highly compensated employees or  other workers. There are standard off-the-shelf plan designs, termed  \u201csafe harbors,\u201d which allow employers to easily comply with this  requirement. Alternatively, employers can develop a custom-tailored plan  design and apply general testing methods (as required by law) to a plan\u2019s  apportionment of contributions or benefit accruals each year. These  methods for custom-tailored plan designs are complex, but they generally  require the employer to provide both coverage and contributions or  benefits for employees other than the most highly compensated at rates  that do not differ too greatly from the rates at which the employer  provides coverage and contributions or benefits for its most highly  compensated employees.", "The purpose of the legal limits that constrain tax-deferred contributions to  tax-qualified retirement plans is to prevent tax preferences from being  used to subsidize excessively large pension benefits. Tax-deferred pension  contributions are also limited by the application of other statutory limits.  In addition to the legal limits, some plans set their own limits on  contributions. In DC plans with plan-specific contribution limits, tax- deferred contributions are limited to the statutory limit or the plan specific  limit, whichever is smaller. Employers set plan-specific limits, in part, to  ensure that the plans they sponsor pass statutory and regulatory  requirements, such as the requirement that contributions or benefits not  be skewed too heavily in favor of highly compensated employees.", "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 imposed dollar  and percentage-of-compensation limitations on combined employer and  employee tax-deferred contributions. Subsequently, the Revenue Act of  1978 included a provision that became Internal Revenue Code section  401(k), under which employees are not taxed on the portion of income  they elect to receive as deferred compensation. The Tax Reform Act of  1986 introduced a dollar limitation (i.e., a maximum dollar contribution)  on employees\u2019 tax-deferred contributions to DC plans. In 2001, the  Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA)  permitted greater contributions to such tax-advantaged savings plans  beginning in 2002. The scheduled increases were to be fully implemented  by 2006 and expire at the close of 2010. At the time, some asserted that  increasing these limits would enhance employer incentives to start new  plans and improve existing plan coverage, especially for employees of  small businesses.", "EGTRRA also allowed a so-called catch-up provision, where persons aged  50 or older are permitted to make additional tax-deferred contributions, in  excess of other applicable statutory limits, to 401(k) and similar DC  plans. The provision is intended to encourage older workers who had not  previously been able to save sufficiently to make larger catch-up  contributions in order to reach more adequate levels of retirement savings.  (See table 1.) However, these EGTRRA provisions had also been  scheduled to expire on December 31, 2010. In 2006, the Pension Protection  Act made permanent the higher benefit limits in DB plans, higher  contribution limits for IRAs and DC plans, and catch-up contributions for  workers 50 and older that were included in EGTRRA.", "Additionally, in order to encourage low- and middle-income individuals  and families to save for retirement, EGTRRA authorized a nonrefundable  tax credit (the Saver\u2019s Credit) of up to $1,000 against federal income  tax. Eligibility for the Saver\u2019s Credit is based on workers\u2019 adjusted gross  income (AGI) and contributions to 401(k) and other retirement savings  plans and IRAs. The Saver\u2019s Credit phases out as AGI increases so that  eligible tax filers with higher AGI receive a lower credit rate (see table 2).  The credit amount is equal to the amount of contributions to a qualified  retirement plan or IRA (up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for  households) multiplied by the credit rate. Federal revenue losses for the  Saver\u2019s Credit are estimated to amount to $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2011  and $6.5 billion for fiscal years 2012\u20132016.", "Over the last three decades, DC plans have replaced DB plans as the  dominant type of private-sector employer pension plan and, by almost any  measure, have taken on a primary role in how workers save for  retirement. By 2007 (the most recent year with available data), DC plans  comprised 93.1 percent of all plans and active DC participants in the  private sector outnumbered those in DB plans 66.9 million to 19.4 million.", "Meanwhile, participation in employer-sponsored plans has stayed fairly  constant in the past few years. Data from the Department of Labor\u2019s  Current Population Survey show that in 2008 about 53 percent of private- sector wage and salary workers, aged 25\u201364, worked for employers that  sponsored a retirement plan and about 44 percent participated in a plan.  The Current Population Survey data show that while each of those  percentages were about 2 percentage points lower than in 2007, they are  indicative of the overall decline in plan coverage and participation since  2000. For instance, the percentage of private-sector wage and salary  workers, aged 25\u201364, who worked for employers that sponsored a  retirement plan in 2008 was more than 8 percentage points lower than it  had been in 2000 (about 61 percent). Likewise, the percentage of private- sector wage and salary workers, aged 25\u201364 participating in a plan fell  from more than 50 percent in 2000 to 44 percent in 2008.", "Similar trends are evident when looking at such percentages by full- and  part-time employment status. The Current Population Survey data also  show that full-time workers are more likely than part-time workers to have  access to and participate in a pension plan. Moreover, the data indicate  there is substantial disparity in sponsorship of retirement plans between  large and small employers. Workers at establishments with fewer than 100  employees are much less likely to have access to an employer-sponsored  retirement plan than workers at larger establishments.", "The U.S. economy went into recession in December 2007 and major stock  indexes fell more than 50 percent from their peaks in October of that year  until hitting their lows in March 2009.

First, we projected that Saver\u2019s Credit recipients tended to make lower  dollar contributions to their DC plans over their working years than  higher-income workers. Because contributions were lower, account  balances also tended to be lower, even with the Saver\u2019s Credit. The lower  the account balance, the more likely the account would be cashed-out  when a worker changed jobs, decreasing DC savings. Second, we found  that, for some workers, the Saver\u2019s Credit would make the difference  between having and not having savings at retirement. Therefore, the  annuity for these individuals would be low, pulling down the average  dollar increase in income that resulted from the Saver\u2019s Credit. Third, our  scenarios did not account for any behavioral effects that may result from  modifying the Saver\u2019s Credit and having all employers offer automatic  enrollment. For example, a more generous credit might motivate more  workers to save more because they would receive a larger credit. We did  not include this possibility in our projections. Further, automatically  enrolling employees would increase the number of people eligible for the  credit because more workers would be participating in DC plans and some  would be eligible to claim the Saver\u2019s Credit. Finally, in our projections,  we assumed that annuities were inflation-adjusted.

For those who have been able to participate in  an employer-sponsored pension plan throughout the financial crisis and  recession, their benefit or accounts at retirement may or may not be  significantly affected. However those who are out of work for any  significant length of time are much more likely to have reduced retirement  savings. The current slow recovery further adds to the uncertainty.

The decline in the major stock market indexes in 2008  significantly reduced the value of many DC plan accounts. According to  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, total assets held in  DC plans fell from $3.81 trillion at the end of 2007 to $2.7 trillion at the end  of 2008. However, as of January 2011 the major stock market indexes have  regained more than 80 percent of their value from the October 2007 peak.  As for plan balances, the Employee Benefits Research Institute (EBRI)  reported that the average 401(k) account balance rose by 31.9 percent in  2009. Some plan managers we interviewed suggested that given these  recent gains, there would not be a significant effect on retirement savings  from the market decline. Others, however, assert that the prior losses  ultimately will have a negative effect on the retirement income of many.", "Plan managers we spoke with conclude that the relative stability they saw  in both employee deferral rates and asset allocations has helped fuel the  regrowth in plan balances for many DC plan participants. Fidelity  Investments reports that in the first quarter of 2010 the percentage of  participants who have decreased their deferrals was 3.5 percent. While this  was higher than in the prior three quarters, it was down almost 50 percent  from its peak of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009. In addition, plan  managers told us that most of their participants have maintained the same  asset allocation that they had prior to the financial crisis, including  allocations of assets in equities. These findings are consistent with past  research that indicates that households rarely rebalance retirement  savings portfolios. Nevertheless, the degree to which subsequent gains due  to continued contributions and investment returns can offset earlier losses  depends in part on the value of the account prior to the crisis and the  number of years a worker has to restore the wealth lost. Consequently,  some analyses have found that older workers with substantial investment  in equities may be more negatively impacted as they were more likely to  have had higher account balances prior to the downturn and thus to have  suffered greater absolute losses than younger workers. Further, with  fewer years left in the workforce they may be unable to recoup these  losses through additional saving and investment.", "Other research, however, suggests that portfolio reallocations may have  been more frequent during the last several years than otherwise believed.  Data from a February 2009 household survey found that 21 percent of  those with retirement savings reported that they had made \u201cactive changes  to how retirement savings are invested\u201d since a prior survey the previous  November. A follow-up survey in May 2009 found that 28.6 percent of  those with retirement savings had made a change in the investment of new  funds or the allocation of old balances since October 2008. Although  estimates differ on the number of participants who have not maintained  their prior deferral rates and asset allocations, the effects such changes  can have on retirement saving could be harmful, especially for those who  reduce or cease contributions. Plan managers report that stopping  contributions even temporarily can adversely impact account balances. In  addition to the account losses suffered when the market declined, those  who reduce or stop deferrals will forgo both the amount of the  contribution and any associated employer matching contributions, as well  as the investment income that would have been earned on those  contributions. Besides concerns about the safety of the market, job loss, a  reduction in pay or hours, or other financial shocks are all events that  could induce an individual to reduce contributions to a pension plan.", "As a result of the financial crisis and economic downturn some plan  sponsors reduced or suspended employer matching contributions and a  large number of employees have been affected by these reductions. In  addition to losing the matching contributions, a participant forgoes the  investment income on those contributions. Surveys of plan sponsors  indicate that between 40\u201350 percent of plans that had previously  suspended employer matching contributions, particularly those at large  firms, have more recently reinstated their matches, and a report from the  Center for Retirement Research at Boston College concluded that to the  extent that the match is quickly restored, little harm may have been  done\u2014especially compared with the alternative of laying off workers.   However, for those employees still not receiving a matching contribution  or receiving a reduced match, the long-term impact is difficult to measure  as it is unclear whether the employer suspensions are temporary or  permanent. Furthermore, everything else equal, unless the reinstituted  match is larger than it had been previously, a reduced or suspended match  means lower contributions now and lower account balances at  retirement.", "The primary effects of the economic recession on individuals and  families\u2014unemployment or reduced wages\u2014could induce plan  participants to use retirement assets for nonretirement related purposes.  Retirement plan participants can often access accrued assets by  borrowing against plan assets, by taking hardship withdrawals from the  plan prior to retirement, or even by cashing out plan assets upon  separation from employment. The impact of this leakage on retirement  savings can be costly. We have previously reported that retirement assets  can be eroded as a result of loans or withdrawals. Data, including some  plan data, indicate that while the percentage of participants taking out  loans or hardship withdrawals from DC plans remains relatively small, it  has increased in the past couple of years since the financial crisis.", "While the rates of loans and hardship withdrawals may not have increased  sharply after the financial crisis, if the economy is slow to recover and  unemployment stays high, this type of leakage may increase if participants  experiencing reduced wages or facing other personal difficulties need  access to any available financial resources. Participants may view loans or  withdrawals as a necessity to help meet critical preretirement financial  needs when faced with serious personal financial catastrophes, even if it  may mean a potential reduction in future retirement income. Furthermore,  in addition to eroding retirement savings, withdrawals from a DC plan or  other retirement account prior to age 59 \u00bd generally incur a tax penalty, an  additional financial burden to bear. A study published by the Urban  Institute found that withdrawals can represent a significant loss to  retirement savings.

This is of increasing concern as  unemployment has increased dramatically in the past few years. As of  February 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.9 percent, representing  nearly 14 million people out of work, and millions more have dropped out  of the workforce\u2014so called discouraged workers\u2014or are working part- time involuntarily.

That means, however, that almost  a third of participants cashed-out some or all of their DC plan assets.  With a significant number of workers being unemployed during the  recession for more than 1 year, it is possible that such cash-outs might  continue or even escalate. We have previously reported that cash-outs of  any amount at job separation have a greater effect on an individual\u2019s  account balance than loans or hardship withdrawals. However, while  loans may generally affect retirement saving balances less than  withdrawals or cash-outs, if a borrower loses his or her job, the loan  amount often becomes due immediately, creating either a burden to repay  the loan at a dire financial time or, if the worker cannot pay the amount  due, an unplanned drain on retirement savings.", "The biggest risk DB plan participants face with regard to retirement  income is likely from unemployment. When a worker with a DB plan is  laid off, accruals cease and the pension benefit they receive will be based  on current salary levels and current service (rather than what salary and  service would have been at the time of retirement), and future benefits will  be lower than they would have been otherwise. To the extent that  sponsors of underfunded DB plans go bankrupt and terminate their plans,  participants of many plans will receive insured benefits from the PBGC,  but some will not get their full benefit.

Recent  trends demonstrate that the slow growth in the number of retirement  plans\u2014as new plan formation barely exceeds plan terminations\u2014may  continue to lead to many workers continuing to work at employers that do  not offer a plan and thus remain without access to the associated tax  benefits of employer-sponsored pension plans. Furthermore, recent  initiatives, such as automatic enrollment, may increase participation;  however, even if this dramatically raises participation rates for those who  work for an employer that sponsors a plan, millions of prime age private- sector workers would remain without access to a plan.", "Even for the 50 percent of the private sector workforce that does  participate in a plan there are concerns about the distribution of pension  tax benefits estimated to cost the federal government more than $100  billion per year. For DC plans, a disproportionate share of these tax  incentives accrues to higher income earners. While 72 percent of those  who make tax-deferred contributions at the maximum limit earned more  than $126,000 annually in 2007, less than 1 percent of those who earned  less than $52,000 annually were able to do so.

In general, we  included a plan as new if it reported a first year as the same as the filing  year or if it indicated that this was the first filing for the plan. However, to  account for errors in the filings, we did not include any plan as new that  had filed a Form 5500 in a previous year. We also eliminated any plan for  which the sponsor indicated it was the first filing, but the effective year  was more than 2 years prior. Note that new plans include plans created  from mergers and acquisitions that do not cover new plan participants. To  identify if a new defined benefit (DB) plan sponsor also offered a defined  contribution (DC) plan, we used the plan sponsors\u2019 employer  identification numbers. To identify the total number of plans in any given  year, we used a Labor publication, Private Pension Plan Bulletin  Historical Tables and Graphs, which adjusts the number of plans upward  from the total number of filings based on the historical number of  nonfilers.

We defined earnings as the sum of wage and salary income from a  worker\u2019s job(s) and business income (if any) from that job. For workers  who did not report their earnings as annual amounts, we used information  about hours worked per week and weeks worked per year to express  earnings as an annual amount. Our analyses excluded individuals whose  earnings could not be expressed as an annual amount. For all analyses, we  used four earnings categories: less than $52,000 per year, $52,000\u2013125,999  per year, $126,000\u2013179,999 per year, and $180,000 or more per year. We  chose the income cutoffs that were the median ($52,000), 90th percentile  ($126,000), and 95th percentile ($180,000) for all DC participants in 2007.", "The SCF is a probability sample based on random selections, so the 2007  SCF sample is only one of a large number of samples that might have been  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 4 percentage  points). This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95  percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will  include the true values in the study population.", "In this report, all estimated percentages based on all DC participants have  95 percent confidence intervals of plus or minus 1 percentage point or  less. Percentage estimates based on participants contributing below  statutory limits have 95 percent confidence intervals within plus or minus  3 percentage points of the percentage estimate itself. Percentages based  on participants at or above statutory limits have confidence intervals  within plus or minus 12 percentage points of the estimate itself. Other  numerical estimates (such as means, medians, or ratios) based on the 2007  SCF data are presented in this report along with their 95 percent  confidence intervals.", "The SCF and other surveys that are based on self-reported data are subject  to several other sources of nonsampling error, including the inability to get  information about all sample cases; difficulties of definition; differences in  the interpretation of questions; respondents\u2019 inability or unwillingness to  provide correct information; and errors made in collecting, recording,  coding, and processing data. These nonsampling errors can influence the  accuracy of information presented in the report, although the magnitude  of their effect is not known.", "As part of the effort to maintain the confidentiality of survey respondents,  most dollar amounts reported in the SCF, including the dollar amount of  DC plan contributions, are rounded. The rounding scheme is designed to  preserve the population mean, on average, and rounds some estimates  down and some estimates up. For example, if the survey respondent  reported making monthly DC plan contributions of $1,292, the  contribution was rounded to either $1,200 or $1,300 based on the results of  the rounding algorithm. This rounding scheme makes it difficult to  precisely estimate whether survey respondents are at or above the  statutory limits on DC plan contributions if annual contributions are close  to the statutory limit. Therefore, our estimates of those contributing at or  above the limit are approximate. Similarly, our estimates of those  contributing below the limits are also approximate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodology and Assumptions Using PENSIM Microsimulation Model", "paragraphs": ["To project lifetime income from DC pensions and to identify the effects of  certain changes in policies, we used the PENSIM microsimulation model.  PENSIM is a dynamic microsimulation model that produces life histories  for a sample of individuals born in the same year. The life history for a  sample individual includes different life events, such as birth, schooling  events, marriage and divorce, childbirth, immigration and emigration,  disability onset and recovery, and death. In addition, a simulated life  history includes a complete employment record for each individual,  including each job\u2019s starting date, job characteristics, pension coverage  and plan characteristics, and job ending date. The model has been  developed by PSG since 1997 with funding and input by Labor\u2019s Office of  Policy and Research at the Employee Benefits Security Administration and  with recommendations from the National Research Council panel on  retirement income modeling.", "PENSIM simulates the timing for each life event by using data from  various longitudinal data sets to estimate a waiting-time model (often  called a hazard function model) using standard survival analysis methods.  PENSIM incorporates many such estimated waiting-time models into a  single dynamic simulation model. This model can be used to simulate a  synthetic sample of complete life histories. PENSIM employs continuous- time, discrete-event simulation techniques, such that life events do not  have to occur at discrete intervals, such as annually on a person\u2019s  birthday. PENSIM also uses simulated data generated by another PSG  simulation model, Social Security and Accounts Simulator, which  produces simulated macro-demographic and macroeconomic variables.", "PENSIM imputes pension characteristics using a model estimated with  1996\u20141998 establishment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Employee Benefits Survey (now known as the National Compensation  Survey). Pension offerings are calibrated to historical trends in pension  offerings from 1975 to 2005, including plan mix, types of plans, and  employer matching. Further, PENSIM incorporates data from the 1996\u2014 1998 Employee Benefits Survey to impute access to and participation rates  in DC plans in which the employer makes no contribution, which the  Bureau of Labor Statistics does not report as pension plans in the National  Compensation Survey. The inclusion of these \u201czero-matching\u201d plans  enhances PENSIM\u2019s ability to accurately reflect the universe of pension  plans offered by employers. The baseline PENSIM assumption, which we  adopted in our analysis, is that 2005 pension offerings, including the  imputed zero-matching plans, are projected forward in time.", "PSG has conducted validation checks of PENSIM\u2019s simulated life histories  against both historical life history statistics and other projections.  Different life history statistics have been validated against data from the  Survey of Income and Program Participation, the Current Population  Survey, Modeling Income in the Near Term, the Panel Study of Income  Dynamics, and the Social Security Adminstration\u2019s Trustees Report. PSG  reports that PENSIM life histories have produced similar annual  population, taxable earnings, and disability benefits for the years 2000 to  2080 as those produced by the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s long-term  social security model and as shown in the Social Security Administration\u2019s  2004 Trustees Report. According to PSG, PENSIM generates simulated DC  plan participation rates and account balances that are similar to those  observed in a variety of data sets. For example, measures of central  tendency in the simulated distribution of DC account balances among  employed individuals is similar to those produced by an analysis of the  Employee Benefit Research Institute-Investment Company Institute 401(k)  database and of the 2004 SCF. We performed no independent validation  checks of PENSIM\u2019s life histories or pension characteristics.", "In 2006, the Employee Benefits Security Administration submitted  PENSIM to a peer review by three economists. The economists\u2019 overall  reviews ranged from highly favorable to highly critical. While the  economist who gave PENSIM a favorable review expressed a \u201chigh degree  of confidence\u201d in the model, the one who criticized it focused on  PENSIM\u2019s reduced form modeling. This means that the model is grounded  in previously observed statistical relationships among individuals\u2019  characteristics, circumstances, and behaviors, rather than on any  underlying theory of the determinants of behaviors, such as the common  economic theory that individuals make rational choices as their  preferences dictate and thereby maximize their own welfare. The reduced  form modeling approach is used in pension microsimulation models and  the feasibility of using a nonreduced form approach to build such a model  may be questionable given the current state of economic research. The  third reviewer raised questions about specific modeling assumptions and  possible overlooked indirect effects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assumptions Used in Projecting DC Plan Balances at Retirement", "paragraphs": ["PENSIM allows the user to alter one or more inputs to represent changes  in government policy, market assumptions, or personal behavioral choices  and analyze the subsequent impact on pension benefits.

At retirement, these are combined into one  account. Because we focus on DC plan balances only, we do not track  Social Security benefits or benefits from DB plans.
