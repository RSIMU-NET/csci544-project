When the program was initiated in 2004, DOD estimated TSAT's total acquisition cost to be $15.5 billion and that it would launch the first satellite in April 2011. TSAT's current formal cost estimate is nearly $16 billion and the initial launch date has slipped to September 2014--a delay of over three years. Furthermore, while the performance goal of the full five-satellite constellation has not changed, the initial delivery of capability will be less than what DOD originally planned. After DOD established initial goals for TSAT, Congress twice reduced the program's funding due to concerns about technology maturity and the aggressiveness of the acquisition schedule. DOD developed the initial goals before it had sufficient knowledge about critical TSAT technologies. DOD is taking positive steps to lower risk in the TSAT program so it can enter the product development phase with greater chance of success. However, as DOD prepares to implement a new incremental development approach for the program, it faces gaps in knowledge that could hamper its success. An incremental development will mean reduced capabilities in the initial satellites and more advanced capabilities in the remaining satellites. Given this change, it will be important for DOD to update requirements in coordination with the TSAT user community. While senior DOD officials have agreed to these reduced capabilities to get the first satellite launched in 2014, DOD has yet to reevaluate its investment in TSAT in light of other DOD investments using the knowledge it has now gained.

The TCA is an element of a  broader global information network or grid, DOD\u2019s overarching vision to  provide authorized users with a secure and interconnected information  environment. The performance parameters for the GIG define the  fundamental requirements for the systems to be interconnected through  the TCA. The TCA is designed to realize the benefits of an Internet  protocol (IP) environment, as it will provide instant accessibility to the  military and intelligence communities. The goal of the TCA is to provide  accessibility to all users while removing communications constraints  related to capacity, control, and responsiveness.

Some of the satellite technologies TSAT will employ have been evolving  for over 25 years. TSAT is building on these heritage technologies in three  primary areas: onboard signal processing for protection and connectivity,  networking, and space laser communication. Through these advanced  technologies, TSAT will improve communications to DOD, intelligence  community, and homeland defense users by transmitting large amounts of  data at a faster rate. Further, TSAT is designed to vastly improve satellite  communications by extending the GIG to users without ground  connections and making it possible for users to travel with small terminals  and communicate while on the move.", "The TSAT system will consist of a five-satellite constellation (with a sixth  satellite for backup), the TSAT satellite operations element (TSOE) which  includes a primary TSAT satellite operations center (TSOC) for on-orbit  satellite control, a backup TSOC, and a set of transportable units, a TSAT  Mission Operations System (TMOS) to provide network management, and  ground gateways (see fig. 1).", "DOD has awarded four TSAT contracts through separate bidding  processes. In 2003 DOD awarded a contract to Booz Allen Hamilton for  overall systems engineering and integration.

This approach establishes time-phased  development of new products in increments. The first increment  incorporates technology that is already mature or can be matured quickly.  As new technologies become mature, they are incorporated into  subsequent increments so that the product\u2019s capability evolves over time.  This approach also reduces risks by introducing less new content and  technology into a design and development effort, an approach intended to  enable developers to deliver a series of interim capabilities to the  customer more quickly. As such, incremental development is considered a  best practice for successful DOD and commercial development programs  because it allows these programs to make cost and schedule estimates  that are based on mature technologies.

After  DOD set its initial goals for TSAT, Congress twice funded the program at  levels below DOD\u2019s request (in fiscal years 2005 and 2006) because of  concerns about the state of technical maturity for key subsystems and an  aggressive schedule for acquisition.

At the first knowledge point, a match is made  between a customer\u2019s requirements and the product developer\u2019s available  resources in terms of technical knowledge, time, money, and capacity. We  have also reported that starting a complex program like TSAT with  immature technologies can lead to poor program performance and  outcomes.", "In early December 2003, we reported that the Air Force would have  difficulty establishing goals when starting the TSAT program because  critical technologies were underdeveloped and early design studies had  not been started. At that time, we recommended that the Air Force delay  the start of the TSAT program until technologies had been demonstrated  to be at an acceptable level of maturity and to consider alternative  investments to TSAT.

The use of these Internet-like  processes will provide unprecedented connectivity for all TSAT users by  moving from an older circuit-based network (similar to telephone) to the  newer IP-based network (similar to the Internet). Additionally, DOD  continues to develop the technologies that are needed for laser  communications. Table 1 identifies the level of maturity of TSAT critical  technologies at program start and their expected maturity dates.", "To minimize the potential for technology development problems after the  start of product development, DOD uses an analytical tool to assess  technology maturity. This tool associates technology readiness levels  (TRL) with different levels of demonstrated performance, ranging from  paper studies to actual application of the technology in its final form. For  TSAT, the space segment contractors are using a series of events to  demonstrate and integrate the critical technologies into subsystems and  then testing to determine the extent the components function properly  together. The maturity levels of the critical technologies for TSAT  currently range from TRL 5 to 6, with the remaining technologies needing  integration testing to demonstrate maturity.

Specifically, according to program officials, the  contract for ground-based network operations was awarded before the  space segment contract so that the competing space segment  contractors could work toward a stable and more mature network  design. In January 2006, DOD awarded a TMOS contract worth $2  billion to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems and Solutions to start  developing the overall network architecture and TMOS. Awarding this  contract first will allow the competing space contractors to focus their  satellite designs on a single architecture and mission operations  system, thereby reducing program complexity.", "Incorporating software best-practices\u2014Our review of the  development plans for the software-intensive TMOS segment that is to  interface with other networks like the GIG shows that DOD is also  incorporating best practices in this area to mitigate program risks. Our  previous work has identified and reported on three fundamental  management strategies that are best practices for software  development: (1) implementing an evolutionary approach, (2) following  disciplined development processes, and (3) collecting and analyzing  meaningful metrics to measure progress. First, the evolutionary  approach includes setting requirements, establishing a stable design,  writing code, and testing. Second, successful acquisitions require that  developers demonstrate they have acquired the right knowledge before  proceeding to the next development phase. Finally, metrics such as  costs, schedule, size of a project, performance requirements, testing,  defects, and quality provide evidence that the developer has acquired  appropriate knowledge in moving from one phase to another. Although  DOD\u2019s software acquisition plans may incorporate these best practices,  the potential for cost and schedule increases because of unforeseen  software complexity is inherent in the development of a large quantity  of software, as is needed for TSAT.
