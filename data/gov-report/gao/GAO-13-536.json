Concerns continue about the quality of care VHA delivers, but many physicians and dentists, referred to as providers, receive performance-based pay and awards. In fiscal year 2011, about 80 percent of VHA's nearly 22,500 providers received approximately $150 million in performance pay, and about 20 percent received more than $10 million in performance awards. GAO was asked to review VHA's performance pay and award systems. This report examines (1) whether VA's performance pay and award policies ensure appropriate administration of this compensation and (2) VHA's oversight of medical centers' compliance with policy requirements. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed VA and VHA officials about the administration of performance pay and awards and VHA's oversight of the related policy requirements; analyzed data from a random sample of about 25 providers selected primarily from primary care, surgery, psychiatry, and dentistry at each of four medical centers GAO visited that had at least one provider who was the subject of an action related to clinical performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) performance pay policy has gaps in information needed to appropriately administer this type of pay. The performance pay policy gives VA's 152 medical centers and 21 networks discretion in setting the goals providers must achieve to receive this pay, but does not specify an overarching purpose the goals are to support. VA officials responsible for writing the policy told us that the purpose of performance pay is to improve health care outcomes and quality, but this is not specified in the policy. Moreover, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has not reviewed the goals set by medical centers and networks and therefore does not have reasonable assurance that the goals make a clear link between performance pay and providers' performance. Among the four medical centers GAO visited, performance pay goals covered a range of areas, including clinical, research, teaching, patient satisfaction, and administration. At these medical centers, all providers GAO reviewed who were eligible for performance pay received it, including all five providers who had an action taken against them related to clinical performance in the same year the pay was given. The related provider performance issues included failing to read mammograms and other complex images competently, practicing without a current license, and leaving residents unsupervised during surgery. Moreover, VA's policy is unclear about how to document certain decisions related to performance pay. For example, the policy does not provide clear guidance on what to document regarding whether a provider's performance-related action should result in the reduction or denial of the provider's performance pay. In contrast to the performance pay policy, VA's performance award policy clearly states the purpose of these awards-- specifically, that they are to recognize sustained performance of providers beyond normal job requirements as reflected in the provider's most recent performance rating.", "VA policy also lists the measures, such as clinical competence, that providers' supervisors are to use to determine these providers' performance rating. VHA's oversight is inadequate to ensure that medical centers comply with performance pay and award requirements. VHA's annual consultative reviews, initiated in 2011, help medical centers comply with human resources requirements, including performance award requirements. Recently, these reviews began to also include performance pay requirements, but do not yet include a standard list of performance pay elements to review, which would be needed to ensure consistency of reviews across medical centers. Further, reviewers do not have the authority to require medical centers to resolve compliance problems they identify, and VHA has not formally assigned specific organizational responsibility to ensure medical centers resolve identified problems. As a result, VHA is unable to ensure that reviews consistently identify problems, and that these problems are corrected and do not recur. GAO found that two of the four medical centers visited did not always correct problems identified through these reviews. For example, a May 2011 review of one of these two medical centers found that the medical center did not conduct a formal evaluation of its performance award program, as required. A review of the same medical center about a year later found the identical problem."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommended that VA clarify the performance pay policy, by specifying the purpose and documentation requirements and that VHA review performance pay goals for consistency with the purpose, and improve oversight to ensure compliance.

These  systems, which include evaluating the performance of physicians and  dentists, referred to in this report collectively as providers, are  administered by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which  administers VA\u2019s health care system. In 2004, the VA Health Care  Personnel Enhancement Act established performance pay, an annual  lump sum payment based on the achievement of specific goals and  performance objectives, for providers. In addition to performance pay,  VA has established monetary performance awards that are available  annually to all staff, including providers, on the basis of annual  performance reviews.

Moreover, because VA\u2019s policy  does not specify how compliance should be documented for certain  performance pay requirements, such as discussion of goals and approval  of amounts, VHA cannot ensure consistent compliance across its medical  centers.", "In addition, oversight of medical centers\u2019 management of performance  pay and awards is not adequate for VHA to have reasonable assurance  that medical centers fully comply with requirements. VHA has not  assigned responsibility to an organizational component to follow up on  identified problems at medical centers, including problems identified  during CARDS reviews, to ensure that they are corrected and remain  corrected. Oversight that does not ensure that identified problems are  resolved and remain so is inconsistent with federal standards for internal  control, and may allow compliance problems to persist or worsen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To clarify VA\u2019s performance pay policy, we recommend that the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs direct the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources  and Administration to take the following four actions to specify in policy:  the overarching purpose of performance pay; how medical centers should document that supervisors have  discussed performance pay goals with providers within the first 90  days of the fiscal year;  that medical centers should document approval of performance pay  amounts and that the approval occurred before the required March 31  disbursement date; and how medical center officials should document whether performance- related personnel actions had an impact on providers\u2019 achievement of  performance pay goals, and as a result, affected performance pay  decisions.", "To ensure that performance pay goals are consistent with the overarching  purpose that VA specifies for this pay, we recommend that the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to review  existing performance pay goals across VA\u2019s health care system.", "To strengthen oversight of medical centers\u2019 compliance with VA policy  requirements for performance pay and awards, we recommend that the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to take  the following two actions: ensure medical centers are in compliance with the requirements in the  performance pay and award policies and assign responsibility to a VHA organizational component with the  knowledge and expertise to ensure correction of medical centers\u2019  noncompliance with VA\u2019s performance pay and award policy  requirements, including problems identified during CARDS reviews,  and ensure that medical centers maintain compliance with these  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["VA provided written comments on a draft of this report, which we have  reprinted in appendix II.conclusions and recommendations.", "In its comments, VA generally agreed with our  In response to our recommendations to clarify the performance pay  policy, VA stated that it concurred with three of them and concurred in  principle with the fourth. Regarding the overarching purpose of  performance pay, VA stated that it will coordinate with VHA to develop a  policy change that will clearly articulate the purpose of performance pay,  which is to ensure and improve the quality of care through the  achievement of specific goals and objectives. In response to our  recommendations that VA specify how medical centers should document  the goal-setting discussion between the supervisor and provider, and the  approval of the performance pay amount, VA stated that it would revise  the performance pay policy to include more detailed instructions for  documenting compliance with these two requirements. In addition, VA  said it would revise form 10-0432 to include sections for documenting  compliance with these two requirements.", "VA stated that it agreed in principle with our recommendation that medical  centers should document whether performance-related personnel actions  had an impact on providers\u2019 achievement of performance pay goals, and  affected performance pay decisions. VA agreed that medical center  officials should consider whether a performance-related personnel action  had an impact on the provider\u2019s achievement of the goals and objectives  associated with performance pay, but stated that it is inappropriate to  require the documentation of the decision on form 10-0432. We  appreciate VA\u2019s commitment to clarify in policy that medical center  officials should consider performance-related personnel actions when  making performance pay decisions. We support VA\u2019s flexibility as to  where to document these considerations, which is why we did not specify  in our recommendation that form 10-0432 should be used for this  purpose. However, we continue to believe that if such considerations are  not documented, VHA lacks information about how these decisions were  made and whether these decisions appropriately reflected providers\u2019  performance, which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards  for documentation.", "To address our recommendation that the Under Secretary for Health  review the existing performance pay goals across VA\u2019s health care  system to ensure that performance pay goals are consistent with the  purpose specified in policy, VA stated that the Under Secretary for Health  directed a committee on February 11, 2013, to conduct a review of  policies and controls associated with the administration of performance  pay, including evaluating challenges associated with establishing  performance pay goals, inconsistent application of performance pay, and  the overall perceived value of performance pay. In June 2013, the Under  Secretary for Health directed a new task force to build upon the work of  that committee and make recommendations for ensuring a consistent and  system-wide process for setting and evaluating performance pay goals  and granting performance pay, including making recommendations for  reviewing and setting uniform performance pay goals across the system  that are aligned to help VHA achieve its goals.", "To address our recommendations to strengthen oversight of medical  centers\u2019 compliance with VA policy requirements for performance pay and  awards, VA stated that the Under Secretary for Health established in May  2013 a task force to develop and provide guidance and methodology for  performance pay. In addition, VA stated that VHA\u2019s Office of the Deputy  Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management will assign  responsibility to the network directors, in coordination with the network  human resources managers, network chief medical officers, medical  center directors, medical center chiefs of staff, and medical center human  resources managers, for monitoring and enforcing VA\u2019s performance pay  and award policies, and communicate that responsibility in a  memorandum. Additionally, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for  Health for Operations and Management will communicate in a  memorandum to the network directors and human resources managers  that they should monitor and track CARDS reviews and coordinate with  the medical center directors and human resources managers to ensure  proper corrective actions are taken for compliance.", "VA also provided a general comment that it considered our definition of  performance-related personnel actions, defined in footnote 5 of the report,  to be too broad. Specifically, VA stated that performance actions are  taken when an employee lacks the skill and ability to perform assigned  duties, and that in such situations providers are given assistance and an  opportunity period to perform at an acceptable level of competence. VA  also stated that if the provider fails to perform at an acceptable level  during this period, the resulting performance action will be either a  reduction of privileges or termination. However, VA\u2019s policy on  employee/management relations states that disciplinary actions\u2014which  include admonishments and reprimands\u2014and major adverse actions\u2014 which include suspension, transfer, reduction in grade, and reduction in  basic pay, in addition to termination\u2014can be taken to address  performance or conduct. In addition, VA stated that four of the five  scenarios listed in appendix I of the report were conduct actions, not  performance actions. As stated in footnote 5 of the report, we created the  term performance-related personnel actions to include any action taken to  address clinical performance\u2014that is, an action that medical centers\u2019  documentation indicated was related to patient safety or quality.  Documentation provided by the medical centers for each of the five cases  listed in appendix I clearly stated that the actions that were taken against  the providers were related to patient safety or quality.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
