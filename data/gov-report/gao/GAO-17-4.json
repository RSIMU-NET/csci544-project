The number of servicemembers with federal student loans who received this rate cap increased as a result of the Department of Education (Education) requiring federal loan servicers to regularly use the Department of Defense's (DOD) SCRA website to identify eligible servicemembers and automatically apply the rate cap without requiring servicemembers to provide written notice of active duty (see figure). Using the automated process, some federal loan servicers identified borrowers who had been eligible for the rate cap as far back as 2008, when the SCRA rate cap first applied to federal loans, and retroactively applied the cap.", "Servicemembers can face challenges obtaining the SCRA rate cap due to their failure to receive accurate information. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should externally communicate the information necessary to achieve their objectives. However, some servicemembers eligible for the cap may not receive it because information used by DOD to inform them about the cap is inaccurate: for example, some DOD information states that the rate cap does not apply to student loans. In addition, because the automated process to identify eligible servicemembers is not required for private student loans, servicemembers with private loans may be particularly at risk of not receiving the accurate information needed to obtain the cap themselves.", "While Education monitors the application of the SCRA cap for federally owned or guaranteed student loans, there is a gap in oversight for private student loans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), four federal financial regulators of banks, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) each oversees aspects of private student loans or SCRA, but none has the authority to routinely oversee SCRA compliance at nonbank entities that handle private student loans. These nonbank entities include institutions of higher education and private companies.

The match  identifies servicemembers who are starting active duty, in order for  servicers to apply the cap and also those who come off active duty, in  order for servicers to remove the cap. Since 2014, student loan servicers  have had to match their files for borrowers with federal student loans  against DOD\u2019s SCRA website on a monthly basis to determine which  borrowers have military service that qualifies them for the cap for federal  student loans, and for what periods of time (we will refer to this process  as the automatic eligibility check in this report).

Additionally, the proposal would eliminate  the provision that servicemembers provide the creditor a copy of their  military orders. While these changes, if enacted, would remove the  burden on servicemembers with private loans of having to provide written  notice of their military status, they would still need to be aware of the cap  and orally provide notice of their status to their loan servicer.

While borrowers could contact Education  with SCRA-related complaints, officials said the agency did not  specifically track the number of SCRA complaints it received across all its  complaint systems.", "In March 2015, the President signed a Student Aid Bill of Rights which  required Education by July 1, 2016 to develop and implement a simple  process for borrowers to file complaints and for Education to track their  resolution. The agency completed design of the new system and started  using it in July 2016. While the system is designed to generate more  robust, standardized information on borrower complaints, Education  officials said it does not systematically track SCRA-related complaints.", "Under the new system, when complainants enter their contact information  online, they can choose to self-identify as \u201ca servicemember or veteran\u201d  using a check box, as appropriate, but this is an optional data field. There  are also two options in a drop-down menu categorizing complaint type  that Education officials said are appropriate for SCRA-related complaints:  \u201cMilitary and Veteran Benefits\u201d and \u201cLoan Interest Rate,\u201d but neither is  specific to SCRA complaints. In addition, there is a blank text box in  which complainants could opt to specify that their issue is SCRA related.  Education officials said they could determine the volume of SCRA  complaints by running a report on complaints with \u201cSCRA\u201d in the text box.  However, this approach relies on borrowers to enter SCRA in the text  box. Also, not all servicemembers may know how to refer to the rate cap  benefit by its actual name or acronym.", "While Education has taken steps to improve and streamline how it tracks  borrower complaints, without a way to systematically identify SCRA- related complaints Education will not be able to evaluate the effectiveness  of its efforts to oversee these benefits or be able to use this information to  improve service to borrowers who are servicemembers. For example, the  agency will not know if the frequency of SCRA complaints for commercial  FFEL loans decreased as servicers implemented the automatic eligibility  check for these loans. In addition, federal internal control standards state  that an agency\u2019s management should analyze and discuss information  related to achieving agency goals. One of Education\u2019s strategic  objectives is to provide superior service and information to borrowers, and  not having information on the extent of SCRA-related complaints can  hinder the agency\u2019s ability to provide this level of customer service. In  addition, Education has identified having a unified borrower complaint  tracking system as a key mechanism to enhance oversight and customer  service. However, Education will not be able to fully respond to  servicemembers\u2019 SCRA-related issues without knowing details about or  frequency of these types of complaints."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Defined Roles of Multiple Agencies Leave a Gap in SCRA Oversight", "paragraphs": ["The current roles of CFPB, the four federal financial regulators, and DOJ  with regard to SCRA compliance result in an oversight gap because no  agency is currently authorized to routinely oversees SCRA compliance for  private student loans made or serviced by nonbank lenders and servicers  (see fig. 4). By routine oversight, we are referring to onsite reviews to  specifically look for instances of noncompliance with SCRA by nonbank  private student loan lenders and servicers. Nonbank lenders include  institutions of higher education and private companies that are not banks.  According to CFPB, the nonbank student loan servicers include the seven  largest student loan servicers. While the proportion of private student  loans that are made or serviced by nonbanks is unknown, as of March  2016, the total private student loan market had an outstanding balance of  about $102 billion, and available data show that interest rates on such  loans can range from about 3 to 19 percent. While Education routinely  monitors the application of the SCRA cap for federal and commercial  FFEL loans, it does not do so for any private loans serviced by these  companies.", "As part of its oversight responsibility, CFPB collects borrowers\u2019 student  loan complaints and reports on issues facing private student loan  borrowers, including military borrowers, through its Ombudsman and  Office of Servicemember Affairs. CFPB also oversees the student loan  lending and servicing operations of large banks and their affiliates (large  bank lenders and servicers), nonbanks that make private student loans  (nonbank lenders), and certain large nonbank student loan servicers  (nonbank servicers) for compliance with certain federal consumer  financial laws, through onsite examinations. However, because SCRA is  not one of the federal consumer financial laws whose oversight was  transferred to CFPB, the bureau does not have the authority to routinely  oversee SCRA compliance by student loan lenders and servicers, and  does not inspect SCRA compliance during its onsite reviews.", "The four federal financial regulators\u2014Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  National Credit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency\u2014have broad authority to review the banking activities of  regulated entities\u2019\u2014insured depository institutions, credit unions, and their  affiliates\u2014including compliance with certain applicable laws, such as  SCRA. According to agency officials, they also have enforcement  authority over institution-affiliated parties, and in certain instances, over  third-party service providers, including reviewing compliance with the  SCRA rate cap for student loans.  However, the regulators do not have  the authority to routinely oversee whether nonbank student loan lenders  or servicers comply with the SCRA rate cap for private student loans.", "DOJ has specific authority to enforce SCRA based on referrals of  possible violations, but does not conduct onsite reviews of student loan  lenders or servicers to check for SCRA compliance, including lenders and  servicers of private student loans. According to DOJ officials, they ask  servicemembers to first go through DOD\u2019s military legal assistance  system to resolve SCRA complaints, including those concerning private  student loans. If the military system is unable to resolve the complaint, it  is referred to DOJ, which may open a formal investigation and/or file a  lawsuit. However, referrals from DOD would only capture cases in which  a servicemember knew about the rate cap for private student loans and  believed that it had been erroneously denied. Currently, because of the  statutorily defined roles of each agency, no agency can routinely  oversees SCRA compliance by certain nonbank private student loan  lenders and servicers by, for example, conducting onsite file reviews.  Because of this, there is a risk that SCRA violations for private student  loans will go undetected, potentially leaving some servicemembers  without a benefit for which they are eligible.", "While CFPB has written agreements in place with the four federal  financial regulators and with DOJ for interagency coordination related to  oversight, these agreements do not provide for routine SCRA oversight  for private loans connected with nonbank lenders and servicers. This may  be because none of these agencies currently has the authority to  routinely oversee SCRA compliance at nonbank private student loan  lenders and servicers. Because CFPB, the federal financial regulators,  and DOJ each have a role in the oversight of either private student loans  or the SCRA rate cap, any of these agencies could potentially be in a  position to assume responsibility for the oversight of SCRA compliance by  nonbank private student loan lenders and servicers. However, additional  statutory changes may be required to give these, or any other agencies,  additional authority to conduct routine oversight of SCRA compliance at  nonbank private student loan lenders and servicers. CFPB and DOJ  could communicate this need to the Congress.", "In prior work, we developed a framework for crafting and assessing an  effective financial regulatory system that stated such systems should be  appropriately comprehensive, and cover all activities that pose risks to  consumer protection, including closing any gaps in oversight. The lack  of routine oversight of nonbank private student loan lenders and servicers  related to SCRA compliance increases the risk that some  servicemembers will not receive a benefit for which they are eligible, even  though SCRA was designed to provide financial protection for all active- duty servicemembers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The number of servicemembers receiving the SCRA interest rate cap for  their federal and commercial FFEL student loans has greatly increased  since student loan servicers began using an automatic eligibility check to  identify those who are eligible. Nonetheless, some servicemembers  continue to face challenges in obtaining the cap. They receive inaccurate  SCRA information from DOD. In addition, if servicemembers have private  student loans, their loan servicer is not required to use the automatic  eligibility check to identify them. As a result, servicemembers are at risk of  not always getting the rate cap benefit for which they are eligible. If DOJ  were to update its proposed SCRA changes by requiring private loan  servicers to use the automatic eligibility check to identify eligible  borrowers, this could lead to legislative action that would provide  consistent treatment for all eligible servicemembers regardless of type of  student loan.", "Education\u2019s new borrower complaint system simplifies the complaint  process for consumers, but lacks the ability to track SCRA complaints  systematically. Without a systematic way to track complaints about the  rate cap, Education will not be certain whether servicemembers continue  to experience problems, making it difficult for Education to meet its  strategic goal of providing superior service. Oversight of compliance with  SCRA is also dispersed across multiple agencies, each of which has  limitations on its authority. Consequently, there is no routine oversight of  SCRA compliance for nonbank private student loan lenders and  servicers.

To ensure that all eligible servicemembers with student loans receive  the SCRA interest rate cap, we recommend the Attorney General  direct the Department of Justice to consider modifying its proposed  changes to SCRA to require use of the automatic eligibility check for  private student loans.  3.  To enhance customer service, we recommend the Secretary of  Education direct the Office of Federal Student Aid to identify ways to  modify the data collected in its unified borrower complaint system to  allow the agency to more precisely identify and analyze complaints  specifically about the SCRA interest rate cap.  4.  To better ensure that servicemembers with private student loans  benefit from the SCRA interest rate cap, we recommend that the  Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the  Attorney General of the Department of Justice coordinate with each  other, and with the four federal financial regulators, as appropriate, to  determine the best way to ensure routine oversight of SCRA  compliance for all nonbank private student loan lenders and servicers.

DOD\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix III,  Education\u2019s in appendix IV, CFPB\u2019s in appendix V, and DOJ\u2019s are in  appendix VI. Of the four federal financial regulators, the National Credit  Union Administration provided formal comments, which are reproduced in  appendix VII, while the other three other regulators provided technical  comments. We incorporated technical comments in the report as  appropriate.", "In its written comments, DOD disagreed with our recommendation, saying  it was unnecessary because the department was already providing  accurate information about the SCRA interest rate cap for student loans.  DOD said that information provided in 6 of the 8 documents GAO  reviewed is accurately based on statute whereas Education\u2019s updated  requirement to automatically apply the cap is based on policy which could  change in the future. Moreover, the automated process applies only to  federal and commercial FFEL student loans in contrast to other types of  debt. DOD said that providing information based on statute rather than  policy would cause less confusion and was a better approach than what  we recommend. With regard to Education\u2019s automated process, we note  that Education formalized this approach through federal regulations that  became effective as of July 2016, which currently legally requires  servicers to use this process for all federal and commercial FFEL loans.  In addition, DOD said it was unable to verify whether DOD\u2019s Military  OneSource website still inaccurately states that the SCRA rate cap does  not apply to commercial FFEL loans. However, when we searched the  website using the term \u201cSCRA,\u201d we still found this inaccuracy as of  October 26, 2016. DOD said it would look into a means of verifying  website information, but in the meantime, it is satisfied that its training  provides correct information. Given that Military OneSource is a key  source of information for servicemembers and that, as we note in this  report, 2 of the 8 documents DOD provided state that the SCRA rate cap  does not apply to student loans, we continue to believe that  servicemembers are not always receiving accurate and up-to-date  information about how the SCRA rate cap applies to student loans.", "In its written comments, Education said it is committed to accurately  tracking the types of complaints it receives. While Education believes its  new feedback system and monitoring efforts allow it to identify SCRA- related issues by conducting keyword searches using a variety of terms,  the agency said that it will respond to GAO\u2019s recommendation by creating  a complaint subcategory specifically for SCRA under the \u201cMilitary and  Veterans Benefits\u201d category. Education added that it had not previously  created a specific complaint category for SCRA given that military  members may be unfamiliar with the term. We share Education\u2019s concern  in ensuring complaints are captured regardless of whether the service  member has knowledge of the SCRA term. However, as we point out in  this report, one of the challenges with Education\u2019s keyword search  process is that it may miss relevant loan complaints where SCRA is not  specifically mentioned. In implementing our recommendation by creating  a subcategory for SCRA complaints, we encourage Education to use  simple language to describe what an SCRA complaint is, rather than rely  on the servicemember\u2019s knowledge of the acronym. We believe doing so  would help servicemembers note concerns related to their student loan  interest charges and active duty status, and allow Education to  appropriately capture this information and resolve any issues.", "In its written comments, CFPB did not specifically agree or disagree with  our recommendation to provide oversight of SCRA compliance among  nonbank private lenders and servicers, but acknowledged that it shares  GAO\u2019s interest in maximizing SCRA protections. CFPB said that while it  will continue its strong collaboration with relevant federal agencies,  existing interagency agreements could not be used to coordinate  oversight of SCRA compliance because these agreements would not  create the statutory authority CFPB would need to oversee SCRA. Based  on CFPB\u2019s comments, we modified the recommendation by removing the  suggestion that oversight could be accomplished by updating interagency  coordination agreements. Although CFPB does not currently have  authority over nonbank lenders and servicers, the bureau said it has other  tools at its disposal, including sharing information with other agencies  about SCRA-related complaints or possible violations. We believe,  however, that referring complaints does not take the place of regular  oversight and that CFPB and DOJ can take additional steps toward that  end. We therefore encourage both agencies to work together to  determine the best way to ensure routine oversight of SCRA compliance  for all nonbank private student loan lenders and servicers, and to  consider developing a legislative proposal seeking additional statutory  authority, as needed, should they determine that step to be necessary.", "In its written comments, DOJ neither agreed nor disagreed with our  second recommendation and agreed with our fourth recommendation.", "With respect to requiring use of the automatic eligibility check for  private student loans, DOJ said that its current package of proposed  legislative changes provides benefits to servicemembers with all kinds  of loans, including private student loans. Rather than requiring  servicemembers to submit written notice and a copy of military orders,  they need only give oral or written notice of eligibility for the cap to  their creditors. However, as we stated in the report, servicemembers  with private student loans would still need to be aware of the rate cap  in order to give notice, whether written or oral. Therefore, we  encourage DOJ to consider updating its current proposal to require  use of the automatic eligibility check by all student loan lenders and  servicers. Not only would this ensure that servicemembers with  private student loans receive a benefit for which they are eligible, but  also that the interest rate cap is applied consistently across all types  of student loans.", "With respect to coordinating oversight with CFPB, and the four federal  financial regulators, as appropriate, DOJ agreed with this  recommendation and believes the agency is in full compliance;  therefore they believe the recommendation should be closed. DOJ  said the agency already coordinates extensively with CFPB and the  financial regulators concerning SCRA compliance, through such  mechanisms as referrals from CFPB for any SCRA-related violations  and access to its consumer complaint database, and that it will  continue to build upon them. While these mechanisms are  commendable, we believe they do not constitute exercising routine  oversight of nonbank private student loan lenders and servicers who  are not affiliated with a depository institution. Therefore, we cannot  close the recommendation as DOJ suggests. We believe that  additional interagency coordination, including working with CFPB to  seek additional statutory authority, as needed, is necessary to ensure  routine SCRA compliance.", "In its written comments on our fourth recommendation, the National  Credit Union Administration (NCUA), one of the four federal financial  regulators, agreed that additional interagency coordination around SCRA  compliance for private student loans would be useful, especially for  certain third-party service providers who may lend money for or service  private student loans.  NCUA noted that it does not currently have  authority to provide routine oversight of SCRA compliance by these  entities.", "In its technical comments, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  proposed that GAO delete the fourth recommendation. In their view,  oversight of nonbank private student loan lenders and servicers cannot  be accomplished by updating existing interagency agreements since the  agency lacks statutory authority to oversee these entities. As noted  earlier, we modified the recommendation accordingly to address a similar  comment received from CFPB. We underscore the need for CFPB and  DOJ to work together to ensure the routine oversight of SCRA  compliance for all nonbank student loan lenders and servicers, which they  may determine requires them to seek additional statutory authority, to  ensure that all eligible servicemembers receive the interest rate cap for  their private student loans.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Education, Director of  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Attorney General of the  United States, Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,  Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, Comptroller of the  Currency, and to other interested parties.

To identify challenges  servicemembers face obtaining the cap and assess the extent to which  federal agencies oversee implementation of the rate cap, we interviewed  officials and reviewed documentation from the Department of Defense  (DOD), Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),  and the Department of Justice (DOJ). We also interviewed  representatives of the 10 student loan servicers who are contracted by  Education to service federal student loans, from four advocacy groups  that represent servicemembers, and from one trade group representing  servicers.

Specifically, for borrowers who  received the cap on at least one of their loans, we analyzed data provided  by the 10 loan servicers to determine (1) whether the cap was applied on  the basis of a written notification of eligibility from the servicemember or  on the automatic eligibility check; (2) the type of loan (i.e., federal or  commercial FFEL); (3) the duration of the cap; (4) loan interest rates prior  to borrowers receiving the cap; and (5) loan disbursement amounts. We  also used these analyses to examine how the SCRA interest rate cap  may affect total loan costs for servicemembers.", "We also reviewed the interest rates for federal, commercial FFEL, and  private student loans from 2008 to 2016, to make sure that interest rates  were over 6 percent for each type of loan during at least some of the  period of time covered by our review (see tables 3 and 4).", "We reviewed aggregate data from Education\u2019s National Student Loan  Data System on the number of borrowers with federal loans who were  receiving the SCRA cap as of October 1, 2014, October 1, 2015, and  December 31, 2015, and compared these data to the data we received  from the 10 federal loan servicers.

We also reviewed information provided by Education on loan  transfer rates between servicers to determine the extent to which loan  transfers occur. Because some loans were transferred between servicers  during our review\u2019s time frame, our numbers may include duplicate counts  for borrowers who had the cap applied by more than one servicer.  According to data from Education\u2019s National Student Loan Data System,  2 percent of federal loans were transferred in fiscal year 2009 and 5  percent were transferred in fiscal year 2015. In addition, 12 percent of  commercial FFEL loans were transferred between servicers in fiscal year  2009 and 3 percent were transferred in fiscal year 2015.", "With regard to private student loans, we reviewed aggregate data from 6  private student lenders, who together accounted for 65 percent of  outstanding private student loan debt as of March 31, 2016, via  MeasureOne, a private-sector company representing the lenders.
