A financial interchange between RRB and the Social Security Administration (SSA) was created in 1951, which as GAO previously reported, helped finance RRB benefits as they increased over time to keep pace with growing Social Security benefits to individuals. Through its financial interchange calculation, RRB takes steps each year to estimate the amount of funds that would have flowed in and out of Social Security's trust funds if rail beneficiaries were covered by Social Security instead of RRB. Five key steps go into the annual calculation:", "RRB is credited for (1) the estimated amount of benefits it would have paid to beneficiaries under SSA rules, (2) administrative costs, and (3) interest accrued on the financial interchange amount.", "SSA is credited for the revenues it would have received from rail workers if they paid into Social Security; specifically, (4) payroll taxes and (5) income taxes paid on benefits received.", "The determined net amounts are transferred between the agencies, which since 1958 have been from SSA to RRB each year. RRB received $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2016, almost one-third of the $12.4 billion in retirement and disability benefits it paid that year. The financial interchange was expanded to Medicare in 1965 to facilitate funding of Medicare benefits to rail workers; RRB transfers Medicare payroll taxes collected, income taxes paid on benefits received, and interest, minus administrative costs to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "A high ratio of beneficiaries to active railroad workers primarily explains the net transfers from Social Security's trust funds to RRB each year since 1958. Rail employment has fallen steadily since World War II, and the number of beneficiaries has exceeded the number of workers since 1961. RRB had 2.7 beneficiaries for every worker in 2015. As a result, RRB has paid out more in benefits than it has collected in payroll taxes and projects this to continue for the foreseeable future.", "RRB takes a number of steps each year to ensure the accuracy of its calculations, such as checking that the sample of cases used to estimate benefit payments is complete, reviewing the work of new employees, and using electronic alerts to help prevent staff from entering incorrect information into its computer system. SSA and HHS also conduct high-level reviews of the calculation results to identify any significant changes from one year to the next. However, RRB's process includes manual data entry and its electronic edit checks cannot flag entries that are incorrect but plausible, which could lead to calculation errors. RRB also has limited documentation of its calculation process, and does not have formal policies on how staff should address some potential calculation errors and on how supervisors should review staff work. This is contrary to internal control standards for having quality data and documenting procedures. In terms of SSA and HHS, they do not currently review case-level calculations made by RRB, and cannot reasonably ensure that work used to determine the transfers they made and received is correct."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes eight recommendations, including that RRB create formal policies and improve documentation of its processes, work with SSA to obtain data electronically, and that SSA and HHS increase their oversight.

The  financial interchange was expanded in 1965 to include HHS. The financial  interchange is intended to put the Old-Age and Survivors (OASI),  Disability Insurance (DI)\u2014which finance retirement and disability benefits  respectively\u2014and Hospital Insurance trust funds in the same position that  they would have been had railroad employment been covered under the  Social Security Act and the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.  Through this financial interchange, RRB typically receives sizable  transfers each year from the OASI and DI trust funds and transfers funds  to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.

What factors, if any, account for the trends in transfers between RRB,  SSA, and HHS through the financial interchange?  3.  To what extent do the agencies provide oversight to ensure that  financial interchange transfer amounts are accurate?", "To address the first objective we reviewed RRB guidance and  documentation to determine the methodology RRB uses for its financial  interchange calculations, as well as assessments of the soundness of the  methodology. We also observed RRB staff while they conducted  calculations on four non-generalizable four cases\u2014selected to provide  variation in terms of the type of benefits being received\u2014to determine the  steps taken by staff.", "To address the second objective, we analyzed data on the amounts of  financial interchange transfers from calendar year 1951 to 2015, the  number of RRB beneficiaries from fiscal year 1937 to 2016, and the  number of rail workers from calendar year 1937 to 2016, the most recent  available data. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing  RRB documentation regarding internal controls and interviewing  knowledgeable officials. We determined that the data on the number of  beneficiaries and workers were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  determined that the data we report on the amounts of financial  interchange transfers were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of  discussing trends in transfers over time.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed agency policies, procedures,  and documentation. We also observed RRB staff demonstrate, on the  four illustrative cases described above, the safeguards to prevent errors  that are built into the system they use to compute financial interchange  amounts. We compared these steps taken by the agencies to criteria for  using quality data and documenting agency procedures in standards for  internal controls in the federal government.", "For all three objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations, and interviewed staff at the three agencies to provide  additional context.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to April 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

However, according  to RRB, these private rail pensions had serious defects that were  magnified by the effects of the Great Depression. For instance, RRB  noted that the plans were generally inadequately financed and that  employers could terminate the plans at will. In prior work, we noted that  the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 was enacted at the urging of rail  labor and established the national railroad retirement system  administered by RRB. The program was to be solely supported by  employees and employers of the rail industry through payroll taxes.", "According to RRB, this system was created separately from Social  Security for several reasons. For instance, RRB notes that Social  Security\u2014created in 1935\u2014would not begin payments for several years  or credit workers for work prior to 1937, while the deteriorating state of  private rail pensions called for immediate retirement payments based on  prior service.", "We previously reported that the 1951 amendments to the Railroad  Retirement Act of 1937 substantially increased railroad retirement  benefits to bring them in line with benefit increases granted to individuals  under Social Security, and that a financial interchange was created  between the agencies in 1951 to help pay for these increases. RRB  annually computes the amounts that SSA would have collected in taxes  from rail workers and their employers, and what SSA would have paid in  benefits if rail workers had been covered under Social Security, with the  net difference transferred between the agencies. The amounts computed  under the financial interchange do not necessarily represent the actual  RRB benefits paid to rail workers and their beneficiaries. RRB determined  that it was due a net transfer from SSA each year since 1958.", "Financial interchange transfers make up a significant portion of the  financing for RRB\u2019s retirement, disability, and survivors benefits. In fiscal  year 2016, RRB paid about $12.4 billion in these benefits and collected  $5.9 billion in payroll taxes from rail employees and employers. RRB  reported that the remainder of its funding for these benefits came from the  financial interchange ($4.1 billion), transfers from the National Railroad  Retirement Investment Trust ($1.4 billion), income taxes collected on  RRB benefits ($758 million), and other funding sources, such as  appropriations. The interchange also serves as a vehicle to fund  Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) benefits for rail workers.", "The benefits provided by RRB consist of a core-level of benefits that are  similar to those available to most workers covered under Social Security,  including Medicare. Rail workers also receive a second level of retirement  benefits that approximate payments from private pension plans (see table  1).", "For non-rail workers, Social Security and Medicare benefits are paid from  their respective trust funds:", "Retirement benefits are paid from SSA\u2019s OASI Trust Fund;", "Disability benefits are paid from SSA\u2019s DI Trust Fund; and", "Medicare Part A benefits are paid from the Hospital Insurance Trust  Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RRB Calculates Financial Interchange Amounts by Approximating Key Flows In and Out of SSA and HHS Trust Funds", "paragraphs": ["The financial interchange is intended to place Social Security\u2019s OASI and  DI Trust Funds and HHS\u2019s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund on the same  financial footing as if rail workers and beneficiaries were covered under  Social Security instead of by RRB. Regarding Social Security, RRB is  credited for what it paid beneficiaries, administrative costs involved with  paying benefits, and interest for the time between the determination of the  interchange amount and its actual transfer. SSA is credited for the  amount of payroll and income taxes it would have collected from rail  workers and for income taxes that would have been paid by RRB  beneficiaries on Social Security equivalent benefits. The net of the five  amounts is the amount that is transferred (see fig. 1). A net transfer from  SSA to RRB means that rail workers would have been a net draw on  SSA\u2019s trust funds if covered under Social Security. RRB calculates the  financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective  basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year. By law,  the agencies must complete their determination by June of each year.", "In keeping with the purpose of keeping the OASI and DI trust funds in the  same place as if rail workers were covered under Social Security, RRB  determines the retirement and disability benefits that rail workers and  dependents would have received if they were covered under Social  Security. Specifically, RRB uses railroad earnings data provided by  employers to replicate SSA\u2019s benefits calculations. Although the basic  retirement and disability benefits that SSA and RRB pay to their  beneficiaries are based on the same formulas, there are several eligibility  differences between the two programs. For instance, a rail worker may  receive unreduced retirement benefits at age 60 after 30 years of work,  whereas the earliest most workers covered under Social Security can  begin receiving retirement benefits is at age 62. According to RRB  officials, even though a 60-year-old railroad worker may be receiving RRB  retirement benefits, RRB would not receive credit through the interchange  for that individual. Once that individual turns 62, RRB determines the  amount of reduced Social Security retirement benefits for which he or she  would have been eligible, given the person\u2019s earnings history and Social  Security\u2019s benefits rules. According to RRB officials, the agency  receives a credit through the interchange for this amount even though the  individual is receiving full RRB retirement benefits.", "To account for these potential differences, RRB officials said that the  agency must make calculations for individual RRB cases. Additionally,  RRB officials said that in light of the number of RRB cases\u2014nearly  400,000\u2014it is not practical to make these calculations annually for each  case. Instead, RRB uses SSA rules to calculate benefits for a subset of  RRB cases in which the worker\u2019s Social Security number ends in 30,  which approximates a 1-percent sample. The sample size was about  4,000 for fiscal year 2016. Once RRB completes its benefit calculation for  each of those cases, it aggregates the result and produces an estimated  amount for its entire population of cases (see fig. 2).", "RRB reported in its annual financial interchange determination report that  it was credited $7.2 billion dollars in fiscal year 2016 for the estimated  amount beneficiaries would have been paid under Social Security."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Administrative Expenses", "paragraphs": ["These expenses represent those that SSA would have incurred to  administer benefits had rail workers been covered under Social Security  (as opposed to the actual amount RRB spent to administer its programs).

Of this amount, transfers related to retirement and  survivor benefits comprised about $256 billion and disability benefits  accounted for about $10 billion. This trend in transfers is primarily  caused by RRB benefit payments exceeding payroll taxes collected as  calculated by the interchange, which has been the case each year of the  financial interchange, resulting in a net amount owed to RRB from SSA  each year (see fig. 4).", "Based on the data RRB reported, the continuing flow of funds to RRB  from SSA has largely been driven by a steadily shrinking number of active  workers in the rail industry paying payroll taxes in support of a larger  population of beneficiaries. According to RRB data, the number of  workers in the rail industry peaked at the end of World War II, when there  were almost 1.7 million workers. Since then, this number declined steadily  to about 231,000 in 2016. Additionally, the number of beneficiaries has  exceeded the number of active workers since 1961. According to RRB  data, there was about 1 beneficiary for every 10 workers in 1938; the ratio  had increased to 3 beneficiaries for every 10 rail workers in 1951, when  the financial interchange was created. By 2016, there were 28  beneficiaries for every 10 workers. Furthermore, RRB officials noted  that another factor causing increased fund transfers from SSA to RRB  was a series of successive amendments to the Social Security Act which  raised benefits immediately while deferring tax increases to pay for the  increased benefits. As a result of these two factors, the payroll taxes paid  by rail workers have not been sufficient to pay for all of the benefits paid  by RRB. Hence, the financial interchange has consistently transferred  money from SSA to RRB (see fig 5).", "According to SSA actuarial estimates, the flow of funds to RRB from SSA  is projected to continue. Social Security\u2019s 2017 trustees report projects  that the amount of transfers to RRB will continue to grow though at least  2026.

These checks alert employees in real time  that an incorrect value may have been entered (for example, a benefit  amount that exceeds what beneficiaries can receive).

The process RRB staff follow in computing  benefit amounts for the financial interchange involves manual data entry  of earnings data and SSA-equivalent benefits.

RRB staff demonstrated  this scenario for us and acknowledged this as a limitation in their internal  controls.", "Any data entry errors have the potential to result in larger errors in the  financial interchange determination. The benefits portion of the financial  interchange determination is based on a sample of all cases. Should any  errors occur in the sample, they will be magnified when RRB inflates the  estimate to arrive at an amount for the entire population of beneficiaries.  Additionally, RRB\u2019s process could result in incorrect transfers for years.  The sample is chosen in the same way each year\u2014individuals with Social  Security numbers ending in 30\u2014so the same cases will remain part of the  sample until the individuals leave the rolls. RRB officials told us that they  generally only have to do a full set of calculations for new cases or cases  in which additional income is detected that affects benefit amounts. RRB  officials estimated that about 20 percent of cases in the financial  interchange sample each year require a full calculation. For the remainder  of cases in the interchange sample, officials said that no annual  recomputation is needed. Instead, the previous year\u2019s results are  adjusted according to any cost of living increase. If a data entry error is  made in one of these cases, RRB may not discover it until the individual  leaves the rolls or dies, at which point RRB staff told us they recalculate  the individual\u2019s benefit amount.", "Data sharing between RRB and SSA could reduce the potential for data  entry errors, but the two agencies have not recently pursued this option.  RRB officials told us that prior to 2008 they used computer code to  automatically save data from SSA databases into spreadsheets, where  the data could be used for calculating the financial interchange. However,  SSA instructed RRB to stop using this method in 2008 because of  security concerns about saving this information outside of SSA systems.  RRB officials added that this constraint prevents them from developing a  more efficient method of data collection that would improve the accuracy  and timeliness of benefit calculations for the financial interchange.  However, RRB officials said that they have not formally approached SSA  in the last several years to discuss potential alternatives for gaining  greater access to data. SSA officials said that RRB should follow SSA\u2019s  procedures for requesting a data exchange if RRB wishes to revisit this  topic.

Additionally, RRB officials told us that formulas used in their spreadsheets  to calculate the results of the interchange have been reviewed by SSA  actuaries.", "While these actions could help identify larger errors, the agencies will not  be able to detect whether errors are made on complex, case-level  calculations or if SSA rules are being correctly followed. In response to  prior errors in financial interchange calculations, RRB officials told us that  SSA reviewed case-level calculations from the 1990s until 2002. SSA  officials told us that they have not reviewed cases since then because of  resource constraints. A 2009 SSA Office of the Inspector General report  recommended that the agency consider increasing its oversight of the  process, such as setting a schedule for review of individual cases given  the importance of reviews in verifying transfers. However, SSA has not  taken action on this recommendation. HHS officials told us that the  financial interchange is one of a number of relatively small funding  streams and the agency has never had cause to suspect mistakes and  has never examined case-level calculations. Federal internal control  standards state that agencies should establish and operate monitoring  activities to evaluate the results of activities. Without monitoring how  calculations are made, SSA cannot reasonably ensure that the transfers it  makes or receives with RRB are accurate. In commenting on a draft of  this report, HHS raised questions about whether it has the authority to  review case-level calculations, but noted in follow-up communication that  this issue is currently undergoing legal review at HHS. As a result, HHS  officials told us that they would not be able to provide additional  clarification at this time. We continue to believe that HHS would be better  positioned to ensure that transfers it makes and receives are calculated  correctly if it reviews case-level calculations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The financial interchange provides RRB with a significant portion of its  funding, and trends in the number of beneficiaries and workers suggest  this will continue to be the case in the future. RRB developed a process to  calculate the financial interchange amount, and the accuracy of the  calculations depends in large part on correct data being manually entered  into RRB\u2019s computer system. However, RRB\u2019s current controls do not  address some potential sources of error. Having the ability to  electronically obtain data from SSA could help reduce the risk posed by  data entry errors.", "Further, RRB has limited written documentation for carrying out aspects  of the financial interchange calculation, such as how its computer system  is structured, how to address instances when staff override error alerts,  and how staff work is reviewed. Without such documentation, RRB puts  itself at risk of staff carrying out actions inconsistently, losing operational  knowledge when staff leave or retire, and complicating oversight of its  operations.", "Lastly, SSA and HHS increase the risk of errors by not performing case- level reviews of financial interchange calculations. This is especially true  for the SSA portion of the interchange, which involves complex  calculations performed according to SSA rules. In its role as the  administrator of the OASI and DI programs, SSA is best positioned to  determine if its rules are properly being applied to financial interchange  calculations. The large sums SSA transfers through the interchange\u2014 over $4 billion annually\u2014warrant additional oversight to ensure that  transfer amounts are correct."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of eight recommendations, including five to RRB  (The Board), two to the Commissioner of SSA, and one to the Secretary  of HHS.", "The Board should work with SSA to explore options for obtaining data  electronically and limiting the reliance of the financial interchange  process on manual data entry. (Recommendation 1)", "The Board should produce written documentation on the financial  interchange process such that a knowledgeable third party could carry  out and replicate its process consistently without further explanation.  (Recommendation 2)", "The Board should produce written documentation of its computer  system and its structure, such as a manual for the computer system,  and data dictionary to provide information on the data elements in the  system, their definitions, descriptions, and range of potential values.  (Recommendation 3)", "The Board should produce written documentation of its procedures for  instances when staff override error alerts generated by its computer  system. (Recommendation 4)", "The Board should produce formal policies on how the work of staff  performing the financial interchange is reviewed. (Recommendation 5)", "The Commissioner of SSA should work with RRB to explore options  for electronically sharing data and limiting the reliance of the financial  interchange process on manual data entry. (Recommendation 6)", "The Commissioner of SSA should take additional steps to provide  oversight of financial interchange calculations at the individual-case  level. This could include periodically reviewing a subset of these  cases. (Recommendation 7)", "The Secretary of HHS should, consistent with its existing statutory  authority, take additional steps to provide oversight of financial  interchange calculations at the individual-case level. If the Secretary  concludes that there are limitations in its authority in this area, the  Secretary should seek to obtain the necessary additional authority.

In written comments, both RRB and SSA agreed with the  recommendations. RRB noted that it will devote the resources needed to  improve the written documentation of its procedures and computer  system. RRB and SSA also provided technical comments which we  incorporated as appropriate. Copies of their written comments are  reproduced in appendixes I and II.", "In written comments, which are reproduced in appendix III, HHS  disagreed with the recommendation that it take additional steps to provide  oversight of financial interchange calculations at the individual-case level.  HHS noted that while in theory it may be a good idea to incorporate such  review into the process, it is limited by statute in its ability to oversee how  RRB calculates transfers between HHS and RRB. HHS went on to  describe a section of the Social Security Act that they noted \u201cpertains  more to Supplemental Medical Insurance trust fund draws for  administrative costs.\u201d Notably, with respect to HHS, our report does not  involve that trust fund, but rather addresses the Hospital Insurance Trust  Fund. Although HHS\u2019s comments did not clarify why it believes that this  section of law would limit its authority with respect to the Hospital  Insurance Trust Fund, it nevertheless asserted that it does apply in this  scenario. We reached out to HHS to seek clarification of its comments.   For example, we inquired about the applicability of a separate provision of  law that would appear to establish a role for HHS to work with RRB to  determine financial interchange amounts. Ultimately, HHS did not  provide the clarification we sought, instead indicating via email that this  recommendation is currently undergoing legal review and that HHS is  unable to provide a response to our questions at this time. HHS further  stated that it will continue to work on this issue to provide GAO with  updates in the future. In light of the uncertainty surrounding HHS\u2019s  authority in this area and the fact that HHS declined to respond to our  requests for clarification of its legal authority, we have modified our  recommendation to reflect the fact that HHS may need to seek additional  statutory authority to implement our recommendation, should HHS  determine it to be necessary.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
