Historically, farmers assumed these risks as part of the hazards of doing business. Since the 1930s, many farmers have been able to transfer part of the financial losses from these risks to the federal government through subsidized crop insurance. Before 1980, the crop insurance program was smaller, covering fewer crops and locations, and its premiums were generally adequate to pay the claims. Since the program was expanded in 1980 to cover more crops in more locations, it has not been financially stable, paying out more in claims in most years than the premiums the farmers and the government had paid in. To reduce the government\u2019s cost for the crop insurance program, the Congress required that, by October 1, 1995, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lower the program\u2019s projected losses from over $1.40 in claims paid for every $1 of premiums taken in to $1.10 or less. In March 1994, USDA issued a plan explaining how it expected to achieve the desired improvement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Crop Insurance Works", "paragraphs": ["Federal crop insurance is a program that is relatively simple in concept but highly complex in implementation. Farmers who buy crop insurance can file claims for part of the money that they would otherwise lose when droughts, floods, infestations of insects, or other natural disasters keep them from harvesting their normal expected crop. The size of the claim depends on the extent of the crop loss and the amount of insurance coverage the farmer has purchased.", "Two types of coverage\u2014catastrophic and additional\u2014are available for most major crops under changes made by the Congress in 1994. Under catastrophic coverage, the government provides a free minimum level of coverage to farmers for a small processing fee. The government pays the premium for this insurance. Farmers must sign up for this program if they sign up for the annual USDA commodity programs; obtain USDA farm ownership, operating, or emergency loans; or contract to place land in the Conservation Reserve Program. They can sign up through their local Consolidated Farm Service Agency office\u2014the USDA agency responsible for administering the program\u2014or obtain their policy from a participating private insurance agent.", "The free catastrophic program protects farmers against extreme losses. The program pays farmers only when they are able to harvest less than 50 percent of their normal crop. The normal crop is determined on the basis of a farmer\u2019s past production history as reported to the USDA office or insurance agent. If a farmer does not report past production, that farmer\u2019s normal crop is determined by using a modified average production level for the county, reduced by a discount, because of the uncertainty of the farmer\u2019s expected production. For losses in production below the 50-percent level, farmers are paid 60 percent of USDA\u2019s estimated market price.", "Farmers can purchase additional insurance from participating private insurance companies. As authorized by the 1980 act redesigning and expanding the program (P.L. 96-365, Sept. 26, 1980), the managers of USDA\u2019s crop insurance program have entered into reinsurance agreements authorizing the participating insurance companies to sell the insurance and process the resulting claims. The government pays part of the farmers\u2019 premium. Farmers who purchase this additional insurance must choose both the coverage level (the proportion of the crop to be insured) and the unit price (e.g., per bushel) at which any loss is calculated. With respect to level of production, farmers can choose to insure as much as 75 percent of normal production (25-percent deductible) or as little as 50 percent of normal production (50-percent deductible) at different price levels. With respect to the unit price, farmers choose whether to value their insured production at USDA\u2019s full estimated market price or at a percentage of the full price. USDA sets the premium rates and assigns correspondingly higher premiums for higher production and price levels.", "The following example illustrates how a claims payment is determined. A farmer whose normal crop production averages 100 bushels of corn per acre and who chooses to buy insurance at the 75-percent coverage level will be guaranteed 75 percent of 100 bushels, or 75 bushels per acre. Assuming that the farmer had chosen the maximum price coverage and that USDA had estimated the market price for corn at $2 per bushel, the farmer would have total coverage of $150 per acre. Should something like drought cut the farmer\u2019s actual harvest to 25 bushels, the farmer will be paid for the loss of 50 bushels per acre\u2014the difference between the insured production level of 75 bushels and the actual production of 25 bushels. The insurance would pay the farmer\u2019s claim at $2 x 50 bushels, or $100.", "In addition, the crop insurance program\u2019s \u201cprevented planting\u201d provision pays farmers who have purchased insurance but never planted crops because of adverse weather conditions. These farmers are entitled to claims payments ranging from 35 to 50 percent of the coverage they purchased, depending on the crop."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurance Premium Rates Are Based on Risk, Which Typically Varies by Location, Farm, and Farmer", "paragraphs": ["Critical to the success of the crop insurance program is aligning the premium rates with the risk each farmer represents. The riskiness of growing a particular crop varies from location to location, from farm to farm, and from farmer to farmer. If the rates are too high for the risk represented, farmers are less likely to purchase insurance, lowering the program\u2019s income from premiums. Conversely, if the rates are too low, farmers are more likely to purchase crop insurance, but because the rates are too low, the income from premiums will be insufficient to cover the claims.", "To align crop insurance premium rates with the risk represented, USDA establishes rates that vary by crop, location (county), farm, and farmer. Because of all the combinations involved, literally hundreds of thousands of premium rates are in place. For this review, we examined crop insurance rates at the state level for six major crops: barley, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, soybeans, and wheat. For these crops, the average premium rates for crop insurance purchased at the 65-percent coverage level in 1994 varied widely among the states. As shown in figure 1.1, the average rates ranged from a low of $1.95 per $100 of insurance coverage for wheat in one state to a high of $32.94 per $100 of insurance coverage for soybeans in another state.", "To adjust the hundreds of thousands of rates it publishes each year, USDA goes through a multistep process involving considerable computer analysis and judgment. USDA\u2019s objective is to set the rates that each farmer pays according to the risk associated with the farmer\u2019s location, crop, past production, and past losses. For the six crops we reviewed, USDA begins its rate-setting process each year by looking at the crop insurance experience over the past 20 years for each county and state. On the basis of a county\u2019s and state\u2019s historical experience, USDA sets a basic rate for each crop in each county at the 65-percent coverage level for average production. Using this basic rate, USDA makes adjustments to establish rates for other coverage levels and for farmers whose production levels are higher or lower than the county\u2019s average. This latter adjustment is based on USDA\u2019s research showing that farmers with higher-than-average production levels are less likely to experience losses.", "USDA aligns rates with risk in several other ways as well. For example, it imposes an additional premium on those farmers who insure individual fields rather than all fields combined, purchase hail insurance, and are high risk as evidenced by frequent and high experience with claims. Moreover, for those farmers who have production records for fewer years than required to establish the amount of production that can be insured, USDA uses the modified average production level for their county, adjusting the production down according to the number of years for which the farmers have provided records. USDA\u2019s rate-setting methodology is described in more detail in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Has History of Financial Losses", "paragraphs": ["Since 1980, when the Congress redesigned and expanded the crop insurance program to be the primary form of agricultural disaster assistance, the program has not been financially sound. USDA has regularly paid out more in claims than it received in premiums paid by farmers and the government. Two key requirements of the 1980 legislation were to (1) operate the program on a financially sound basis and (2) eliminate the need for government-funded disaster assistance by having most farmers buy crop insurance. The program has never met either requirement.", "First, to be financially sound, the program needed to realize more income from premiums, including the government\u2019s subsidy, than it paid to settle farmers\u2019 claims so that it could build up a cash reserve to pay farmers\u2019 claims in years of catastrophic loss. As shown in figure 1.2, the claims paid per $1 of premium (including the government\u2019s subsidy) for crop years 1981 through 1994 varied greatly from year to year, averaging $1.41. During this period, claims exceeded premiums by a total of $3.3 billion. The highest claims payments in relation to premiums were in 3 catastrophic years\u2014resulting from severe droughts in 1983 and 1988 and excessive moisture and severe flooding in 1993. Excluding the 3 catastrophic years, the average claim per dollar in premiums was $1.22. Thus, even in years without catastrophic losses, the program consistently operated at a loss; catastrophic years just made the situation worse.", "Moreover, the Congress\u2019s goal of having most farmers buy crop insurance to eliminate the need for direct government disaster payments was not reached. Farmers never insured more than 40 percent of their eligible acres, and the pressure for direct disaster assistance continued. In fact, the Congress passed emergency disaster legislation to cover several crop years in the 1980s and each crop year from 1988 through 1993. Over the period 1981-93, USDA paid farmers about $11 billion in disaster assistance payments. Adding this to the government\u2019s $8 billion share of the cost of crop insurance, the government\u2019s spending to assist farmers who lost crops exceeded $19 billion over the 13-year period. Figure 1.3 depicts the outlays by year.", "The crop insurance program\u2019s financial condition is influenced by several key management activities that, taken together, determine whether the program will produce sufficient income to cover claims. These key activities are setting appropriate premium rates, setting and enforcing the rules for calculating a farmer\u2019s normal establishing the periods when insurance can be sold, and setting and enforcing the rules for adjusting claims.", "Historically, these activities, individually and collectively, have prevented the crop insurance program from reducing its losses to an acceptable level. As we reported throughout the 1980s, USDA\u2019s crop insurance program unsuccessfully attempted to achieve financial soundness at the same time it was rapidly expanding to include more crops and locations. In 1993, the crop insurance program\u2019s acting manager acknowledged to a congressional committee that during the 1980s, the agency had focused \u201csolely\u201d on improving participation in the program and \u201csacrificed\u201d actuarial soundness.", "Moreover, we and USDA\u2019s Inspector General reported problems with the private insurance companies\u2019 claims adjustments. In 1993, the Inspector General estimated an overpayment rate for claims of about 9 percent\u2014an improvement over the 16-percent overpayment rate in 1987 payments that we had previously reported.", "Furthermore, we had previously identified inherent problems with crop insurance and problems in the design of the crop insurance program that made it exceedingly difficult for the program to be financially sound.Crop insurance is an inherently difficult proposition because many weather-related hazards can reduce crop production over large areas of the nation, thereby increasing the chance that a substantial number of policies will require payments during the same year. This widespread impact reduces the probability that financial stability can be achieved because risk pooling\u2014the concept that limited premiums are paid by many to fund claims paid to relatively few\u2014is less likely to be successful if most of the insured farmers simultaneously face severe losses.", "For example, in the severe drought of 1988, 92 percent of the 34,773 crop insurance policies purchased by wheat farmers in North Dakota and Montana resulted in payments for claims, as did 58 percent of the 65,159 policies purchased by corn farmers in Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois. Similarly, in 1993\u2014a year with extensive moisture and flooding\u201472 percent of the 71,131 crop insurance policies purchased by Iowa and Minnesota corn farmers resulted in payments for claims, as did 56 percent of the 54,909 policies purchased by soybean farmers in the same two states.", "Statutes and regulations designed to encourage participation in the program have further limited USDA\u2019s ability to make the program financially sound because they encourage participation at the expense of appropriate rates. These provisions include (1) allowing all farmers to participate regardless of risk (entitlement); (2) allowing farmers to insure for production levels higher than would be expected on the basis of their production history, thereby increasing the likelihood that claims will be paid; (3) restricting USDA\u2019s ability to increase premiums; and (4) allowing farmers more time to assess current growing conditions before purchasing insurance, which enables them to better determine the likelihood of loss and to purchase insurance when that likelihood is high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Congress Enacted Various Measures to Improve Crop Insurance Program\u2019s Financial Soundness", "paragraphs": ["As a result of persistent problems and high costs in the delivery of crop insurance to farmers, potential reform of the crop insurance program was a major focus in developing the 1990 farm bill. However, congressional and administration officials were unable to reach agreement on a design for the crop insurance program that fostered high participation, eliminated the need for expensive ad hoc disaster assistance legislation, and stayed within budget guidelines. Consequently, in the 1990 legislation the Congress reemphasized the need for the crop insurance program to achieve financial soundness by mandating that USDA raise the premium rates, where necessary. However, the Congress limited the increase for any farmer to no more than 20 percent per year.", "Continuing to be concerned about the losses in the crop insurance program, the Congress, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, directed USDA to improve the crop insurance program\u2019s financial condition. The act required USDA, by October 1, 1995, to lower the program\u2019s projected losses (loss ratio) from an average of over $1.40 paid in claims for every $1.00 of premium taken in down to $1.10. In response to the legislation, USDA developed a blueprint explaining how it expected to improve the program\u2019s financial condition by reducing losses to the level specified in the legislation.", "In October 1994, the Congress made additional changes. Under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-354, Oct. 13, 1994, title I), the Congress combined the existing crop insurance program and the new catastrophic insurance program for which USDA pays the farmers\u2019 premiums. By adding the catastrophic coverage, the Congress planned to eliminate the need for ad hoc, emergency disaster assistance for crop losses. This change should resolve the inherent conflict in the program between expanding participation and achieving financial soundness. The legislation also repeated the requirement that USDA lower the projected loss ratio to $1.10 in claims paid for every $1 in premiums on and after October 1, 1995. This requirement remains in effect through September 30, 1998; thereafter, the amount paid in claims must be reduced to $1.075 for every $1 in premiums. The act also specifically provided that USDA establish insurance rates that will fulfill the requirement for 1998.", "The estimated cost of the integrated program, according to USDA\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 1996, is $2.1 billion, which will be partially offset by about $600 million in premiums paid by farmers. Thus, the net cost to the government is estimated at $1.5 billion.

In response, USDA added more specific time frames for accomplishing tasks.", "To determine the extent to which USDA\u2019s premium rates for crop insurance were adequate under the legislative requirement, we met with crop insurance program officials at USDA\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., the Department\u2019s main crop insurance field office in Kansas City, Missouri, and selected regional service offices.

We also reviewed previous reports by GAO and USDA\u2019s Inspector General.", "For our review, we evaluated the adequacy of the premium rates for 1991-95 for six of the seven major crops insured by USDA. We selected these six crops for review because they were the largest programs for which USDA used the same methodology to set the rates. For 1994, the income from premiums for these six crops totaled about $721 million.For these six crops, the losses experienced were at about the same level\u2014$1.37 compared with $1.41 in claims payments for each $1 in income\u2014as in the overall program for the period 1981 through 1994.

We developed the benchmark rates by generally following USDA\u2019s methodology for setting premium rates. USDA uses the past 20 years\u2019 claims experience to set its rates each year. USDA believes that the past 20 years\u2019 claims experience provides the basis for setting rates each year that are needed to produce sufficient income from premiums to pay future claims. For example, if claims payments averaged $100 over the past 20 years and the insurance sold averaged $1,000 in coverage, the benchmark rates would be 10 percent of the amount of the insurance coverage sold, or $10 per $100 of coverage. Although the future claims paid would vary from year to year, they would be expected to average about $100 per year. Thus, to achieve a rate that is 91 percent adequate, USDA would need to set the rate at $9.10.", "Following USDA\u2019s methodology, we used 20 years of historical data for the insurance claims paid and insurance coverage sold to calculate a benchmark premium rate for each crop in each county and state. Because USDA sets its basic rates at the county level on the basis of the historical experience in the county and state, we calculated benchmark rates for each crop overall, weighting the county experience to the state crop, national crop, and national level (six crops combined). We then compared these benchmark rates with USDA\u2019s basic premium rates for the year reviewed to assess the adequacy of USDA\u2019s rates. Appendix II provides more detail on our methodology.

USDA believes that farmers were confused about the program\u2019s requirements and restrictions because of the rapid expansion of the crop insurance program in crop year 1995. Moreover, in offering prevented planting coverage for the first time in crop year 1994, USDA recognized that changes would be required in future years as it gained experience with this provision.

Keeping farmers in the program is a legitimate goal. However, without sufficient increases in the basic rates, the legislative requirement cannot be met. Currently, USDA\u2019s management and the Congress cannot project the program\u2019s losses because USDA does not annually evaluate and report on the adequacy of the basic rates. Until that is done, USDA and the Congress will be unable to routinely know whether the program is meeting its legislative requirement, and, if not, what adjustments need to be made to the basic rates.", "In addition to the problems with the basic rates, USDA has not adjusted the factors applied to the basic rates to arrive at accurate rates for coverage and production levels different from those covered by the basic rates. Most purchases of crop insurance occur at these other levels. This lack of accurate rates benefits some farmers and penalizes others: Farmers pay too much for coverage at the higher coverage level and too little at the lower coverage level. Similarly, farmers pay too little for production levels above average and too much or too little for production levels below average, depending on the crop.

With respect to our recommendation that rates be raised by 20 percent, USDA repeated its position, which we noted earlier, that raising rates up to the maximum authorized should not be a standard practice because abrupt increases may discourage farmers from purchasing crop insurance. While we also recognize this possibility, as we previously stated, unless rates are raised as much as allowed when needed, the premium rates for many crop programs will continue to fall short of the legislative requirement of 91-percent adequacy.", "USDA also had several comments on a proposed recommendation in a draft of our report that it report to the Congress as a part of its budget request on the additional funds the program would need to subsidize farmers\u2019 purchase of crop insurance when the rates are inadequate.

However, USDA believes that it needs time to identify the most appropriate point in the process for such verification. USDA plans to consult with the companies with which it has insurance contracts and arrive at a workable verification plan by May 31, 1996."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USDA Has Reduced the Risk in the Timing of Insurance Sales, but Some Additional Changes Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["Until recently, USDA allowed farmers to purchase crop insurance after they knew whether early growing conditions, such as the amount of moisture in the subsoil, might result in poor production. Such late deadlines for purchasing insurance increased the likelihood that those who bought insurance during the planting period would file claims. In recognition of the importance of purchasing deadlines to the crop insurance program\u2019s financial soundness, 1994 crop insurance legislation required USDA to set deadlines that were 30 days earlier than in 1994. This was to prevent farmers from buying crop insurance close to or in the planting period, when they can better evaluate the probability of a loss. While the revised deadlines will reduce the extent of this problem, the underlying problem of USDA\u2019s approach to setting these deadlines remains.", "The legislation builds on the proposal USDA included in its blueprint for setting the last date for purchasing insurance for the 1995 crop year 15 to 30 days earlier than it had in 1994. USDA\u2019s proposal was in response to our analysis of three crops in 111 crop-producing areas. For 33 percent of these areas, USDA allowed insurance sales to continue well into the planting period (8 to 60 days past the initial planting date). In another 32 percent of these areas, the deadlines for purchasing insurance were near the start of the planting period (up to 7 days before or after USDA\u2019s initial planting date).", "Although USDA moved the deadline for new purchases of crop insurance 30 days earlier in the year, it generally did not move the related deadline for cancelling insurance. The cancellation deadline is the last date that current insurance purchasers may cancel their coverage before it continues in force for another year. Before crop year 1995, the purchasing and cancellation deadlines were on the same date, as would be expected. By not moving the cancellation deadline, USDA allows many current purchasers to make the decision to renew or cancel their crop insurance coverage well into the planting period. USDA officials explained that they could not change the cancellation date without first publishing the proposed change for comment in the Federal Register. USDA officials said that they were in the process of making this change and expect to have revised all cancellation dates by crop year 1997.", "While USDA had set its purchasing deadlines 30 days earlier in the year as the legislation required, it has not addressed the underlying problem\u2014these deadlines are not designed to address actual production situations. Instead, the dates have historically been set, and continue to be set, to ease the administration of the crop insurance program. The dates are set for a several-state area rather than for local growing conditions. Specifically, USDA has two principal purchasing deadlines for spring-planted crops and two for fall-planted crops. These deadlines have historically fallen into the planting period for many crops in many areas. However, USDA does not have written procedures or criteria for its field offices to follow in reviewing and updating the purchasing deadlines on the basis of the planting dates in each crop-growing region.", "Consequently, the revised national deadlines correct the situation we identified in most cases, but not all. With this change, 12 percent of the areas we reviewed\u2014compared with 66 percent formerly\u2014had purchasing deadlines that continued into the planting period. Without establishing a procedure for routinely reviewing and updating these deadlines on the basis of planting practices in each region, USDA will continue to have some deadlines that extend into the planting period.", "Moreover, USDA does not record crop insurance sales dates in its database.

As result, USDA increases the probability of a shortfall\u2014that claims paid will exceed $1.10 for each $1 in premiums.
