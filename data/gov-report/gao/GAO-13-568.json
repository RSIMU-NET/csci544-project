It may be the sole source of insurance to some residents of flood-prone areas. Mainly due to catastrophic losses in 2005, the program became indebted to the U.S. Treasury and has been unable to repay this debt. Because of NFIP\u0092s financial instability and management challenges, GAO placed the program on its High-Risk List in 2006. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 introduced many changes to the program and mandates GAO to study the effects of increasing the maximum coverage limits ($250,000 for residential buildings and $500,000 for commercial buildings) and providing optional coverage for business interruption and additional living expenses. This report discusses (1) existing flood insurance coverage, (2) the potential effects of changing NFIP coverage limits, and (3) the potential effects of allowing NFIP to offer optional coverage for business interruption and additional living expenses. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from NFIP\u0092s databases of policies and claims, reviewed prior reports, and interviewed brokers, insurers, and representatives from consumer advocacy and industry organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) currently has more than 5.5 million policyholders insured for about $1.3 trillion who pay about $3.5 billion in annual premiums, but less than half purchase maximum coverage--a possible indicator of how many might purchase additional coverage were it offered. However, from 2002 through 2012, the proportion of residential and commercial policies at maximum building coverage rose substantially--from 11 to 42 percent and from 21 to 36 percent, respectively. States along the Gulf and East Coasts have the most residential policyholders with maximum coverage. In addition, states with higher median home values generally have a higher percentage of policyholders purchasing coverage up to the limit. Industry stakeholders said that an unknown number of policyholders with higher-value properties choose to purchase additional, or excess, coverage above the NFIP limit through the private flood insurance market--a small and selective group of insurers.", "Increasing coverage limits could increase the net revenue of the program and have varying effects on NFIP, the private insurance market, and consumers. Assuming that higher coverage limits had been in effect from 2002 through 2011, GAO's analysis suggests that NFIP still would have suffered losses during years with catastrophic floods, such as 2004 and 2005, but would have experienced net increases in revenue in other years. Such increases could have offset future losses or helped avoid additional debt, but the overall financial impact and risk to the program would depend on the adequacy of the rates charged, which GAO has questioned in the past, and the number of policyholders opting for additional coverage. Regarding the private flood insurance market and consumers, higher NFIP coverage limits could decrease participating insurers' overall risk exposure and provide more options to consumers, but might lessen participation of private insurers, as consumers might need to purchase less private insurance.", "Adding optional coverage to NFIP for business interruption and additional living expenses could result in less uninsured risk in the market, but further negatively impact the financial stability of the program. Industry stakeholders told GAO that business interruption coverage is generally purchased by only larger companies, as its high cost prohibits small- and medium-sized companies from being able to afford it. In addition, adding business interruption coverage to NFIP could be particularly challenging. For example, properly pricing risk, underwriting, and claim processing can be complex. NFIP officials have stated that they would have to hire additional expertise in-house to offer this coverage. Similarly, offering optional coverage for additional living expenses has many of the same potential effects on NFIP, the private market, and consumers, although this coverage is generally less complex to administer."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO continues to support previous recommendations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that address the need to ensure that the methods and data used to set NFIP rates accurately reflect the risk of losses from flooding.

We also analyzed the policy database to identify the total  residential policies and commercial policies for each fiscal year from 2002  through 2012 and calculated the proportional increase of those with  maximum building coverage. We further analyzed residential single-unit  policy coverage for 2011 to investigate the association between the  percentage of each state\u2019s policyholders with maximum coverage and a  state\u2019s median home value. In addition, we calculated average payments  for residential and commercial claims that were closed and closed without  payment for the period from 2007 through 2012 using data from FEMA\u2019s  BureauNet. To address the effect on NFIP, the private insurance market,  and consumers of increasing NFIP coverage limits or adding optional  coverage for business interruption and additional living expenses, we  interviewed industry experts, including representatives from FEMA,  insurance industry organizations, brokers, insurance companies, and  consumer advocacy organizations. Using NFIP\u2019s claims and policy  databases, we estimated the effect on NFIP\u2019s financial condition of raising  coverage limits from $250,000 to $417,000 by estimating the impact on  net revenue (premiums less claim payments) for residential single-unit  dwellings from 2002 through 2011.

NFIP, which  makes federally backed flood insurance available to residential property  owners and businesses, was intended to reduce the federal government\u2019s  escalating costs for repairing flood damage after disasters. Floods are the  most common and destructive natural disaster in the United States.  However, flooding is generally excluded from homeowners\u2019 insurance  policies that typically cover damages from other losses, such as wind,  fire, and theft. Because of the catastrophic nature of flooding and the  inability to adequately predict flood risks, private insurance companies  have historically been largely unwilling to underwrite and bear the risk that  results from providing primary flood insurance coverage. Under NFIP, the  federal government currently assumes the liability for the insurance  coverage and sets rates and coverage limitations, among other  responsibilities, while the private insurance industry sells the policies and  administers the claims for a fee determined by FEMA. Some of these  same insurers also provide coverage for flood insurance above the limit of  NFIP coverage. A number of private insurers that do not sell and  administer NFIP policies also offer flood insurance. Flood insurance  purchased above current NFIP coverage limits generally is referred to as  excess flood insurance.", "Since NFIP\u2019s inception, Congress has several times enacted legislation to  strengthen certain aspects of the program. The Flood Disaster Protection  Act of 1973 made flood insurance mandatory for owners of properties in  vulnerable areas who had mortgages from federally insured or regulated  lenders. The act also provided additional incentives for communities to  join the program. Community participation in NFIP is voluntary. However,  communities must join NFIP and adopt FEMA-approved building  standards and floodplain management strategies in order for their  residents to purchase flood insurance through the program. The National  Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened the mandatory  purchase requirement for federally backed mortgages of properties  located in special flood hazard areas (SFHA). The Bunning-Bereuter- Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 established a pilot  program to encourage owners of properties that continually suffer from  repeated flood losses to take steps to reduce the risk of damage, known  as mitigation. Owners of these \u201crepetitive loss\u201d properties who do not  mitigate the risks face higher premiums. Finally, the Biggert-Waters Act  reauthorized the program through 2017 and removed subsidized rates for  a number of insured properties, such as residential property that is not the  primary residence, severe repetitive loss properties, business properties,  and property that has incurred flood-related damage for which the  cumulative amounts of payments equaled or exceeded the fair market  value of the property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Premiums", "paragraphs": ["NFIP studies and maps flood risks, assigning flood zone designations  based on the risk level for flooding.

Flood insurance rates are calculated for each flood zone.  Areas that have a 1-percent chance of flooding in a given year are at high  risk for flooding and are generally referred to as SFHAs. These areas  are designated as zones A or V (see table 1). Areas designated as V or  VE are located along the coast. Areas with moderate to low risk for  flooding are designated as zones B, C, or X.", "NFIP offers two types of flood insurance premiums to property owners  who live in participating communities: subsidized and full-risk. The  National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 authorized NFIP to offer subsidized  premiums to owners of certain properties. These subsidized rates are not  based on flood risk and, according to FEMA, represent only about 40 to  45 percent of the full flood risk. Congress originally mandated the use of  subsidized premiums to encourage communities to join the program and  mitigate concerns that charging rates that fully and accurately reflected  flood risk would be a burden to some property owners. According to  FEMA, Congress made changes to the program over the years to  encourage further participation in NFIP through low premiums. However,  as mentioned previously, the Biggert-Waters Act eliminated the existing  subsidies for certain types of properties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences from Private Insurers", "paragraphs": ["The insurance operations of NFIP differ from those of most private  insurers in a number of ways. For example, by design NFIP does not  operate for profit like a private insurer but must instead meet a public  policy goal\u2014to provide flood insurance in flood-prone areas to property  owners who otherwise would not be able to obtain it. At the same time, it  is expected to cover its claims losses and operating expenses with the  premiums it collects, much like private insurers. In years when flooding  has not been catastrophic, NFIP has generally managed to meet these  competing goals. But in years of catastrophic flooding, such as 2005, it  has not done so and has exercised its authority to borrow from Treasury  to pay claims. This arrangement results in much of the financial risk of  flooding being transferred to the federal government and ultimately the  taxpayer. Further, unlike private insurers that generally are not subject to  limits on premium rate increases, FEMA is limited in how much it can  raise rates. Prior to passage of the Biggert-Waters Act, FEMA had been  prevented from raising rates on each flood zone by more than 10 percent  each year, although the act now allows rate increases of up to 20  percent. The Biggert-Waters Act further changed the program when it  eliminated subsidies for certain properties, such as severe repetitive loss  properties and properties for which the policyholders let their flood  insurance lapse.", "NFIP is also required to accept virtually all applications for insurance and  cannot deny coverage or increase premium rates based on the frequency  of losses. Private insurers, on the other hand, may reject applicants or  increase rates if they believe the risk of loss is too high. As a result, NFIP  is less able to offset the effects of adverse selection\u2014the phenomenon  that those who are most likely to purchase insurance are also the most  likely to experience losses. concentration of policyholders in the riskiest areas. This problem is further  compounded when those policyholders with properties at greatest risk are  required to purchase insurance from NFIP because they have a mortgage  from a federally insured or regulated lender.", "Adverse selection occurs when insurers cannot distinguish between less risky and more  risky properties, although homeowners can. When premiums do not reflect differences in  risk that are known to potential policyholders, those who buy insurance are often those at  greatest risk for the hazards covered. Adverse selection in the market for natural  catastrophe insurance suggests that homeowners who are at the highest risk of  experiencing a natural catastrophe will buy available insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of Write-Your-Own Insurance Companies", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception, NFIP, to a large extent, has relied on the private  insurance industry to sell and service policies, and in 1983, FEMA  established the Write-Your-Own (WYO) program. Private insurers  become WYOs by entering into an arrangement with FEMA to issue flood  policies in their own name. WYOs adjust flood claims and settle, pay, and  defend all claims arising from the flood policies but assume no flood risk.  Insurance agents from these companies are the main point of contact for  most policyholders. Based on information the insurance agents submit,  WYOs issue policies, collect premiums, deduct an allowance for  commission and operating expenses from the premiums, and remit the  balance to NFIP. In most cases, insurance companies hire  subcontractors\u2014flood insurance vendors\u2014to conduct some or all of the  day-to-day processing and management of flood insurance policies.  When flood losses occur, policyholders report them to their insurance  agents, who notify the WYO insurance companies. The WYO companies  review the claims and process approved claims for payment.

To obtain coverage for business interruption for a loss caused  by flood, the commercial customer must purchase excess flood insurance  coverage from a private insurance company.

Based on our analysis, just over half of all NFIP policies and  about 25 percent of all residential single-unit policies at maximum  coverage limits were from three Gulf Coast states: Florida, Texas, and  Louisiana. Seven states\u2014mostly located on the Gulf Coast and the  Eastern Coast\u2014made up 75 percent of all residential single-unit  policyholders with maximum building coverage and about 35 percent of  all residential single-unit policies. In comparing maximum coverage rates  in individual states, we found that, in general, states with higher median  home values also had a higher percentage of policyholders purchasing  coverage at the maximum limit.

Although aggregate information  is not available on the precise size of the private flood insurance markets  for residential and commercial properties, some brokers and other staff  from industry organizations told us these markets are generally  considered small. According to an industry survey and our own research,  it appears that about 30 companies offer excess flood coverage to  residential and commercial customers. Some companies only serve  residential clients, and some only serve commercial clients. Companies  that participate in the excess insurance market are selective about the  risk levels they are willing to insure. Some brokers, insurers, and staff at  industry organizations we talked to said that insurance companies  generally only offer residential excess flood insurance to owners of high- value homes that are well constructed, up to code, and not located in  high-risk areas, such as those designated as Zone A or V (high-risk and  high-risk coastal). For example, one insurer said that it insures high-value  homes with coverage up to $15 million and that the average value of the  homes it insures is about four to five times higher than the average value  of homes that NFIP insures. Similarly, on the commercial side, another  insurer said that it only made flood coverage available to gain or retain an  important account, rather than because of an interest in providing private  flood insurance. Further, the company stated that it does not write  insurance for small businesses, primarily due to the catastrophic nature of  the exposure presented by floods.", "Industry stakeholders told us that the high cost of excess residential flood  insurance was another factor influencing policyholders\u2019 decisions about  whether or not to purchase this coverage, but precise information on the  costs was difficult to obtain. Insurers we contacted generally were  reluctant to provide specific information on their rates because the rates  are based on many variables unique to each home and are therefore not  generalizable. Three common variables used to determine rates are flood  zone, elevation of building, and the value of the home. However, staff  from insurance industry organizations told us that not many residential  policyholders purchase excess flood coverage because of its high price.", "For example, one broker told us that the starting point for an excess flood  rate he had negotiated before Superstorm Sandy was about $.3125 for  every $100 of insurance on building coverage for a post-FIRM property  built in a high-risk area (Zone A) that had been built to the required base  flood elevation. Based on this rate, $500,000 in excess flood coverage  on a building would cost approximately $1,562 annually. However, the  broker also indicated that other variables would change the rate so that  the costs for excess flood insurance on this property could range from  $1,200 to $3,000. According to  NFIP maintained by FEMA, NFIP\u2019s average insurance policy costs about  $600 per year, but the rates vary substantially between zones and can  range from $412 for a preferred risk policy for maximum coverage for the  building and contents in Zones B, C, or X (moderate to low risk) to $4,375  for a pre-FIRM standard policy for a primary residence in a high-risk  coastal area (Zone V) with maximum building coverage. One insurance  company official told us that they charged twice NFIP\u2019s additional rate for  properties in the same zone.explained that many variables affect the rate charged, and these factors  vary for each property. One broker explained that the rating sheet he  used to determine quotes to consumers was 30 pages.", "Insurers and brokers that we talked to  Excess flood insurance coverage for commercial policies can be similarly  restrictive and costly. For example, one insurer explained that costs  varied for excess coverage depending on the flood zone where the  property was located. For every $100 of total insurable value, the cost for  buildings in Zone A (high-risk) would range from 5 cents to 50 cents, and  the cost in Zones B or C (moderate to low risk) would range from half a  cent to 10 cents. As a result, $5,000,000 in coverage could cost between  $250 and $25,000 in annual premiums. However, this provider also said  that the flood zone was only one factor used to determine pricing and that  other factors and proprietary pricing also influenced these annual  premiums. In addition to the factors listed for residential policies (i.e.,  flood zone, base flood elevation, and building value), insurers and brokers  we interviewed said that premiums for commercial policies were also  influenced by some or all of the following variables: proximity to Zones A (high risk) or B (moderate to low risk), whether the building has a basement, whether the building is built on a concrete slab, type of equipment located on the first floor,  location of mechanical equipment,  redundancy of operations (i.e., does the company have operations in  another state or country that can continue the business), and whether the company has a disaster recovery plan in place.", "In addition to high costs, staff at consumer advocacy organizations and  insurance industry organizations described a number of other reasons  that a consumer might decide not to purchase flood insurance in general.  Some consumers are not sure whether they should purchase flood  insurance, either because they think that a flood will never happen to  them or because they are confused by the fact that it has to be purchased  as a separate policy.

In addition, we assumed that those policyholders who received the  maximum building claim amount during the period examined also would  have received an additional building claim amount of $167,000. We  calculated the additional premiums that would have been paid by the  policyholders, the additional claim amounts received by these  policyholders, and the additional net revenue under these assumptions.  Finally, we calculated the actual premiums, actual claim amounts, and  actual net revenue for the policyholders with maximum coverage as  benchmarks for comparison.", "Our results for this baseline scenario suggest that higher coverage limits  would have been associated with increased net revenues in most fiscal  years from 2002 through 2011. For all fiscal years except 2004 and 2005,  our baseline estimates of additional premiums are greater than our  estimates of additional claims. For fiscal years 2004 and 2005\u2014years  when the program experienced catastrophic losses\u2014our estimates of  additional premiums are less than our estimates of additional claim  amounts, and the program would have been exposed to additional risk.  As noted in table 2, in most years premiums collected from all policies  exceed claims paid, except for particularly catastrophic years. FEMA  officials explained that most of the losses that NFIP covers are fairly small  and usually fall below the current residential policy limits of $250,000 until  a catastrophic event occurs, such as Hurricane Katrina. However, in  addition to paying claims, NFIP premiums are also used to pay the costs  associated with administering the program, such as WYO expenses,  operating expenses, flood insurance studies, floodplain management, and  FEMA administrative costs. Our analysis assumes that a higher coverage  limit would not result in materially higher administrative expenses for the  program.", "We analyzed additional scenarios using variations in our assumptions  and found similar results. We examined different combinations of (1) the  increase in premiums being 20 percent lower than the baseline estimate;  (2) the increase in claims being 20 percent lower than the baseline  estimate; and (3) the percentage of policyholders increasing their  coverage 25 percent, 50 percent, or 75 percent of all policyholders. As  with the baseline scenario, the results from these additional scenarios all  suggest that higher coverage limits would have been associated with  increased net revenue in most of the years analyzed, except for the years  with catastrophic losses. In these years, the scenario results show that  net revenues would have been negative, exposing the program to  additional losses. The estimated additional net revenue shown in table 2,  both positive and negative, would be scaled down if fewer than 100  percent of policyholders at the $250,000 maximum chose to increase  their coverage. See appendix I for details on these additional scenarios.", "Our analysis suggests that the effect on the financial condition of the  program of raising NFIP\u2019s coverage limits would depend on a number of  factors. For example, the number and selection of policyholders who  increase their coverage, the additional premiums they pay, and the  additional amounts they receive for claims on their policies are all factors.", "In particular, changes in the rate schedule of any additional coverage and  consequent changes in coverage that policyholders make in response  could change the impact of raising coverage limits on NFIP\u2019s financial  condition. As stated earlier, FEMA charges a lower rate for coverage  above $60,000. Although we assumed that the flood insurance rate  schedule would remain constant, FEMA officials indicated that the rate  schedule might decrease at higher coverage limits, and that our  methodology likely overstates the increase in premiums as a result.  Policyholders might respond to changes in the rate schedule by adjusting  their coverage amounts. To the extent that coverage amounts change,  claim amounts may change as well. We did not attempt to quantify the  potential impact of these further changes.", "Overall, the financial impact on the program of raising coverage limits  would depend on the adequacy of the rates that would be charged for the  additional coverage. If the size of the program and risk exposure were  increased by raising coverage limits, setting rates for the additional  coverage that accurately reflect the risk would be important, or the  financial stability of the program would be undermined. FEMA officials  said that as long as NFIP rates accurately reflect the actual risk of  flooding, increasing the coverage limits should not affect the program  because even though FEMA would occasionally pay out more with the  increased limits, it would also be collecting more income from higher  premiums, which would help offset the occasional increased payouts.  However, in a 2009 report we raised concerns about FEMA\u2019s rate-setting  process. We found that the annual amount that NFIP collects in both  full-risk and subsidized premiums is not enough to cover its operating  costs, claim losses, and principal and interest payments for the debt owed  to Treasury, thereby exposing the federal government and ultimately  taxpayers to ever-greater financial risks, especially in years of  catastrophic flooding. In addition, we recommended that FEMA ensure  that its rate-setting methods result in rates that accurately reflect flood  risks. As previously discussed, the Biggert-Waters Act requires FEMA to  implement a number of changes to its rate-setting process, including  eliminating certain subsidies; phasing out other subsidies and  grandfathered policies; building a reserve fund; and updating maps that  reflect the relevant information on topography, long-term erosion of  shorelines, future changes in sea levels, and the intensity of hurricanes.", "As of June 2013, FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement many of these reforms  were ongoing.", "Similarly, lowering NFIP coverage limits would lessen the program\u2019s risk  exposure. A representative from one insurance industry organization also  said that lowering coverage limits would take premiums away from the  program and make it less structurally sound. However, FEMA officials  stated that if coverage limits were lowered, they would adjust premium  levels upward to account for the decreased income the program would  receive. As of September 2012, about 28 percent of all residential single- unit policies were for less than $150,000 in coverage and about 48  percent of commercial policies had less than $350,000 in coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect on the Private Flood Insurance Market of Raising or Lowering the Coverage Limit", "paragraphs": ["Brokers and staff from insurance industry organizations told us that the  private flood insurance market would have less risk exposure if NFIP  were to raise its coverage limits because the point at which NFIP\u2019s  coverage ended and their coverage began, called the \u201cattachment point,\u201d  would be higher. This would lessen the premiums collected and overall  risk exposure of the private flood insurance market. For example, a home  valued at $750,000 needs $500,000 in additional coverage based on the  current coverage limits offered by NFIP. If NFIP\u2019s coverage limits were  increased to $350,000, then the private excess market would only need to  provide coverage for $400,000. Further, one insurer that we talked to said  that NFIP\u2019s coverage limits should be raised because the value of homes  has increased since the coverage limits last increased in 1994 to the  current limits. According to FEMA officials, the prior building coverage  limit was $185,000, set in 1977; thus the building coverage limits have  increased about 35 percent in 36 years.", "Staff from one insurance industry organization told us that increased  NFIP coverage limits might push other insurers that currently provide  flood insurance above NFIP\u2019s current limit of $250,000 out of the market.  They explained that fewer companies would be needed because fewer  people would need to purchase additional flood insurance coverage, as  they might be able to get all the insurance they needed through NFIP.  However, as discussed earlier, insurers and brokers noted that  companies providing excess coverage tend to insure more expensive  properties.", "When we asked industry stakeholders about the potential effects of  lowering coverage limits, staff from some industry organizations told us  that insurers might drop out of the market due to increased risk and  inability to compete with NFIP\u2019s lower premium rates.

Although raising coverage limits  would provide more coverage options for consumers, staff at consumer  advocacy organizations and insurance industry organizations told us that  raising coverage limits might have minimal impact on overall consumer  participation. The general consensus was that consumers with homes  valued higher than $250,000 would be interested in NFIP increasing its  coverage limits and would likely purchase more coverage through NFIP if  it were available. As we noted earlier, the percentage of residential and  commercial policies at the maximum coverage amounts increased from  2002 through 2012, suggesting possible additional demand for increased  coverage limits. However, these points are applicable to rates in place  prior to the Biggert-Waters Act, and consumers\u2019 decisions may be  different based on higher rates after the act\u2019s implementation.", "One FEMA official said that raising the coverage limits could make  premiums more affordable to consumers whose homes were valued at  less than $250,000. He explained that if policyholders who currently buy  the maximum amount of coverage also bought the increased coverage  and paid the additional premiums, FEMA could lower its overall rates to  reach the income level needed to covers its expenses, which would lower  the rates for those who do not purchase the maximum coverage. For  example, if NFIP were to sell 40 percent more coverage on average, it  could also expect to get 40 percent more premiums on average if it did  not change the rates. Although total premiums collected might increase  by 40 percent, the claims payouts would likely be more modest because  smaller claim amounts are more common, and the entire increase in  premiums would not be needed to cover losses. As a result, flood  insurance premiums for individual policyholders could be lowered to  reach the required levels for the program. However, FEMA officials did  not know specifically how rates might change if coverage limits were  changed. Staff at one consumer advocacy organization and at one  industry organization said that most consumers only purchase the amount  they are required to purchase and would probably not purchase additional  coverage if the limits were raised. As previously noted in figure 2, the  median home value in the majority of states is below NFIP\u2019s current  maximum building limit.", "Alternatively, if NFIP were to lower its coverage limits, it could force more  consumers whose homes are valued at greater than the limit to purchase  insurance in the private excess flood market, to the extent it is available. If  insurers in the excess flood market were not willing to lower their  attachment point, it could create a gap in coverage between what the  private insurance market was willing to offer and the new NFIP maximum  coverage limit. Staff at some consumer advocacy and industry  organizations said that lowering NFIP\u2019s coverage limits could increase the  demand for excess insurance\u2014either by homeowners\u2019 choice or by  lenders forcing consumers to purchase additional flood insurance to cover  the value of their homes.

Under the assumption that FEMA\u2019s  rates would be lower than private market industry rates, industry  stakeholders told us that more small- and medium-sized companies might  be able to purchase this coverage because it would be more affordable to  them. Further, large businesses might be inclined to buy more business  interruption coverage. In general, more businesses buying coverage  would result in less uninsured risk and could offset the need for some  government disaster relief payments.", "However, underwriting business interruption coverage and adjusting  claims could be challenging for FEMA because it lacks needed expertise.  We have previously found that underwriting this type of coverage is  complex and that properly pricing the risk for business interruption  coverage requires extensive evaluation of a company\u2019s business model  and cash flow. For example, an insurance broker told us that  commercial customers typically are required to complete a two- to three- page financial worksheet providing historical information on net income  and continuing expenses for the period to be insured, including costs  such as payroll, rent, utilities, and other ongoing expenses that an owner  would be expected to pay even if the building were destroyed. This  information is used to determine the amount of coverage the insurer is  willing to offer and the price of the coverage. Underwriting business  interruption coverage is complex because predicting the costs associated  with flood-related damage is difficult. An academic study noted that in  order to predict the potential losses from a flood, insurers would need to  consider not only the direct damage to a property but also the implications  of a flood on the company\u2019s other locations, infrastructure, supply chains,  and employees. In addition to the complexities of underwriting, we have  previously found that adjusting business interruption claims is also  challenging because the extent of losses depends on the nature of the  business and the circumstances surrounding the loss. Further, one  broker explained that the expertise of forensic accountants is necessary  to adjust for claims.additional experts such as lawyers, adjusters, and forensic accountants if  they added business interruption coverage\u2014experts with a deeper and  more thorough understanding of underwriting and claims processing.", "NFIP officials stated that they would need to hire  In addition to these challenges, if the rates NFIP charged for business  interruption coverage were not adequately risk-based, adding such  coverage could negatively impact the program\u2019s financial stability and  thus further increase taxpayer exposure. Further, adverse selection could  increase the program\u2019s risk if only those businesses with the highest risk  or the highest claims purchased business interruption coverage from  NFIP. Some insurers, brokers, and staff from industry organizations that  we talked to emphasized the importance of careful underwriting of  business interruption coverage because underestimating the potential  costs can lead to losses for insurers. For example, one broker we  interviewed explained that after Hurricane Katrina, some private insurers  suffered losses from business interruption coverage because businesses  were closed for such a long period that the losses from this coverage  were greater than the actual value of the building that was damaged.  Although FEMA officials told us that they planned to price any new  coverage at a rate equivalent to the actual risk for flood, we have  previously raised concerns about how FEMA\u2019s rates are calculated and  suggested that the rate-setting process does not fully take into account all   Collectively, these factors increase the risk that full-risk  relevant factors. premiums, as set by FEMA, on any new coverage may be insufficient to  cover future losses, adding to concerns about NFIP\u2019s financial stability.", "See GAO-09-12. In this report we found that FEMA sets flood insurance rates on a  nationwide basis, combining and averaging many topographic factors that are relevant to  flood risk, so that these factors are not specifically accounted for in setting rates for  individual properties. Some patterns in historical claims and premium data suggest that  NFIP\u2019s rates may not accurately reflect differences in flood risk. We also found that FEMA  does not fully take into account factors such as ongoing and planned development, long- term trends in erosion, or the effects of global climate change, although private-sector  models are incorporating some of these factors. told us that the availability of business interruption coverage in the private  market is limited because few companies offer private flood insurance.  According to one broker\u2019s estimate, about 10 or 12 insurance companies  currently offer business interruption coverage for flooding. Some  stakeholders suggested that similar to increasing coverage limits, adding  this coverage to NFIP could provide a disincentive for private insurers to  continue offering it. In addition, any change to the federal flood insurance  program would create an increased burden on WYO insurers from an  administrative and operations perspective, as they would likely need to  develop new forms, promote a new product, and respond to the additional  volume of work.", "Optional coverage for business interruption through NFIP could  potentially expand the affordability and availability of this coverage for  certain commercial consumers. Business interruption coverage is  expensive through the private market and is generally only purchased by  large companies. For example, one insurance broker that we spoke with  told us that although interest in coverage for business interruption from  companies of all sizes is high, generally only larger companies can afford  it. Staff from an industry association and an insurer further concurred that  the high cost of business interruption coverage prevents small- and  medium-sized companies from purchasing it. A representative from an  industry organization testified that including business interruption  coverage would help provide stability to local economies affected by  flooding and could provide needed security to small businesses.  However, whether NFIP could offer business interruption coverage at  premium rates that are affordable and still adequately risk-based is  unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coverage for Additional Living Expenses", "paragraphs": ["The potential impact on NFIP of offering coverage for additional living  expenses could depend on how the coverage is structured. In 2009,  FEMA contracted for a study that focused on NFIP offering additional  living expense coverage. According to the FEMA study, offering  additional living expense coverage in the same way as private insurers\u2014 that is, to cover increases in expenses to maintain a household\u2019s normal  standard of living\u2014may not be the most appropriate option for NFIP, in  part because it would be difficult to price. As with business interruption  coverage, inadequate pricing for additional living expense coverage could  further increase taxpayer exposure. In addition, similar to business  interruption coverage, the program\u2019s risk could be further increased by  adverse selection if only the homeowners at higher risk purchased the  coverage.", "The appropriate price of additional living expenses could be difficult for  NFIP to determine. According to one insurer we interviewed, the premium  rate for a standard homeowner\u2019s policy that includes additional living  expenses for perils other than flood is based on historical losses,  including historical losses from additional living expenses. However,  FEMA does not have historical data on additional living expense losses  for flood, and the usefulness of any data from private insurers that offer  this coverage is limited because these policies typically cover only a  specific subset of the market and may not account for the larger number  of policyholders that NFIP would cover in a disaster-stricken area. The  FEMA study noted that estimating the expected length of time  policyholders would be displaced and expected costs of claims would be  difficult. For example, in the case of widespread, catastrophic flooding,  the time required to repair a property or relocate policyholders and the  increased demand for a limited supply of temporary living arrangements  could increase the payments NFIP would have to make. Individuals  were displaced for long periods of time following Hurricane Katrina.  Because of the difficulty in estimating potential losses and determining  adequate pricing, the risk exists that premiums collected may not cover  losses, which could increase the government\u2019s exposure if FEMA needed  to rely on its borrowing authority to cover any shortfall. The FEMA study  concluded that if additional living expense coverage was offered through  NFIP, a more basic structure that was easier to manage would be more  appropriate. For example, the study suggested that offering a set dollar  amount or a per diem rate for a specified period to help policyholders  offset their additional expenses would be a better fit for NFIP, rather than  offering full coverage for a number of variables that might differ between  homeowners. Although adding optional coverage for additional living  expenses poses some of the same difficulties as business interruption  coverage, FEMA officials explained that coverage for additional living  expenses is much simpler to administer.", "Adding living expense coverage could also have unintended  consequences for private insurance companies. First, WYOs would need  to adjust for changes in claims processing. For example, claims adjusters  would need to conduct additional work to verify the damage to the  property, the length of time the policyholder was displaced, and the  policyholder\u2019s description of normal living expenses in order to avoid  potential fraud or inflation of claims. In addition, staff at an industry  organization told us that if NFIP were to begin offering coverage for  additional living expenses but offered it at subsidized prices (i.e., prices  that did not reflect the full risk), private companies that do offer this  coverage could be priced out of the market. Also, staff at one industry  organization stated that, similar to business interruption coverage, if  FEMA were to begin offering optional coverage for additional living  expenses WYO\u2019s would probably have to make administrative changes to  their flood insurance and marketing programs.", "Offering additional living expense coverage could provide more options  for consumers, but few consumers might take advantage of it. Coverage  for additional living expenses resulting from flooding is available on a  limited basis through the private market, such as through optional  additional coverage added to an excess flood insurance policy. For  example, according to the FEMA study, this coverage can be added to  some excess flood insurance policies, with limits from $7,500 up to  $107,500. However, as stated earlier, the number of policyholders who  purchase excess flood insurance coverage is generally low, and those  who do purchase it are typically high-income individuals with properties  located in low-risk areas. Because the excess market is generally  selective, NFIP coverage for additional living expenses could allow  additional consumers the ability to purchase this type of coverage,  although FEMA officials noted that depending on how the coverage was  structured, it could be fairly expensive. A representative of an industry  organization also noted that if the additional coverage were to increase  the price of the premium, consumers would not necessarily elect to  purchase the additional coverage.

We computed  the aggregate number of all residential policies and commercial policies  with maximum coverage since 2002 and the annual rate of policies with  maximum coverage. We further analyzed residential single-unit policy  coverage for 2011 to investigate the association between the percentage  of each state\u2019s policyholders with maximum coverage and a state\u2019s  median home value. Even though NFIP provides coverage to American  Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, we excluded these  territories from our analysis because they are not U.S. states. We  calculated average payments for residential and commercial claims that  were closed and closed without payment for the period from 2007 through  2012 using data from FEMA\u2019s BureauNet.

First, for our  baseline scenario, we assumed that all policyholders with maximum  building coverage increased their coverage from $250,000 to $417,000;  that their premium rates per $100 of additional building coverage did not  change; and that they received an additional $167,000 on any claim for  which they received the maximum building claim payment. To assess the  sensitivity of our results on the assumptions that the rates used to  calculate additional premiums are unchanged and that claim amounts for  claims with the maximum building claim payment increased by $167,000,  we analyzed three alternative scenarios that differed from the baseline  scenario by either reducing the rates used to calculate additional  premiums by 20 percent, reducing the additional claim amounts by 20  percent, or both. Second, to assess the sensitivity of our results to the  assumption that all policyholders with maximum building coverage  increase their coverage from $250,000 to $417,000, we also analyzed  three alternative scenarios that differed from the baseline scenario by  reducing the number of policyholders who increased their building  coverage to 25, 50, and 75 percent. In these scenarios, we used  simulations that randomly selected the policyholders who increased their  building coverage a large number of times and then calculated the  average impact on premiums, claims amounts, and net revenues. Third  and finally, we calculated the actual premiums, actual claims amounts,  and actual net revenue as benchmarks for comparison.", "To assess the reliability of the data in the policy and claims database, we  examined the variables in the databases for missing values and for  coding errors. We verified that there were not any duplicate observations  on a policy in a fiscal year. We identified and dropped observations in the  policy snapshots that could not be identified as either subsidized or  nonsubsidized. We identified and dropped observations in the claims data  with the date of loss earlier than the policy effective date. We verified that  there is one claim for each policy for each date of loss.
