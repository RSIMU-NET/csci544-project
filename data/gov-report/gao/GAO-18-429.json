Mandatory denials include convictions for producing methamphetamine on the premises of federally-assisted housing and lifetime sex offender registrants. Otherwise, PHAs generally have discretion in establishing their criminal history policies and may deny assistance for other offenses or factor in mitigating circumstances.", "HUD monitoring of public housing agencies. From 2011 through 2016, HUD issued new guidance to PHAs on criminal history policies, but these changes are not reflected in HUD's program guidebooks for PHAs. These guidebooks serve as key reference tools, but have not been updated in over 15 years. Updating them would help HUD more accurately communicate its criminal history policies. While HUD officials said their current efforts to update the guidebooks will reflect recent criminal history policy notices, documentation provided by the agency on these updates did not specifically address criminal history guidance. In addition, HUD's compliance reviews of high-risk PHAs do not address some criminal history policy requirements, such as the prohibition on using arrest records as the basis for determining eligibility. Further, these reviews are largely limited to examining PHAs' written policies and do not cover how PHAs implement those policies. More comprehensive compliance reviews would improve HUD's ability to identify areas of noncompliance with criminal history policy requirements.", "Fugitive Felon Initiative. From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the HUD Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shared data through the Fugitive Felon Initiative, which led to the apprehension of more than 1,200 wanted persons who may have lived in HUD-assisted housing. However, GAO found that the HUD OIG had not defined its regional office responsibilities under the initiative and that four of the seven HUD OIG regions did not participate from 2012 through 2016. The HUD OIG revised its procedures for the initiative in April 2018 to include regional office responsibilities, such as coordinating with law enforcement agencies. According to HUD OIG officials, regional offices are now required to coordinate with law enforcement agencies on a priority list of investigative leads, which include warrants for violent felonies, sexual assault, and narcotics distribution. However, the HUD OIG does not plan to assess regional office implementation of several requirements. Collecting and assessing more comprehensive information on regional office activities would help the HUD OIG determine the extent to which regions are undertaking required activities. In addition, the HUD OIG and the FBI have not consistently shared information on the initiative's results\u2014such as apprehension statistics and program savings\u2014which could help evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative. Further, the HUD OIG's and the FBI's current activities to implement the initiative differ in some areas from the agreed-upon responsibilities listed in their 2012 memorandum of understanding. Updating the memorandum to reflect current responsibilities under the initiative could help improve collaboration between the agencies and improve implementation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that HUD update PHA guidebooks and improve monitoring procedures; that the HUD OIG assess more comprehensive information on the implementation of the Fugitive Felon Initiative; and that the HUD OIG and the FBI consistently share information on the initiative's results and update their memorandum of understanding to reflect current responsibilities.

This included discretion on policies  for screening applicants, denying admissions,  and terminating assistance.", "Denials and terminations. PHAs may choose to deny or terminate  assistance for additional offenses that are not specifically listed in federal  requirements. All of the PHAs we reviewed had established policies to  deny admissions or terminate tenancy for additional offenses. For  example, in addition to the mandatory denials, one PHA had a written  policy to deny admission to public housing to applicants or household  members convicted of arson or child molestation and persons who  committed homicide, armed robbery, trafficking, or domestic violence in  the past 3 years. Another PHA would deny housing assistance if an  applicant, tenant, household member, or guest had ever committed  homicide, kidnapping, rape or sexual assault, indecency with a child, or  arson. According to selected PHA\u2019s written policies, other offenses for  which PHAs may deny admission or terminate tenancy include selling,  producing, or manufacturing illegal substances; violent behavior; property  destruction; and fraud, bribery, or other crimes in connection with a  federally-assisted housing program.", "Lookback periods. PHAs can establish periods of time before the  admission decision during which an applicant must not have engaged in  certain types of criminal activity, such as drug-related or violent crimes,  known as lookback periods. Based on our interviews with selected PHAs,  lookback periods generally ranged from 2 years to 7 years but were  sometimes longer for offenses such as homicide or assault. For example,  one PHA had a policy to deny housing assistance to individuals who have  committed manslaughter, robbery, illegal possession of a firearm or  deadly weapon, assault, or physical violence to persons or property within  a 5-year period. Another PHA had a 5-year lookback period for felony  convictions for burglary; a 10-year lookback period for felony convictions  for assault, kidnapping, abduction, forcible sex, or arson; and a 20-year  lookback period for convictions for first degree murder, according to its  screening criteria for the public housing and HCV programs. Some PHAs  began the lookback period on the date of the conviction, and others on  the date the offense occurred.", "Representatives of three PHAs we interviewed said that they had revised  their policies in the past 5 years to reduce their lookback periods. For  example, from 2013 through 2016, one PHA reduced its lookback period  for all offenses first from 10 years to 7 years, and then finally to 3 years.  The officials said their neighborhood had a high incarceration rate and  they wanted to give second chances to ex-offenders. Officials from  another PHA said that in 2016, they changed their lookback period from  10 years to 5 years at the suggestion of their new deputy director.", "Use of arrest records. According to HUD\u2019s 2015 guidance, PHAs cannot  rely on arrest records to determine eligibility for housing assistance.  However, they may still review arrest records and may make an adverse  housing decision based on the conduct underlying an arrest if the conduct  indicates that the individual is not suitable for tenancy and the PHA has  sufficient evidence (in addition to the arrest record) that the individual  engaged in the conduct. Officials from 9 of the 10 PHAs said that they  did not rely on arrest records to determine eligibility for assistance.  Officials from the remaining PHA told us they have used arrest records as  the basis for denying assistance for certain offenses and believed they  complied with HUD\u2019s notice on the use of arrest records by providing the  applicant or tenant the right to appeal the denial or termination.", "Of the 9 PHAs that did not rely on arrest records for determining eligibility  for assistance, officials at 5 PHAs indicated that they obtained and  reviewed information on arrest records, but that they did not take action to  deny assistance or terminate tenancy based on an arrest record. Officials  at 1 PHA stated that they only took action based on conviction records  and officials at another PHA stated they do not use arrest records at all in  making eligibility determinations. For cases where an applicant has  charges pending, officials at 2 PHAs said that they may wait for the case  to be closed prior to making an eligibility determination.", "Consideration of mitigating circumstances and other factors. PHAs  sometimes consider mitigating circumstances for applicants or tenants  who may otherwise be denied housing assistance. Officials from PHAs  we interviewed took different approaches to allowing mitigating  circumstances and other factors. For example, officials from one PHA  said that it always considered mitigating circumstances and requested  such information as part of the application process. Officials at another  PHA said that after a denial letter is sent, applicants can provide evidence  of mitigating circumstances during the appeals process. Another PHA\u2019s  officials said that in making eligibility decisions, they considered the  severity of the crime and whether the individual completed rehabilitation.  As allowed by federal requirements, some PHAs included in their policies  factors to consider when determining whether or not to deny or terminate  housing assistance. For example, one PHA\u2019s policy stated that in  making such determinations it considers several factors such as the  seriousness of the case and the effects that denying assistance may have  on other household members or the community. Officials from another  PHA said that they allowed public housing residents to preserve their  tenancy on the condition that the offending household member is  permanently excluded from the public housing unit.", "Selected PHAs\u2019 Coordination with Local  Law Enforcement   Officials we interviewed at 10 public housing  agencies (PHA) said they coordinated with  local law enforcement as part of their efforts to  address criminal activity in public housing.  Two PHAs have their own police departments.   Three PHAs said that local police officers  patrol their public housing properties and  inform the PHA if there are any issues related  to criminal activity. Officials at one of the  larger PHAs we interviewed said that staff  check arrest reports every night to see if any  crimes were committed by their tenants.  Officials at another PHA said that they had  off-duty police officers regularly patrol their  public housing properties and had security  cameras on their properties that are  monitored by local police.", "Timing and Frequency of Background Checks. In addition to federal  requirements to conduct criminal background checks at time of  application, PHAs may also choose to conduct such checks as part of an  annual recertification process for persons already receiving rental  assistance. Officials from 3 of the 10 PHAs we interviewed said that they  conducted background checks on tenants during the recertification  process.

The letter also reminded PHAs that they have  discretion to consider other factors such as evidence of rehabilitation  or participation in social service programs when screening applicants  for suitability.", "HUD issued a notice in 2012 recommending that PHAs terminate the  tenancy of persons living in federally assisted housing who were  erroneously admitted while subject to a state lifetime sex offender  registration requirement or who commit sex offenses while living in  federally assisted housing. HUD recommended that PHAs ask at the  time of annual recertification whether any member of the household is  subject to a state lifetime sex offender registration program in any  state. If the PHA finds that a member of the household engages in  criminal activity, including sex offenses, while living in HUD-assisted  housing, the PHA should pursue termination of tenancy, according to  the notice.", "As previously discussed, HUD issued a notice on criminal history  policies and the use of arrest records in 2015, stating that the fact that  an individual was arrested is not sufficient evidence that the individual  engaged in criminal activity. In addition, the notice stated that HUD  does not require the adoption of \u201cone strike\u201d policies (for example,  policies that deny admissions or tenancy to anyone who has engaged  in criminal activity), and that in most cases PHAs have discretion to  determine whether to deny admission or terminate assistance to  applicants or households with criminal history records.", "In 2016, the HUD Office of General Counsel issued a document  indicating that policies that exclude individuals based on arrests do  not satisfy the Fair Housing Act\u2019s burden of proof.

We reported previously that HUD had struggled  to maintain up-to-date and complete policies and procedures across its  management functions. In March 2018, HUD officials told us they had  begun the process of updating their HCV and public housing guidebooks,  noting that PHAs have requested such an update. HUD officials said the  eligibility chapters of the updated guidebooks will reflect the notices that  HUD has provided to PHAs in recent years on criminal history policies.  However, we requested documentation on HUD\u2019s planned updates and  the information we received did not clearly indicate that the new criminal  history guidance would be incorporated into the guidebooks.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should  communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives. This can include ensuring appropriate means of  communicating with external parties. Effective communications can take  many forms, including guidance.

HUD may also review a PHA\u2019s  criminal history policies through the annual  plan submission process.

To conduct these compliance reviews, field staff use  HUD\u2019s Compliance Monitoring Checklist (checklist). The checklist, which  was first piloted in 2016 among six PHAs, contains six questions field  staff must cover that directly relate to PHAs\u2019 criminal history policies.  These include questions on the PHA\u2019s policies for denying applicants for  drug-related criminal activity and checking states\u2019 sex offender registry  lists. In 2017, HUD expanded the use of the checklist to 74 high-risk and  very-high-risk PHAs. For 2018 reviews, HUD officials stated that each of  HUD\u2019s 45 field offices will be required to use the checklist for at least one  high-risk PHA in their portfolio, meaning the checklist will be applied to at  least 45 PHAs out of 626 PHAs designated as high risk and very-high risk  (out of a total of 3,825 PHAs as of December 2017), according to HUD  officials. HUD field offices can choose to use the checklist at more than  one PHA, according to HUD officials. Prior to this checklist, HUD officials  said HUD field staff collected information on PHAs\u2019 criminal history  policies through HUD\u2019s Rental Integrity Monitoring reviews by which HUD  field office staff collect and analyze PHA income and rent information,  identify income and rent errors, and assess PHA policies and procedures  in both the public housing and HCV programs. However, HUD no longer  required these reviews after 2006, though field staff may still conduct  them, according to HUD officials.", "As shown in table 2, the checklist generally directs field staff to obtain a  copy of a PHA\u2019s written policies related to criminal history. For two of the  six questions, field staff are also directed to review supporting materials  and interview PHA staff, but for the other four questions, no additional  information must be obtained. According to HUD officials, field staff who  conduct the reviews are experienced and know to obtain additional  information even if it is not listed in the checklist guidance. Officials stated  that the checklist was not intended to be a step-by-step guide.", "HUD\u2019s checklist does not include items to assess PHAs\u2019 compliance with  additional aspects of PHAs\u2019 criminal history policies. As shown in table 2,  the checklist includes specific items related to federal requirements on  drug-related criminal activity, sex offenders, and convictions for  methamphetamine production for which PHAs are required to deny  admissions for public housing and HCV programs. The checklist,  however, does not cover the requirement related to the abuse of alcohol.", "In addition, HUD\u2019s checklist also does not address the requirement that  PHAs may not use arrest records as the basis for denying or terminating  assistance. Officials from 8 of the 10 PHAs we interviewed stated that  they were already implementing policies or changed their policies to  follow HUD\u2019s notice on arrest records. However, we found that 1 of the 2  remaining PHAs we interviewed had not yet updated its written policies,  though officials at this PHA said they did not base any decisions on arrest  records in practice. The other PHA\u2019s policies state that a record of  arrest(s) will not be used as the basis for the denial or proof that the  applicant engaged in disqualifying criminal activity, but officials from this  PHA said that they did use arrest records as the basis for denying  assistance to persons. Specifically, PHA officials stated that they based  assistance decisions on records of arrest for drug-related or violent  activity if the arrest had not been dismissed, had not reached disposition,  and occurred within the last 5 years. Officials from this PHA said that they  comply with HUD\u2019s 2015 notice by providing the applicant the right to  appeal a denial or termination (officials said that appeals by applicants  are rare).", "HUD\u2019s checklist instructions direct Office of Public and Indian Housing  (PIH) field staff to note regulatory violations that they observe when  conducting compliance reviews using the checklist. However, officials in  HUD headquarters stated that they could not provide information on any  regulatory violations related to PHAs\u2019 criminal history policies specifically  because they have aggregate results from the 2017 checklist reviews,  which do not specify the type of compliance issues identified by field staff.  As a result, violations related to criminal history policies would be  included under the general categories of PHA\u2019s Admissions and  Continued Occupancy Policies (for public housing) or Administrative  Plans (for HCV). In addition, none of the HUD staff we interviewed from  July through December 2017 from five of HUD\u2019s field offices discussed  any instances of noncompliance specifically related to PHAs\u2019 criminal  history policies. Field staff we interviewed identified a range of potential  actions they might take if they found that a PHA\u2019s criminal history policies  did not meet HUD\u2019s requirements. These actions could include providing  technical assistance to the PHA, requiring the PHA to make corrective  actions within a specified time frame, or requiring the PHA to rescreen  applicants.", "HUD is required by law to assess the performance of PHAs in all major  areas of management operations, including implementing effective  screening and eviction policies and other anticrime strategies. In  addition, federal internal control standards indicate that management  should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to  risks. However, HUD\u2019s checklist does not address PHAs\u2019 criminal  history policies in a comprehensive manner. For example, it generally  does not require field staff to go beyond reviewing written policies and  obtaining additional information on how the policies are being  implemented. In addition, field staff are not required to address some  federal requirements, such as PHAs\u2019 use of arrest records. According to  agency officials, HUD issued the arrest record notice in response to  information indicating that PHAs were basing denial decisions on whether  an individual had been arrested, which is not sufficient evidence of  criminal activity. In our interviews of 10 selected PHAs, as discussed  above, officials from one PHA described practices that were not in line  with its written policy on the use of arrest records. Specifically, the  officials stated that they make housing assistance decisions based on  arrest records though their policies state they will not. Another PHA had  not updated its written policy to reflect its practice of not basing decisions  on arrest records. HUD officials stated that, due to resource issues, they  developed the checklist to address high-risk areas, but that they planned  to review the checklist again after the guidebooks are updated. By  reviewing the checklist to determine what additional criminal history policy  requirements should be included and revising the checklist instructions to  direct staff to obtain information on PHAs\u2019 implementation of criminal  history policy requirements, HUD could improve its ability to identify areas  of noncompliance.

According to HUD OIG officials, the HUD OIG  generally does not pursue tenant fraud cases as part of the Fugitive Felon  Initiative, although the MOU lists this as one of the purposes of the  initiative. Specifically, the MOU states that in addition to apprehending  fugitive felons, the secondary purpose of the initiative is to investigate,  identify, and refer for prosecution individuals who fraudulently receive  HUD benefits.

The MOU states that HUD OIG regional  offices should not refer cases to PHAs for administrative action for 60  days after the FBI sends the lead letter to law enforcement. However, the  MOU does not specify how HUD OIG regional offices will be notified  about when the 60-day period begins. In addition, officials from HUD OIG  regional offices had differing understandings of when this 60-day period  begins, and officials from one region stated that they had only recently  become aware that there was a 60-day waiting period. Further, the  current MOU does not reflect new language in the HUD OIG\u2019s 2018 SOP  that allows HUD OIG regional offices to make referrals to PHAs if the  subject of the warrant is on the Prioritized Fugitive Felon List and is  apprehended before the 60-day period expires.", "HUD OIG Interaction with Law Enforcement.

By completing its  planned updates of program guidebooks to reflect this guidance, HUD  could help ensure that PHA staff know and follow HUD\u2019s current guidance  on criminal history policies. In addition, HUD could improve its ability to  identify and address potential noncompliance by determining what  additional criminal history requirements to include in its compliance  reviews and obtaining additional information on how PHAs are  implementing their policies as part of these reviews.", "Through the Fugitive Felon Initiative, the HUD OIG and the FBI undertook  efforts that led to over 1,200 apprehensions of wanted persons in the past  5 years. During the course of our review, the HUD OIG updated its  procedures for the initiative in an effort to better define regional office  responsibilities and improve the consistency of their participation, as well  as to leverage the FBI\u2019s efforts. However, collecting and assessing more  comprehensive information on the extent to which regional offices are  implementing these new procedures would better enable the HUD OIG to  determine the extent to which its regional offices are fulfilling their  responsibilities and identify areas for improvement.

We disagree. According to the 2018 SOP, the HUD OIG will be  responsible for collecting and reporting statistics for some regional office  activities, such as the number of referrals. As discussed in this report, we  believe the HUD OIG could obtain more comprehensive information on  additional required regional activities using existing resources, such as  through periodic data calls to regions. Such assessments of regional  office activities are particularly important given that regional offices had  not consistently participated in the Fugitive Felon Initiative in the past.

We focused on the public  housing and HCV programs because PHAs screen applicants and  determine eligibility for these programs, whereas property owners are  primarily responsible for these functions for other HUD rental assistance  programs. In addition, the HCV program is the U.S. government\u2019s largest  rental assistance program. In addition, we interviewed officials from HUD  headquarters as well as officials in five HUD field offices and 10 PHAs in  four selected metropolitan areas: Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, New York  City, and Philadelphia. We used a cluster sampling technique to select  the four metropolitan areas. In selecting these areas, we considered  geographic location and proximity of HUD field offices and HUD OIG  regional offices to each other, whether there were options to visit a variety  of differently sized PHAs that had different characteristics (such as ones  that managed both the public housing and HCV programs or had a law  enforcement department), and participation of HUD OIG regional offices  in the Fugitive Felon Initiative. In each of the four selected metropolitan  areas, we selected two to three PHAs to visit, for a total nongeneralizable  sample of 10 PHAs (see table 5). In selecting PHAs, we considered PHA  size (as measured by the number of public housing and HCV units),  whether the PHA implemented both public housing and HCV programs,  distance in miles between a PHA and the HUD and HUD OIG metro area  offices, and whether a PHA was in an urban or nonurban location and  had a law enforcement department.", "We selected five HUD field offices by determining which field office  oversees each of the selected PHAs.
