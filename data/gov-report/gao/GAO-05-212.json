Many legislative proposals have been made to consolidate the U.S. food safety system, but to date no other action has been taken. Several countries have taken steps to streamline and consolidate their food safety systems. In 1999, we reported on the initial experiences of four of these countries--Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Since then, additional countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, have undertaken consolidations. This report describes the approaches and challenges these countries faced in consolidating food safety functions, including the benefits and costs cited by government officials and other stakeholders. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS and USDA said that the countries' consolidation experiences have limited applicability to the U.S. food safety system because the countries are much smaller than the United States. The two agencies believe that they are working together effectively to ensure the safety of the food supply."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In consolidating their food safety systems, the seven countries we examined--Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom--varied in their approaches and the extent to which they consolidated. However, the countries' approaches were similar in one respect--each established a single agency to lead food safety management or enforcement of food safety legislation. These countries had two primary reasons for consolidating their food safety systems--public concern about the safety of the food supply and the need to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. Countries faced challenges in (1) deciding whether to place the agency within the existing health or agriculture ministry or establish it as a stand-alone agency while also determining what responsibilities the new agency would have and (2) helping employees adjust to the new agency's culture and support its priorities. Although none of the countries has analyzed the results of its consolidation, government officials consistently stated that the net effect of their country's consolidation has been or will likely be beneficial. Officials in most countries stated their new food safety agencies incurred consolidation start-up costs. However, in each country, government officials believe that consolidation costs have been or will likely be exceeded by the benefits. These officials and food industry and consumer stakeholders cited significant qualitative improvements in the effectiveness or efficiency of their food safety systems. These improvements include less overlap in inspections, greater clarity in responsibilities, and more consistent or timely enforcement of food safety laws and regulations. In addition to these qualitative benefits, officials from three countries, Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands, identified areas where they believe financial savings may be achieved as a result of consolidation. For example, in the Netherlands officials said that reduced duplication in food safety inspections would likely result in decreased food safety spending and that they anticipate savings from an expected 25 percent reduction in administrative and management personnel. Although the seven countries we reviewed are much smaller than the United States, they are also high-income countries where consumers have very high expectations for food safety. Consequently, we believe that the countries' experiences in consolidating food safety systems can offer useful information to U.S. policymakers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, the federal food safety system in the  United States emerged piecemeal, over many decades, typically in response  to particular health threats or economic crises. The result is a fragmented  legal and organizational structure that gives responsibility for specific food  commodities to different agencies and provides them with significantly  different authorities to enforce food safety laws. In fiscal year 2003, the  principal federal agencies with food safety responsibilities spent nearly  $1.7 billion to ensure the safety and quality of the U.S. food supply.", "Many legislative proposals have been made to reform existing laws and  consolidate the U.S. food safety system, but to date no action has been  taken. Most recently, in 2004, parallel Senate and House bills proposed  combining the food safety regulatory programs of the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), within  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the voluntary  seafood inspection program operated by the Department of Commerce.", "Several countries have taken steps to streamline and consolidate food  safety functions. In 1999, we reported on the experiences of four  countries\u2014Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom\u2014that were  consolidating their food safety systems. In response to your interest in  learning about these and other countries\u2019 experiences with consolidation,  we updated information on the countries covered in the 1999 report and  included information on three other countries that have also undertaken  consolidation efforts\u2014Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. This  report describes the approaches these seven countries have taken in  consolidating food safety functions, the challenges they faced, and the  results of the countries\u2019 efforts, including benefits and costs cited by  government officials and industry or consumer stakeholders.", "To develop this information, we examined the seven countries\u2019 efforts to  streamline and consolidate their food safety systems, including the  benefits and costs that resulted, as cited by government officials. We  conducted structured interviews with senior government officials from  food safety, agriculture, and health agencies and with representatives of  food industry and consumer organizations, reviewed and analyzed the  documents they provided, and reviewed World Health Organization and  GAO reports. We also met with European Union (EU) food safety officials  to discuss how the EU\u2019s food legislation is affecting its member countries\u2019  decisions to consolidate, as well as how the EU interacts with food safety  agencies in member countries. The information on countries\u2019 food safety  systems in this report, including descriptions of laws, is based almost  exclusively on interviews with and documentation provided by high-level  food safety officials as well as food industry or consumer stakeholders  from the seven countries we examined. Most of the information we  obtained was qualitative. To the extent possible, we corroborated the  qualitative information provided by government officials by interviewing  food industry and consumer organization stakeholders. We obtained very  limited quantitative information. We asked government officials questions  intended to help us assess the reliability of the quantitative information  they provided, but we could not determine the reliability of most of this  information because of constraints on the amount of time the countries\u2019  food safety officials could devote to our study. Although we could not  assess the quantitative information\u2019s reliability, we are reporting it in order  to provide descriptive information that will inform policymakers in the  United States about the various approaches, challenges, and benefits that  countries\u2019 officials identified to us regarding their consolidation efforts.", "Appendix I provides more information on our scope and methodology. We  conducted our work from April 2004 through December 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["While the U.S. food supply is generally safe, each year, according to a  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate, tens of  millions of Americans become ill and thousands die from eating unsafe  food. Furthermore, USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service has estimated that  the costs associated with foodborne illnesses are about $7 billion, including  medical costs and productivity losses from missed work.", "The safety and quality of the U.S. food supply is governed by a complex  system that is administered by 15 agencies. The principal federal agencies  with food safety responsibilities operate under numerous statutes  underpinning the federal framework for ensuring the safety and quality of  the food supply in the United States. These laws give the agencies different  regulatory and enforcement authorities, and about 70 interagency  agreements aim to coordinate the combined food safety oversight  responsibilities of the various agencies. The federal system is  supplemented by the states, which have their own statutes, regulations,  and agencies for regulating and inspecting the safety and quality of food  products.", "USDA and FDA have primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of  foods. USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service regulates meat, poultry,  and certain egg products, and FDA regulates the safety of all other foods,  including milk, seafood, and fruits and vegetables. The Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on the amount of pesticide residues  that are allowed in food, and the National Marine Fisheries Service within  the Department of Commerce provides fee-for-service inspections to  ensure the safety and/or quality of commercial seafood. Similarly, USDA\u2019s  Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) performs food quality assurance  inspections that include food safety elements. In addition to their  established food safety responsibilities, USDA, FDA, and EPA, along with  the Department of Homeland Security, have begun to address food  security. Figure 1 summarizes the 15 agencies and their food safety  responsibilities.", "Many proposals have been made to consolidate the U.S. food safety system,  but to date no action has been taken. Several bills introduced in the  Congress, reports by the National Academy of Sciences and the National  Commission on the Public Service, and several of our reports and  testimonies have proposed consolidation of the U.S. food safety system.  For example, in 2001, parallel Senate and House bills proposed  consolidating inspections and other food safety responsibilities in a single  independent agency. In 2004, legislation was again introduced in the Senate  and the House to establish a single food safety agency to protect public  health, ensure food safety, and improve research and food security. This  proposed legislation would combine the two food safety regulatory  programs of USDA and FDA, along with a voluntary seafood inspection  program operated by the Department of Commerce. The proposed new  food safety program would have been based on a comprehensive analysis  of the hazards associated with different foods and their processing and  would require, among other things, the enforcement of the adoption of  process controls in food establishments as well as the establishment and  enforcement of science-based standards.", "In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences recommended integrating the  U.S. food safety system and suggested several options, including a single  food safety agency. More recently, the National Commission on the Public  Service recommended that government programs that are designed to  achieve similar outcomes be combined into one agency and that agencies  with similar or related missions be combined into large departments. The  Commission chairman testified before a House subcommittee that  important health and safety protections fail when responsibility for  regulation is dispersed among several departments, as is the case with the  U.S. food safety system.", "The division of responsibility among several government agencies  responsible for food safety is not unique to the United States. Food safety  officials in the countries we selected for this review said they faced similar  divisions of responsibilities and that their countries\u2019 reorganizations were  intended to address this problem.", "Although the seven countries whose food safety systems we reviewed are  much smaller in population than the United States, they, like the United  States, are high-income countries where consumers have very high  expectations for food safety. Table 1 presents data on population, size of  economy, food expenditures, and consumer spending for food as a  percentage of total consumer spending for the seven countries and the  United States. The table shows that U.S. consumers\u2019 spending on food as a  percentage of their total spending is somewhat similar to that of the other  seven countries, ranging from about 10 percent in the United States to over  16 percent in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In general, high-income  countries tend to spend a smaller percentage of their income on food than  low-income countries. For instance, in low-income countries consumers\u2019  spending for food often exceeds 50 percent of their total spending.", "Most of the countries we selected for this review are members of the EU  and, as such, must abide by EU food safety legislation. The development  and implementation of EU food safety legislation is the responsibility of the  Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General. In 2002, to respond  to consumer concerns about the safety of the food supply, the EU created a  new independent food safety institution, the European Food Safety  Authority (EFSA), which is responsible for providing independent,  scientific advice on all matters linked to food and animal feed safety. The  tasks performed by EFSA include communicating with the public on food  safety matters and providing risk assessments to the European  Commission, the European Parliament, and the EU Member States.", "In addition to creating EFSA in April 2004, the EU adopted additional,  comprehensive food safety legislation that becomes effective, in large  part, on January 1, 2006. Together with the earlier regulation establishing  EFSA, the legislation is intended to create a single, transparent set of EU  food safety rules applicable to all food, including animal and nonanimal  products. The legislation covers the entire food supply chain from  production to consumption and places more requirements on EU member  nations. It identifies specific food safety objectives and, unlike much of the  EU\u2019s previous food safety legislation, specifies the methods by which those  objectives must be achieved. For example, it requires food business  operators to adopt specific hygiene measures and a permanent procedure  or procedures based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point  principles. Moreover, the legislation requires that each EU country  establish and implement an official food and animal feed control plan by  January 1, 2007. Thereafter, an annual report on the implementation of this  national control plan must be submitted. To carry out its official controls  over food and animal feed, a country must designate responsible entities. If  a country has more than one responsible entity, it must ensure effective  coordination between these entities. According to a paper presented at a  2004 international forum for food safety regulators, in recent years many  EU countries have chosen to establish a national food safety authority, but  the establishment of such an authority is not obligatory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Countries Have Taken Various Consolidation Approaches, and Officials and Stakeholders Cited Challenges and Costs but Believe Food Safety Systems Are Now More Effective", "paragraphs": ["The seven countries we examined had two primary reasons for  reorganizing and consolidating their food safety systems, took various  approaches, and often faced similar challenges. While the extent to which  countries consolidated their food safety systems varied considerably, each  country established a single agency to lead food safety management or  enforcement of food safety legislation. Although most countries incurred  some consolidation start-up costs, government officials, as well as food  industry and consumer stakeholders, generally agree that consolidation  has led to significant qualitative improvements in the effectiveness or  efficiency of their food safety systems. Our ability to evaluate these  improvements and other information officials provided was limited  because none of the countries has conducted an analysis to measure the  effectiveness and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system relative  to that of the previous system. In some cases, it may be too early to fully  assess the benefits of the countries\u2019 consolidations.", "The seven countries whose reorganizations we reviewed consolidated their  food safety systems primarily to improve program effectiveness and  efficiency or to respond to public concern about food safety.", "According to a 1998 National Research Council report, an effective food  safety system protects and improves the public health by ensuring that  foods meet science-based safety standards through the integrated activities  of the public and private sectors. This report also addresses efficiency,  stating the greatest strides in ensuring food safety from production to  consumption can be made through a scientific risk-based system that  ensures that surveillance, regulatory, and research resources are allocated  to maximize effectiveness. Public concern about food safety became an  important issue in several industrialized countries during the 1990s when  bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow  disease, was confirmed in large numbers of cattle. In addition to  improving effectiveness and efficiency and responding to public concern  about food safety, some EU countries were further prompted to  consolidate by the need to comply with recently approved EU food safety  legislation that becomes effective, in large part, January 1, 2006. The new  legislation places more requirements on EU member countries. For  example, each EU member country will be required to submit and annually  update a plan for the implementation of the new law and to report annually  on the implementation of that plan.", "Regarding consolidation approaches, each country established a single  agency to lead food safety management or enforcement of food safety  legislation. Each country modified its existing legal framework to give legal  authority and responsibility to the new food safety agency. However,  countries\u2019 approaches in consolidating their food safety systems varied,  particularly with respect to how comprehensively food safety functions  were consolidated. For example, Denmark centralized its system by  creating a new federal agency in which it consolidated almost all its food  safety functions and activities, including food inspections, which were  previously distributed among several federal and local government  agencies. On the other hand, in Germany, which established a new lead  food safety agency, the 16 federal states continue to be responsible for  oversight of food inspections performed by local governments. Germany\u2019s  new food safety agency functions as a coordinating body to lead food  safety management, including formulation of general administrative rules  to guide the federal states\u2019 implementation of national food safety laws.", "In reorganizing their food safety systems, officials from several countries  cited challenges in two areas. First, many countries faced a similar decision  regarding whether to place the new agency within the existing health or  agriculture ministry or establish it as a stand-alone agency while also  determining what responsibilities the new agency would have. A second  challenge, cited by officials in several countries, was helping employees  assimilate into the new agency\u2019s culture and support its priorities.", "Although countries have not formally analyzed consolidation results, the  government officials and stakeholders we interviewed in each of the seven  countries cited improvements in food safety system operations and stated  that the net effect of consolidation has been or will likely be positive. None  of the countries has conducted an analysis to measure the effectiveness  and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system relative to that of the  previous system. For example, officials stated that they could not  determine whether their country\u2019s consolidation had resulted in public  health benefits, such as reduced foodborne illness, because consolidation  was only one of many factors that could affect the frequency of foodborne  illness. Furthermore, it may be too early to fully assess the benefits of  consolidation for several of the countries, as their countries\u2019 new food  safety structures have been functioning for 3 years or less. Although  limited, some information on costs and benefits was available. As  expected, most countries incurred start-up costs, which included, for  example, the acquisition of buildings and purchases of laboratory  equipment. Some countries experienced a temporary reduction in the  quantity of food safety activities performed due to consolidation-related  disruptions. However, government officials in each of the seven countries  believe the benefits of their consolidations have exceeded or will likely  exceed the costs. In particular, these officials, as well as food industry and  consumer stakeholders in each country, consistently stated that  consolidation of their food safety systems has led to significant qualitative  improvements in food safety operations that enhance effectiveness or  efficiency. These improvements include the reduction of overlapping food  safety activities, such as inspections of food establishments by various  agencies. (Figure 2 summarizes each country\u2019s improvements in food  safety operations as cited by government officials, food industry  stakeholders, or consumer stakeholders.) Moreover, government officials  in Canada, the Netherlands, and Denmark stated that some cost savings  may be achieved as a result of changes that have already taken place or are  expected from planned changes needed to complete their consolidation  efforts.", "Figures 3 through 9 show summary information on each country\u2019s reasons  for consolidation, entities responsible for food safety before and after  consolidation, challenges, and start-up and other consolidation-related  costs, as well as examples of consolidation benefits.

As we learned from food safety officials and industry and  consumer stakeholders in each country we reviewed, such reforms may  result in benefits such as reducing overlaps in food safety inspections and  basing the frequency of inspections on the risks posed by specific products.  We have reported in the past that the federal food safety system in the  United States could benefit from statutory and organizational reforms.

In  addition, our report acknowledges that these officials provided limited  quantitative data; when it was provided to us, we included it in the report.  Our report also acknowledges that none of the countries has conducted a  formal analysis to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of its  consolidated food safety system with that of the previous system. HHS also  commented that the countries included in our report have smaller food and  agriculture industries than the United States. We agree, and our report  highlights such differences in table 1, which shows that the seven countries  have smaller economies and less total food consumption than the United  States. Our report also points out, however, that these countries are similar  to the United States in that they are high-income countries where  consumers have high expectations for food safety. Finally, HHS  commented that the report does not identify the agencies that are  responsible for foodborne illness surveillance in each of the countries we  reviewed. We have added a footnote to indicate that the report does not  contain that information. HHS also provided technical comments, which  we have incorporated in the report as appropriate.

Specifically, with regard to the  effect of consolidation on public health benefits, the report states that  officials told us they could not determine whether their country\u2019s  consolidation had reduced foodborne illness because consolidation was  one of many factors that could influence the frequency of foodborne  illness. USDA also stated that the report does not contain quantitative data  on reorganization costs. This statement is incorrect. All but one of the  seven countries provided information on the costs of reorganization, which  the report presents in figures 3 through 9. Similar to HHS, USDA  commented that the countries we reviewed have much smaller populations  and also differ from the United States in climate and agricultural  production. Our report identifies differences of this type in table 1.

In addition, multiple agencies were tasked with  enforcing food safety legislation with no central accountability system in  place to ensure that food safety legislation was being properly enforced or  to coordinate food safety functions and activities across the food supply  chain.", "As a result of a series of food scares in the 1990s, the Irish government  undertook a review of its food safety system in 1996 to assure the safety  and quality of their food products. The government\u2019s review eventually led  to the establishment of a lead food safety agency. The government  established an interdepartmental committee to advise the Irish parliament  on how the various food safety entities could best be coordinated. In early  1997, this committee recommended establishing a Food Safety Authority of  Ireland. Under this recommendation, the responsibility for implementation  of food safety laws would have remained with the existing agencies. The  Authority would have audited these agencies and had a voice in setting and  maintaining standards as well as in promoting good practices. Before this  recommendation was enacted, a new government took office after an  election in mid-1997. The new government believed that the Authority  should be directly accountable for all food safety functions, including  enforcement of food legislation. This proposal led to the establishment of  the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), formally established in law  under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, and beginning its  official operation in January 1999. The legislation which established the  FSAI provides for the transfer of all relevant staff to the new agency.  Alternatively it provides that the FSAI can enter into a service contract with  existing agencies for the enforcement of food legislation.

The  study revealed that a majority of respondents considered food safety  standards to be improving, although concerns remain about specific foods,  such as chicken; food outlets; and other food-related issues, including  salmonella. Only one-third of the survey\u2019s respondents stated that they  were confident in the level of monitoring and enforcement of food safety  standards. Despite these concerns, officials of a consumer organization  stated that the creation of NZFSA was a very positive step that was strongly  supported by consumers, and that the agency was too new for consumer  confidence levels to have significantly increased at the time of the survey.", "An official representing a food industry organization in New Zealand stated  that the organization, along with others, had advocated the establishment  of a single food safety agency for years. The official stated the previous  system was piecemeal and inefficient, due to coordination problems  associated with two ministries having food safety responsibilities and  neither ministry placing a high priority on food safety. As a result of the  establishment of NZFSA, the industry is more confident in how the nation  handles food safety. One official stated that as a result of the consolidation,  the use of available resources for food safety activities is more efficient  because food safety resources are located in one agency instead of  fragmented between two ministries. In addition, the official stated that  consumer confidence levels have improved due to an increase in the  government\u2019s responsiveness to food safety crises. According to the  official, NZFSA has a responsive network that quickly delivers information  to notify the public of food safety issues. Finally, the official stated that  NZFSA has significantly improved transparency and remains committed to  ongoing discussions with its many stakeholder groups. For example, in  responding to reports of increased iodine levels in children, NZFSA began  discussions immediately with endocrinologists, other doctors, and with  food industry representatives to address the issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The United Kingdom\u2019s Food Safety System Consolidation", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, the Queen, by and with the consent of Parliament, enacted  legislation to establish the independent Food Standards Agency, which  went into effect on April 1, 2000."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reasons for Consolidating Food Safety Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Officials stated that the United Kingdom consolidated its food safety  system due to a loss of public confidence in food safety, which largely  resulted from the government\u2019s perceived mishandling of BSE.
