Examples of these factors include the following:", "Fossil energy. Advances in drilling technologies enabled economic production of natural gas and crude oil from shale and similar geological formations. These advances led to increases in domestic production of natural gas and crude oil beginning around 2008 and contributed to declines in domestic prices of natural gas, as well as lower prices for crude oil in some regions of the United States. Some federal activities also may have influenced these trends. For example, the federal government limited oil producers' liability associated with some oil spills, lowering the producers' costs for liability insurance. In addition, the federal government provided tax incentives encouraging production for oil and gas producers, resulting in billions of dollars in estimated federal revenue losses. Moreover, partly because of lower natural gas prices, domestic coal production decreased in recent years as utilities switched from coal to natural gas for electricity generation.", "Nuclear energy. Declining prices for a competing energy source\u2014natural gas\u2014may have led to decreases in the production and consumption of nuclear energy in recent years. Federal activities may have also influenced this trend. For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced plans to terminate its work to license a disposal facility for certain nuclear power plant waste in 2009, creating uncertainty about how this waste would be managed. This uncertainty may have provided a disincentive for some nuclear power operators to stay in the market or expand capacity because of the cost of storing nuclear waste.", "Renewable energy. Federal tax credits for ethanol and federal policies requiring the use of ethanol in transportation fuels were major factors influencing an 8-fold increase in the production and consumption of ethanol from 2000 to 2013. In addition, state policies requiring the use of renewable energy in electricity production, as well as federal outlays and tax credits for renewable energy producers, were major factors influencing a 30-fold increase and a 19-fold increase in production and consumption of electricity from wind and solar energy, respectively, from 2000 to 2013.", "According to the studies and reports GAO reviewed, other federal activities may have influenced aspects of U.S. energy production and consumption from 2000 through 2013 but were not targeted at a specific energy source. For example, the federal government strengthened energy efficiency standards for vehicle fuel economy and consumer products such as appliances and lighting, provided electricity and transmission services to customers through its power marketing administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and spent billions of dollars helping low-income households cover heating and cooling costs. In addition, the federal government supported research and development targeting a wide range of energy-related technologies at government-owned laboratories and through funding to universities and other research entities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Americans\u2019 daily lives, as well as the economic productivity of the United  States, depend on energy. Most sectors of American society rely upon a  readily available and affordable supply of energy to function. However,  the production and consumption of energy involve economic and  environmental trade-offs. For example, fossil energy provides relatively  inexpensive sources of fuels that power automobiles, generate electricity,  and power industrial processes. However, burning these fuels increases  air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, according to the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). According to the Congressional  Research Service (CRS), federal energy policy since the 1970s has  focused primarily on ensuring a secure supply of energy while protecting  the environment.", "In pursuing the goals of a secure energy supply and a healthy  environment, the federal government subsidizes or otherwise provides  support to energy companies and consumers. For example, the federal  government provides tax incentives and other support to promote the  domestic production of energy (including the extraction of coal, oil, and  natural gas) and the development of renewable energy (including wind  and solar power). The federal government also intervenes in energy  markets in other ways, such as setting standards and requirements  (through laws and regulations) that may not be directed at specific  sources of energy but that nonetheless may influence the types and  quantities of energy that are produced or consumed. For example, the  federal government promotes energy efficiency through appliance  efficiency standards that are written into law and regulates pollutants that  are created in the production and consumption of energy.", "The federal government has established a number of important energy  policies over the past decade, and several federal organizations have  studied some of the costs associated with these policies. For example,  Congress passed several key laws affecting energy producers and  consumers over the past 10 years, including the Energy Policy Act of  2005 (EPAct), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA),  and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery  Act). Several federal organizations, including the Department of Energy\u2019s  (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA), CRS, and the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO), have published reports identifying  and quantifying aspects of federal support for energy production and  consumption associated with these policies.

Fossil energy comes from coal,  natural gas, crude oil, and petroleum products. Nuclear energy comes  from uranium, which is mined and processed into nuclear fuel. This fuel  undergoes nuclear fission in a nuclear reactor to produce heat, which is  converted into electricity using steam turbine technology. Renewable  energy comes from a variety of sources, including biomass, which is  organic material from plants and animals and includes liquid biofuels  (such as ethanol and biodiesel), wood, and waste (such as municipal  solid waste and agricultural byproducts); hydroelectric power; geothermal;  wind; and solar. Many sources of renewable energy are converted into  electricity before being consumed. The United States domestically  produces most of the energy it consumes. However, it also imports a  portion, mostly in the form of crude oil and petroleum products.", "In 2013, the United States consumed over 97 quadrillion British thermal  units (Btu) of energy, including over 12 quadrillion Btus of imported  energy, according to EIA data. As shown in figure 1, most of this energy  (or about 82 percent) came from fossil energy sources. The rest came  from renewable and nuclear energy sources.", "There are four major sectors of the U.S. economy that consume energy at  the point of end use:  the industrial sector, which includes facilities and equipment used for  manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction;  the transportation sector, which generally comprises vehicles (such as  cars, trucks, buses, trains, aircraft, and boats, among others) that  transport people or goods;  the residential sector, which consists of homes and apartments; and  the commercial sector, which includes buildings such as offices,  malls, stores, schools, hospitals, hotels, warehouses, restaurants, and  places of worship, among others, as well as federal, state, and local  facilities and equipment.", "End-use sectors obtain energy from different combinations of sources.  The industrial sector mainly consumes natural gas and electricity but also  uses some petroleum products as feedstock. The transportation sector  mainly consumes gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel; it also consumes biofuels  and natural gas, as well as small amounts of electricity. The residential  and commercial sectors mainly consume energy from electricity and  natural gas but also use some petroleum products. As described above,  every sector consumes electricity produced by the electric power sector,  which takes electricity generated from fossil, nuclear, or renewable  energy and delivers it to the end-use sectors through transmission and  distribution lines. As shown in figure 2, the industrial sector consumed the  largest share of energy (32 percent or 31.3 quadrillion Btus) in 2013,  followed by the transportation, residential, and commercial sectors.", "Not all of the energy produced is available for consumption at the point of  end use, mainly because energy losses occur whenever energy is  converted from one form to another. For example, coal-fueled power  plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to heat water and  produce steam. The steam, at tremendous pressure and temperature,  flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to produce electricity. During  this process, the burning of coal produces heat energy, some of which  converts water into steam. In turn, some of the energy in the steam is  converted into electrical energy. At each point in this process, some of the  original energy contained in the coal is lost. According to EIA, about two- thirds of the energy consumed to generate electricity is lost in conversion,  and most of these losses occur in fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants  that generate steam to turn turbines.", "According to general economic principles, a number of factors may affect  the production and consumption of energy. These factors include the  following:", "Changes in the supply of energy relative to changes in demand may  affect the price that consumers pay. For example, if the supply of  gasoline increases faster than the demand for it, the price of gasoline  will most likely decrease. In contrast, if the demand for gasoline  increases faster than the ability to supply it, the price of gasoline will  most likely increase.", "Prices of energy provide signals to producers and consumers and  may affect their behavior. For example, lower gasoline prices provide  an incentive for consumers to consume more gasoline, while higher  gasoline prices provide an incentive for consumers to consume less  gasoline. (However, incentives or disincentives may not actually  change behavior if they are insufficient to outweigh other factors or  considerations.)", "Costs associated with producing energy provide signals to producers  and may affect their behavior. For example, lower production costs  provide an incentive for oil companies to produce more gasoline,  while higher production costs provide an incentive for oil companies to  produce less gasoline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Influencing Overall U.S. Energy Production and Consumption", "paragraphs": ["Three important factors\u2014energy efficiency, energy conservation, and the  global economic recession of 2007 to 2009\u2014had a major influence on  U.S. energy production and consumption over the past decade but  generally affected all energy producers and consumers rather than  affecting only a specific source of energy. The first two factors are related  but have distinct meanings. Energy efficiency is the use of technology  that requires less energy to perform the same function, such as using a  compact fluorescent light bulb in place of an incandescent bulb. Energy  conservation is any behavior that results in the use of less energy, such  as turning the lights off when you leave the room. Both energy efficiency  and conservation reduce our consumption of energy and thereby  influence the total amount of energy produced and consumed in the  United States.", "Some data suggest that the United States increased the efficiency with  which it used energy from 2000 to 2013. For example, according to  Federal Highway Administration data, the fuel economy of U.S. motor  vehicles increased from an average of 16.9 miles per gallon in 2000 to  17.6 miles per gallon in 2012 (the latest year for which data are  available). Another measure of the efficiency with which the United States  uses its energy is to compare U.S. energy consumption with the U.S.  gross domestic product, which is a measure of the value of all final goods  and services produced within the United States in a given period. By  making this comparison, we can measure whether it takes less energy  over time to produce the same value of goods and services. According to  EIA data, the consumption of energy per dollar value of gross domestic  product decreased from about 7,900 Btus per dollar in 2000 to about  6,200 Btus per dollar in 2013, indicating that the United States became  more energy efficient.", "The third factor, the global economic recession of 2007 to 2009, resulted  in reduced economic activity in general, which reduced energy demand  and had long-term effects on global energy markets. For example,  according to a 2009 International Energy Agency report, the recession\u2019s  effects on both energy producers and consumers included the following:", "Energy companies drilled fewer oil and gas wells and reduced  spending on refineries, pipelines, and power stations.", "Businesses and households spent less on energy-using appliances,  equipment, and vehicles.", "Tighter credit and lower prices made investment in energy savings  less attractive financially, while the economic crisis encouraged  energy consumers to reduce overall spending.

Without such licenses, firms  cannot operate nuclear reactors and generate electricity from nuclear  energy. Other laws and regulations focus on the effects of economic  activity on the health and welfare of citizens. For example, under the  Clean Air Act, EPA is responsible for regulating emissions of a variety of  air pollutants from coal-fueled power plants and other energy producers.  While laws and regulations vary widely in how they are designed, they  tend to function by influencing the decisions of producers and consumers  in the market. In addition, laws and regulations may impose a variety of  costs, such as costs on regulated entities to comply with the laws and  regulations (\u201ccompliance costs\u201d), and costs on government agencies to  administer and enforce them.

Government provision of goods or services may be  deemed necessary to address certain circumstances, such as economic  inequalities among segments of the public or a need for a good or service  considered unlikely to be met by the private sector.

For  example, if the federal government assumes the risk of default on a loan  to a manufacturer of turbines (that generate electricity from wind energy),  nonfederal lenders may offer a lower interest rate to the manufacturer  than they would in the absence of the federal guarantee.

One  prominent method is through the tax system, which includes personal  income taxes, corporate income taxes, and excise taxes based on the  value of goods and services sold, among other types of taxes. The  primary purpose of the federal tax system is to collect the revenue  needed to fund the operations of the federal government. Taxes may alter  taxpayers\u2019 behavior by inducing them to shift resources from higher-taxed  uses to lower-taxed uses in an effort to reduce tax liability.", "The federal government also collects revenues associated with its  management of federal lands. The federal government owns and  manages roughly 30 percent of the nation\u2019s total surface area (or about  700 million acres onshore). It also has jurisdiction and control over the  outer continental shelf, which includes about 1.8 billion acres of  submerged lands in federal waters off the coast of Alaska, in the Gulf of  Mexico, and off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The federal government  leases federal lands for the production of oil, gas, minerals such as coal,  or other resources. In exchange, the government generally collects  revenues, including payments in the form of rents and bonuses, which are  required to secure and maintain a lease, and royalties, which are based  on the value of the minerals that are extracted.", "However, the federal government may choose to forgo certain revenues.  Tax expenditures are tax provisions that are exceptions to the \u201cnormal  structure\u201d of individual and corporate income tax necessary to collect  federal revenue. These preferences can have the same effects as  government spending programs; hence the name tax expenditures. The  Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 identified  six types of tax provisions that are considered tax expenditures when they  are exceptions to the normal tax, as described in table 1. Tax  expenditures may affect the behavior of energy producers and consumers  by providing an incentive to engage in certain types of activities. For  some tax expenditures, forgone revenues can be of the same magnitude  or larger than related federal spending for some mission areas.", "In addition to forgoing tax revenues, the federal government may choose  to forgo revenues associated with its leases of federal lands and waters.  \u201cRoyalty relief\u201d is a waiver or reduction of royalties that companies would  otherwise be obligated to pay for their leases of federal lands or waters.

The  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) instituted several  changes to CAFE standards in 2007, such as moving from a single fleet  standard to an attribute-based standard. In 2009, the U.S. administration  announced a new policy to increase vehicle fuel economy by  strengthening CAFE standards and aligning them with the first  greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles, which would be  administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The  Department of Transportation and EPA established a national program for  these two sets of standards by issuing coordinated regulations covering  vehicle model years 2012 to 2025 in May 2010 and October 2012.  Vehicle manufacturers will have to meet more stringent fuel economy  standards, which are projected to be equivalent to over 50 miles per  gallon by 2025.", "In addition, since the 1970s, the federal government has established  minimum efficiency standards requiring that certain products, such as  residential appliances, commercial equipment, and lighting products,  meet specified energy efficiency standards before they can be sold in the  United States. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required  the Department of Energy (DOE) to set minimum energy-efficiency  standards for manufacturers of specified categories of consumer products  such as refrigerators, dishwashers, furnaces, and hot water heaters. The  statute was later amended (e.g., by the Energy Policy Act of 2005   and EISA) to include additional categories of consumer products.

The statute  further requires DOE to set and periodically review and revise standards  for these product categories to achieve the maximum level of energy  efficiency that is technically feasible and economically justified.", "The federal standards for vehicle fuel economy and for energy efficiency  standards in products provided disincentives for overall energy production  and consumption. Specifically, as we concluded in August 2007, the  CAFE program reduced oil consumption by cars and light trucks from  what it would have otherwise been, and the evidence suggested that  increasing CAFE standards would save additional oil in the future. In  addition, as we found in March 2013, DOE estimated that, from the  inception of the federal minimum efficiency standards program in 1975  through 2005, consumer benefits from these standards amounted to  about $64 billion.
