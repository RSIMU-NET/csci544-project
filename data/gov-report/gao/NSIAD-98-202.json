Moreover, the UNAIDS Secretariat recently reported that more than 90 percent of the 5.8 million new infections in 1997 (up from 3.1 million in 1996) were in developing countries (see fig. 1.2). Sub-Saharan Africa has the worst infection rate, accounting for 3.4 million new infections in 1997. In that region,  7.4 percent of people aged 15 to 49 are infected. Estimates for South and South-East Asia indicate the disease is also rapidly spreading in that region, with 6.4 million currently living with HIV/AIDS and 1.3 million new infections in 1997.", "Established market economies include North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.", "In many developing countries, HIV/AIDS has begun to erode decades of gains in health, child survival, life expectancy, education, and economic development. For example, U.S. Bureau of the Census projections for Zambia indicate that by 2010, AIDS may increase infant mortality rates nearly 60 percent higher than would have been expected without the disease. Similarly, projections for Zimbabwe indicate that by 2010, life expectancy will decline from 70 years to less than 35 years as a result of AIDS and in Uganda from 54.5 years to 35.5 years. Since the start of the epidemic, more than 8 million children have lost either their mother or their father because of AIDS. AIDS\u2019 impact on families and public health systems is weakening economies as people in their prime working years are afflicted by the disease and governments and families divert scarce resources to care for them for extended periods of time.", "The donor community is spending approximately $250 million a year to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the developing world. The United States is the largest single donor, contributing $117 million in 1997 through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that includes specific support for UNAIDS. However, HIV/AIDS poses serious challenges to the world community because of the extent of the epidemic and the cost and difficulty of changing deeply rooted traditions and behaviors that contribute to the spread of the disease: according to a study commissioned by WHO, between $1.5 billion and $2.9 billion would be needed from donors and affected countries annually to implement behavioral and blood safety strategies to prevent HIV/AIDS in developing countries. Moreover, other epidemics had their roots essentially in medical problems and could be addressed through biomedical remedies from public health systems. However, absent a vaccination or cure, slowing the reach of the virus must be accomplished by addressing such fundamental cultural and social traditions as the role of women, sexual practices, and inheritance laws. For example, according to USAID, tradition and laws in Kenya do not allow women to inherit property. Without skills or experience in earning money, if their husbands die, women often have no other recourse than to engage in prostitution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID and U.N.

As a bilateral agency, USAID works in partnership with governments, other donors, and private organizations to support research and implement HIV/AIDS interventions in the 28 countries where it has major programs. The U.N.\u2019s role is in advocating, mobilizing, and coordinating the international response worldwide in addition to managing HIV/AIDS activities in 152 countries."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USAID Response to the Epidemic", "paragraphs": ["Since it began its HIV/AIDS assistance program in 1986, USAID\u2019s goal has been to reduce the incidence of new HIV/AIDS infections. In the 1980s, very little was known about the epidemic or how to fight it. As a result, USAID focused its initial efforts on understanding the causes and extent of the epidemic and on identifying ways to prevent its spread. At the direction of Congress in 1986, USAID supported WHO\u2019s Global Program on AIDS (GPA), and it also paid for public and private research efforts and activities in the field. These field activities included operations research on interventions that prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS; surveillance and analysis of the incidence, spread, and impact of the disease; and assistance in countries\u2019 design and implementation activities. During this learning phase, USAID reported that it was the first donor to introduce HIV/AIDS prevention activities in most countries. Further, by providing short-term technical assistance to USAID missions in more than 74 countries and funding small-scale projects to prevent new infections, it educated USAID staff and host country officials about the epidemic.", "By the early 1990s, USAID became more knowledgeable about the disease, and Congress increased funding for HIV/AIDS (see fig.1.3). USAID designed a strategy to focus on country-level projects that could have a measurable impact on the epidemic. From 1991 to 1997, USAID supported the AIDS Control and Prevention (AIDSCAP) project. By far the most ambitious international HIV/AIDS prevention effort ever undertaken, AIDSCAP was a worldwide program intended to help USAID overseas missions design and implement HIV/AIDS prevention projects. AIDSCAP directly managed comprehensive projects in some countries and supplied technical assistance to USAID missions as requested. USAID relied primarily on private voluntary organizations (PVO) and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) to implement its HIV/AIDS programs, both at its Washington, D.C., headquarters and in the field.", "By 1997, USAID had incorporated the goal of reducing HIV/AIDS transmission as one of five objectives in its global health improvement portfolio and had delineated performance goals and indicators to measure its progress. Agency funding for HIV/AIDS activities had increased (to about $125 million in 1993, leveling off at about $117 million a year), and USAID shifted more resources to missions to develop their own comprehensive programs. Headquarters\u2019 efforts became focused on providing technical assistance as needed and supporting research. In fiscal year 1997, the majority of USAID\u2019s funds supported project activities at the country level\u2014with major programs in 28 countries ($81 million), followed by centrally managed technical assistance and research support ($20 million), and grants to UNAIDS ($16 million).", "In 1997, USAID initiated three cooperative agreements with several PVOs and has a fourth in process. These agreements provide up to $290 million over 5 years for HIV/AIDS activities\u2014about $40 million to conduct operations research and field testing to refine and develop best practices for prevention and care; up to $150 million for technical assistance, as requested by missions; up to $75 million to implement programs that advertise and promote the appeal, availability, and use of condoms, as requested by missions; and about $25 million to provide program design/monitoring and evaluation, lessons learned, and information dissemination services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.N.

General Assembly directed WHO to develop and coordinate the agency\u2019s first program to respond to HIV/AIDS by creating the Special Program on AIDS in 1987, subsequently renamed GPA in 1988. GPA\u2019s mission was to strengthen the capacity of governments to respond to the epidemic and to help establish national AIDS programs. WHO provided technical and financial support, ranging from $100,000 to $400,000 to initiate national programs. WHO is credited with making major contributions to nations\u2019 efforts against the epidemic, including protecting blood supply systems, strengthening national behavior research, and improving disease surveillance.", "In the early 1990s, U.N. officials and donors increasingly recognized the need for a multisectoral response to the complex challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic\u2014including the social, economic, and development issues affecting the spread of the virus. They realized that WHO\u2019s medically based response was insufficient. They were concerned that countries were dependent on GPA for operational support and, as a result, were not devoting enough of their own resources to the effort. Also, they expressed the need for better coordination and delineation of roles and responsibilities among various U.N. agencies. To address these concerns, on January 1, 1996, the United Nations replaced GPA with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The 1996-97 biennial budget for the UNAIDS Secretariat was $120 million, of which the United States contributed $34 million, or about 28 percent.", "The U.N.\u2019s goal in creating UNAIDS was to lead a broad-based, expanded, worldwide effort to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS is composed of a Secretariat and six U.N. agency cosponsors: the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF); the United Nations Development Program (UNDP); the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); WHO; and the World Bank. Each cosponsor was expected to expand its financial support for HIV/AIDS efforts, to try to mobilize resources for HIV/AIDS in affected countries, and to coordinate with other cosponsor agencies at the country level.", "Unlike WHO\u2019s role in GPA, the UNAIDS Secretariat was not expected to provide significant financial support and technical advisers to countries. Instead, it was established primarily as a coordinating body and was expected to advocate increased political and financial support for HIV/AIDS activities, to devise a framework for performance measures to be used in managing HIV/AIDS activities, to provide technical support and best practice information to help develop and carry out national HIV/AIDS strategies, and to organize entities at the country level\u2014called \u201ctheme groups\u201d\u2014as the forum for coordinating U.N. efforts. Theme groups were to be composed of field representatives of U.N. cosponsor agencies. The groups were expected to work together to assist national governments develop and implement HIV/AIDS programs.

We did not evaluate the program\u2019s impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic or whether U.S. support for the program should continue.", "To examine USAID\u2019s contributions to the global effort to prevent HIV/AIDS, we reviewed expert studies on the disease and interventions, and reviewed internal and external USAID project evaluations from 1995 to 1998. We compared the reported data with evidence we gathered in the field. To view USAID efforts in the field, we chose countries in different parts of the world with both emerging and advanced epidemics. In countries with emerging epidemics, HIV/AIDS is primarily concentrated in high-risk groups, and in countries with advanced epidemics it has spread to the general population. In Latin America and the Caribbean, we visited the Dominican Republic and Honduras, both of which have emerging epidemics. USAID considers Honduras the epicenter of the epidemic in Central America because it has the highest concentration of HIV-positive people in its high-risk groups. In Asia we visited India, which has more HIV-positive people than any other country in the world, although still largely concentrated in high-risk groups, and the Philippines, which has an emerging epidemic. In Africa, we visited Zambia, which has an advanced epidemic, with about 20 percent of the general population infected with HIV. In the countries we visited, we reviewed internal USAID mission project papers and 1997 mission progress reports and observed USAID projects. To gather evidence of the effectiveness of USAID\u2019s country-level projects, we reviewed behavior surveys and available surveillance data; and met with mission directors, population, health, and nutrition officers, HIV/AIDS project officers, staff from PVOs and NGOs implementing projects, host government officials, project participants, and recipients of services, including commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, and youth, volunteers, a condom social marketing organization, and private sector representatives involved in HIV/AIDS activities, and people living with HIV/AIDS. We visited project sites to see how interventions were implemented and to discuss the views of the recipients of USAID activities.", "To examine the level of financial oversight USAID exercised over program activities, we reviewed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and USAID guidance relating to the use of cooperative agreements and contracts. We reviewed several relevant contracts, cooperative agreements, and associated procurement records relating to active HIV/AIDS projects to determine whether they provided for appropriate oversight as required by federal procurement regulations and guidance from OMB and USAID. We discussed financial oversight responsibilities with USAID project managers, procurement staff, and financial management officers in headquarters and in the five countries we visited. We also reviewed the financial record-keeping and reporting requirements that USAID placed on recipients of USAID funds. In addition, we reviewed quarterly expenditure reports from PVOs from 1994 through 1997 and discussed financial reporting and selected management and accounting policies with PVO staff to determine their compliance with OMB and agency provisions. We reviewed USAID\u2019s administrative approval and payment procedures and studied recent USAID assessments of its financial and operational oversight responsibilities with PVOs. We reviewed pre-award evaluations for four headquarters-led projects and two mission-led projects and reviewed audit reports related to the centrally managed projects in the five countries we visited. We also met with Office of the USAID Inspector General (OIG) staff to discuss their reviews of these reports and independent audit assessments.", "As an agency of the U.S. government, we have no direct authority to review the operations of multilateral organizations such as the United Nations. However, throughout this review we obtained broad access to agency staff members and official information at the headquarters, regional, and country level. To determine whether UNAIDS has achieved its goal to lead an expanded and broad-based, worldwide response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we measured progress against criteria set forth in the U.N.\u2019s Economic and Social Council resolution endorsing the creation of a Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, the memorandum of understanding signed by the six cosponsoring agencies, and the strategic plans of the UNAIDS Secretariat and the cosponsoring agencies.

We also obtained agency expenditure data reported by the UNAIDS Program Coordinating Board. We did not verify the data reported by or provided directly to us from the agencies and the UNAIDS Secretariat. In attempting to determine the level of spending by the major donors and developing nations, we reviewed preliminary data from a study on global HIV/AIDS expenditures conducted by the UNAIDS Secretariat and Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health. We also met with government officials to discuss the level and type of financial support for HIV/AIDS activities and to discuss barriers to increasing resources to fight the disease.

They are information, education, and counseling to raise awareness of the threat of HIV/AIDS in an effort to promote positive behavior changes such as abstinence or reduction in the number of sexual partners, and safer sex practices; treatment of STDs which, if left untreated, can facilitate transmission of the HIV infection; and \u2022 promotion of increased condom use through condom \u201csocial marketing\u201d to prevent transmission of the virus."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Information, Education, and Counseling", "paragraphs": ["The first intervention, attempting to change risky behavior through increased awareness, has posed a particular challenge to HIV/AIDS experts.

For example, in some African countries, polygamous unions may force \u201cjunior wives\u201d into prostitution to earn money. In addition, research on ways to promote change in sexual behaviors is not advanced. Even when effective approaches have been identified, they may not always be transferable from one cultural environment to another. For example, USAID\u2019s largest HIV/AIDS program\u2014AIDSCAP\u2014noted the difficulty in encouraging Rwandan refugees to take individual action to change their risky behavior when they had no control over the rest of their life.", "USAID supported a number of efforts to identify approaches to achieve behavioral change through clinical trials of HIV prevention counseling and testing in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. For example, AIDSCAP worked with the United Nations and research institutions from Kenya, Tanzania, Trinidad, and the United States to assess the efficacy of efforts intended to promote voluntary HIV counseling and testing. In 1997, USAID signed a cooperative agreement to support a 5-year, $40-million program for operations research and field testing of interventions to further refine and develop best practices for prevention and care activities.", "In the five countries we visited, USAID projects used creative approaches to increase HIV/AIDS awareness and promote behavior change. For example, in Honduras, USAID\u2014in conjunction with UNICEF\u2014supported youth theater groups to develop plays with HIV/AIDS-related themes. To reach out-of-school youth, USAID supported pregame mock soccer matches, where HIV Virus and Death teams battled Abstinence and Condom teams.

This research concluded that STDs, especially those that cause lesions, provide a pathway for the HIV virus to enter the body and that STDs were highly prevalent in many of the populations most affected with HIV/AIDS. As early as 1991, USAID reported that the risk of HIV transmission significantly increased when other STDs are present and worked with WHO to develop standardized treatments. The link between STDs and HIV transmission was eventually confirmed by the results of a 3-year trial in Tanzania. The trial concluded that increased STD treatment reduced HIV incidence by about 40 percent.", "Improving STD treatment capacity was a component of USAID\u2019s AIDS prevention strategy in every country we visited. In Honduras, USAID supported the expansion of health clinic services to include treatment of STDs.

The development of this marketing strategy was based on USAID-sponsored research and experience that showed that people are more likely to use a condom if they were affordable, high quality, and available when and where needed. World Bank data demonstrated that condom sales increased dramatically in many developing countries after condom social marketing programs were introduced.

However, it is difficult to determine the link between a particular activity or program and reductions in the incidence of HIV/AIDS because of the long incubation period for the disease; a person can be infected as a result of an activity from 7 to 10 years previously.

In India, the first HIV testing center in New Delhi was developed, providing free voluntary testing; counseling services; dissemination of information about HIV/AIDS, STDs, and condom use; support and care services for HIV-positive clients; and advocacy and sensitization about the rights and needs of HIV-positive individuals. In Zambia, a pilot project for home-based care mobilized community groups to deal with the consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including (1) educating the community about HIV/AIDS; (2) caring for orphans, the chronically ill, and the dying; and (3) developing income-generating projects for women, orphans, and people living with AIDS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["UNAIDS has made limited progress toward achieving its goal of leading a broad-based, expanded, worldwide response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Cosponsor agency estimates of overall U.N. spending on HIV/AIDS show that resources have not increased with the creation of UNAIDS, as was expected. Agency spending on HIV/AIDS began declining before the creation of UNAIDS in 1996 and since then has leveled off, despite an increase in overall cosponsor agency spending of 6.5 percent.", "Building worldwide support for HIV/AIDS was a key objective of UNAIDS. However, the UNAIDS Secretariat is not able to measure progress in meeting this goal because it does not yet have baseline data on spending on HIV/AIDS at the country level and has only recently developed baseline data for contributions by donor countries. Secretariat officials said that spending estimates for affected countries should be available in the fall of 1998. In addition, the Secretariat lacks data to determine whether the level of private sector resources directed to HIV/AIDS has increased or decreased. While the UNAIDS Secretariat has made significant efforts at the international level to mobilize private sector support, we found that U.N. efforts at the local level were very limited in the countries we visited.", "Secretariat officials acknowledged that as of 1997, most theme groups were not working effectively and that they underestimated the difficulty of getting U.N. agencies to coordinate and conduct joint programming. For example, in two of the five countries we visited, we found poorly functioning theme groups that rarely met. Factors that hindered theme group operations included insufficient guidance to staff in the field regarding how theme groups should operate, not holding staff accountable for theme group success, and U.N. agency staff\u2019s lack of commitment to working together.", "In addition, the UNAIDS Secretariat has not been very successful in providing technical assistance and other support to facilitate theme group activities and has only started to establish performance measures. Despite UNAIDS\u2019 difficulties, we observed innovative and U.N. agency intervention projects in each of our case study countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Comments from USAID, the Department of State, and the UNAIDS Secretariat generally focused on concerns about our review of UNAIDS. USAID stated that it shares our concerns about areas in which UNAIDS has not made sufficient progress. However, USAID expressed its strong endorsement and support for the program and the unique role UNAIDS plays in the global response to HIV/AIDS. USAID also pointed to the difficulty of UNAIDS\u2019 mandate and UNAIDS\u2019 relatively short existence (2 years at the time of our review). USAID stated that progress had been made in some areas since our review. For example, USAID noted that at a recent meeting, a Monitoring and Evaluation Technical Review Group was created to develop a monitoring and evaluation plan targeted for December 1998.", "UNAIDS Secretariat officials agreed with our conclusion that U.N. expenditures for HIV/AIDS did not substantially increase since the creation of UNAIDS. However, it questioned the quality of the financial data reported by the cosponsor agencies because agencies have difficulty estimating expenditures and use different methods of reporting. The Secretariat stated that relying on financial expenditures alone masks the increased expenditures of human resources on HIV/AIDS by cosponsor agencies in many countries. The Secretariat stated that progress has been made toward mobilizing the private sector and coordinating efforts at the country level, providing support to theme groups, and developing a framework for measuring the progress of the U.N. effort on HIV/AIDS was reasonable given the challenges it faced and the short time since the creation of UNAIDS. The Secretariat provided updated information on activities undertaken after we completed our fieldwork.", "Our conclusion about the decline in U.N. spending on HIV/AIDS is based on data reported by the respective cosponsor agencies. We recognize that agencies use different methods to report expenditures and that it is difficult to estimate expenditures, particularly when HIV/AIDS expenditures are integrated into spending for other activities. However, because each agency has reported the data in a consistent manner over time, we believe that the data are useful to identify trends. We also agree with the Secretariat that adding other measures of the U.N. effort, such as human resources, would be useful. However, the Secretariat does not currently have an evaluation and monitoring system to measure non-financial contributions to HIV/AIDS.", "We did not make a judgment about whether cosponsor agencies should have made more progress toward mobilizing the private sector. The concern we raised in the report was less about the level of private involvement than the fact that cosponsor agencies in all but one of the countries we visited were not making efforts to involve the private sector. We acknowledge in the report that theme groups have made some progress since the Secretariat\u2019s 1996 survey; it was conducted the same year that most theme groups were established, so some progress would be expected. However, the 1997 survey indicated that half or fewer of the theme groups had undertaken efforts in 7 out of 10 of the key outputs measured. We also note that despite being instructed by its governing board to immediately begin developing an evaluation and monitoring plan, the Secretariat did not hire staff to develop the plan until a year and a half after UNAIDS was established.", "USAID, State, and the UNAIDS Secretariat also noted that UNAIDS has only been in existence for 2-1/2 years and were concerned that it may have been too early to assess the program. State also said it was disappointed at the very negative tone in the report concerning UNAIDS\u2019 activities and believed that the report did not give any credit to UNAIDS for what it had achieved. Furthermore, State said that we implied that U.N. agencies and the U.S. government should stop supporting UNAIDS.", "While we recognize that UNAIDS has been in existence for only 2-1/2 years, we did not evaluate the program\u2019s impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In our report, we present the facts as we found them to be, including areas needing improvement and areas that have worked well. In fact, the report specifically identifies UNAIDS\u2019 accomplishments, including information on innovative grassroots interventions. Also, we did not evaluate whether support for UNAIDS should be continued. Our objective, as stated in the report, was to examine the program\u2019s progress, since its inception, in meeting established objectives such as increasing resources devoted to HIV/AIDS and working together in theme groups at the country level."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
