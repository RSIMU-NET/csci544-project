However, a lack of well-defined requirements, poor business arrangements, and inadequate oversight and accountability have negatively affected reconstruction and support efforts. For example, in a July 2007 report, GAO found that DOD completed negotiation for task orders on an oil contract more than 6 months after the work commenced and most costs were incurred. DOD paid nearly all of the $221 million in costs questioned by auditors. Also in July 2007, GAO found that unclear DOD guidance, inadequate staff, and insufficient technology resulted in poor accountability over more than 190,000 weapons provided to Iraqi forces. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation to determine what DOD accountability procedures apply or should apply to the program. However, as of March 2008, DOD had not made a determination. The need to effectively manage and oversee contractors supporting deployed forces is equally important. DOD pays billions of dollars each year for contracted goods and services in locations such as Iraq and elsewhere. However, several long-standing and systemic problems continue to hinder DOD's management and oversight of contractors at deployed locations, including the failure to follow planning guidance, provide an adequate number of contract oversight personnel, systematically collect and distribute lessons learned, and provide predeployment training for military commanders and contract oversight personnel on the use and role of contractors. GAO's work has identified instances where poor oversight and management of contractors led to negative financial and operational impacts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made a number of recommendations aimed at strengthening DOD's management and oversight of contractor support at deployed locations, and the department has agreed to implement many of those recommendations. However, GAO has found that DOD has made limited progress in implementing some key recommendations. The United States has made available nearly $6 billion to rebuild Iraq's energy sector and $300 million to develop its government ministries but lacks integrated strategic plans for both efforts. Building the capacity of the ministries is critical to ensure that Iraq can effectively govern, rebuild, and stabilize the country. Rebuilding Iraq's energy sector is necessary to ensure that Iraq can pay for these tasks and provide essential services to the Iraqi people. However, in the absence of a comprehensive and integrated strategic plan, U.S. efforts to build the capacity of the Iraqi government have been hindered by multiple U.S. agencies pursuing individual efforts without overarching direction. The creation of a plan for the energy sector is also essential for Iraq to meet energy production and export goals. GAO recommended that State work with Iraqi ministries to develop an integrated energy plan. State commented that the Iraqi government, not the U.S. government, should act on GAO's recommendations. Given the billions of dollars provided to rebuild Iraq's energy sector and the limited capacity of Iraqi ministries, GAO believes that its recommendations are still valid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the challenges the United States  must address to successfully improve performance and ensure  accountability over U.S. efforts to stabilize and reconstruct Iraq.

About $45 billion was provided for reconstruction efforts,  including rebuilding Iraq\u2019s oil and electricity sectors, improving its security  forces, and enhancing Iraq\u2019s capacity to govern. Prudence with taxpayer  funds and growing long-range fiscal challenges demand that the United  States maximize its return on the billions of dollars invested in Iraq.   Further, strengthening Iraq\u2019s fragile government institutions, which have  thus far failed to adequately deter corruption, stimulate employment, or  deliver essential services, is critical to establishing a peaceful, stable, and  secure Iraq.", "My statement today is based upon GAO\u2019s extensive work spanning several  years. Since 2003, we have issued nearly 130 Iraq-related reports and  testimonies. Our work in Iraq largely has been performed under my  authority as Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on my own  initiative since it is a matter of broad interest to the entire Congress. We  performed this work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "I am pleased to appear with the DOD Inspector General and the Special  Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. As you know, GAO and the  inspectors general have different, but complementary, roles and  responsibilities. GAO\u2019s broad audit authority allows it to support Congress  through strategic analyses of issues that cut across multiple federal  agencies and sources of funding, while the inspectors general focus  primarily on preventing and exposing fraud, waste, and abuse in individual  federal agency programs. The abilities of the inspectors general to provide  in-country oversight of specific projects and reconstruction challenges  have enabled GAO to focus on national, sector, and interagency issues. We  and the other accountability organizations coordinate our oversight efforts  to avoid duplication and leverage our resources.", "I would like to note that several of my colleagues in the accountability  community and I have developed a definition of waste. As we see it, waste  occurs when taxpayers do not receive reasonable value for their money in  connection with any government-funded activity due to inappropriate acts  or omissions by officials with control over or access to government  resources. Most waste does not involve a violation of law, but it does  involve mismanagement resulting from poor leadership or guidance;  inappropriate actions or omissions, including the use of poor business  arrangements; or inadequate oversight, often caused by having too-few  skilled people. Our reports and testimonies have provided specific  examples where such issues resulted in higher costs, schedule delays, and  unmet goals. I highlight some of these in my testimony. Nevertheless,  estimating or quantifying the financial impact of fraudulent, wasteful, or  abusive practices is not always feasible or practicable.

After its dissolution, the  Secretary of State assumed responsibilities for the supervision and general  direction of reconstruction efforts in Iraq. DOD, including the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, and United States Agency for International  Development (USAID) have had responsibility for managing and  overseeing specific reconstruction projects.", "Contractors have largely carried out reconstruction efforts in Iraq. For  example, in early 2004, the CPA, through various military organizations,  awarded seven contracts to help provide overall direction, coordination,  and oversight of 12 large design-build contractors. In turn, these 12 design- build contractors were responsible for the design and execution of  construction activities in various sectors such as electricity, oil, and public  works and water.", "In addition, DOD has made extensive use of contractors to support its  deployed forces.  The scale of contractor support DOD relies on today in  locations such Iraq and elsewhere amounts to billions of dollars worth of  goods and services each year, underscoring the need to effectively manage  and oversee contractor efforts.  Contractors provide interpretation,  intelligence analysis, and security services, as well as weapon systems  maintenance and base operations support. The significance of such  contracts is illustrated by the fact that the Army reported obligations of  over $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2007 on its single-largest support contract,  the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP).", "The collective effort of military, civilian, and contractor personnel in Iraq  has been complicated by the country\u2019s security environment. The CPA\u2019s  original reconstruction plan was premised on the assumption that a  permissive security environment would enable the United States to restore  Iraq\u2019s essential services to prewar levels. The CPA also assumed that the  Iraqi government and the international community would help finance  Iraq\u2019s development and that Iraqi oil revenues could help pay for  reconstruction costs. None of these assumptions has materialized.", "In February 2007, we reported that the security situation was continuing to  deteriorate, impeding the management and execution of reconstruction  efforts. As shown in figure 1, the security situation generally deteriorated  through the summer of 2007, with the number of attacks increasing to  about 180 per day in June 2007.", "However, since then, the number of enemy-initiated attacks has decreased  by about two-thirds, to the levels of early 2005. Specifically, the average  number of daily attacks decreased from about 180 in June 2007 to about 60  in January 2008\u2014a nearly 70 percent decrease\u2014as the number of attacks  against coalition forces in particular fell considerably.

The absence of these elements often  contributed to unmet expectations, schedule delays, or higher-than- necessary costs, underscoring both the need to hold agencies and  contractors accountable for outcomes, and the challenges of doing so.  Such issues are not unique to Iraq but reflect some of the long-standing  and systemic issues confronting DOD. They are, however, magnified in a  contingency situation such as Iraq or Katrina.

After the State Department  assumed responsibility for U.S. reconstruction efforts in 2004, it re- examined the priorities and programs initiated by the CPA, with the  objective of reprioritizing funding to key, high-impact projects. State  increased support for security, law enforcement efforts, and oil  infrastructure enhancements. These reallocations, affecting billions of  dollars of planned work, led to the cancellation of some projects in the  electricity and water sector.", "At the contract level, the lack of well-defined requirements resulted in  schedule delays and the United States potentially paying more than  necessary. For example, in September 2005, we reported that difficulties in  defining the cost, schedule, and work to be performed on projects in Iraq\u2019s  water and sanitation sector contributed to project delays and reduced  scopes of work. We found that agreement between the U.S. government  and contractors on the final cost, schedule, and scope of 18 of the 24 task  orders valued at $873 million had been delayed. These delays occurred, in  part, because Iraqi authorities, U.S. agencies, and contractors could not  agree on scopes of work and construction details.", "Previously, in July 2004, we reported that a disagreement between the  LOGCAP contractor and the DCAA on how to bill for services to feed  soldiers in Iraq involved at least $88 million in questioned costs. The  disagreement regarded whether the government should be billed on the  camp populations specified in the statement of work or on the actual head  count.

Such arrangements often allowed  contractors to begin work before key contract terms and conditions, such  as the scope of the work and its price, were fully defined. For example, in  a September 2006 report, we found that DOD contracting officials were  less likely to remove the costs questioned by auditors if the contractor had  already incurred these costs before the contract action was definitized. In  contrast, in the few instances in which the government negotiated the  terms before starting work, the portion of questioned costs removed from  the proposal was substantial. For example, in three audits related to a  logistics support contract, DCAA questioned $204 million. Since the  government and the contractor negotiated the terms prior to the onset of  the work, the contractor had not incurred any costs at the time of  negotiations. DCAA calculated that $120 million of the $204 million in  questioned costs were removed as a result of its findings.", "We subsequently issued a report in July 2007 that focused on the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 $2.5 billion contract to Kellogg Brown & Root to  restore Iraq\u2019s oil infrastructure and ensure an adequate fuel supply within  Iraq. DCAA reviewed the contract\u2019s 10 task orders and questioned $221  million in contractor costs. While DOD considered DCAA\u2019s audit findings  and performed additional analysis, the lack of timely negotiations  contributed significantly to DOD\u2019s decision on how to address the  questioned costs. In this case, all 10 task orders were negotiated more than  180 days after the work commenced and the contractor had incurred  almost all its costs at the time of negotiations.

On multiple  occasions, we and others have reported on deficiencies in DOD\u2019s  oversight; for example:  In December 2006, we reported that DOD did not have sufficient numbers  of contractor oversight personnel at deployed locations, which limited its  ability to obtain reasonable assurance that contractors were meeting  contract requirements efficiently and effectively.", "In October 2007, the report of the Commission on Army Acquisition and  Program Management in Expeditionary Operations stated that the Army  lacked the leadership and military and civilian personnel to provide  sufficient contracting support to either expeditionary or peacetime  missions. According to the Commission, Army contracting personnel  experienced a 600-percent increase in their workload and were performing  more complex tasks, while the number of Army civilians and military in  the contracting workforce had remained stagnant or declined. As a result,  the Commission found that the vital task of postaward contract  management was rarely being done. It recommended that the Army  increase the number of civilian and military personnel in its contracting  workforce by 1,400 individuals.", "Our recent analysis of five types of vehicles presented to the Army as  ready for acceptance from July 2006 through May 2007 found that 18 to 31  percent of the vehicles failed government inspection.

Three factors  contributed to this lapse in accountability. First, DOD had not specified  which DOD equipment accountability procedures, if any, applied to the  train-and-equip program for Iraq. Congress funded the train-and-equip  program for Iraq outside traditional security assistance programs, which,  according to DOD officials, allowed DOD a large degree of flexibility in  managing the program. These officials stated that, since the funding did  not go through traditional security assistance programs, the DOD  accountability requirements normally applicable to these programs did not  apply. For example, under traditional security assistance programs, DOD  regulations specify accountability procedures for storing, protecting,  transporting, and registering small arms and other sensitive items  transferred to foreign governments.", "Second, DOD did not maintain a centralized record of all equipment  distributed to the Iraqi security forces from June 2004 until December  2005. At that time, DOD established a consolidated property book system  to track the issuance of equipment to the Iraqi security forces and was  attempting to recover past records. Our analysis found a discrepancy of at  least 190,000 weapons between data reported by the former Multinational  Security Transition Command- Iraq (MNSTC-I) commander and the  property books (see figure 2). Former DOD officials stated that this lapse  was due to an insufficient number of staff and the lack of a fully  operational network to distribute equipment, among other reasons.", "Third, since the beginning of the program, DOD has not consistently  collected supporting documents that confirm when the equipment was  received, the quantities of equipment delivered, or the Iraqi units receiving  the equipment. Since June 2006, the command has placed greater  emphasis on collecting this documentation. However, our review of the  2007 property books found continuing problems with missing and  incomplete records. Further, the property books consist of extensive  electronic spreadsheets, which are an inefficient data management tool  given the large amount of data and limited personnel available to maintain  the system.", "In our July 2007 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense (1)  determine which DOD accountability procedures apply or should apply to  the program, and (2) after defining the required accountability procedures,  ensure that sufficient staff, functioning distribution networks, standard  operating procedures, and proper technology are available to meet the  new requirements.

However, we noted in our 2003 report  that the operations plan for the war in Iraq contained limited information  on contractor support. Similarly, DOD policy requires planning for  contractor-provided services during crisis situations to provide a  reasonable assurance of the continuation of services and to prepare a  contingency plan for obtaining services from alternate sources if needed.  Our review found that essential contractor services for deployed troops  had not been identified and backup planning was not being done. Without  firm plans, there is no assurance that the personnel needed to provide  essential services will be available when needed.", "In addition, we reported in 2004 that the Army did not follow its planning  guidance when deciding to use the Army\u2019s LOGCAP contract. Army  guidance stresses the need for the clear identification of requirements and  the development of a comprehensive statement of work early in the  contingency planning process. Because this Army guidance was not  followed, the plan to support the troops in Iraq was not comprehensive  and was revised seven times in less than 1 year, generating a significant  amount of rework that would have been avoided had the planning  guidance been followed.", "We have also found that DOD has not reviewed contractor support to  identify the essential services provided and the department lacked  visibility over the totality of contractor support to deployed forces.

For example, we  reported in 2004 that DOD did not always have enough contract oversight  personnel in place to manage and oversee its logistics support contracts  such as LOGCAP and the Air Force Contract Augmentation Program  (AFCAP). As a result, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)  was unable to account for $2 million worth of tools that had been  purchased using the AFCAP contract. In 2006, a LOGCAP Program Office  official stated that the office did not prepare to hire additional contract  oversight personnel in anticipation of an increased use of LOGCAP  services due to Operation Iraqi Freedom. According to the official, if  adequate staffing had been in place early, the Army could have realized  substantial savings through more effective reviews of the increasing  volume of LOGCAP requirements.", "In January 2008, we reported that the Army was inadequately staffed to  conduct oversight of an equipment maintenance contract in Kuwait, a  contract with cumulative obligations of more than $500 million. Vacant  oversight personnel positions included a quality assurance specialist, a  property administrator, and two quality assurance inspectors. According  to Army officials, such shortfalls meant that surveillance was not being  performed sufficiently, and the Army was less able to identify trends in  contractor performance and begin corrective action. For example, a  review of property accountability reports found that the contractor  reported a total of $2.4 million in government-furnished property;  however, two of the eight property listings alone totaled more than $2  million. Without adequate oversight of government property, the Army  cannot be certain that duplicate supplies have not been ordered and that  government property is not misplaced or misused.", "DOD has taken some actions to address the challenge of a less-than- adequate number of contract oversight personnel.

In the 2006 report, officials with a Stryker brigade  stated that a lack of training hindered their ability to resolve staffing issues  with a contractor conducting background screenings of third-country and  host-country nationals. In this case, shortages of contractor-provided  screeners forced the brigade to use its own intelligence personnel to  conduct screenings.

For example, the 2007 report of the Commission on Army  Acquisition and Program Management in Expeditionary Operations found  that combatant commands do not recognize the significance of contracts  and contractors in expeditionary operations. The report concluded that  the Army needs to educate and train commanders on the important  operational role of contracting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Adequate Strategic Planning Impedes U.S. Efforts to Develop Capacity in Iraqi Ministries and Improve Outcomes in Iraq\u2019s Energy Sector", "paragraphs": ["U.S. efforts to increase the Iraqi government\u2019s capacity to invest in its own  rebuilding are undermined by strategic planning shortfalls in two critical  areas\u2014developing the capacity of the Iraqi ministries to effectively  execute their responsibilities and integrating oil and electricity  development into a unified plan. In the energy sector, developing a  comprehensive and integrated strategic plan is essential to meeting energy  production and export goals, which in turn will help Iraq meet its future  financial needs.

Over the past 4 years, U.S. efforts to help build the capacity of the Iraqi  national government have been characterized by multiple U.S. agencies  leading individual efforts, without overarching direction from a lead entity  that integrates their efforts, and shifting time frames and priorities in  response to deteriorating security and the reorganization of the U.S.  mission in Iraq. Consequently, U.S. efforts to date have not resulted in key  Iraqi ministries having the capacity to effectively govern and assume  increasing responsibility for operating, maintaining, and further investing  in reconstruction projects.", "The Iraqi ministries also face several challenges that pose a risk to their  success and long-term sustainability. First, our October 2007 report found  that Iraqi ministries lack personnel with key skills, such as budgeting and  procurement. Second, sectarian influence over ministry leadership and  staff complicated efforts to build a professional and nonaligned civil  service. Third, pervasive corruption in the Iraqi ministries impeded the  effectiveness of U.S. efforts. Fourth, poor security limited U.S. advisors\u2019  access to their Iraqi counterparts, preventing ministry staff from attending  planned training sessions and contributing to the exodus of skilled  professionals to other countries.", "While recognizing these challenges, U.S. efforts to help build the capacity  of the Iraqi ministry suffered from the lack of coordination and shifting  priorities. First, no single agency was in charge of leading U.S. ministry  capacity development efforts. State, DOD, and USAID have led separate  efforts at Iraqi ministries, investing about $169 million in funds in 2005 and  2006 for these efforts. As of mid-2007, State and USAID were providing 169  capacity development advisors to 10 key civilian ministries; DOD was  providing 215 to the Ministries of Defense and Interior. Although State  took steps to improve coordination in early 2007, coordination between  the agencies remains problematic. For example, although State, USAID,  and DOD tried to develop a common set of metrics to measure ministry  capacity in 2005, the agencies have now developed separate sets of  metrics.", "Second, the focus of U.S. capacity development efforts had shifted from  long-term institution-building projects, such as helping the Iraqi  government develop its own capacity development strategy, to an  immediate effort to help Iraqi ministries overcome their inability to spend  their capital budgets and deliver essential services to the Iraqi people.  However, as we reported in January 2008, it is unclear if Iraq is spending  its $10.1 billion capital budget since U.S. and Iraqi reports show widely  disparate rates for Iraqi government spending in 2007. Citing unofficial  Ministry of Finance data, the administration\u2019s September 2007 Benchmark  Assessment Report stated that the Iraqi ministries had spent 24 percent of  their capital projects budgets, as of July 15, 2007. The report concluded  that, compared with 2006, the government of Iraq was becoming more  effective in spending its capital projects budget. However, the  administration\u2019s report is not consistent with Iraq\u2019s official expenditure  reports, which show that the central ministries had spent only 4.4 percent  of their investment budget, as of August 2007. The lack of consistent and  timely expenditure data limits transparency over Iraq\u2019s execution of $10.1  billion 2007 budget for capital projects and reconstruction. The most  recent expenditure data show a capital expenditure rate of 7 percent for  the central ministries, as of November 2007.", "The U.S. government is beginning to develop a comprehensive and  integrated strategy for U.S. capacity development efforts in Iraq, although  agencies have been implementing separate programs since 2003. GAO\u2019s  previous analyses of U.S. multiagency national strategies demonstrate that  such a strategy should integrate the efforts of the involved agencies with  the priorities of the Iraqi government, and include a clear purpose and  scope; a delineation of U.S. roles, responsibilities, and coordination with  other donors, including the United Nations; desired goals and objectives;  performance measures; and a description of benefits and costs. U.S.  efforts to develop Iraqi ministry capacity have included some but not all of  these components. For example, agencies are working to clarify roles and  responsibilities. However, U.S. efforts lack clear ties to Iraqi-identified  priorities at all ministries and information on how resources will be  targeted to achieve the desired end-state.", "In October 2007, we recommended that State, in consultation with the  Iraqi government, complete a comprehensive and integrated strategy for  U.S. capacity development efforts. State recognized the value of an  integrated strategy but stated that it may hinder efforts to tailor capacity  development efforts to the priorities of each ministry. GAO\u2019s  recommendation does not preclude tailoring capacity development efforts  to meet each ministry\u2019s unique needs. A strategy ensures that a U.S.- funded program has consistent overall goals, clear leadership and roles,  and risks that are assessed.", "Similarly, in January 2008, we recommended that to help ensure more  accurate reporting of the government of Iraq\u2019s spending of its capital  projects budget, the Secretary of the Treasury work with the government  of Iraq to ensure the reporting of accurate and reliable expenditure data.  The Department of the Treasury agreed with our recommendation to  ensure accurate and reliable reporting of Iraqi expenditure data and is  working to implement it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Adequate Strategic Planning Impedes U.S. and Iraqi Efforts to Restore Iraq\u2019s Energy Sectors", "paragraphs": ["Despite the United States\u2019 investment of about $6 billion to rebuild Iraq\u2019s  oil and electricity sectors, production in both sectors has consistently  fallen below U.S. program goals of 3 million barrels per day and 6,000  megawatts of electrical peak generation capacity. As we reported in May  2007, it is difficult to identify the most pressing future funding needs, key  rebuilding priorities, and existing vulnerabilities and risks within the  sectors given the absence of an overarching strategic plan that  comprehensively assesses the requirements of the energy sector as a  whole. While the Iraqi government has crafted a multiyear strategic plan  for Iraq\u2019s electricity sector, no such plan exists for the oil sector. Given the  highly interdependent nature of the oil and electricity sectors, such a plan  would help identify the most pressing needs for the entire energy sector  and help overcome the daunting challenges affecting future development  prospects.", "As shown in figure 3, Iraq\u2019s oil production and exports, despite recent  improvements, continue to fall below U.S. goals. As of December 2007,  Iraq produced about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day and exported nearly  2.0 million barrels per day, compared with the U.S. goals of 3.0 million  barrels and 2.2 million barrels, respectively.", "In addition, U.S. goals for electricity remain unmet. The problem is  compounded by increasing demand that outstrips supply. As of February  2008, demand for electricity was twice as high as the supply. In addition,  available power in Baghdad was 9 hours per day, compared with 17 hours  per day in Basra. As we previously reported in May 2007, one of the  challenges in developing the electricity sector was the U.S. government\u2019s  decision to install natural gas turbine engines despite the absence of a  natural gas distribution network. Of the 35 engines installed, 16 were using  diesel or crude oil rather than natural gas. As a result, maintenance was  three times as costly and electricity generated decreased by 50 percent.", "Billions of dollars are still needed to rebuild, maintain, and secure Iraq\u2019s  oil and electricity infrastructure, underscoring the need for sound strategic  planning. The Ministry of Electricity\u2019s 2006-2015 Electricity Master Plan  estimates that $27 billion will be needed to reach its goal of providing  reliable electricity across Iraq by 2015. According to DOD, investment in  Iraq\u2019s oil sector is \u201cwoefully short\u201d of the absolute minimum required to  sustain current production, and additional foreign and private investment  is needed. Moreover, U.S. officials and industry experts estimate that Iraq  would need $20 billion to $30 billion over the next several years to reach  and sustain a crude oil production capacity of 5 million barrels per day.", "We recommended that the Secretary of State, in conjunction with relevant  U.S. agencies and international donors, work with Iraqi ministries to  develop an integrated energy strategy. State commented, however, that the  Iraqi government, not the U.S. government, is responsible for taking action  on GAO\u2019s recommendations. We believe that the recommendations are  still valid given the billions of dollars made available for Iraq\u2019s energy  sector, the limited capacity of the Iraqi ministries, and the U.S.  government\u2019s influence in overseeing Iraq\u2019s rebuilding efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["U.S. efforts in Iraq are expansive: combating insurgents, training local  security forces, shaping government institutions, reconstructing  infrastructure, and enhancing public services. These efforts demonstrate a  substantial commitment to most aspects of nation building. However,  nation building is costly, particularly in the absence of a permissive  security environment. Since 2001, Congress has appropriated about $700  billion for military and diplomatic activities in support of the global war on  terrorism; the majority of this amount has supported U.S. actions in Iraq.  This large expenditure of resources and the enormous task at hand  heightens the levels of risk and offers the potential for fraud, waste, abuse,  and corruption.", "But, as GAO\u2019s audits point out, these risks are further heightened when  U.S. programs lack sound strategic planning, well-defined requirements,  adequate oversight and accountability, and sufficient training for  personnel. Future investments in Iraq will require decision makers not  only to assess the outcomes achieved thus far but also the outcomes that  could have been achieved with more efficient and effective use of  appropriated dollars. It will also require decision makers to consider  difficult trade-offs as the nation faces increasing fiscal challenges on the  home front. Nonetheless, continuing oversight by Congress and the  accountability organizations is needed to ensure that opportunities for  waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption are minimized.", "In prior reports, GAO recommended that, to improve accountability and  minimize opportunities for fraud, waste, and abuse of U.S. funds, (1) DOD  adopt sound business processes in its acquisition strategies, such as  definitizing contracts in a timely fashion and strengthening accountability  procedures; (2) DOD leadership ensure implementation of and compliance  with existing guidance to improve its management and oversight of  contractors supporting deployed forces; and (3) U.S. agencies work with  Iraq to develop strategic plans for key sectors.", "DOD and State have taken action to implement some, but not all, of our  recommendations. Given the billions of dollars that the United States has  spent in Iraq to help rebuild its infrastructure, improve security, support  our forces, and improve the capacity of the ministries, I believe our  recommendations, if fully implemented, would improve accountability and  outcomes. Whether they are fully implemented, however, will depend on  the leadership at each agency to set the appropriate tone, ensure that  existing guidance is effectively implemented, take actions to prevent  mistakes from being repeated, and seize opportunities to ensure that the  efforts to help rebuild and stabilize Iraq achieve their intended results.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
