These officials, who said they had limited experience serving those affected by SUD, worked with required organizational partners and hired specialists to assist job seekers and to provide intensive job readiness services. However, these efforts are relatively new and outcomes are not yet known. Workforce officials GAO interviewed in two selected states without targeted grants said they had viewed SUD primarily as a public health issue, but had recently taken some steps to address it. For example, one state added a workforce subcommittee to an existing opioid task force.", "State and local workforce officials in all six states identified a range of challenges they face in addressing the needs of SUD-affected job seekers. For example, criminal history or a lack of transportation may make it difficult for these job seekers to obtain and maintain employment. Officials said another challenge is finding employers who are willing to hire those in recovery. They stated that employers are concerned about the risks to their businesses, such as potential employee relapse and possible negative reaction from customers. Officials were seeking more information and assistance to help address such concerns.", "DOL officials said they support SUD-affected communities mainly by providing information to states that apply for and receive targeted grants. However, officials in two selected states expressed uncertainty about DOL's expectations of states in serving the needs of SUD-affected job seekers and potential employers. Officials in another state said they were unclear on whether they could use non-targeted funds to continue targeted grant activities. GAO's review of related DOL guidance found that it does not provide specific information on expectations of states or the use of WIOA funds outside of targeted grants to address this issue. Further, while DOL has disseminated some information on serving job seekers with SUD (such as in quarterly calls with grant recipients), it does not plan to share information that grantees submit to the agency, such as lessons learned and successes, with all states. Doing so could help states meet the training and employment needs of those in recovery, and the needs of potential employers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL clarify (1) its expectations of state workforce agencies and (2) how WIOA funding can be used in addressing the needs of those affected by SUD and potential employers, and share information with all states on lessons learned and promising practices.

An  estimated 10.2 million people misuse opioids at least once a year,  according to a 2018 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  survey. For some, this misuse becomes a substance use disorder  (SUD)\u2014an illness resulting from the recurrent misuse of prescription or  illicit drugs, as well as non-prescription substances like alcohol. Past GAO  work, as well as other government and academic studies, have found that  SUD results in high costs for society and the economy. While SUD has  long been considered primarily a health care and law enforcement issue,  SUD has also affected costs associated with education, human services,  and the workforce, among others. Specifically, for workers and their  employers, SUD has been linked with lost productivity, absenteeism, and  unemployment.", "In response to the prevalence of opioid misuse, HHS declared a public  health emergency in October 2017. The Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL)  Employment and Training Administration (ETA) subsequently announced  two grants specifically to address the opioid crisis through the workforce  system\u2014a network of federal, state, and local agencies that administer  and carry out an array of federal employment and training programs.  These grants, which were authorized under the Workforce Innovation and  Opportunity Act (WIOA), were available to states, tribes, and outlying  areas. DOL has awarded the grants in two phases; as of December 2019,  six states have been awarded National Health Emergency Dislocated  Worker Demonstration Grants (also known as Phase 1 grants) and one  tribe and 14 states have been awarded Disaster Recovery National  Dislocated Worker Grants (also known as Phase 2 grants).", "You requested that we examine how WIOA-funded programs are  addressing the employment and career-specific education (or job training)  needs of communities and individuals affected by SUD. This report  examines (1) how selected state and local workforce agencies are using,  or planning to use, WIOA funds to provide training and employment  services to communities and individuals affected by SUD; (2) what  challenges workforce agencies face in addressing the needs of  individuals in recovery and their potential employers; and (3) how DOL is  supporting communities affected by SUD.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed officials in six states,  including state and local workforce officials and their partners (for  example, community organizations or state departments of health).

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported that DOL is one of more than a dozen federal  agencies\u2014known as National Drug Control Program agencies\u2014that have  responsibilities for drug prevention, treatment, and law enforcement  activities. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was  established in 1988 to, among other things, enhance national drug control  planning and coordination. As federal agencies engage in drug control  efforts, ONDCP is responsible for, among other things, overseeing and  coordinating the implementation of national drug control policy across the  federal government. These responsibilities include promulgating a  National Drug Control Strategy. In 2017 and 2018, ONDCP lacked a  statutorily-required National Drug Control Strategy, and we recently  reported that the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy did not fully comply  with the law. In December 2019, we recommended that ONDCP  develop and document key planning elements to help ONDCP structure  its ongoing efforts and to better position the agency to meet these  requirements for future iterations of the National Drug Control Strategy.  We also found that the 2019 strategy did not contain several pieces of  required information, such as quantifiable and measurable objectives, and  specific targets for long-term goals, or a description of a performance  measurement system. ONDCP subsequently issued the 2020 National  Drug Control Strategy on February 3, 2020. We reviewed this Strategy  and found that it made progress in addressing several statutory  requirements but fell short in meeting others. Furthermore, in our March  2019 High-Risk report, we named drug misuse as an emerging issue  requiring close attention. Based on our findings from a body of work  related to drug misuse\u2014including 25 new GAO products issued since our  2019 High-Risk report\u2014we have determined that this issue should be on  our High-Risk List.", "DOL\u2019s Phase 1 and Phase 2 grants, targeted to support efforts for  addressing the opioid crisis, are authorized by WIOA, which was enacted  in 2014 and emphasizes the alignment and integration of workforce  programs. ETA is responsible for some WIOA programs, which provide  education and other services to help job seekers obtain employment and  advance in the labor market, including job search assistance, career  counseling, and a variety of occupational skills such as classroom and  on-the-job training. In addition, WIOA emphasizes that employers are  also customers of the workforce system, and includes provisions that  involve them in helping the system provide the skilled workers they need.  WIOA requires states to submit plans to DOL every 4 years, and updates to these plans every 2 years, that outline the state\u2019s workforce strategies  for core WIOA programs. The next state plans are due in 2020.", "WIOA gives state and local officials the flexibility to develop and fund  services that meet the specific needs of their local communities and meet  WIOA goals of increasing employment, retention, and earnings to  promote economic self-sufficiency. To that end, WIOA core program  performance measures and targets include those related to job  attainment and retention; median earnings; and skill and credential  attainment. DOL officials told us that states generally use the same  WIOA performance measures for the Phase 1 and 2 grants as well. The  WIOA-funded workforce development system provides services through a  national network of approximately 2,400 American Job Centers (AJCs).  State and local entities deliver WIOA-funded employment and training  activities and coordinate with partner programs via the AJCs.", "ETA\u2019s Phase 1 and 2 grants are intended, in part, to serve dislocated  workers\u2014adults whose jobs have been terminated, who have been laid- off, or who were self-employed.

Grant recipients generally  have 2 years to expend their funds. See table 2 for more information  about these grants.", "Both grants require that recipients partner with community organizations,  such as those in health care and justice systems, and with at least one  local workforce development board or AJC.

The state targeted 16 counties in the state that officials  said had been hardest hit by the opioid crisis. State officials said they  plan to use this grant to provide services to anyone who meets the  criteria of a dislocated worker, and they felt the opioid crisis had a  strong enough economic effect for the state to use the grant for those  whose employment has been affected by the crisis.", "DOL\u2019s Women\u2019s Bureau granted Maryland $650,000 in September  2018 to fund two projects providing job-seeking supports to women  affected by opioid use disorder.", "Pennsylvania plans to use HHS funding to expand treatment capacity  for underserved populations through targeted workforce development,  according to its grant application.", "Additionally, ETA has recently provided more funding opportunities to  support state and local workforce efforts to address the opioid epidemic.  In September 2019, ETA, in partnership with the Appalachian Regional  Commission and the Delta Regional Authority, announced the 23  grantees on the first round of funding under the Workforce Opportunity for  Rural Communities Initiative, which included a focus on serving  individuals impacted by the opioid epidemic. Five of the ten awards in the  Appalachian region committed to addressing opioid and other SUD  impacts as part of their projects. Also, in October 2019, ETA announced  another funding opportunity for $20 million in grants under the Substance  Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment  for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act. The SUPPORT Act  directs DOL to conduct a pilot grant program to address the economic  and workforce effects associated with SUDs.", "Beyond those recently funded, workforce efforts to address the opioid  crisis may need to continue for many years given the nature of SUD.  Research suggests that incentives for avoiding drug misuse, such as  obtaining and maintaining employment, can be highly effective in  promoting recovery from SUD. However, an estimated 40 to 60 percent of  people with SUD experience relapse, according to the National Institute  on Drug Abuse.

These relationships fostered both knowledge sharing and  coordination, elements especially important to state officials with limited  experience serving this population. For example, in Ohio, state officials  said that input from community partners, such as substance use disorder  and mental health boards, helped them identify who could best provide  supportive services for job seekers in recovery.", "We found workforce agencies in all four states receiving targeted DOL  grants worked to serve job seekers with the following partners:  Health care organizations. Workforce officials said they partner with  health care organizations to identify people in recovery from SUD who are  ready to look for employment. For example, New Hampshire state  officials described the state\u2019s \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d services system, where  health care entities such as hospitals refer people affected by SUD to  various services. The health care staff coordinate with local workforce  agency staff and notify them when an individual in recovery is ready for  employment and training services. Other states described similar  coordination of services. For example, a local workforce agency in  Washington is partnering with a nonprofit health care organization to  coordinate workforce development efforts with health and social services.", "Justice organizations. Workforce agencies partnered with drug courts,  detention centers, and other facilities to address the employment  readiness and support needs of those in the juvenile and adult justice  systems who may have SUD. For example, in Washington, local  workforce agency officials told us that they provide training and education  services\u2014including reentry workshops and work readiness services\u2014for  their area\u2019s juvenile justice facilities, where over 70 percent of the  population has a substance use disorder. In New Hampshire, state  workforce officials described a partner organization whose officials have  relationships with all of the drug courts in the state, and also sit on the  board of the drug court in one of the state\u2019s largest counties. They said  that drug courts provide people an option to seek recovery services  instead of criminal charges, and the local workforce agency provides  employment services for people participating in drug courts.", "Educational institutions. Partnerships with community colleges and  universities helped workforce agencies to provide employment training for  job seekers interested in participating in recovery services. In two of our  selected states, officials reported using funds to support the development  of peer recovery specialists. Such peer recovery specialists, according to  HHS, can bring the lived experience of recovery to assist others in  initiating and maintaining recovery. For example, in Ohio, the state  workforce agency partnered with a community college to help people to  become peer recovery specialists and licensed chemical dependency  counselors. Maryland provided Phase 1 Grant funds to a research-based  organization, housed on the campus of state university, which is  preparing peer recovery specialists. Furthermore, local workforce agency  officials in Ohio also told us that they worked with a university to put  together a master\u2019s degree in social work for those with Licensed Social  Worker credentials or a bachelor\u2019s degree.", "Other organizations. Partnerships with community organizations and  housing commissions helped states address transportation and housing  needs through referrals and coordinated services. For example, local  workforce officials in Washington told us they work with partners through  subcontracts or memoranda of understanding to help job seekers with  childcare and housing so they can attain and retain employment. Also,  officials in New Hampshire told us that one state partner works with sober  living houses, which are group homes in which people in recovery can  live during and after treatment.", "Several state workforce officials we interviewed noted that a key benefit  to the WIOA targeted-assistance grants was forging partnerships which  will have lasting impacts on how they conduct services in the workforce  system. For example, officials in New Hampshire noted that the state  plans to continue to leverage relationships with their partners after the  grant expires. Also, officials in Ohio said these partnerships put new  processes in place, including referral systems that will facilitate getting  people in recovery into the workforce system over the long term.", "States not receiving targeted grants. Workforce officials in Alabama  and Arizona, the states we selected that did not receive targeted DOL  grants but are still experiencing high levels of opioid misuse in their  communities, stated that they were engaged in some newly formed  partnerships to address the workforce aspects of SUD. Alabama  workforce officials said they recently began participating in a statewide  opioid task force, including serving on the workforce subcommittee with  other state departments, such as the state Department of Commerce.  Arizona officials said that the state workforce agency partners with the  state Department of Corrections and has implemented second chance  centers, which offer services such as job training and onsite job fairs,  within three prisons. They noted that in one of these prisons, the majority  of women are incarcerated for drug-related offenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Agencies Used Funding to Provide Employment Services to Job Seekers in Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Officials in the four selected states that received targeted DOL grants said  they used this funding to assist those in recovery from SUD to obtain  employment.

As of January 2020, officials said the state had  enrolled 177 individuals into its program, including some who are  participating in on-the-job training (employment that is partially subsidized  by grant funds). Similarly, officials at a local workforce agency in  Washington told us that the agency aims to place 125 people affected by  SUD into transitional jobs as part of its grant-funded activities. These  subsidized jobs allow individuals to add experience to their resumes, as  well as gain an employment reference.", "In Maryland, the state distributed part of its Phase 1 grant funds to local  workforce agencies in eight counties directly or indirectly affected by the  opioid crisis. These funds provide job seekers with employment, training,  and support services that help them prepare for, secure, and retain  employment, and advance along career pathways in high-demand  industries and occupations\u2014including those related to SUD recovery,  such as counseling. Similarly, Ohio workforce officials told us they were  reintegrating individuals who are affected by opioid use into the workforce  by using some of their Trade and Economic Transition National  Dislocated Worker Grant funds to provide career services, guidance, and  counseling, along with support services.", "Several officials noted that, while their agencies may use the same  process for those with SUD as those without to get individuals ready for  jobs, it is often a longer process when someone is in recovery or  otherwise affected by SUD. For example, officials from a local workforce  agency in Ohio told us that those in recovery from SUD often need more  services and support to work through barriers prior to job placement than  other clients without the disorder. Agency workforce staff are to follow up  with people in recovery to make sure they are still supported, even after  they have found employment or have enrolled in training\u2014sometimes on  a weekly basis. Officials said that those in recovery may not have  previously had a job or attended post-secondary school before, and must  balance their recovery with these new responsibilities.", "Similarly, state workforce officials in New Hampshire said that many in  recovery have not had the opportunity to build skills and confidence. The  New Hampshire Work Ready program is a 60-hour program offered  through the state\u2019s community colleges that provides help in areas such  as how to dress for an interview and the workplace. This program, which  is available to all job seekers, also helps people decide what to disclose  regarding their personal history and helps them emphasize their  strengths. Officials characterized this program as especially helpful for  people with criminal backgrounds. In response to the needs of those in  recovery, they said the state has created a new \u201cbridge\u201d program to  prepare individuals to participate in the Work Ready program, which will  be implemented in recovery centers using targeted grant funds.", "States not receiving targeted grants. Workforce officials in Alabama  and Arizona, states that did not receive targeted grants, said that state  efforts to address SUD, and more specifically opioid use disorder, were  largely focused on the health aspects of the issue. Alabama officials told  us that the state workforce agency was not originally part of the  Governor\u2019s task force on opioid use disorder. The task force\u2019s  recommendations were mostly health care related and addressed issues  such as provider practices. However, the task force has recently added a  workforce subcommittee with the goal of identifying strategies and  resources to provide in-demand career pathways for those affected by  SUD, and officials reported that they plan to apply for Phase 2 funding in  the future. Arizona state officials said that its workforce development  system provided support in communities, but noted that there is not a  coordinated strategy statewide. Arizona officials also emphasized that  they consider SUD primarily a public health issue, not a workforce issue;  they said that while employment is part of a spectrum of services, SUD is  an issue that is best addressed on the health side."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Also Funded Specialists and Are Piloting Workplace Programs", "paragraphs": ["To assist those affected by SUD in finding employment, local workforce  agencies used their targeted grant funding to secure specialists. For  example, officials at two local workforce agencies in Ohio told us they had  hired or planned to hire new staff to work with the population affected by  SUD. One agency plans to hire case managers specializing in mental  health, who will team with AJC staff to help ensure clients in recovery get  the support they need to be successful. The other agency plans to hire  peer recovery specialists and job coaches to help those in recovery  develop soft skills. One local workforce agency in Washington also hired  peer recovery specialists, and is using them as case managers at an  AJC. Another agency in Washington is using Phase 1 grant funds to  employ four \u201cnavigators\u201d to coordinate services to address the needs of  those in recovery. In addition, officials said they are in the process of  hiring a job developer to liaise between job seekers, navigators, and  employers, and help recruit employers who are willing to hire those in  recovery from SUD.", "Additionally, communities are exploring different workplace programs to  support those in recovery. Officials in New Hampshire and Ohio reported  using their Phase 1 and Trade and Economic Transition National  Dislocated Worker Grant funds, respectively, to pilot recovery-friendly  workplace initiatives, which provide training and supports to employers to  help them better understand and work with individuals with SUD. Ohio  state officials told us that, in three pilot counties, the state will train  supervisors and managers and provide second-chance policies and  employee assistance programs. According to these officials, recovery- friendly workplaces encourage an environment where employers,  employees, and communities can collaborate to create positive change  and eliminate barriers for those affected by SUD. In New Hampshire,  employers may request that the state designate them as a recovery- friendly workplace. The New Hampshire workplace program will provide  an advisor who conducts an orientation with management and staff and  helps the employer publicize their participation in this effort so that their  employees will know of their commitment, and will know their workplace is  a safe place to disclose SUD.

For example, officials at a local workforce  agency in a rural area of Maryland said their area has no addiction  specialists, and many people in the area have to travel nearly 2 hours to  receive recovery treatment and counseling.", "Involvement with the justice system. Individuals in recovery may be  more likely to have criminal records that complicate obtaining and  maintaining employment. Officials in New Hampshire told us that  employers might not hire people with a criminal history, and that  employers are allowed to ask about criminal history on a job application,  even if the individual is in long-term recovery. Appalachian Regional  Commission officials said that job seekers with a criminal record also  have especially limited employment options in their region because the  federal government and its contractors are large employers there, but  may not be able to hire someone with a felony conviction, which is an  issue for many individuals with SUD.", "Transportation difficulties. Lack of reliable, affordable transportation  presents difficulties for many in recovery. For example, New Hampshire  officials told us many people with SUD have lost their license or have no  car, and few public transportation options are available in the state  outside of urban areas. Local workforce officials in a rural area of Ohio  said no reliable public transportation exists near them, and the limited taxi  service that exists is very expensive.", "Housing difficulties.

Officials from the Appalachian Regional Commission said this  was the most challenging aspect of SUD with respect to the workplace.  Officials from another organization that works with employees with SUD  also told us that employers may be reluctant to hire SUD-affected  individuals because state laws or claims related to lack of reasonable  accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 can  make it difficult to terminate individuals with a known substance disorder  when they relapse. To address this, some employers put in place a zero- tolerance policy, automatically terminating an employee who tests  positive for drugs.", "Safety/reliability. Workforce officials in Maryland said employers are  concerned that SUD-affected employees may bring drugs into their  workplaces or quit unexpectedly. New Hampshire officials told us that  employer liability is an issue as employers are worried about accidents.  They also told us employers are concerned about productivity loss due to  SUD and, in particular, an employee\u2019s inability to work a regular schedule  because they or a family member is dealing with SUD. Ohio officials in  one local area told us that employers in white-collar jobs are less willing  to hire individuals in recovery because they are concerned about possible  theft, and that workforce officials have been working with businesses to  secure liability insurance.", "Suitability. Some employers will not hire a person who is unable to pass  a drug test. This may present issues for individuals who take medication  as part of their recovery treatments. For example, Alabama officials told  us that a major reason that employers in their state did not hire job  applicants for vacant positions was because they could not pass initial  drug screenings. In addition, under U.S. Department of Transportation  regulations on workplace drug and alcohol testing, when an employee  performing safety-sensitive functions tests positive for drug use, they  must be removed from performing such functions and evaluated for  treatment options before returning to work. This includes those in  aviation, trucking and locomotive transit. Certain entities regulated by the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission are also required to administer drug and  alcohol testing.

Employers may also be reluctant to hire those affected by SUD  because of its associated stigma. New Hampshire officials said that  employers are concerned about people\u2019s perceptions and believe it would  hurt business if they declare themselves a recovery-friendly workplace.  For example, they told us about an employer who runs a high-end  restaurant in the state who expressed concern that customers may not  want an individual with SUD preparing their food. Washington officials  expressed similar concerns, saying that while some employers embrace  being a recovery-friendly employer, others do not publicize this because  they are unsure how it will be received by the public. Officials in Alabama  also noted the need for honesty and transparency about the stigma of  SUD and for employers who are willing to invest in their workers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOL Is in the Early Stages of Supporting State and Local Efforts through Information Sharing and Technical Assistance; Workforce Agencies Identified Additional Needs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Partnerships Help DOL Identify Ways to Support State and Local Agencies Serving SUD- Affected Individuals", "paragraphs": ["According to DOL officials, they have begun working with ONDCP and  other federal agencies to address the drug crisis.

DOL officials said they have regular conversations with  ONDCP about how ETA can support the ONDCP strategy within its  current authority. For example, one DOL official told us she  communicates with ONDCP nearly every week. DOL officials also said  they attend meetings hosted by ONDCP which occur roughly every 6  weeks and include representatives from all of the agencies involved in the  National Drug Control Strategy. According to DOL officials, through these  meetings, they have learned about government-wide efforts to support  those affected by SUD, and have shared information about DOL\u2019s own  efforts to address the opioid crisis.", "DOL officials told us they communicate with other federal agencies  regarding the opioid crisis. For example, DOL officials said that HHS  provided a list of available grant funding to address the opioid crisis, and  DOL has sent this list to its regional offices to distribute to states. In  addition, ETA officials told us that two out of the six regional offices have  staff serving on regional opioid task forces, for example, with HHS.", "DOL has also conducted several webinars with HHS on addressing  training and employment needs of individuals and communities affected  by SUD. Specifically, DOL officials described: a webinar in October 2018 discussing topics such as the rise in opioid  use and a screening and intervention technique; a webinar in May 2019 for program staff working directly with  participants in the workforce development programs located in states  in the mid-Atlantic region, which are among those with the highest  opioid-related deaths; and, a webinar with HHS, ONDCP, and other organizations in August 2019  on peer support recovery, including discussing how DOL grant funds  have been used to train SUD-affected individuals to become peer  recovery specialists.", "Internally, DOL officials told us they began a DOL-wide opioid workgroup  in April 2019 to improve communication among units and strengthen  connections across the agency. According to DOL officials and meeting  agendas we reviewed, the workgroup meets about once a month, and  discusses what DOL is doing to address the opioid crisis and identify any  potential gaps in their efforts.

According to officials, ETA assigned Federal  Project Officers from one of its six DOL regional offices to work with each  state. Officials have also encouraged information sharing among  grantees. For example, officials said they hosted quarterly calls among  grantee states, where they discussed performance reporting, evaluation,  and use of the Federal Bonding Program, and have allowed time for peer- to-peer sharing of grant accomplishments and challenges. To  encourage peer-to-peer sharing and engagement, ETA also provided  grantees with a list of grantee contacts in all states that received Phase 1  or 2 grants. However, this technical assistance has been limited to those  receiving the targeted grants, and is not offered to all states, tribes, and  outlying areas that may be interested in conducting related work.", "DOL officials are working to improve available information on addressing  the employment and training needs of those affected by SUD. According  to DOL officials, interested entities can access a DOL website called  WorkforceGPS with resources and materials on substance abuse,  including its effect on the workforce system, and case management  resources. DOL also contracted with a research organization to review  literature that examines what is known about workforce programs for  individuals with SUD. The research is meant to identify key themes and  findings related to successfully implementing the Phase 1 grants, such as  the role of mental health services in the lives of grant participants and  different employment-related interventions. DOL officials said that, as a  complementary piece to the literature review, the contractor was tasked  with developing a resource guide that identifies promising practices  across the public and private sectors, with a goal of providing up to date  information on tools, programs, websites from across the country to serve  as a resource for grantees who are planning and implementing their own  initiatives. Officials said that the contractor shared preliminary results from  its research activities with targeted grantees in October 2019. Based on  these results, DOL officials reported that there was a lack of evidence  about the relationship between opioid use disorder and employment.  Therefore, they said, the literature review covers a broader range of  information related to SUD in an effort to provide useful information. DOL  released the full results of the literature review and resource guide on its  website in March 2020.", "Regarding oversight of grant activities, DOL plans to review grantee  performance through required state quarterly reports, which have only  recently begun to be submitted. DOL requires that these reports include  financial data and program performance information (such as  characteristics of, and services received by, participants, as well as  participant outcomes). These quarterly reports also contain a narrative  section where grantees can share information on project success stories,  upcoming grant activities, and promising approaches. The final quarterly  report for the grant must summarize the successes and/or challenges in  delivering services, as well as address the topics of sustainability,  replicability, and lessons learned. DOL officials said they do not have  plans to share information from the summaries in the quarterly reports  with other states. In addition, DOL officials told us that states generally  are to use the same performance measures for these grants as they do  for WIOA core programs. However, officials said they realize the SUD  population could have different challenges than the rest of the WIOA  population and, as a result, they are looking into developing new  performance measures to address these differences.", "Regarding evaluation of grant activities, DOL has contracted with a  research organization to conduct a 3-year evaluation of Phase 1  activities.

Furthermore, our  review of DOL documents and guidance such as the ETA  announcements to states of the targeted grants and the WIOA state plan  guidance, found that these documents did not fully address the questions  and concerns of state and local workforce officials. Federal internal  control standards regarding risk assessment state that management  should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving its  objectives such as WIOA\u2019s goals of increasing employment and  retention. These standards also state that management should  communicate with its partners to help achieve its objectives. Better  communicating information could enhance DOL\u2019s ability to respond to  these risks.", "Specifically, state and local workforce officials and our review identified  three areas in which additional DOL actions could help officials address  the needs of job seekers in recovery and potential employers:  Clarity about expectations and use of funds. Officials in Arizona, Ohio,  and Washington said they would like clarification from DOL about its  expectations regarding the role of state and local workforce systems in preparing individuals in SUD recovery for employment, or in determining  the appropriate use of WIOA grant funds. Clarity around DOL\u2019s  expectations for state workforce agencies could be helpful, as Arizona  officials emphasized that they consider SUD a public health issue, not a  workforce issue, and have viewed SUD as an issue that is best  addressed on the health side. Also, information on expectations and the  use of non-targeted WIOA grant funds is especially important as states  draft their 2020 WIOA state plans, which will set priorities for state  workforce agencies for the next 4 years. For example, officials from one  local area in Washington told us that they hoped to continue the grant  activities and partnerships past the end of the current targeted grant, but  they were unsure whether they could do this with non-targeted, WIOA  formula grant funding. Our review of the targeted grant announcements  found they did not contain information on whether this was an allowable  use of funds.", "ETA issued guidance regarding the 2020 WIOA state plans in February  2020. However, our review of this guidance found that it does not provide  specific information about states\u2019 roles in meeting the needs of job  seekers in recovery from SUD or their potential employers, or how non- targeted WIOA funding can be used to address those needs. DOL  officials acknowledged that the guidance does not include such  information, stating that the purpose of the guidance was to focus on the  procedures and instructions for states in submitting their state plans, and  not to provide specific suggestions on uses of WIOA funds or what  particular strategies states should pursue. Clarity on the role of states and  the use of WIOA funding would better position state workforce systems to  meet the training and employment needs of those affected by SUD and  their potential employers.", "Better information sharing with all states. Officials from four of the six  selected states identified areas in which it would be useful for DOL to  enhance its information sharing. Specifically, officials in these states told  us that it would be useful for DOL to share information about lessons  learned and successful strategies in addressing the needs of job seekers  in recovery and potential employers with all states\u2014whether or not they  received targeted grants. They said such information would be particularly  helpful given that many states are in the early stages of developing their  programs. Officials stated that information based on the experiences of  their peers would assist states in ensuring those in recovery are job ready  and in hiring and retaining these workers. For example, officials from  Arizona\u2014a state without a targeted DOL grant\u2014told us their communities  could benefit from learning about experiences of states or local areas that  are addressing the crisis within the workforce system, especially those  using an approach that offers wraparound services such as transportation  assistance. Additionally, officials from Ohio\u2014a state with a targeted DOL  grant\u2014said they would like to learn from more experienced state officials  who have been working for 6 months or a year within the workforce  system to address the opioid crisis.", "Workforce officials stated that even if job seekers in recovery are trained  and job ready, workforce agencies face challenges in addressing  employers\u2019 concerns about hiring these individuals. Workforce officials in  five of the six selected states said that information about incentives for  employers to hire individuals affected by SUD, and/or education for  employers about this population, would be helpful given that perceived  risks have led to difficulties with finding employers who are willing to hire  this population. In particular, given limitations of federally supported  incentive programs and the stigma associated with SUD, a dual  approach\u2014education and incentives\u2014may be needed. However, at this  point, most information on strategies to address employer concerns,  including leveraging pre-existing federal programs, is not widely  disseminated.", "DOL officials stated that they recognize the challenges state and local  workforce agencies face in engaging employers in this area and are  exploring use of existing programs to incentivize the hiring of job seekers  with SUD. However, they acknowledged that to date, limited information  has been shared with the large network of state and local workforce  agencies. Thus far, DOL has been piloting and promoting one available  incentive, the Federal Bonding Program, which is designed to help reduce  employers\u2019 risk by offering reimbursement for loss from illegal acts, such  as theft or embezzlement, for individuals with criminal records. DOL  officials have recognized that other existing incentive programs\u2014targeted  to employers of other populations, such as low-income, and other  disadvantaged job seekers\u2014may be helpful. They said that because the  populations eligible for these programs share similar characteristics as  those in recovery, they are exploring how to connect them to employers  who are willing to hire those in recovery. For example, the Work  Opportunity Tax Credit encourages employers to hire individuals from  certain targeted groups who have consistently high unemployment rates,  such as individuals with a felony record, by providing employers with a tax  credit as an incentive to hire and retain these workers.", "However, state officials said, and our review confirmed, that these current  federal programs may not fully address employer concerns. Specifically,  bonds might not protect against other liabilities which may be of concern  to employers, such as accidents caused by an employee under the  influence of opioids. Furthermore, despite promoting awareness of these  programs, DOL officials recognized that these efforts alone may not  increase employer participation, particularly given the need to move  beyond the stigma associated with that condition. Officials in two states  told us that education is an important response in addressing employers\u2019  concerns about the potential stigma associated with hiring individuals with  SUD. For example, New Hampshire has a pilot program on recovery- friendly workplaces to educate employers about reducing stigma  associated with SUD, as well as related human resource policies and  employee assistance programs. Also, Arizona officials stated that  workforce agencies need to understand the employer perspective and  engage, educate, and involve employers.", "To date, DOL has been primarily communicating information about  emerging, workforce system-based strategies to serve job seekers and  employers affected by SUD with Phase 1 and 2 grantee states. As  previously noted, DOL has an existing mechanism\u2014its WorkforceGPS  website\u2014that could be used to share information more widely. Access to  information on promising practices and lessons learned can help  workforce agencies in all states learn about possible ways to address the  needs of job seekers affected by SUD and their potential employers.", "More time to use grant funds. Officials in New Hampshire, Ohio, and  Washington said that a longer time window in which to use the DOL grant  funding would be helpful. For example, New Hampshire officials said the  length of time needed for intake and enrollment for clients with SUD is  longer than usual for a typical WIOA job seeker; therefore, more time to  use the Phase 1 grant funds could help them with the more intense  interventions. In addition, state workforce officials in Ohio told us it is  complicated and takes time to develop new partnerships and trust at the  local level, and to determine what the state and other partners can  provide. Similarly, Washington state officials said the limit on the time  allowed to use the Phase 1 and 2 grant funds has limited their ability to  enroll job seekers in recovery and implement their partnerships.  Specifically, state officials said that the delay in receiving funds means  they will not have the full 2 years for grant activities. To meet DOL\u2019s  reporting deadlines, they will need to complete their activities earlier than  anticipated. ETA officials told us that they are considering extending the  Phase 1 and 2 grant periods for some states. In commenting on a draft of  this report, they also said that If these limitations prevent a state from  continuing its grant beyond a certain period of years, states can apply for  a new grant should it still meet the conditions for eligibility, such as if the  public health emergency declaration for the opioid crisis remains active."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In light of the persistent nature of the drug crisis and the complex set of  issues facing individuals on the path to recovery, workforce agencies are  likely to continue facing challenges in meeting the needs of this  population and their potential employers.

However, state officials we interviewed expressed  uncertainty about what is expected of them or the specific allowable uses  of their non-targeted WIOA funds to address a crisis that has long been  considered primarily a health and law enforcement issue. Our work raises  concerns about how the workforce system continues to seek clearer  direction on the role of states and the use of non-targeted WIOA grant  funding in helping ensure the economic well-being of communities  affected by this public health emergency.", "DOL\u2019s current efforts are still in the early stages, and it will take time for  the agency to fully identify and disseminate effective, evidence-based  strategies. In the meantime, states are seeking the best information  currently available to help their workforce systems support job seekers  affected by SUD and their potential employers. DOL\u2019s targeted grants  provide an opportunity for grantees and non-grantees alike to learn  states\u2019 experiences in addressing the effects of the opioid crisis through  the workforce system, but information on the current approaches states  receiving targeted grants are using is not being shared beyond the  targeted grantee community. Sharing this information with all states could  better position workforce agencies to address the needs of job seekers  affected by SUD and help employers understand and address the  perceived risks of hiring job seekers in recovery.
