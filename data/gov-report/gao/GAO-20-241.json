It includes cyber education and training, integration of cyber into operational exercises, and needed recommendations on changes to cyber capabilities and authorities. However, seven of these tasks have not been fully implemented.", "The Cyber Discipline plan has 17 tasks focused on removing preventable vulnerabilities from DOD's networks that could otherwise enable adversaries to compromise information and systems. Of these 17, the DOD Chief Information Officer is responsible for overseeing implementation of 10 tasks. While the Deputy Secretary set a goal of achieving 90 percent implementation of the 10 CIO tasks by the end of fiscal year 2018, four of the tasks have not been implemented. Further, the completion of the other seven tasks was unknown because no DOD entity has been designated to report on the progress.", "The Cyber Awareness training is intended to help the DOD workforce maintain awareness of known and emerging cyber threats, and reinforce best practices to keep information and systems secure. However, selected components in the department do not know the extent to which users of its systems have completed this required training. GAO's review of 16 selected components identified six without information on system users that had not completed the required training, and eight without information on users whose network access had been revoked for not completing training.", "Beyond the initiatives above, DOD has (1) developed lists of the techniques that adversaries use most frequently and pose significant risk to the department, and (2) identified practices to protect DOD networks and systems against these techniques. However, the department does not know the extent to which these practices have been implemented. The absence of this knowledge is due in part to no DOD component monitoring implementation, according to DOD officials. Overall, until DOD completes its cyber hygiene initiatives and ensures that cyber practices are implemented, the department will face an enhanced risk of successful attack.", "While two recurring reports have provided updates to senior DOD leaders on cyber information on the Cyber Discipline plan implementation, department leadership has not regularly received information on the other two initiatives and on the extent to which cyber hygiene practices are being implemented.

In particular,  some foreign nations\u2014where adversaries may possess sophisticated  levels of expertise and significant resources to pursue their objectives\u2014 pose a significant threat. For example, according to the former Director of  National Intelligence\u2019s 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S.  Intelligence Community, China presents a growing attack threat to our  core military systems and Russia is staging cyberattack assets to allow it  to disrupt or damage U.S. military infrastructure.", "Compounding these threats, IT systems are often riddled with  cybersecurity vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown. Cybersecurity  vulnerabilities\u2014particularly when combined with human error\u2014can  facilitate cyberattacks that disrupt critical operations, lead to inappropriate  access to and modification of sensitive information, and threaten national  security. Most of these cyberattacks can be attributed to human error\u2014 either through improperly configured IT systems or non-compliance with  existing cybersecurity policy. For example, the Defense Information  Systems Agency network was breached between May and July 2019  potentially compromising personal information, including Social Security  numbers. Also, in July 2015, a phishing attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff  unclassified email servers resulted in the system being shut down for 11  days while cyber experts rebuilt the network, affecting the work of roughly  4,000 military and civilian personnel.

The  department concurred that tasks two and six in the DC3I should be  implemented and stated that these two tasks are the only two still  actively being pursued. The department stated that the remaining five  tasks were either implemented or have been overcome by events.  However, the department did not provide evidence that the other five  tasks were implemented or demonstrate how these tasks were  overcome by events during the audit or in its comments on a draft or  our report. In addition, JFHQ-DODIN officials stated that the principles  outlined in the DC3I are important for the department to achieve its  cybersecurity goals. For example, several of these five tasks were  focused on improving cybersecurity awareness and training at all  levels within the department. Therefore, it is unclear why DOD  believes that these cyber hygiene tasks have been overcome by  events; DOD did not elaborate. Implementing all seven DC3I tasks  that have not been implemented can better position the department to  achieve the goals of the DC3I to (1) mitigate the risks of  compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of mission- critical information as a result of human error by users on the  department\u2019s networks; and (2) transform DOD cybersecurity culture  by enabling and reshaping leaders, cyber providers, personnel who  perform cyberspace operations, and general users to improve  individual human performance and accountability on DOD\u2019s network.", "The department partially concurred with our recommendation that  DOD components develop plans with scheduled completion dates to  implement the four remaining CDIP tasks overseen by DOD CIO.  DOD provided classified comments on this recommendation. Thus,  we cannot respond in detail to their comments. We plan to respond to  DOD\u2019s comments in a classified version of this report, which we plan  to issue later in 2020. Developing plans that would facilitate  implementation of these four CDIP tasks would better position DOD to  meet the Deputy Secretary of Defense\u2019s goal of removing preventable  vulnerabilities from DOD\u2019s network that could allow adversaries to  compromise information and information systems.", "The department partially concurred with our recommendation that  components accurately monitor and report information on the extent  that users have completed the Cyber Awareness Challenge training  and information on the number who have been denied access to the  network for not completing the training. The department concurred  that it should ensure components accurately report the number of  users who have completed the training. However, it did not concur  that components should report the number of users who have been  denied access to the network because they have not completed the  training. The department stated that a statistic showing this  information would not be meaningful and would be burdensome to  collect. We disagree that such a measure would not be meaningful  because it would help leaders hold network users accountable and  better position DOD components to comply with DOD policy.  Recognizing that trained and aware users are the first and most vital  line of defense, DOD components should document and maintain the  status of awareness compliance for each user. In its current  approach, DOD is unable to confirm whether all of its network users  have completed the cybersecurity training, as required. For example,  as stated above, 8 of the 16 (50 percent) of the DOD components we  requested training information from told us they did not monitor  whether users who did not complete the annual training were blocked  from DOD networks and systems. If the Secretary of Defense does  not ensure that DOD components accurately monitor and report  information on the number of users whose access to the network was  revoked because they have not completed the training, the  components will jeopardize the department\u2019s ability to ensure that  DOD users are trained in steps needed to address cybersecurity  threats to the department.", "In responding to this recommendation, DOD also stated that the Navy  indicated that it provided us data on the number of its users who  completed the training and the total number of its users.

We  updated our assessment of the Navy in our report. We now indicate that  the Navy was able to identify the number of users who had completed the  training in fiscal year 2018. However, we disagree that the difference  between the total number of users and the number of users who  completed the training equates to the number of users who did not take  the training. DOD CIO officials told us during our audit that computing the  number of users using this method is not reliable because there are  multiple explanations for the difference between the total number of users  and the number of users who took the training. For example, officials told  us that some military users leave the service before they complete the  annually required training and are included in the service\u2019s total number  of users but are not included in the number of users who took the training.", "The department partially concurred with our recommendation that the  CIO assess the extent to which senior leaders have information to  make risk-based decisions and then revise accordingly the recurring  reports.

However, the department stated that it did not fully agree with the  recommendation because, as written in the draft report, the  department believed the recommendation was stating that DOD  should have \u201ccomplete\u201d information. Based on DOD\u2019s comment, we  clarified the recommendation to state that senior DOD leaders should  have more complete information to make risk-based decisions.

However,  DOD did not provide evidence during the audit or in responding to the  draft report that the department had assessed the CDIP tasks required by  the Deputy Secretary of Defense in 2015. Specifically, the department  has not determined whether they remain valid or aligned with the current  cybersecurity threat environment, that the vulnerabilities associated with  these seven tasks were mitigated or addressed, and that a senior-level  DOD official provided written direction canceling the Deputy Secretary of  Defense\u2019 CDIP taskings. More importantly, our analysis of the seven  tasks that DOD is not currently tracking progress on are consistent with  basic cybersecurity standards established by DOD guidance and NIST\u2014 and which DOD is planning to apply to certain defense contractors in  future contract awards to protect DOD information that is stored or  transits through their networks as a part of the Cybersecurity Maturity  Model Certification framework.

That is, DOD agencies are about  71 percent of DOD\u2019s non-service and non-combatant command  components and about 71 percent of our sample.", "We selected these five agencies: Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency, Defense Commissary Agency, Defense Contract  Management Agency, Defense Finance and Accounting Service and  the National Security Agency. We selected these two field activities:  Defense Media Activity and Defense Technology Security  Administration.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense. We also randomly selected  one of 16 components from the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  This group included the offices that support the six Under Secretaries  we discussed above such as the Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy as well as other offices including the Office of Cost Assessment  and Program Evaluation and the Office of the DOD Chief  Management Officer. We selected one component from this group to  ensure we reflected the perspective of components at the DOD  headquarters level. We selected the Office of the DOD Chief  Information Officer.", "To collect information from this sample of 16 components, we developed  a standard set of questions we provided to each component on topics  related to both objectives. In particular, we asked DOD components to  provide the number of network users that completed the fiscal year 2018  Cyber Awareness Challenge training, the number of network users that  did not complete the training, and the number of network users who had  their access to the network removed as a result of not taking the training.  We also asked other questions including a question about the information  that senior leaders are provided regarding cyber hygiene practices.", "Each component provided written responses to our questions and in  some cases provided documentation corroborating their responses. We  conducted a content analysis of the components\u2019 responses and the  documentation they provided. To complete this content analysis, two  analysts assessed the components\u2019 responses, compared and discussed  their separate analyses, and reached agreement on their conclusions  about their analysis. We compared the information we collected from  these components to a provision in NIST Special Publication 800-50,  Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training  Program, which advises agencies to capture training compliance data at  an agency level.", "Further, we interviewed officials from Defense Information Systems  Agency and JFHQ-DODIN to determine the extent to which DOD had  implemented cyber hygiene practices that the department has  implemented to protect its networks from key cyberattack techniques that  adversaries may use.", "To determine the extent to which senior DOD leaders receive information  on the department\u2019s efforts to address cyber hygiene initiatives and  practices, we first defined senior DOD leaders as the Secretary of  Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and DOD component heads.  To identify the information that could be included in reports that senior  DOD leaders receive about DOD efforts to mitigate cyberattack  techniques, we identified techniques that are most likely to be used by  adversaries against DOD\u2019s networks or that could cause severe adverse  effects on DOD\u2019s operations. In particular, we identified 22 key  cyberattack techniques from two sources:  Joint Force Headquarters DOD Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN)  provided a list of eight cyberattack techniques that the agency  observed adversaries using most frequently in January 2019. JFHQ- DODIN officials also determined that these data are representative of  the cyberattack techniques that they have recently observed.", "We identified 14 cyberattack techniques by analyzing a review  conducted in 2016 by the National Security Agency, the Defense  Information Systems Agency, and the DOD CIO. In the review, the  agencies identified 177 cyberattack techniques and ranked the  techniques according to the level of risk the techniques posed to  DOD\u2019s unclassified and Secret-level networks. The agencies used a  number of different criteria to rank these techniques, including the  prevalence of the technique, visibility of the technique, and whether  other, closely associated alternative techniques exist. We selected the  14 cyberattack techniques that the agencies identified as the highest  priority.", "Next, we analyzed the contents of two recurring reports that senior  leaders receive on the department\u2019s cybersecurity posture: the Cyber  Hygiene Scorecard and the Cyber Landscape Report. In particular, we  analyzed these reports to determine if they included information about  DOD\u2019s implementation of key cyber hygiene initiatives that we describe in  the first objective. We also analyzed the reports to determine if they  included the lists of key cyberattack techniques and information about the  extent that the department had implemented cyber hygiene practices to  protect DOD networks from these cyberattack techniques.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: DOD Cybersecurity Culture and Compliance Initiative Tasks", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) Chief Information Officer (CIO) and  other relevant DOD components implemented four of the 11 tasks  required in the Cybersecurity Culture and Compliance Initiative (DC3I)  and the remaining seven tasks were not fully implemented as of October  2019.
