Today, lithium  batteries are widely used in consumer electronics products and electric  vehicles.", "DOD\u2019s influence on the type of technologies developed by U.S.  companies has diminished over the past several decades as companies  significantly increased the amount of their own funds they invested in  research and development relative to the amount of DOD funding they  received. DOD continues to be interested in adapting the technology  developed by commercial companies, such as those related to cyber,  space, artificial intelligence, and unmanned vehicles, to upgrade or  develop new weapon systems. However, as we have previously reported,  concerns about intellectual property, the length of time it takes DOD to  award a contract, and the need to establish a government-unique cost  accounting system make DOD an unattractive customer for some  companies.", "Congress gave DOD the authority to use agreements known as other  transactions, which allows DOD to attract companies or other entities that  have not done business with DOD.

This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD used prototype other  transactions for fiscal years 2016 through 2018; (2) how DOD  agreements officers determine non-traditional company status and  participation in prototype other transactions; and (3) the extent to which  agreements officers followed their contracting offices\u2019 established review  processes before awarding prototype other transactions.", "To determine the extent to which DOD used prototype other transactions,  we analyzed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) from fiscal years 2016 through 2018, the most  recent complete year of data when we began our review. Our analysis  assessed the number of other transactions awarded, the number of  modifications and orders related to these other transactions, and the  number of modifications and orders made during this period on other  transactions awarded prior to fiscal year 2016, as well as the amount of  funds obligated by these actions. Unless otherwise stated, for the  purposes of this report, we use the term \u201cactions\u201d to refer to modifications  and orders that result in a change in obligations.

At the time of our review  FPDS-NG did not distinguish prototype transactions from production  transactions and procurements for experimental purposes, the latter of  which allows DOD to buy chemical, telecommunications, aeronautical,  and other types of supplies and designs that DOD considers necessary  for test purposes when developing defense supplies. By reviewing  information about the types of other transactions from DOD components  that were responsible for 85 percent of other transaction obligations and  71 percent of the number of these transactions, we were able to  determine the type of other transactions awarded by these components.  Based on these steps, we identified eight other transactions out of 244  that were incorrectly identified as prototype other transactions. Four were  awards for the production of products, while the other four were  procurements for experimental purposes. After excluding these eight  other transactions from our analysis, we determined that the FPDS-NG  data were sufficiently reliable for discussing DOD\u2019s use of prototype other  transactions.", "To determine how DOD agreements officers assessed non-traditional  company status and participation in prototype other transactions, we  reviewed relevant statutes and DOD policy related to the award of  prototype other transactions, including sections 2302 and 2371b of title  10, U.S. Code, and DOD\u2019s January 2017 and November 2018 Other  Transactions Guides. We then selected a non-generalizable sample of 11  prototype other transactions that were awarded in fiscal year 2018, and  reviewed documentation about the methods used by DOD agreements  officers to determine whether a company was a non-traditional defense  company and whether the non-traditional company was participating to a  significant extent, as appropriate, on these other transactions. We  selected these 11 prototype other transactions from four DOD  components\u2014the Army, Air Force, Defense Advanced Research Projects  Agency, and Washington Headquarters Services\u2014that had obligated the  most funds on prototype other transactions in fiscal year 2018. We  selected four prototype other transactions from the Army, one from Air  Force, four from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and two  from Washington Headquarters Services to represent a range of dollar  values and a mix of different recipients such as non-traditional  companies, traditional defense contractors, and a consortium, which in  general is a group of companies that work together to achieve a common  objective.", "To determine the extent to which agreements officers followed their  contracting offices\u2019 established review processes before awarding a  prototype other transaction, we reviewed policies from DOD and the four  components listed above. We compared the processes used to review  and approve the 11 prototype other transactions we selected to the  applicable policies. Specifically, we used Air Force Research Laboratory  and Army Contracting Command-New Jersey policies when reviewing Air  Force and Army prototype other transactions in our sample, respectively.  We used Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Washington  Headquarters Services policies when reviewing prototype other  transactions from those DOD components. We reviewed selected  documentation about the prototype other transactions in our sample, such  as those related to management and legal reviews, acquisition planning,  and non-competitive awards.

Further, DOD could award follow-on  production other transactions, without using competitive procedures,  to the participants of a successfully completed, competitively awarded  prototype project, provided several conditions were met. Congress  codified DOD\u2019s other transaction authority for prototype and follow-on  production other transactions at section 2371b of title 10, U.S. Code,  in 2015.", "Congress did not define a prototype project in statute. DOD\u2019s November  2018 Other Transactions Guide, however, defined a prototype project as  addressing a proof of concept, model, novel application of commercial  technologies for defense purposes, or a process including a business  process, among other types. Under section 2371b, DOD can use other  transactions for prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing  the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting  platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or  developed by DOD, or to improve those in use by the armed forces.", "In addition, Congress has required DOD to meet at least one of the  following four conditions to use a prototype other transaction:  1.  There is at least one non-traditional defense contractor or non-profit  research institution participating to a significant extent in the prototype  project.  2.  All significant non-government participants in the transaction are small  businesses or non-traditional defense contractors.  3.  At least one-third of the total cost of the prototype project is to be paid  out of funds provided by sources other than the federal government.  4.  The senior procurement executive determines in writing that  exceptional circumstances justify the use of a transaction that  provides for innovative business arrangements or structures that  would not be feasible or appropriate under a contract, or would  provide an opportunity to expand the defense supply base in a  manner that would not be practical or feasible under a contract.", "Section 2371b of title 10, U.S. Code, does not limit DOD to awarding  prototype other transactions to non-traditional companies. DOD could  award traditional defense contractors a prototype other transaction under  the first, third, and fourth conditions listed above. It could also award  prototype other transactions to consortiums, which may be comprised of  non-traditional companies, traditional defense contractors, and others  such as non-profit research institutions. These consortiums may be  administratively managed by a single firm. Consortium management firms  in general provide administrative support to consortium members, such  as distributing requests for proposals, holding proposal writing  workshops, negotiating the general terms and conditions of prototype  projects with consortium members, and making payments to consortium  members. For example, Advanced Technology International, a  consortium management firm, reported that it represented 298 members  in the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction consortium as of  September 2019, according to its website. The website also states that 87  percent of the consortium\u2019s members were non-traditional companies.", "Contracting offices generally designate a subset of their contracting  officers to award other transactions, including prototype other  transactions.

According to the Army agreements officer, Lockheed Martin was awarded  an other transaction instead of a FAR-based contract because Lockheed  Martin needed to collaborate with four other companies that were  awarded prototype other transactions. The Army agreements officer told  us he concluded that it would have been difficult for all the contractors to  collaborate if some were operating under prototype other transactions  and Lockheed Martin was subject to the requirements of a FAR-based  contract.

This was because neither had performed work on a DOD  contract or subcontract that was subject to full cost accounting  standards in the preceding year, which is one of the statutory criteria  to be considered a non-traditional company. To confirm that the prime  contractor and the subcontractor were non-traditional companies, the  agreements officer checked the System for Award Management,  leveraged market research, and relied on input from technical officials  from the Navy\u2019s Surface Warfare Directorate and Unmanned Maritime  Systems Program Office with industry knowledge about contractors.", "In a $10 million Army prototype other transaction for an artificial  intelligence war-gaming capability, the contractor that was to perform  all the work stated that it met the statutory definition of a non- traditional company. To verify its status, the agreements officer  determined that the contractor did not have a record in the System for  Award Management, which would ordinarily be required if the  company had previously done business with the federal government.

Transactions exceeding that  amount would be reviewed by a higher ranking official, such as the  Center Director.", "According to senior contracting officials, the review process is intended to  ensure that prototype other transactions meet the statutory requirements  for use of the authority before award. The review process also facilitates  component efforts to obtain the \u201cbest deal\u201d for the government based on  decisions by the agreements officers, senior contracting and program  officials, and legal advisors about factors such as whether to compete the  transaction and whether to obtain technical data rights for the prototype.  Table 5 provides more specific information on the review process  required by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Army Contracting  Command-New Jersey, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,  and Washington Headquarters Services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agreements Officers Documented Various Decisions Prior to Awarding Prototype Other Transactions", "paragraphs": ["Agreements officers in our review documented aspects of their decision  making prior to awarding a transaction. For example, agreements officers  generally documented the condition under section 2371b of title 10, U.S.  Code, that was met to use a prototype other transaction, and some  documented the negotiation process with the commercial companies  regarding terms and conditions of the transactions. We also found that  the Air Force Research Laboratory, Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency, and Washington Headquarters Services required  agreements officers to document acquisition planning for prototype  projects to some extent. Senior contracting officials from these  organizations stated that acquisition planning helps programs manage  risks and provides direction to agreements officers who are new to  awarding other transactions. For an Air Force other transaction we  reviewed, documentation included the purpose and objectives for the  prototyping project, the anticipated cost and type of funding needed for  the project, and the transaction award schedule. We found the Army  agreements officer who awarded the prototype other transaction to the  Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Consortium developed an  acquisition planning document, even though policy did not require her to  do so. The agreements officer said she did this because the transaction  had a $10 billion ceiling and she considered this a best practice. Legal  counsel, several senior level contracting officials, and program officials  reviewed the acquisition planning document before the agreements  officer awarded the transaction.", "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency also required agreements  officers to document the reason for non-competitive awards in a  memorandum. We previously reported that competition promotes the  efficient use of taxpayer resources and establishes accountability for  results by helping to drive down prices and motivate better contractor  performance. We found that an Air Force Research Laboratory  agreements officer also documented the reasons why a $1.2 million  prototype other transaction to develop a manufacturing process to reduce  a missile engine\u2019s production costs was awarded non-competitively, even  though policy did not require such documentation. The agreements officer  said the reason for the non-competitive award was that a non-traditional  company is the manufacturer of the engine and has the experience to  create cost-saving innovations to its manufacturing process. The  agreements officer stated legal counsel reviewed this documentation prior  to awarding the other transaction and that management was aware of the  non-competitive status of this transaction during acquisition planning.", "Contracting officials from the Army Contracting Command-New Jersey  stated that, consistent with statute, they did not require acquisition  planning or non-competitive award documentation because they wanted  to maintain few requirements to award prototype other transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Award Times Varied Significantly for the Prototype Other Transactions We Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["While senior contracting officials told us that they were able to streamline  the review process for other transactions compared to the actions  typically required before awarding other procurement contracts, they  cautioned that the time needed to award a prototype other transaction  can vary significantly. We found that, for the 11 prototype other  transactions we reviewed, award times\u2014which we defined as the time a  contracting office released a solicitation until the time the government  awarded the other transaction\u2014ranged from 45 to 370 days. By way of  reference, we recently reported that the time from solicitation issuance  until the time the government awarded 129 weapon systems-related  procurement contracts ranged from less than a month to over 4 years,  with a median of about 9 months.", "For the 11 prototype other transactions we reviewed, contracting officials  noted that the times varied due to factors such as prior knowledge about  the contractor and the complexity of the prototype project.", "An Air Force prototype other transaction for improving missile engine  manufacturing processes was awarded in 45 days because the  agreements officer said she had extensive knowledge about the  capabilities of the contractor prior to awarding this transaction and  was, therefore, able to plan for and develop other transaction  documentation early. The agreements officer told us that she had  knowledge of this company because it had previously been a  subcontractor on a technology demonstration.", "Conversely, the Army took 370 days to award a prototype other  transaction because the government needed time to assess what  contracting instrument to use to ensure multiple contractors  collaborated to build an autonomous airborne network of sensors.  According to the agreements officer, the government needed time to  research the effects of several possible teaming arrangements,  including creating a new consortium, using an existing consortium,  awarding a FAR-based contract, placing all of the contractors on a  single other transaction, or awarding individual other transactions to  each contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreements Officers Generally Followed Management Review Processes Prior to the Award of the Prototype Other Transactions GAO Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["In nine of the 11 prototype other transactions we reviewed, agreements  officers followed their contracting offices\u2019 policies to have prototype other  transactions reviewed before awarding the other transactions.", "In a $4.6 million Army prototype other transaction to develop a  capability to modernize legacy hardware systems, the appropriate  senior-level contracting official reviewed the transaction, such as by  checking terms and conditions and ensuring that the contract file was  complete. Legal counsel also reviewed the transaction prior to award,  as required.", "In a $6.1 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  prototype other transaction, the agreements officer consulted the  Deputy Director about this transaction before negotiations and a  contracting official one level above the agreements officer reviewed  the transaction, as the agency\u2019s policy required. The agreements  officer also consulted legal counsel, an optional policy action, to draft  and negotiate a clause that would waive specific topics of the  commercial rights license that did not apply to the government. The  agreements officer stated that by working with legal counsel to  develop a clause, he was able to meet the program\u2019s objective to  prototype a capability to emulate and validate microchip designs and  accommodate the contractor\u2019s desire to use its commercial license.", "For the remaining two prototype other transactions, we found, and  contracting officials agreed, that agreements officers did not meet policy  requirements for obtaining higher level review before award.", "In the first case, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  agreements officer did not have a higher level official review a $7.8  million prototype other transaction before it was awarded. Agency  policy required the agreements officer to consult with the Deputy  Director of the Contract Management Office about the negotiation  strategy and discuss any issues that arose during negotiations. In  addition, policy required the agreements officer to have a contracting  official one level above the agreements officer review the prototype  other transaction before award, regardless of dollar value. The  agreements officer told us that he did not consult with the Deputy  Director or obtain the required review because he thought the terms  and conditions were straightforward and the dollar value was too low  to require a review by an official above him.", "Senior-level Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  contracting officials told us they were not aware that this prototype  other transaction was awarded without the required consultation and  review until we brought this to their attention. According to these  officials, internal controls were in place that should have prevented  the award of prototype other transactions without the required  consultation and review\u2014such as making current policy documents  readily accessible to agreements officers, communicating policy  changes to agreements officers, and using a data system to track the  development of other transactions prior to award. These officials  stated that they plan to check compliance with the required pre-award  consultation and review during their next internal file review of  awarded other transactions that will be completed in fiscal year 2020.  If they find instances of noncompliance, officials stated that the  agency will take corrective actions, such as providing additional  training for agreements officers. They also stated that they  subsequently reviewed the $7.8 million prototype other transaction  and determined that no changes needed to be made to the other  transaction in this instance.", "In the second case, the Army Contracting Command-New Jersey  agreements officer\u2014who was also the Center Director\u2014had his  Branch Chief review a $10 million prototype other transaction prior to  award. Command policy, however, generally requires the Center  Director to review prototype other transactions valued at or greater  than $10 million. The Center Director stated that he did not serve as  the reviewer on this transaction because he would have been  reviewing his own work.", "Army Contracting Command-New Jersey officials stated that the  management review should have been conducted by another Center  Director or a higher contracting official, but noted that this was an  atypical situation not addressed in the command\u2019s policies. As such,  Army Contracting Command-New Jersey officials plan to revise their  management review policy by fall 2019 to address who should be  responsible for conducting a higher level management review when  someone who is designated to conduct the management review  serves as the agreements officer for the transaction.
