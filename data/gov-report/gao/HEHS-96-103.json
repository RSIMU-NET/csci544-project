On the basis of estimates by school officials, we projected that America\u2019s investment in its schools needed to be increased by about $112 billion to repair or upgrade facilities to good overall condition and to comply with federal mandates over the next 3 years. About one-third of the schools serving about 14 million pupils nationwide reported needing extensive repair or replacement of one or more buildings; 60 percent of schools (many in otherwise adequate condition) reported at least one major building feature, such as plumbing, in disrepair. Moreover, about half the schools reported at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition, such as poor ventilation or heating or lighting problems.", "In addition to that information about schools nationwide, you requested that we identify differences in the (1) condition of schools, (2) amount of funding needed to repair or upgrade facilities, and (3) number of students attending schools in inadequate condition by the following: location (state and region), community type, percentage of minority and poor students, and school level and size.

About 70 percent of these schools serve 27 million elementary students, 24 percent serve 13.8 million secondary students, and 4 percent serve about 1 million students in combined elementary and secondary and other schools. More than one-half of the students in central city schools are members of a minority group, compared with 28 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of students in urban fringe/large towns and rural/small town public schools.", "The average new elementary school today costs about $6 million, and the average secondary school, about $15 million to construct and has up to 150,000 square feet. Accordingly, a school today is likely to have more than one building\u2014an original building, some permanent additions to that building, and a variety of temporary buildings\u2014each built at different times. Most well-maintained and periodically renovated buildings will continue to have a useful life equivalent to a new building.", "Several state courts as well as the Congress have recognized that the quality of the learning environment affects the education children receive. Children\u2019s attending school in decent facilities is crucial to a high-quality learning environment. The term \u201cdecent facilities\u201d was specifically defined by one court as those that are \u201cstructurally safe, contain fire safety measures, sufficient exits, an adequate and safe water supply, an adequate sewage disposal system, sufficient and sanitary toilet facilities and plumbing fixtures, adequate storage, adequate light, be in good repair and attractively painted as well as contain acoustics for noise control.\u201d", "Problems with school facilities, however, continue to surface. Many school facilities nationwide are in substandard condition and need major repairs due to leaking roofs, plumbing problems, and inadequate heating systems or other system failures, according to widely quoted studiesconducted in recent years. Although these studies document some problems and provide much anecdotal information, different methodological problems limited their usefulness. Nevertheless, facility studies conducted by several states tend to corroborate these findings. Furthermore, the Department of Education has not assessed the condition of the nation\u2019s school facilities since 1965, when it found that almost one-half of schools nationwide had at least one defect in building features such as structural soundness or heating.", "Although localities generally finance construction and repair, with states playing varying roles, federal programs provide some money to help localities offset the impact of federal activities (such as Impact Aid to improve accessibility for the disabled) and to manage hazardous materials. Frequently, these programs do not offset all costs, however. For example, federal assistance provided for asbestos management under the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act of 1984 did not meet the needs of all affected schools. From 1988 through 1991, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received 1,746 qualified applications totaling $599 million but only awarded $157 million to 586 school districts it considered to have the worst asbestos problems. EPA knew of the shortfall in federal assistance but believed that state and local governments should bear these costs.", "Because of the perception that federal programs\u2014as well as state and local financing mechanisms\u2014did not address the serious facilities needs of many of America\u2019s schools, the Congress passed the Education Infrastructure Act of 1994. The Congress then appropriated $100 million for grants to schools for repair, renovation, alteration, or construction.

Most of these schools needed multiple features repaired. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems were the most frequently reported building feature in need of such repair. Furthermore, schools with inadequate buildings and building features may be among the least prepared for 21st century technology needs.", "A large number of schools affecting many children also have unsatisfactory environmental conditions.

About 13 percent of schools reported five or more unsatisfactory conditions. Those conditions most frequently reported to be unsatisfactory were acoustics for noise control, ventilation, and physical security. We estimate that about 25 million students nationwide are attending schools with at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition.

Furthermore, 67 percent of central city schools (with almost 10 million students) reported at least one building feature needing repair or replacement compared with the overall average of 59 percent. Schools of all levels had nearly the same percentage of schools reporting at least one inadequate building, building feature, or both.", "Recent studies explain somewhat these concentrations of school facilities problems. For example, a Department of Education study on school spending reported that, in central cities, where greater numbers of students live in poverty and cost more to educate than nonpoor students, schools by necessity must spend a greater portion of limited funds on instruction and less on repairing buildings or buying or repairing equipment. Another study of urban schools with a more detailed analysis of this problem reported that an urban school district actually spends about 3.5 percent of its budget on facilities maintenance. Of this amount, however, 85 percent is for emergency repairs, and only the small amount remaining is spent on preventive maintenance. This, of course, leads to deferred maintenance and escalated costs. During our visits to schools in large central cities, we found that the maintenance and repair budget in some districts was even lower\u2014as little as 2 percent of the overall budget.", "To put these amounts in perspective, in one urban district, the small amount allocated was only adequate to paint classrooms every 100 years and replace floor coverings every 50 years.

The estimate of sampling error depends largely on the number of respondents and the amount of variability in the data.", "Variability in the data is particularly relevant to this report. Analyses are based on the dollar amount reported by schools in response to questions about the total cost of all repairs/renovations/modernizations required to put school buildings into good overall condition and past and future spending for selected federal mandates. The wide range of dollar amounts reported reduced the amount of precision with which we could produce dollar estimates. For this reason, we limited our dollar estimates to a national-level estimate of average and total dollars spent. We then examined proportions of schools that reported spending in these categories by a number of variables of interest.", "A similar situation exists for the number of students affected by inadequate or unsatisfactory conditions. We did not report out the number of students affected for the state analyses because sampling errors for most states were too high (greater than \u2013  25 percent). We could, however, report out the number of students for the other analyses (region, community type, school level, school size, proportion of minority students, and proportion of students on free or reduced-price lunch)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonsampling Errors", "paragraphs": ["In addition to sampling errors, surveys are also subject to other types of systematic error or bias that can affect results. This is especially true when respondents are asked to answer questions of a sensitive nature or inherently subject to error. Lack of understanding of these issues can also result in systematic error. Bias can affect both response rates and the way respondents answer particular questions. We cannot assess the magnitude of the effect of bias, if any, on survey results. Rather, possibilities of bias can only be identified and accounted for when interpreting results. This survey had three major possible sources of bias: (1) bias inherent in all self-ratings or self-reports, (2) the complexity of this particular task, and (3) sensitivity of compliance issues.", "Bias inherent in self-rating may impact survey results because integrity of the data depends upon respondents\u2019 providing honest and accurate answers to survey questions. The results of this report are affected by the extent to which respondents accurately reported expenditures and the extent to which they provided accurate estimates for projected spending. When, as in this case, responses are not verified, the possibility of this kind of bias always exists.", "Second, assessing the physical condition of buildings is also a very complex and technical undertaking. Moreover, many facilities problems, particularly the most serious and dangerous, are not visible to the naked eye. Further, any dollar estimates made of the cost to repair, retrofit, upgrade, or renovate are just that, estimates, unless the school has recently completed such work. The only way school officials actually know what such work costs is to put it out for bid. Even then, cost changes may occur before the contracted work is completed. Therefore, estimates and evaluations reported are subject to inaccuracies.", "A third kind of bias that may occur results from the sensitivity of compliance issues. In this case, our interest in securing information on compliance with federal mandates put us in a highly sensitive area. For example, respondents may have perceived that accurately reporting problems in providing access for disabled students would make the school vulnerable to lawsuits, despite assurances of confidentiality. Consequently, in such sensitive areas, schools may have tended toward underreporting or made conservative estimates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Definitions of Analytic Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["Definitions are based on those used for the 1990-91 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) conducted by the Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Community Type", "paragraphs": ["We used SASS designations for central city, urban fringe/large town, and rural/small town for community type."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Central City", "paragraphs": ["A large central city (a central city of a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA)) with population greater than or equal to 400,000 or a population density greater than or equal to 6,000 per square mile) or a mid-size central city (a central city of an SMSA but not designated a large central city)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Urban Fringe/Large Town", "paragraphs": ["Urban fringe of a large or mid-size central city (a place within an SMSA of a large or mid-size central city and defined as urban by the Bureau of the Census) or a large town (a place not within an SMSA but with a population greater than or equal to 25,000 and defined as urban by the Bureau of the Census)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rural/Small Town", "paragraphs": ["Rural area (a place with a population of less than 2,500 and defined as rural by the Bureau of the Census) or a small town (a place not within an SMSA, with a population of less than 25,000, but greater than or equal to 2,500, and defined as urban by the Bureau of the Census)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "School Level", "paragraphs": ["We used elementary, secondary, and combined as defined below for school level.", "Elementary\u2014A school that had grade six or lower or \u201cungraded\u201d and no grade higher than the eighth.", "Secondary\u2014A school that had no grade lower than the seventh or \u201cungraded\u201d and had grade seven or higher.", "Combined\u2014A school that had grades higher than the eighth and lower than the seventh."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Size of School", "paragraphs": ["We designated schools as small, medium, or large according to school enrollment as follows:", "Small\u2014A school with fewer than 300 students.", "Medium\u2014A school with more than 299 but fewer than 600 students.", "Large\u2014A school with more 600 students or more."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minority Enrollment", "paragraphs": ["We used the following SASS designations for minority students: American Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Hispanic, regardless of race (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other culture or origin); and Black (not of Hispanic origin)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Geographic Region", "paragraphs": ["We used the following four designations for region:", "Northeast\u2014Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.", "Midwest\u2014Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas.", "South\u2014Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas.", "West\u2014Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proportion of Students Receiving Free or Reduced-Price Lunch", "paragraphs": ["This calculation was based on survey question 4 (\u201cWhat was the total number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) students enrolled in this school around the first of October 1993?\u201d) and survey question 25 (\u201cAround the first of October 1993, how many applicants in this school were approved for the National School Lunch Program?\u201d)."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Data on Condition of Buildings and Building Features", "paragraphs": ["We asked respondents to rank the overall condition of buildings and selected building features on an adequacy scale: excellent, good, adequate, fair, poor, or replace (see question 10 in app. VI for definitions).
