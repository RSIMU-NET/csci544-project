High speed rail tends to attract riders in dense, highly populated corridors, especially where there is congestion on existing transportation modes. Costs largely hinge on the availability of rail right-of-way and on a corridor's terrain. To stay within financial or other constraints, project sponsors typically make trade-offs between cost and service characteristics. While some U.S. corridors have characteristics that suggest economic viability, uncertainty associated with rider and cost estimates and the valuation of public benefits makes it difficult to make such determinations on individual proposals. Research on rider and cost forecasts has shown they are often optimistic, and the extent that U.S. sponsors quantify and value public benefits varies. Once projects are deemed economically viable, project sponsors face the challenging tasks of securing the up-front investment for construction costs and sustaining public and political support and stakeholder consensus. In the three countries GAO visited, the central government generally funded the majority of the up-front costs of high speed rail lines. By contrast, federal funding for high speed rail has been derived from general revenues, not from trust funds or other dedicated funding sources. Consequently, high speed rail projects must compete with other nontransportation demands on federal funds (e.g., national defense or health care) as opposed to being compared with other alternative transportation investments in a corridor. Available federal loan programs can support only a fraction of potential high speed rail project costs. Without substantial public sector commitment, private sector participation is difficult to secure. The challenge of sustaining public support and stakeholder consensus is compounded by long project lead times, by numerous stakeholders, and by the absence of an established institutional framework. The recently enacted Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 will likely increase the federal role in the development of high speed rail, as will the newly enacted American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In the United States, federal involvement with high speed rail to date has been limited. The national rail plan required by the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 is an opportunity to identify the vision and goals for U.S. high speed rail and how it fits into the national transportation system, an exercise that has largely remained incomplete. Accountability can be enhanced by tying the specific, measurable goals required by the act to performance and accountability measures. In developing analytical tools to apply to the act's project selection criteria, it will be important to address optimistic rider and cost forecasts and varied public benefits analyses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal, state, and local decision makers have had a renewed interest in  looking at how high speed rail might fit into our national transportation  system and address increasing mobility constraints on the nation\u2019s  highways and at airports due to congestion. Although the current  economic downturn has recently reduced the level of highway and air  travel, projections show that intercity travel will grow again and that  existing transportation capacity limitations will constrain mobility. The  Department of Transportation (DOT) estimates that several intercity  highways linking major urban markets will experience significant  congestion by 2035. According to a recent report, capacity limitations will  constrain air traffic at 14 airports in 8 metropolitan areas, even if planned  capacity improvements are carried out through 2025. In addition, the  dependence of growing highway and air travel on fossil fuels raises  significant environmental concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions.  As a result, transportation decision makers are exploring options that not  only expand transportation capacity and relieve increasing congestion but  also minimize the deleterious environmental impacts of increasing  highway and air travel. The average intercity passenger train can produce  significantly less emissions than other transportation modes.", "The National Railroad Passenger Rail Corporation (Amtrak), the nation\u2019s  intercity passenger rail provider, has seen nearly a 20 percent increase in  riders in the last 2 years, in part because service enhancements in some  intercity corridors have improved overall travel time and reliability,  making the train more competitive with highway and air travel. Still,  Amtrak does not offer service in many heavily traveled intercity corridors.  Moreover, Amtrak\u2019s service continues to have slow average speeds relative  to other transport modes, and experiences significant delays, often  resulting from sharing track with commuter and freight rail. Proposals for  investment in high speed rail in the United States have existed for decades.  However, corridor service that exceeds Amtrak\u2019s predominant top speed  of 79 miles per hour currently only exists on Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor  between Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., and in a few other  corridors\u2014including New York City, New York, to Albany, New York;  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Los Angeles,  California, to San Diego, California\u2014and on a segment of track between  Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. By contrast, countries in Europe  and Asia have developed extensive rail systems with top speeds exceeding  150 and even 200 miles per hour, which have attracted relatively high  numbers of riders compared with other transportation modes.", "As part of a larger effort to reexamine transportation funding and decision  making in the United States, the National Surface Transportation Policy  and Revenue Study Commission and its Passenger Rail Working Group  issued a report that laid out the potential for a new vision of intercity and  high speed rail development in the United States, and that called for an  initial investment of $5 billion per year. Moreover, in October 2008,  Congress enacted the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of  2008 (PRIIA), which establishes a program to develop high speed rail  corridors\u2014authorizing $1.5 billion in funding for project development.  The recently enacted American Recovery and Reinvestment of Act of 2009  (ARRA) appropriated $8 billion for high speed rail and intercity passenger  rail congestion and capital grants (the latter of which were authorized by  the PRIIA), with priority given to projects that support the development of  high speed rail service. To better understand the role that high speed rail  service could play in the U.S. transportation system, we were asked to  assess (1) the factors affecting the economic viability of high speed rail  projects\u2014that is, whether a project\u2019s total social benefits offset or justify  the total social costs\u2014and difficulties in determining the economic  viability of proposed projects; (2) the challenges that U.S. project sponsors  experience in developing and financing high speed rail projects; and   (3) the federal role in the potential development of high speed rail  systems.", "For the purposes of this report, we use the Federal Railroad  Administration\u2019s (FRA) definition of high speed ground transportation,  which is \u201cservice that is time-competitive with air and/or automobile travel  in a given intercity corridor.\u201d This definition does not define high speed  rail on the basis of a specific speed threshold. As a result, our review  includes a wide range of projects, including both \u201cincremental\u201d projects,  which are designed to increase the speed\u2014above 79 miles per hour and up  to 150 miles per hour\u2014or reliability of rail service on existing track  usually shared with commuter or freight railroads, and \u201cnew\u201d high speed  rail projects\u2014capable of speeds above 150 miles per hour\u2014which are  designed to operate on their own tracks or guideway not shared with other  rail services. Our review is also technology neutral, meaning that we did  not analyze or consider the technical feasibility of the various rail  technologies available, such as diesel, electrified trains, or magnetic  levitation (maglev) trains, but rather we considered only the service and  performance aspects of these different technologies in the proposals we  reviewed.", "We obtained information from numerous sources to address our  objectives. Specifically, we conducted structured interviews with officials  involved in the planning and operation of the 5 corridor rail lines that  currently exceed 79 miles per hour, and with project sponsors for 11  specific corridor projects in the United States that are actively being  pursued and have advanced into the environmental review phase of  project development. (See app. I for a detailed discussion of our scope and  methodology, and apps. II and III for a detailed description of each project  we reviewed.) The 5 existing projects are all incremental improvements,  and of the 11 proposed projects, 6 are incremental projects, and 5 are new  high speed rail projects that would involve new track or guideways. Three  of the latter projects are considering maglev technology. We structured the  interviews to determine (1) the most important characteristics and factors  that affect the project\u2019s viability; (2) the most important challenges faced  by project sponsors in developing the project; and (3) the roles of various  federal, state, local, and private sector entities in the development of the  project. Also, we conducted case studies of 2 high speed rail projects that  had been terminated (the Florida Overland Express and the Texas TGV) as  well as case studies of high speed rail in France, Japan, and Spain (see  app. IV for more details on the terminated projects, and app. V for  information on the high speed rail systems in France, Japan, and Spain).  We chose the terminated projects to identify the challenges encountered  by previous attempts to develop high speed rail in the United States, and  we chose these countries on the basis of their experiences with the  development and operation of high speed rail service. In addition, we  reviewed relevant literature on high speed rail systems in these and other  countries as well as information, studies, and reports on domestic high  speed rail proposals. Lastly, we conducted over 90 interviews with a wide  range of stakeholders and interested parties, including academics;  consultants involved in ridership forecasting and planning; representatives  from private firms that invest in transportation infrastructure; engineers  involved in developing various rail technologies; state and local  government agencies and organizations; and officials at Amtrak, FRA, the  Surface Transportation Board, and other federal agencies involved in the  domestic projects we reviewed.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2007 to March 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Five corridor rail lines currently exceed Amtrak\u2019s predominant top speed  of 79 miles per hour in the United States. Proposals for high speed rail  projects in 44 other specific corridors are at some stage of planning and  development. Eleven of these projects have advanced into the  environmental review phase (see table 1).", "Financing for the proposed projects has yet to be arranged, with the  partial exception of the proposed Los Angeles, California, to San  Francisco, California, system, for which voters recently approved $9.95  billion in bond funding. For those projects that currently operate above 79  miles per hour, financing came from federal or state sources. Federal  funding for high speed rail has generally gone to improvements to rail  service in the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston,  Massachusetts, and to research and development. Some $3.1 billion has  been spent by the federal government on the Northeast Corridor since  1990\u2014about 75 percent of all federal funding identified by FRA as having  been spent for high speed rail over this period. The remaining 25 percent  has primarily gone to research and development purposes related to high  speed rail. For example, the first foray into high speed rail development  was in 1965, when Congress provided funding to begin studying high speed  rail technologies. Later, the Magnetic Levitation Deployment Program  provided funds to begin studying maglev as a new high speed  transportation technology and to advance a demonstration project in the  United States. States have also invested in high speed rail in some  instances. For example, state funding was used to help achieve speeds  above 79 miles per hour between New York, New York, and Albany, New  York; Los Angeles, California, and San Diego, California; Chicago, Illinois,  and Detroit, Michigan; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania.", "Several federal agencies have played a role in the planning and  development of high speed rail projects to date, and others may potentially  be involved as projects progress. FRA has generally been the lead federal  agency\u2014sharing that role with other federal agencies, such as the Surface  Transportation Board\u2014regarding the environmental review process. The  Surface Transportation Board must give its approval before any new rail  lines can be constructed that connect to the interstate rail network. FRA  also designates corridors as \u201chigh speed rail\u201d corridors, and is the agency  responsible for any safety regulations or standards regarding high speed  rail operations. Safety standards relative to tracks and signaling  requirements become more stringent as train speeds increase. For  example, at speeds of 125 miles per hour or higher, highway-rail grade  crossings must be eliminated, and trains must be equipped with positive  train control, which will automatically stop a train if the locomotive  engineer fails to respond to a signal. To operate at speeds above 150 miles  per hour, FRA requires dedicated track\u2014that is, track that can only be  used for high speed rail service. No safety regulations currently exist for  speeds above 200 miles per hour. In addition to FRA and the Surface  Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration and the  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) may play a role if highway or other  transit right-of-way will be used or if highway or transit funds are to be  used for some part of a high speed rail project. The Bureau of Land  Management is responsible for granting rights-of-way on public lands for  transportation purposes and, thus, would be involved in any new high  speed rail project that envisions using public lands. Various other agencies  would be involved in the environmental approval process, including the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency,  among others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Viability of High Speed Rail Is Affected by Many Corridor and Service Characteristics, but Uncertainties About Ridership and Other Estimates Make Viability Determinations Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Based on our interviews with both domestic project sponsors and foreign  operators of high speed rail lines, in addition to a literature review, we  identified many common characteristics that tend to lead to relatively high  numbers of riders and resulting public benefits and to relatively lower  costs. High speed rail tends to attract the most riders and resulting public  benefits in corridors between roughly 100 and 500 miles with existing high  demand for intercity travel. Service characteristics relative to other travel  alternatives\u2014such as travel time and price competitiveness, high  frequency, greater reliability, and safety\u2014are also critical in attracting  riders and producing public benefits. Costs of high speed rail tend to be  lower in corridors where right-of-way exists that can be used for high  speed rail purposes, and a relatively flat- and straight-alignment can be  used. While several U.S. corridors exhibit characteristics that suggest  potential economic viability, decision makers have faced difficulties in  ascertaining whether any specific proposed line will be viable due to  uncertainties in how accurately project sponsors forecast riders and  estimate costs, and to the lack of agreement and standards regarding how  a project\u2019s public benefits should be valued and assessed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Numerous Corridor and Service Characteristics, and Trade-offs between Service and Costs, Influence a Project\u2019s Economic Viability", "paragraphs": ["High levels of demand for intercity travel are needed to justify a new high  speed rail line. (See app. V for a discussion of techniques for forecasting  demand for intercity travel and riders on high speed rail.) Project sponsors  identified high levels of population and expected population growth along  a corridor, and strong business and cultural ties between cities as factors  that can lead to higher demand for intercity travel. In some corridors,  riders are expected to come from business travelers and commuters due  to the strong economic ties between cities along the corridor; while in  other corridors, a larger number of tourists and leisure travelers comprise  the expected riders. Officials in Japan expressed the importance of  connecting several high-population areas along a corridor as a key factor  in the high number of riders on their system, to effectively serve several  travel markets, including commuters and travelers from cities along the  corridor. The corridor between Tokyo and Osaka in Japan is unique in that  it is one of the most populous regions in the world, with multiple urban  areas of several million inhabitants located along the corridor. This  corridor attracts the highest number of riders of any high speed rail line in  the world\u2014over 150 million riders annually. In other foreign corridors we  examined, however, population and densities were not as high, but foreign  officials indicated that high speed rail revenues in these areas were  sufficient to cover ongoing operating costs, although not necessarily  sufficient to recoup the initial investment in the line. Some, but not all of  the corridors under development in the United States today have  population levels similar to corridors in the foreign countries we examined  (see figs. 1 and 2).", "Poption (in million)", "Poption (grphic repreenttion)", "City nme Poption (in million)", "Poption (grphic repreenttion)", "Several proposals exist in this corridor, with varying attributes and estimated travel times. See  appendix VII of this report for more information on the various proposals.", "High speed rail also has more potential to attract riders in corridors  experiencing heavy travel on existing modes of transportation (i.e.,  conventional rail, air, and highways\u2014including automobile and bus) and  where there is, or is projected to be, congestion and constraints on the  capacity of existing transportation systems. These situations lead to  demand for an additional transportation alternative, or demand for  expansion or improvements to existing transport modes. To attract riders  from existing transportation alternatives, a proposed high speed rail line  needs to be time- and price-competitive with the alternatives, and also  needs to have favorable service characteristics related to frequency,  reliability, and safety. FRA and others have found that high speed rail tends to be most time-competitive at distances of up to 500 miles in  length.  Existing high speed rail lines in Japan tend to be most time- competitive and attain the highest relative levels of service in corrido roughly similar distances (see fig. 3). According to foreign and domestic  officials with whom we spoke, generally lines significantly shorter than  100 miles do not compete well with the travel time and convenience of  automobile travel, and lines longer than 500 miles are unable to overcom e  the speed advantage of air travel. Between 100 and 500 miles, high speed  rail can often overcome air travel\u2019s speed advantage because of reductions  in access and waiting times. Air travel requires time to get to the airport,  which can often be located a significant distance from a city center, as  well as time related to checking baggage, getting through security, waiti at the terminal, queuing for takeoff, and waiting for baggage upon arrival  at a destination. By contrast, high speed rail service is usually designed to go from city center to city center, which generally allows for reduced  access times for most travelers. Some travelers will have destinations  starting points outside of city centers in closer proximity to airports, thus potentially minimizing or eliminating in some cases the access time  advantage of high speed rail where high speed rail service does not  ,  connect to airports or other locations preferred by travelers. High sp rail also generally has less security and waiting time than airports. On th foreign high speed rail lines we observed, there was no formal security  comparable to airport security, and travelers could arrive at a station jus few minutes prior to departure.", "In France, Japan, Spain, and elsewhere, high speed rail has been shown to  be time-competitive with air travel and has relieved capacity constraints at  airports. For example, high speed rail in Japan has resulted in eliminating  one air route (Tokyo-Nagoya), while several others have lost significant  market share to high speed rail. With the introduction of the Madrid- Barcelona high speed rail line in February 2008, air travel between th cities has dropped an estimated 30 percent (from 5.0 million to 3.5 million  air passengers), while high speed rail riders increased markedly. In  France, high speed rail has captured 90 percent of the Paris-Lyon air market, and Air France officials estimated that for high speed rail trips of  between 2 and 3 hours, high speed rail is likely to capture about 80 percen of the air-rail market over time. By displacing shorter distance air travel,  high speed rail has freed up considerable airport capacity in those cities  for other longer distance flights. However, because high speed rail  becomes a new competitor with short-distance air travel, airlines ha ve in  some cases actively opposed its development. In the United States, most  of the 16 high speed rail projects we focused on will connect metropolitan areas with anticipated capacity constraints at nearby airports (see fig. 4)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty Regarding Forecasts of Riders and Costs, and How Public Benefits Are Quantified and Valued Make Determinations of a Specific Project\u2019s Economic Viability Difficult", "paragraphs": ["While several U.S. corridors exhibit characteristics that suggest potential  economic viability, determining whether any specific proposed line will be  viable has proven to be difficult for decision makers.

For example, a study of  over 250 transportation infrastructure projects in Europe, North America,  and elsewhere, found that rail projects\u2014while not all high speed\u2014had the highest cost escalation out of all the transportation modes studied\u2014 averaging 45 percent higher than estimated. Another study that included  27 rail projects, 1 of which was a high speed rail project, from around the  world found that rider forecasts for over 90 percent of the rail projects  studied were overestimated, and 67 percent were overestimated by more  than two-thirds.", "Numerous techniques are available in travel demand modeling (a  common tool for forecasting riders) and, thus, different models for the  same proposed project could have diverse results. A modeler usually  makes choices on the theory and assumptions upon which the model is  based, the mathematical form of the model, and the variables to be  included. For example, a modeler may design a survey to determine how  travelers would react to a new transportation mode, but there is a risk that  the design or implementation of that survey could lead to biased survey  results. Survey instruments can be scrutinized by third parties, but the  process of data collection is less accessible to outside observers,  especially after the fact. Furthermore, decisions on how to handle data  within a model may enable the analyst to steer the result in a preferred  direction. For an external, disinterested reviewer, the evolution of such  decisions is very difficult to trace.

Of these analyses, none have  formally compared the proposed project with alternative modal  investments, such as airport or highway expansion, although the proposed  high speed rail line between Los Angeles, California, and San Francisco,  California, has created a rough comparison of high speed rail investment  with stated investment needs on the highway and air modes. Even if a  formal benefit-cost analysis has not been done, public benefits of some  domestic projects are considered in some ways within the context of the  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Under NEPA, the  weighing of the merits and drawbacks of the various alternatives need not  be displayed in a monetary benefit-cost analysis, but an environmental  impact statement should at least indicate factors not related to  environmental quality, which are likely to be relevant and important to a  decision.", "Project sponsors with whom we spoke\u2014domestically and  internationally\u2014cited several types of public benefits that were significant  in determining the economic viability of proposed high speed rail lines,  including:   Travel time savings: Travelers using alternative modes may experience  travel time savings as a result of reduced highway traffic and airport use  by travelers shifting to high speed rail.", "Environmental benefits: Environmental benefits could result from  reducing pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, to the extent that the rail  service reduces congestion on highways or at airports and makes use of  fuel-efficient technology (i.e., high speed rail service using diesel  locomotives would provide less environmental benefit than service that is  electrified, all else being equal).", "Traffic safety: Benefits from increased traffic safety include reduction in  traffic accidents, to the extent that the rail service reduces congestion on  highways.", "Economic development, land use, and employment: A high speed rail  system that encourages relocation of households and firms, and in cities  where passenger rail stations are located, could experience growth of  population and business presence\u2014increasing retail sales, rental income,  and property values.", "Government officials in the countries we studied told us that a national  policy decision had been made that the public benefits flowing from high  speed rail are sufficient to justify some amount of public subsidy in high  speed rail systems. In other words, passenger fare revenues are not  necessarily expected to cover the full cost of constructing, operating, and  maintaining the system. For example, in Japan, government officials told  us that the construction of a new high speed rail line will be built only if  certain criteria are met, including stable public subsidies, profitability of  the operator, and a positive benefit-cost ratio. In Spain, one of the goals of  high speed rail is to increase social and territorial cohesion. French  officials said subsidies depend on the line\u2014core lines like Paris-Lyon can  cover construction costs from passenger fares.", "Quantifying public benefits can be difficult, however, and the level at  which to value some benefits can be subject to disagreement.  Furthermore, there are currently multiple federal guidelines in the United  States for valuing public benefits, yet none have been designated for use in  analyzing proposed high speed rail projects. For example, high speed rail  service that reduces congestion on highways or at airports and makes use  of fuel-efficient technology may provide an environmental benefit (i.e.,  reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions). However, the value to  assign to the reduction of pollution and greenhouse gas reductions is  difficult to determine, since there is no current market for pollution  reduction in the United States. Thus, the valuation of pollution  reduction\u2014defined as the public\u2019s willingness to pay\u2014is generally left to  economists to estimate by indirect methods. The valuation of greenhouse  gas reductions entails additional considerations that are based on  uncertain future benefits. Other intangible benefits, such as economic  development impacts, are also difficult to estimate and are subject to  disagreement. Officials in Japan told us that, although they previously  calculated regional economic development benefits and included them in  high speed rail decision making, they abandoned the practice because it  was too difficult to isolate the impacts and because they believe that  benefits accrued through revenues and passenger benefits alone are  sufficient to meet their criteria for constructing new high speed rail lines.  Moreover, while benefits such as improvements in economic development  and employment may represent real benefits for the jurisdictions in which  a new high speed rail service is located, from another jurisdiction\u2019s  perspective or from a national view they may represent a transfer or  relocation of benefits."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "High Up-front Costs Are the Main Challenge to High Speed Rail Development, and Challenges Also Exist in Sustaining Support and Building Consensus", "paragraphs": ["Once domestic projects are deemed to be economically viable, efforts to  develop those projects will continue to encounter significant challenges in  financing the high up-front construction and other costs.

Project sponsors must also sustain political support over  several electoral cycles and coordinate project decisions among numerous  stakeholders in different jurisdictions, typically without the benefit of an  established institutional framework."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Substantial Up-front Investment Requirements Far Exceed Limited Available Public Funding", "paragraphs": ["Once economic viability is determined, the main challenge is securing the  investment necessary to fund the substantial up-front capital costs, such  as those incurred for planning and preliminary engineering, building the  infrastructure, and acquiring train equipment. In addition, high speed rail  projects require a very long lead time, and the lengthy development  periods can increase the uncertainty over future costs and benefits, and  the front-loaded nature of the required spending can increase risk.  Passenger fares are generally insufficient to finance the capital and  operating costs of a high speed rail system, and the public \u201cexternal\u201d  benefits cannot necessarily be captured in a revenue stream based on  prices. Therefore, public subsidies are generally required, at least for the  initial investment. Domestic project sponsors for all of the proposed high  speed rail projects we reviewed, except one, indicated that they have or  will need some federal funding to develop and construct their projects.  The PRIIA authorized annual funding\u2014a total of $1.5 billion for fiscal  years 2009 to 2013\u2014for high speed rail corridor development across the  entire United States. ARRA appropriated $8 billion for high speed rail and  intercity passenger rail congestion and capital grants (the latter of which  were authorized by the PRIIA). However, this funding will not likely be  sufficient to fund large-scale projects. For example, project sponsors for  the proposed high speed rail line between Los Angeles, California, and San  Francisco, California, are anticipating $12 billion to $16 billion in federal  funding alone, and, according to the California High Speed Rail Authority,  total project costs are expected to exceed $40 billion if the entire system is  constructed.", "Federal funding that has historically been made available for high speed  rail has been derived from general revenues, rather than a dedicated  funding source. Consequently, high speed rail projects must compete with  other nontransportation demands on federal funds, such as national  defense, education, or health care, as opposed to being compared with  other alternative transportation investments or policies in a corridor. By  contrast, other transportation modes are funded through federal  programs\u2014such as federal-aid highways, the FTA\u2019s New Starts Program,  and the federal Airport Improvement Program\u2014which benefit from   (1) dedicated funding sources based on receipts from user fees and taxes,   (2) a format for allocating funds to states, and (3) in some cases, a  structure for identifying projects to be funded. As we have previously  reported, comparison of alternative investments in other transport modes,  such as high speed rail, generally does not occur when decision makers  are evaluating projects or applying for funding from any of these  programs.", "Given the lack of dedicated federal grant funding currently available for  high speed rail projects, project sponsors are exploring other federal  financing mechanisms for high speed rail projects, such as federal loan  programs. Available federal loan programs, however, may be limited in  their ability to help fund the substantial cost of high speed rail projects or  the number of projects competing for federal loans. Two project sponsors  told us that they plan to apply (and one project sponsor indicated it did  not plan to apply, but elements of its project would be eligible) for credit  under the TIFIA program, which offers credit assistance to surface  transportation projects. According to TIFIA documents, the $122 million  authorized by Congress annually for the program provides over $2 billion  in credit assistance. Sponsors of high speed rail projects could request  that amount or more for one loan, thereby constraining TIFIA\u2019s ability to  fund other projects in the same year, as we noted when analyzing the  Florida Overland Express (FOX) project in 1999. There may be other  challenges as well. For example, because TIFIA assistance cannot exceed  33 percent of a project\u2019s construction costs, project sponsors must secure  other sources of funding to construct a project, which has proven  difficult. In addition, the availability of TIFIA funds, or other federal  funding, may be questionable since the federal government faces  significant future fiscal challenges, as we have noted in recent reports.  Finally, as Amtrak officials suggested, the TIFIA program\u2019s requirement  that loans and loan guarantees be repaid may be another limitation on the  program\u2019s usefulness in funding high speed rail projects.", "In the countries we visited, the central government generally funds the  majority of up-front costs of their country\u2019s respective high speed rail  projects, and they do so without the expectation that their investment will  be recouped through ticket revenues. The public sector\u2019s ability to recover  its financial investment has varied on the basis of how revenues have  grown, but transportation officials in Japan and Spain told us that a public  subsidy was generally necessary because ticket revenues are insufficient  to fully recoup the initial investment. In Japan, while two early lines  developed in the 1960s and 1970s may have fully repaid the initial  investment and debt related to their construction, three of the high speed  rail lines built since the 1987 privatization have been able to recover 10  percent, 52 percent, and 63 percent of their construction costs through  ticket revenues. Spanish officials told us the original high speed line in  Spain between Madrid and Seville has been profitable on an operating cost  basis but has not covered all of its costs, including the original  construction costs. A Spanish academic researcher told us that future lines  might not cover even their operating costs.", "State funding for high speed rail can also be limited by the lack of  dedicated funding sources and restrictions on the use of gasoline tax  revenues. None of the project sponsors with whom we spoke obtained  funding from a dedicated source of state funding for high speed rail; one  project sponsor (i.e., the Virginia Department of Rail and Public  Transportation), however, noted that it had a dedicated rail funding source  available. Since the two high speed rail projects currently being developed  in Virginia are still in the planning stages, according to the Virginia  Department of Rail and Public Transportation, they have not yet sought  funds from Virginia\u2019s Rail Enhancement Fund, which provides about $25  million annually for both freight and passenger rail improvements. In  addition, according to a report by the Brookings Institution, 30 states\u2014 including states where high speed rail projects are proposed, such as  Minnesota, Nevada, and Pennsylvania\u2014are restricted from spending  revenues from excise taxes on gasoline, which typically is a state\u2019s main  source of transportation revenue.", "In lieu of a dedicated source of state funding, some project sponsors have  sought funding directly through appropriations of state revenue or bond  measures, which compete with numerous other state budgetary needs.  New York State Department of Transportation officials said that  appropriations from general state revenue and bonding measures enabled  them to fund only incremental improvements along the New York, New  York, to Albany, New York, corridor, not the major expansions that had  been planned. The choice of a financing mechanism can have serious  implications for states and local governments, which as we have  previously reported, will face broader fiscal challenges over the next 10  years, because of increasing gaps between receipts and expenditures. For  example, in November 2008, California voters passed a ballot initiative that  would allow the state to issue $9.95 billion in bonds, $9.0 billion of which  would go toward the construction of a statewide high speed rail system.  According to information prepared by California, this bond issue,  including principal and interest, could cost the state general fund about  $19.4 billion over 30 years. Also, bonding mechanisms may cost more than  using appropriations of general revenues. For example, we reported that a  proposal to allow Amtrak to issue up to $12.0 billion in tax credit bonds  over a 10-year period for capital improvements on designated high speed  rail corridors and the Northeast Corridor would have cost the U.S.  Treasury as much as $11.2 billion (in present value terms) in lost tax  receipts over a 30-year period if states had financed their contribution  from tax-exempt borrowing and Amtrak had used accumulated losses to  offset taxable earnings in a trust fund established to repay the bond  principal. This cost compared with an estimated total cost to the U.S.  Treasury of between $7.3 billion and $8.2 billion (in present value terms) if  annual federal appropriations of federal revenues had been used for the  same purpose. Another possibility are tax-exempt private activity bonds,  which can be used to finance high speed rail facilities. Such bonds were  formerly restricted to high speed intercity passenger rail facilities that  operate at speeds in excess of 150 miles per hour and proceeds could not  be used for rolling stock (passenger rail vehicles). ARRA modified these  restrictions to make eligible projects that are \u201ccapable of attaining\u201d  maximum speeds in excess of 150 miles per hour, rather than operating at  such speeds. This modification may increase the number of projects that  can qualify to use tax-exempt private activity bonds for high speed  intercity passenger rail facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attracting Private Capital Is Also a Challenge, Particularly When the Public Sector Does Not Assume Substantial Financial Risk", "paragraphs": ["Both current and former domestic high speed rail project sponsors have  sought private financing but found it difficult to obtain private sector buy- in, given the significant financial risks high speed rail projects pose. In  February 2008, we reported that public-private partnerships can provide  potential benefits, such as transferring some risk from the public to the  private sector, and an increased potential for operational efficiencies. The  level of private sector involvement anticipated by some domestic high  speed rail projects is unprecedented, particularly given the limited private  sector involvement with operating domestic high speed rail to date. For  example, the California High Speed Rail Authority is looking to the private  sector to provide between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion of the total cost to  finance, construct, operate, and maintain the first phase of its statewide  system.", "Private sector firms have expressed interest in high speed rail projects, but  the firms with which we spoke noted that without public sector  commitment\u2014both financial and political\u2014 private sector involvement  and financing would be limited, due to the financial and ridership risks of  such projects. A good illustration of the domestic relationship between the  public and private sectors in high speed rail is the FOX project. The  private sector\u2019s willingness to finance a portion of that project\u2019s  construction costs was predicated on an understanding that Florida would  cover costs that could not be recouped through ticket revenues. Although  the state agreed to provide $70 million annually over a 40-year period to  support the project, it was terminated when this support was withdrawn.  (See app. IV for more detail on the FOX project.) Similarly, in California,  private sector entities have expressed interest in investing in part of the  high speed rail project, but noted that they would need substantial public  sector commitment to the project before participating.", "Efforts to develop entirely privately financed high speed rail projects in  the United States have proven unsuccessful to date. According to the  Texas High Speed Rail Authority, the Texas TGV project, which was  intended to be a privately financed project in the Texas triangle (Houston- Dallas-Fort Worth-San Antonio), was unsuccessful, primarily because one  of the firms involved in the private consortium encountered financial  difficulties. (See app. IV for more details on the Texas TGV project.) In  Florida, an effort to pursue a privately financed high speed rail project  during the 1980s also failed (before the FOX project). One current project,  the Desert Xpress project, from Victorville, California, to Las Vegas,  Nevada, is also seeking to develop an entirely privately financed high  speed rail line, but as of February 2009, the project had not secured private  financing.", "Public-private partnerships are one means by which foreign governments  are seeking to share the financial risks of their expanding high speed rail  systems. In Japan\u2014where the rail system was privatized in 1987\u2014the  national government and local governments still assume the financial risk  of constructing a new high speed rail line, investing two-thirds and one- third of the construction costs, respectively (see fig. 5). With the  government\u2019s financial commitment, the private railroad operating  companies undertake the operational risk and rely on ticket revenues to  cover operating and maintenance costs. The railroad operating  companies\u2019 business model, which includes various business ventures and  nonrail revenue streams, also helps them assume this risk for rail lines  with relatively low numbers of riders, since these additional revenues may  be able to cover high speed rail operating losses, if they occur.", "As France and Spain look to expand their high speed rail systems, they are  exploring private sector participation to, among other reasons, attract  additional financing, and, in the case of France, tap private sector  management and technical expertise. France is contemplating a public- private partnership contract scheme where risks associated with  financing, designing, building, and maintaining a high speed rail line are  allocated to the private sector (see fig. 6). Under this scheme, the private  sector essentially would assume the responsibilities of the public  infrastructure manager, put up the initial construction financing, take on  the projects\u2019 construction cost and schedule risks, and ensure that the  infrastructure is available to a passenger rail operator for a certain  percentage of time. The line must also be maintained to certain levels to  ensure safety. The public sector assumes the risk associated with  operating the rail service, and commits to making fixed annual payments  to the private sector, as long as the infrastructure is available the  prescribed percentage of time. French officials acknowledged that there  is currently much uncertainty about how these arrangements will work  and whether there will be sufficient private sector interest. At the time of  our visit, France had not implemented a public-private partnership.  However, a recent call for tenders on the Tours-Bordeaux line raised the  interest of 3 French contractors. French officials expect this contract to  close by the end of 2009. Spain was in the process of completing a public- private partnership for a line from Figueras to the French border.  However, this arrangement was used to construct a portion of a high  speed rail line in the Netherlands, and, according to an official with the  private sector consortium that constructed this line, if there is a public  sector commitment, the private sector can make a public-private  partnership work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustaining Public and Political Support over Lengthy Development Process and Reaching Multistakeholder Consensus Will Also Be Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Additional challenges faced in developing high speed rail projects include  sustaining public and political support over lengthy development timelines  for high speed rail. As we have previously mentioned, high speed rail  projects require long lead times. The five new right-of-way rail projects we  reviewed have been in project development between 4 years and 18 years,  and on average 13 years. Similarly, in France, transportation ministry  officials told us that high speed rail projects in their country take about 14  to 16 years to complete. This time comprises when project planning begins  to when the project opens for revenue service. A considerable amount of  this time is for studies and analysis as well as public debate about the  merits of a project. Sustaining public support over this length of time can  be difficult and can have significant impacts on a project. As the  experience with the FOX project demonstrated, development of high  speed rail projects can occur over multiple electoral cycles, which not  only can change the course of project development but can also lead to  project termination if public and political support is not sustained. For  example, as we have previously discussed, the Florida DOT had planned to  provide $70 million annually to help construct the FOX project. The  project began under one gubernatorial administration that supported the  project. The project was terminated under a different administration that  did not support the project. Several public and private sector officials we  spoke with cited the need for someone or some organization to  \u201cchampion\u201d a project over a long period of time. French officials told us it  is easier to sustain public support for a high speed rail project once it has  the commitment of the central government.", "There are also challenges associated with the ability to provide  transparency and confidence in project cost estimates and rider forecasts.  As we have previously discussed, these estimates and forecasts can often  be inaccurate, which may erode public support for high speed rail. During  the FOX project, advocacy organizations, state transportation agencies,  and GAO each questioned the reliability of project cost estimates and rider  forecasts. The governor of Florida decided to cancel state funding for the  project, in part due to the skepticism raised by these organizations.  Cancellation of state funding led to termination of the project. More  recently in California, a report by numerous advocacy organizations raised  similar concerns about the rider forecasts and costs estimates for the  statewide high speed rail project. Although the public approved nearly a  $9.95 billion bond to support this project, over time public support could  erode, along with public funding, if confidence in rider, revenue, and cost  estimates is lost.", "Reaching consensus on project decisions, such as a rail line\u2019s actual route,  involves difficult negotiations, which can cause substantial project delays  and disagreements among stakeholders. Given that high speed rail projects  can span hundreds of miles and sometimes cross multiple states,  numerous stakeholders and jurisdictions are involved. Stakeholders  typically include, among others, federal, state, and local governments; the  private sector; and advocacy organizations. For example, project sponsors  of the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor (a project from Washington,  D.C., to Charlotte, North Carolina) noted that some 50 federal, state, and  local government agencies are involved in the project as well as a 214- member advisory committee. Coordinating on project decisions with these  stakeholders\u2014each with their own priorities and views\u2014can be difficult,  particularly without an established institutional framework within which  this can occur, as exists for other transportation modes. For example, in  planning highway and transit projects, federal agencies, local transit  agencies, metropolitan planning organizations, and state transportation  departments benefit from established procedures for planning and public  involvement.", "Development of domestic high speed rail projects may typically be led by  rail divisions within state DOTs or by high speed rail authorities and  commissions. These organizations are often limited in terms of  institutional and financial resources. For example, in the case of the  California High Speed Rail Authority, funding has fluctuated from a little  over $1 million per year to a little over $14 million (see table 4) as a result  of changes in its annual appropriation from the state legislature. The $3.9  million in state funding for fiscal year 2005-2006 was planned to support  approximately 4 staff members in developing a $45 billion, 800-mile  statewide high speed rail system. Rail divisions within state DOTs also  face similar funding and manpower issues, since there is typically no  dedicated state funding for rail services, as we previously discussed. In  addition, rail has generally not been a primary focus of state  transportation plans, which are more focused on highway projects.", "Commissions and authorities may face other institutional challenges  related to their role and authority. For example, a Virginia official told us  that legislation to create a high speed rail authority fails every year it  comes up for a vote because of concerns that an authority might issue  bonds and jeopardize the state\u2019s triple A bond rating. In addition, the role  of high speed rail authorities is sometimes unclear. According to the final  report of the Texas High Speed Rail Authority, as well as the former  director of the authority, rail authorities can sometimes be conflicted  between advocating for a high speed rail project and objectively  determining whether a system is in the \u201cpublic convenience and  necessity.\u201d", "Stakeholder consensus is also a considerable challenge for projects that  involve incremental improvements for high speed rail service. Nine of the  11 incremental project sponsors with whom we spoke said that working  with stakeholders such as Amtrak, commuter railroads, and private freight  railroads can be difficult and time-consuming since each has its own  interests. Projects that cross state lines pose additional stakeholder  challenges, particularly with respect to allocating benefits and costs  among the states. To address multistate issues, some states have pursued  interstate compacts and commissions as a means to formalize decision  making. For example, the Virginia-North Carolina Interstate High Speed  Rail Compact established a commission to provide project leadership and  vision and to define roles. However, interstate compacts can be difficult to  implement and involve working out many practical issues, including  deciding on what type of service to provide, how financial contributions  will be distributed, and what occurs if and when one or more states do not  meet their financial or other responsibilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Leadership Has Been Limited, but Following Reexamination Principles Can Ensure That the Federal Role Is Focused on Yielding Maximum Benefits", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, the federal government has not historically had a  strong leadership role in high speed rail.

With the federal interest clearly defined, policymakers can  clarify the goals for federal involvement (i.e., specific goals could be set on  the basis of the expected outcomes), and can clearly define the roles of  federal, state, and local government in working toward each goal. Where  the federal interest is greatest, the federal government may play a direct  role in setting priorities and allocating resources, as well as fund a higher  share of program costs.

In the 1990s  FRA studied the commercial feasibility of high speed rail and focused on  the economics of bringing high speed ground transportation (including  high speed rail) to well-populated groups of cities in the United States. Its  report identified potential opportunities where high speed rail could  complement highway or air travel. One purpose of the study was to lay  the groundwork for high speed rail policy in the United States. However,  according to FRA, this policy was never developed.", "The PRIIA requires the FRA Administrator to prepare a long-range  national rail plan; preparing that plan will provide an opportunity for the  federal government to identify the vision and goals of high speed rail for  the nation and identify how, if at all, high speed rail fits into the national  transportation system. Although the act does explicitly require that high  speed rail be included in the national rail plan, the national rail plan must  be consistent with state rail plans and, among other things, state rail plans  are to include a review of all rail lines in a state, including proposed high  speed rail lines. National vision and goals, influenced by an intermodal  perspective, have been key components in the development of high speed  rail systems and national rail plans in both Europe and Asia. For example,  in Europe, the vision and goals laid out by the central governments have  evolved from being focused on reviving an industry (the railroads) and  addressing transportation capacity constraints, to being focused on  increasing the role of rail in an intermodal transportation system, making  rail a preferred transport mode in short-distance intercity corridors, and  using rail to achieve broader environmental, energy, and economic  development goals. In Japan, after the initial success of the first high speed  rail line between Tokyo and Osaka, the central government developed a  national rail master plan that laid out the vision and goals for how the  system would develop (including making passenger rail competitive with  air travel), where it would extend, and the benefits that were to be  expected. That master plan has guided high speed rail development ever  since.", "The development of a vision for high speed rail in the United States may  need to be coordinated with reexamination of other federal surface  transportation programs. As we reported, in March 2008, one reason that  existing federal transportation programs are not effective in addressing  key challenges, such as increasing highway and airport congestion and  freight transportation demand, is because federal roles and goals are not  clear. In addition, we reported that many programs lack links to needs or  performance, the programs lack the best analytical tools and approaches,  and there is modal stovepiping at DOT.", "Project sponsors, states, and others with whom we spoke are looking for  federal leadership and funding in creating a structure for high speed rail  development and in identifying how to achieve the potential benefits that  these projects may offer.

Accountability mechanisms can be incorporated into grants in a variety of  ways. For example, as we reported in March 2008, grant guidelines can  establish uniform outcome measures for evaluating grantees\u2019 performance  toward specific goals, and grant agreements can depend in part on the  grantees\u2019 performance instead of set formulas.

In  France, postproject evaluations of the performance of major transport  infrastructure projects have been required since 1982. However, a French  government official told us that most of the current French high speed rail  network was built before this 1982 postproject evaluation requirement  began to be enforced. Consequently, few postproject evaluations have  been done, even though this official said some evaluations had been done.  Government officials in Spain said that economic evaluations of high  speed lines had been conducted but, in some cases, did not determine the  government\u2019s choice of lines to develop. Rather, the government chose to  develop lines that would create a high speed network that extends the  benefits of high speed rail to the whole national territory. Territorial  criteria have played an important role in the Spanish government\u2019s  decision to prioritize high speed rail. In Japan, historical postproject  evaluations have generally not been done. A comparison of actual and  forecasted ridership has been done for recent high speed rail lines and the  estimates have been within 90 percent accuracy. The performance of high  speed rail lines has focused on the accuracy of ridership forecasts, and  these estimates are an integral part of negotiations between the  government and private operators for construction of new high speed rail  lines. For example, construction of new lines is carried out by the  government, but a private operator assumes control over the line and  assumes all the operating and maintenance responsibilities and ridership  risk.

By translating benefits and costs into  quantitative comparisons to the maximum extent possible, these analyses  provide a concrete way to link transportation investments to program  goals.", "The PRIIA specifies various criteria for which high speed rail grant  proposals will be evaluated to determine federal investment. Specifically,  project selection is partially dependent on the consideration of the  project\u2019s anticipated favorable impact on air or highway traffic congestion,  capacity, and safety. Project selection criteria encourage a project sponsor  to evaluate public benefits. For example, greater consideration is to be  given to proposed projects that, among other things, provide  environmental benefits and positive economic and employment impacts.  The rail cooperative research program established by the PRIIA will also,  among other things, include research into developing more accurate  models for evaluating the impact of rail passenger and freight service,  including the effects on highway and airport and airway congestion,  environmental quality, and energy consumption.", "Although the PRIIA does not provide explicit guidance for quantifying or  valuing the economic and other impacts specified in the project selection  criteria, a more established approach to analyzing proposed projects and  quantifying and valuing nonfinancial benefits may emerge, given the  potential results of the rail cooperative research program and since future  proposed rail projects may be evaluated within the context of state  transportation systems and will need to meet specific criteria contained in  the PRIIA to obtain federal funding. In our view, any approach developed,  to the extent practicable, should conform to Executive Order 12893. This  order directs federal executive departments and agencies with  infrastructure responsibilities to develop and implement infrastructure  investment and management plans consistent with the principles in the  order. A key principle is that infrastructure investments are to be based on  a systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs, including both  quantitative and qualitative measures reflecting values that are not readily  quantified. The order also directs that agencies encourage state and local  recipients of federal grants to implement planning and information  management systems that support the principles articulated in the order.  In creating a more consistent approach, proposed projects may be more  easily compared with one another, ensuring that public funding is applied  to the projects and corridors with the greatest potential benefits.", "Similarly, the PRIIA requires that consideration be given to projects with  positive economic and employment impacts, but again does not provide  explicit guidance on determining what is or is not a positive economic or  employment impact. As we have previously discussed in this report,  economic impacts are difficult to isolate, therefore, economic  development locally may not constitute a national net benefit\u2014rather it  could be a redistribution of resources. For example, development of a high  speed rail system could increase economic development in the area where  it is built. However, this increased economic development could be a  redistribution of resources rather than a net benefit. Consequently, it will  be important in implementation of the PRIIA for guidelines to be  developed on how to consider national economic and employment  benefits in relation to local benefits. FRA is currently in the process of  evaluating the PRIIA and preparing final rules for how high speed rail  projects will be reviewed and selected for federal funding under  provisions of the act. The final rules are required to be issued in October  2009.", "Forecasts of riders and costs are two key components of evaluating the  economic viability of high speed rail projects, and rider forecasts are the  anchor for the array of public benefits that a new line might bring.  However, as we have discussed, these forecasts are often optimistic,  calling into possible question the credibility of information being used by  decision makers to pursue high speed rail. Development of stronger  policies, procedures, and tools could enhance the accuracy and credibility  of the forecasts and contribute to better decision making. There are a  variety of means that have been discussed in the transportation literature  and could potentially be employed to strengthen the accuracy of  forecasting. These means include the following:    obligating state and local governments to share some of the risks of  underestimated costs for those projects seeking federal financial support;   obtaining forecasts and estimates from independent sources, such as a  state auditor or a federal agency, rather than sources contracted to  construct projects for a high speed rail project sponsor;   subjecting forecasts to peer review with possible public disclosure of all  relevant data and public hearings; and    conducting horizontal comparisons of projects\u2014that is, using data from  different projects reported using a standardized accounting system to  prepare probability distributions of the accuracy of project estimates of  cost and demand\u2014to evaluate new high speed rail projects.", "Another potential means to improving the accuracy of these estimates is to  align the incentives of public and private interests. For example, in Japan,  for a new line to be built, the private operator must be able to make a  reasonable profit over and above operating costs, maintenance costs, and  lease payments made to the government for use of the track. The private  operator then has an incentive to maximize riders, but also to minimize the  lease payments, to increase its profit potential. Therefore, the private  operator wants to be conservative regarding rider forecasting and wants  the government to build the infrastructure in order to allow for the lowest  cost operation and maintenance. The central government has an incentive  to keep costs low in constructing the line and to extract the highest lease  payment it can negotiate from the private operator. The private rail  operator and the central government negotiate and agree upon a lease  payment, which remains set over a 30-year period. These negotiations are  based on forecasts of riders over the ensuing 30 years and the existing cost  estimates. According to officials and academics in Japan, this structure  has resulted in a discipline that has vastly improved the accuracy of rider  forecasting and cost estimation. For one newly constructed line, actual  riders were within 90 percent of forecasted riders, and the construction of  the line was within budget and ontime.", "In Europe, we found that the use of analytical tools and approaches for  analyzing the public benefits of high speed rail projects was generally a  requirement, and that these analytical tools led to public benefits being  more systematically quantified and valued compared with projects in the  United States. As we previously discussed in this report, evaluation of  benefits can often be difficult and give rise to disagreements, and few  standards exist in the United States to govern such analyses. A French  official said evaluations of public benefits and costs began in the 1980s as  the result of a 1982 law. France\u2019s current approach to analyzing proposed  projects includes analysis of public benefits\u2014including travel-time  savings, security, noise, and pollution\u2014in conjunction with financial  benefits to calculate financial and socioeconomic indicators (such as  financial internal rate of return and socioeconomic rate of return). These  financial and socioeconomic indicators are generally used to compare  proposed projects that meet certain minimum thresholds and to prioritize  them for construction. France\u2019s 2004 Ministerial Order for analyzing  proposed transportation infrastructure projects provides guidance to  project sponsors in quantifying and valuing these benefits, and sets forth  monetized values for specific public benefits and costs. In addition, France  plans to soon build a multicriteria analysis tool that will take into account  additional nonfinancial benefits and costs, such as building in greenhouse  gas emissions reductions, as a means to advance sustainable development  objectives. This tool will guide France in adopting a new national  infrastructure planning scheme. Spain began explicitly including public  benefits and costs in proposed project analyses in 2003. Specific benefits  of rail projects are also outlined in a European Commission guide for  investment projects, and include time savings, additional capacity, and  wider economic benefits such as economic development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensure Fiscal Sustainability", "paragraphs": ["Our work has shown that transportation funding faces an imbalance of  revenues and expenditures and other threats to its long-term  sustainability. We have reported that a sustainable surface transportation  program will require targeted investment, with adequate return on  investment, from not only the federal funds invested but also investments  from state and local governments and the private sector. In the context of  high speed rail, fiscal sustainability includes consideration of such things  as whether federal, state, and other funding is affordable and stable over  the short- and long-term (i.e., both while a project is being planned and  constructed as well as after the high speed rail line is in operation); the  extent to which costs and revenues are shared among federal, state, local,  and private participants; and whether any project fees and taxes are  aligned with use and benefits. Moreover, sustainability can refer to the  extent to which ticket revenues will cover ongoing operating and  maintenance costs to avoid ongoing public subsidy.", "The PRIIA includes recognition of the potential fiscal sustainability high  speed rail projects that might be selected for development. For example,  the PRIIA requires the federal government to give greater consideration to  high speed rail corridor projects that incorporate, among other things,  equitable financial participation in the project\u2019s financing, including  financial contributions by intercity passenger, freight, and commuter  railroads commensurate with the benefits expected to their operations as  well as financial commitments from host railroads, nonfederal entities,  and nongovernment entities. Similarly, proposals under the PRIIA for  specific high speed rail projects are required to contain a description of  the projected revenues and sources of revenue, including the expected  levels of both public contributions and private investment. The level of  public and private contributions, in addition to a summary of the potential  risks to the public, including risks associated with project financing, must  be considered in project selection by commissions set up by the Secretary  to review the proposals.", "The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study  Commission, created to study the condition and needs of the nation\u2019s  surface transportation infrastructure, called for an increase in intercity  passenger rail service, including high speed rail service, and also proposed  a system of fiscal sustainability in its final report in January 2008. The  commission\u2019s final report suggested that funding should come from a  variety of sources, and that a fund should be set up for rail investment that  would collect money from a new federal ticket tax levied on users of the  system. Currently, users of intercity passenger rail in the United States do  not pay ticket taxes or user fees similar to those paid by users of the  aviation system or fuel taxes used to support the highway system.", "In other countries, high speed rail systems appear to be fiscally sustainable  on an ongoing financial basis. For example, new high speed rail lines are  not constructed in Japan unless they can cover their operating and  maintenance costs, not including the payback of the initial investment in  the infrastructure.

Yet the potential benefits of high speed rail\u2014both to riders and  nonriders\u2014are many.

The PRIIA establishes a good framework for helping craft a  federal role in high speed rail (which, to date, has been limited) to address  these challenges.

This will establish the baseline  for federal involvement. To maximize returns on federal investments, it  will also be critical when reviewing grant applications under the PRIIA  high speed rail provisions to clearly identify expected outcomes and to  incorporate performance and accountability measures to ensure these  outcomes are achieved. The failure to incorporate such measures is a  common drawback of federal transportation programs. Finally, it will be  incumbent upon the federal government to develop the guidelines,  methods, and analytical tools to develop credible and reliable ridership,  cost, and public benefit forecasts.

DOT  indicated that the strategic plan may include the Department\u2019s vision for  developing high speed rail services, criteria for selecting projects, an  evaluation process that will be used to measure effectiveness, and a  discussion of the relationship between the ARRA grant programs and the  recently enacted PRIIA. DOT said it is also working to comply with  statutory requirements to issue interim guidance in June 2009, describing  grant terms, conditions, and procedures.

We also agree that the President\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2010  budget, if enacted, could further increase the emphasis on high speed rail  and its potential development. As discussed in the report, high speed rail  systems can offer a number of benefits. However, these systems are very  expensive, can take a long time to develop, and face numerous financial  and other challenges to bring to fruition. Given the renewed interest in  high speed intercity passenger rail and its development and the substantial  resources that might be made available, it is even more important that  potential challenges are addressed and a clear federal role be established.  This includes developing a strategic vision for high speed rail that includes  consideration of how high speed rail fits into the nation\u2019s transportation  system; that the review and evaluation of grant applications under PRIIA,  ARRA and other programs clearly identify outcomes to be achieved and  incorporate into grant documents appropriate performance and  accountability measures to ensure these outcomes are achieved; and that  guidance and methods be developed that increase the reliability of  ridership and other forecasts used to determine the economic viability of  high speed rail projects.

An advantage of such data is that  they are inexpensive for the secondary user and have been subjected to  some degree of quality control by the originating agency. One  disadvantage is that the results of any analysis do not necessarily apply to  a specific transportation project. Another limitation is that the model is  limited by the available data. Micro models can help inform specific policy  changes, such as the option of adding high speed rail service to a  transportation system. Micro data refers to individuals\u2019 characteristics and  behavior. These data are often gleaned from surveys of travelers or  households. Micro data, however, are generally expensive to obtain, their  collection may be limited due to privacy considerations, and their quality  depends on the sophistication of the survey methodology. A danger in  survey data, just as in political polling, is that the design or  implementation of a survey could lead to biased survey results. Survey  instruments can be scrutinized by third parties, but the process of data  collection is less accessible to outside observers, especially after the fact.  Typically, a survey, as well as ensuing analysis, will be commissioned by  the public agency that is sponsoring a project, raising conflict-of-interest  concerns. Surveys can provide ambiguous results for innocent reasons as  well (e.g., such results may be due to differences in methodology).  2. Model building: Constructing a formal travel demand model generally  entails a number of choices and professional judgment. For example, a  modeler usually makes choices on the theory and assumptions upon  which the model is based, the mathematical form of the model, and the  variables to be included. Because models entail professional judgment,  many models are sufficiently diverse (e.g., include differing assumptions)  such that alternative models of the same problem can yield different  results. Also, alternative theories of travel demand could imply different  models with diverse findings. Models with conflicting rationales can both  claim legitimate empirical support.", "In predicting future demand for an existing or new transportation facility,  two types of data are typically involved: historic and prospective. A model  is often initially developed using historic data. The effects and implied  outcomes of the model are then compared with actual experience to test  the structure of the model (e.g., the theory and assumptions on which the  model is based). Details of the model may be adjusted to improve the  results\u2014that is, to make the modeled effects more closely match actual  experience. Once a model has provided satisfactory results, it may be  deployed with data on projected future conditions. Again, forecast  modelers may adjust and readjust the structure of the model. The use of  statistical methods in testing models is usually a trial-and-error process,  thus, rarely is the first result the end of the study.  3. Estimation: There are usually multiple criteria by which to analyze or  interpret the results of a model, and the analyst enjoys considerable  discretion in determining the direction of the analysis. In addition, the  foundation of the analysis is survey data, and the data collected could  yield results dramatically at variance with theory, expected empirical  impacts, and past experience. For these reasons, the nature of the data  and the decisions on how to handle them may enable the analyst to steer  the result in the analyst\u2019s preferred direction. For an external,  disinterested reviewer, the evolution of such decisions is very difficult to  trace. Because circulation of data and models for outside review may be  restricted by proprietary considerations and the population of private  sector organizations equipped to conduct large-scale projects may be  sufficiently limited, the evaluation by independent peer reviewers may be  difficult."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standard Framework for Travel Demand Modeling", "paragraphs": ["In the intercity context, the standard framework for estimating travel  demand has been the four-step model. The four steps are as follows:  1. Trip generation: This step refers to the total number of trips, based on  the idea of \u201cproductions\u201d (households are the most important source of  production) and \u201cattractions\u201d (places of employment or retail  establishments are obvious attractors). Trips can have the purpose of  moving people or freight, either within a region, to or from a region, or  through a region. The main purposes for persons to travel include  commuting, business travel, and leisure travel. Thus, household and  business patterns of commuting and shopping are the most stable source  of information used in modeling, while a more variable source of  information are trips aimed at recreation, and other more episodic  decisions. Model inputs (or variables) used to explain trip productions  include trip purpose (e.g., commuting and home-to-school) household size,  auto ownership, and income. Trip attractions are chiefly workplaces and  retail outlets. These data can be obtained through records, such as ticket  sales, and supplemented by or derived exclusively from surveys.  2. Trip distribution: This step pertains to trips in terms of connected  origins and destinations. The standard approach to estimating trip  distribution is what is known as a \u201cgravity model.\u201d Gravity models were  used in models of trade and migration. In the context of this discussion,  trips from point A to point B are positively affected by measures of mutual  attraction (i.e., \u201cproductions\u201d at point A and \u201cattractions\u201d at point B). The  analogy is to Newton\u2019s law of the gravitational force between two bodies:  that it increases with the mass of each, and decreases with the distance  between them. Trips are negatively affected by some measure of  \u201cimpedance\u201d or friction affecting the desirability of a trip between the two  points, such as distance, travel time, cost of travel, or some combination of  such factors. The inputs to a gravity model could be the number of trips  originating and ending at a given number of zones. A problem in  distribution is the feedback implied by possible congestion or crowding of  a transit facility. The more people decide to move from point A to point B,  the greater the impedance factor could be, depending on how the factor is  represented. This in turn could influence the number of trips. Allowing for  feedback requires additional complexity in a trip distribution model. More  complex models can be implemented. An alternative approach to the  gravity model\u2014where time series data are available\u2014is a model that  combines steps one and two. In such a model, the number of trips  between a given origin and destination is explained by population levels at  each end, travelers\u2019 incomes, and the level of service available for the  mode (e.g., rail and automobile) in question. The apparent simplicity of  such an approach may obscure the advantages of implementing such a  model for the full gamut of trip purposes, in each mode, for each origin- destination pair.  3. Mode choice: This step pertains to the decision on how to travel, such as  driving alone, carpooling, or taking some type of public transportation.  The probability of choosing among modes is modeled as a function of the  characteristics of individuals, trip purpose, and the relative costs of  alternative modes, among other possible factors. The estimated probability  for a population is the share estimated for a given transportation mode.  Obvious factors in the choice of a travel mode include the relative costs,  travel time, convenience, and comfort of the travel alternatives in  question. The choice of a travel mode interacts with personal decisions on  whether to own an automobile, and, if so, how many, and where to reside.  This chicken-egg interaction complicates the analysis of causality in mode  choice. Mode choice models are founded on microeconomic consumer  theory that depends on a bevy of controversial, technical economic  assumptions about human behavior. In general, the theory assumes a high  degree of rational and consistent behavior on the part of individuals,  including foresight, self-discipline, an aversion to risk, and the capacity to  process information. Over the past two decades, a growing literature has  developed providing empirical evidence against such notions of  rationality.", "The purpose of a mode split analysis is to predict the shares of trips over  existing and prospective modes. In principle, the factors that distinguish  choices in Europe from those in the United States would be accounted for  in the model. For example, if motor fuel in the United States, factoring in  the relevant taxes, is cheaper than in Europe, the impact of differences in  the costs of trips under different modes would be reflected in the overall  explanation of the extent to which travelers might choose high speed rail  over automobile and air. A good mode split model will indicate the  strengths of the assorted factors, including the preference for one  transportation mode over another, assuming all other factors are equal.  The extent to which government policies\u2014such as the impact of motor  fuels\u2019 taxes on travel costs\u2014influence the choice, can be abstracted from,  to assess underlying preferences.  4. Route assignment: The final step of travel demand modeling is to  determine the distribution of trips between two given points for all modes  over the possible routes between the points. Assuming travelers prefer the  route that takes the least time, given decisions about destination and  mode, in a regional setting with many zones and a multitude of paths  between a multitude of points, a mathematical programming problem of  considerable complexity is encountered. Even so, such a problem glosses  over the extent of congestion and resulting changes in travel time to which  particular routes can be subjected. Reckoning with the associated  feedback\u2014travelers on congested routes choose alternatives\u2014adds  complexity to the exercise. When travel times are minimized on all routes  and no traveler has an incentive to choose yet another alternative, the  system is said to be in equilibrium. Uncovering such an equilibrium is a  goal of route assignment modeling. Pressure on particular route segments  provides information to the policymaker on the possible expansion of the  network or the use of tolls to reduce congestion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Description of the Proposed Los Angeles, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, High Speed Rail Corridor", "paragraphs": ["Three separate high speed rail proposals connecting the Los Angeles,  California, and Las Vegas, Nevada, metropolitan areas illustrate the  ridership and cost trade-offs that are associated with selecting, among  other things, a particular route or train technology.

Project sponsors for each option  indicated that a transportation need exists between the two regions, due  to capacity constraints on existing transportation modes, significant  growth in population and employment, and projections for future growth  in the long term. One-third of all visitors to Las Vegas are from California,  and more than 10 million visitors are estimated to come from the Southern  California area. This travel is estimated to grow substantially by 2030,  although the Las Vegas economy has been hit particularly hard by the  recent economic crisis, as reflected in the recent decreases in visitor  volume. However, according to one project sponsor, travel from Southern  California to Las Vegas has not been as severely impacted as visitation  from elsewhere, as reflected by traffic counts on Interstate 15 (I-15) at the  Nevada state line, which show only about a 5 percent reduction in  automobile traffic.", "High speed rail stakeholders with whom we spoke said ridership on any  high speed rail line will be impacted by the location of the rail stations in  relation to where potential riders live for all stations along the line, but  especially at the ends of the line. Desert Xpress will most likely forgo some  ridership by terminating service outside of the Los Angeles area (in  Victorville). Because riders must first drive their personal vehicles to  Victorville\u2014typically the most congested portion of the automobile trip  between the Los Angeles area and Las Vegas\u2014and then board a train,  stakeholders have expressed concern regarding the level of risk related to  the estimates of riders. Similarly, the maglev project is designed to  terminate in Anaheim, which may also result in fewer riders than  connecting directly to the more populous Los Angeles area, and similar  concerns over risks associated with overly optimistic ridership estimates  have been expressed. The conventional rail proposal, while connecting  directly into downtown Los Angeles, is plagued by slow speeds and travel  times that are not as competitive with automobile or air travel.

However, according to transportation  officials, this segment of the trip can be significantly delayed depending on  traffic conditions, in some cases, resulting in travel times to Victorville of  up to 3 hours.
