The Navy report addressed the potential for reducing maintenance and repair costs for the Navy\u0092s small boat fleet by using advanced boat lifts, and it addressed recommendations regarding the potential establishment of improved boat corrosion control and prevention as key performance parameters. The Navy report partially addressed the committee\u0092s direction to include an evaluation and business case analysis of the impact of advanced boat lifts for potential improvements to small boat acquisition costs and life-cycle sustainment. The report\u0092s business case analysis evaluated potential improvements to life-cycle sustainment, focusing on potential maintenance cost savings associated with boat lifts. However, this business case analysis did not evaluate the impact of the use of advanced boat lifts on potential improvements to small boat acquisition costs. Navy officials told GAO that the use of advanced boat lifts would not significantly contribute to extending the service life of the boats or produce any other additional benefits that would lead to reduced small boat acquisition costs. This is primarily because a critical feature of current procurement strategies is to select, specify, or design boats that are made from corrosion-resistant materials and use components that are corrosion resistant. Nonetheless, the Navy did not include this justification in the report or analyze the potential effects of the use of boat lifts on small boat acquisition costs in the report\u0092s business case analysis.", "While the Navy completed a business case analysis of the impact of reduced maintenance and repair costs for the Navy\u0092s small boat fleet through the use of advanced boat lifts, GAO found several areas in which more complete information could have been included to better support the findings of the Navy study. The April 2011 DOD Product Support Business Case Analysis Guidebook provides standards for the DOD business case analysis process used to conduct analyses of costs, benefits, and risks. GAO identified several areas in which more comprehensive information, consistent with the DOD guidebook, could have been included in the Navy\u0092s business case analysis. For example, the Navy did not include (1) actual lift installation and maintenance cost data or (2) qualitative data on other potential costs and benefits associated with the use of boat lifts, particularly location- and mission-specific benefits, from Navy installations that are using 72 recently acquired boat lifts. The DOD guidebook indicates that authoritative data sources\u0097those used to conduct the financial and nonfinancial analysis for a business case analysis\u0097should be comprehensive and accurate. Navy officials recognized that more comprehensive information would have been useful, but noted that they were unable to systematically survey all current boat lift users within the few months they had to complete their business case analysis. The Navy noted in its report that a significant number of boat lifts have recently entered service in the fleet and that the Navy will monitor service experience, data that may provide a basis for future decisions regarding the use of boat lifts. Without more complete information, the Navy may not be fully informed when it considers making future investments in boat lifts or other storage and harboring techniques at individual locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Navy collect and include more complete information when evaluating future investment decisions at individual locations.

According to the Navy, the use of trailers can also facilitate timely  logistical movement. The Navy has over 1,800 boat trailers in stock.  Another technique is to use boat lifts, which are designed to raise a boat  out of the water to reduce the effects of the saltwater environment on the  hull, appendages, and exposed machinery components. The Navy has 72  boat lifts in stock located at Navy installations around the world (e.g.,  Norfolk, Virginia; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Bahrain).

Specifically, the report noted that the boat corrosion and  control prevention aspect of sustainment is not a stand-alone testable  quantity; therefore it fails to meet an important criterion for a key  performance parameter.  Include a recommendation regarding the potential establishment of  improved boat corrosion control and prevention as a requirement for  Naval Sea Systems Command to incorporate into its acquisition  strategies: The report stated that corrosion control and prevention are  already a well-established part of the requirements used by Naval Sea  Systems Command in its acquisition strategies for procurement  contracts for small boats.
