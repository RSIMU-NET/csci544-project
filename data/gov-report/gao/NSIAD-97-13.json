These problems have been exacerbated in recent years by reductions in military force structure and related weapon system procurement; changes in military operational requirements due to the end of the Cold War; increased reliability, maintainability, and durability of military systems; increased maintenance performed in operational units; and increased privatization of depot maintenance workloads.", "Beginning in the late 1980s, DOD\u2014primarily through the BRAC process\u2014reduced some of its excess capacity by closing a number of depots and transferring most workloads to remaining depots and some to the private sector. Altogether, the first three BRAC rounds (1988, 1991, and 1993) resulted in recommendations to close nine Army and Navy depots and the Air Force\u2019s Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center.

The downsizing was to be accomplished through consolidating similar workloads, mothballing or disposing of plant equipment, and tearing down buildings. The Commission also estimated that annual savings would be $89 million after the implementation period and that the net present value of all costs and savings over a 20-year period would be $991.2 million.", "The 1995 BRAC Commission concluded that DOD\u2019s downsizing approach would not adequately reduce infrastructure and overhead costs. It recommended closing the Sacramento and San Antonio centers and transferring their workloads to the remaining depots or private sector commercial activities. In making its closure and workload transfer recommendations, the Commission considered the effects on the local communities, workload transfer costs, and potential effects on readiness. It concluded that the savings and benefits outweighed the potential drawbacks. The Commission\u2019s report noted that given the significant amount of excess depot capacity and limited DOD resources, closure is a necessity. Further, closing these activities would improve the use of the remaining centers and substantially reduce DOD operating costs. The specific Commission recommendations were as follows:", "Realign Kelly Air Force Base, including the air logistics center; disestablish the defense distribution depot; consolidate the workloads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council; and move the required equipment and personnel to the receiving locations.", "Close McClellan Air Force Base, including the air logistics center; disestablish the defense distribution depot; move the common-use ground communication electronics to Tobyhanna Army Depot, Pennsylvania; retain the radiation center and make it available for dual use and/or research, or close as appropriate; consolidate the remaining workloads with other DOD depots or private sector commercial activities as determined by the Council; and move the required equipment and any required personnel to receiving locations. All other activities and facilities at the base will close.", "The Commission estimated that these recommendations would require one-time implementation costs of $822.6 million but would yield net savings of $151.2 million during the 6-year implementation period. Further, they would yield annual savings of $338.2 million after the implementation period, about $70 million of which represented depot maintenance savings. The projected depot maintenance savings were developed by assuming that the number of depot maintenance personnel could be reduced by 15 percent. The Commission estimated that the net present value of savings over 20 years, including the 6-year implementation period, would be $3.5 billion.

One of the major reasons for this increase is that as requirements have declined, the large fixed overhead costs for both the depots and the bases on which they are located must be allocated to a smaller depot maintenance workload base. As we noted previously, about 3,100 military and civilian personnel are involved in base support operations at Kelly Air Force Base and 2,600 at McClellan Air Force Base. These operations support center activities, including the depots, as well as other base tenant activities. It is estimated that a military depot with several thousand employees incurs fixed overhead costs of from $50 million to $100 million annually. By closing bases, DOD can eliminate base support and depot maintenance infrastructure and achieve substantial future savings. Additionally, consolidating workloads from closing depots with workloads of underused Air Force depots could yield additional savings at the receiving depots by increasing their efficiency, spreading their fixed overhead costs over a larger workload base, and lowering their average costs.", "Privatizing-in-place does not substantially reduce infrastructure and excess capacity. It just moves some of it to the private sector. Private sector manufacturing and repair facilities also have extensive excess capacity. The privatization-in-place of the Sacramento and San Antonio depots will not reduce the large amount of excess capacity in the Air Force depot system and the private sector or their associated costs, unless additional facilities are closed or other cost-reduction means are successfully implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidating Workloads Could Produce Substantial Savings", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force\u2019s planning has not progressed far enough to compare precisely the cost of privatizing depot workloads in place with the cost of transferring the work to other underused depots. However, because privatization-in-place will have little effect on excess capacity at the remaining depots, it is unlikely that any savings would offset the cost of maintaining excess depot capacity.", "The Navy\u2019s experience closing naval aviation depots and consolidating workloads at remaining Navy facilities provides useful insights regarding the benefits of this closure option. According to Navy officials, consolidating workloads from three closing naval aviation depots and quickly moving most of this workload to the three remaining depots was projected to reduce excess capacity and decrease the overhead rates at remaining naval aviation depots. Capacity utilization was projected to increase 35 percent as a result of this consolidation. The utilization rate for each depot varies depending on the specific workload transfers and other variables, such as the rate of decline of their pre-consolidation workload base. Overall, the economy and efficiency improvements were projected to decrease the overhead rates by 18 percent between fiscal years 1994 and 1997. Based on a 10-million hour workload program, the consolidation could save an additional $100 million annually. Navy officials stated that because of the continuous decline in depot maintenance workloads and other factors, anticipated savings cannot be measured precisely. However, they noted that closing naval aviation depots and consolidating workloads in the Navy\u2019s remaining three depots has clearly improved efficiency and lowered the cost of the Navy depot maintenance program.", "Our analysis of BRAC Commission estimates indicates that the closure of the depots at the San Antonio and Sacramento logistics centers were expected to save about $70 million annually. Based on our analysis of Air Force data, the actual savings could be as much as $206 million annually, if the closing depots\u2019 work is transferred to the remaining military depots. The Commission\u2019s estimate assumed that about 15 percent of the maintenance personnel at the closing centers could be eliminated. This evaluation did not attempt to measure economy and efficiency improvements that resulted from workload consolidation. However, our analysis indicates that transferring about 8.2 million hours of work from the closing Air Force depots to the three remaining depots would (1) reduce these three depots\u2019 excess capacity from about 46 percent to about 8 percent, (2) lower the hourly rates by an average of $6.00 at receiving locations, and (3) save as much as $182 million annually as a result of economies of scale and other efficiencies. This estimate was based on a workload redistribution plan that would only relocate  78 percent of the available hours to Air Force depots. This reallocation plan was developed by the Joint Depot Cross Service Group during the BRAC 1995 process. If our analysis had included a plan for redistributing all 10.5 million available hours of work, then our projected annual recurring savings would have been higher. Similarly, the Army estimates that the Commission-mandated transfer of about 1.2 million hours of ground communications workload from the Sacramento depot to the Tobyhanna Army Depot will save an additional $24 million.", "According to financial management officials at the three remaining centers, it will cost about $475 million to absorb all of the 10.5 million direct labor hours of the Sacramento and San Antonio depot work currently available for reallocation. Comparing this cost estimate to our $206 million projected annual savings indicates that net savings would occur within 2-1/2 years of the consolidation. Transition costs for moving only 78 percent of that workload would be less; therefore, net savings would occur in even less time if all of the 10.5 million direct labor hours available for redistribution to Air Force depots were moved. Moreover, $318 million of the projected $475 million are associated with the release or movement of depot maintenance personnel, and the costs are about the same for either option. DOD will incur these costs regardless of whether the workload is moved to other military depots or privatized-in-place. It could recoup the remaining $157 million in less than 1 year if the workloads were consolidated at other Air Force depots. Additionally, over $110 million of the remaining $157 million cost is required to support the movement of the C-5 aircraft workload. A decision to privatize the C-5 workload in place or at a contractor facility would reduce transition costs to between $50 million and $100 million, including the additional costs estimated to be required for the privatization. Thus, the cost of moving all but the C-5 is estimated to have a payback period of less than 8 months. Finally, the potential $200 million annual savings that could result from the consolidation is in addition to the BRAC Commission\u2019s $268-million savings estimate for eliminating base support operations and non-depot maintenance personnel at the McClellan and Kelly Air Force Bases.", "On the other hand, if the remaining depots do not receive additional workload, they are likely to continue to operate with significant excess capacity and become more inefficient and expensive as workloads dwindle due to downsizing and privatization initiatives. If a depot is not closed, excess capacity and costs could still be reduced by downsizing-in-place and implementing various economy and efficiency initiatives. However, the amount of the reduction could be minimal without further workload consolidations and depot closures. Additionally, the remaining Air Force depots are located on large multi-functional bases that support other missions and optimum savings could not be achieved unless the entire base is closed.", "Subsequent to our analysis, the Air Force Materiel Command analyzed potential savings from workload consolidation, including how increasing the efficiency of underused military depots would lower fixed overhead rates. This analysis showed that annual savings of $367 million can be achieved through consolidation of workloads in remaining DOD depots. Further, an additional $322 million could also be saved by relocating workload to depots that already have lower hourly rates.

The Air Force\u2019s plans initially focused on privatizing five prototype workloads\u2014three at Sacramento and two at San Antonio. The BRAC Commission report specified that the Defense Depot Maintenance Council should determine where depot maintenance workloads from the closing Air Force depots should be moved. The Council approved the Air Force\u2019s plan for the five prototype workloads on February 1, 1996. Table 2 shows the proposed prototype program, including the estimated annual value of the workloads and the number of workers involved.", "The prototype workloads involved about 11 percent of the San Antonio depot\u2019s maintenance personnel and about 27 percent of the Sacramento depot\u2019s personnel.

Contract awards were projected for the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 for the hydraulics, software, C-5 paint/depaint, and fuel accessories workloads, and the second quarter of fiscal year 1997 for electronic accessories. while privatization is desirable and will deliver more for the defense dollar, the more restrictive Privatization-in-Place is counterintuitive. The Department of Defense is expecting the private sector, which already carries significant excess capacity due to defense downsizing, to be willing to take on workload to be performed at a closing base.

Shortly thereafter, Air Force planners began to focus on a concept that would involve several large consolidated work packages, essentially one at Sacramento and two at San Antonio (one for the C-5 aircraft and one for engines). The Defense Depot Maintenance Council approved the revised acquisition strategy in August 1996. However, the 10 U.S.C. 2466 provision that limits private sector depot maintenance performance to no more than 40 percent\u2014the 60/40 rule\u2014constrains the Air Force\u2019s ability to privatize depot maintenance workloads.

If the 60/40 provision is not repealed in the future, the remaining  $1.05 billion workload will be transferred to other military depots. This will substantially increase the use of these depots and reduce their labor hour rates for all workloads. If the 60/40 provision is repealed, DOD will need to eliminate substantial excess capacity at the military depots to reduce the cost impact of further privatization. In addition to the 60/40 provision, Air Force officials stated that they intend to comply with the 10 U.S.C. 2469 provision requiring public/private competitions before transferring depot-level workloads valued at not less than $3 million to the private sector.", "Under the revised strategy, one request for proposals will be issued for all Sacramento workloads that are proposed to be privatized-in-place, including A-10 and KC-135 aircraft, hydraulics, instruments and electronic accessories, and software. Air Force planners estimated the value of the Sacramento workload to be about $220 million annually, with a projected 2,200 workers involved. According to Air Force officials, the Sacramento work package can be privatized without breaching the 60/40 provision. The Air Force is following a three-phased approach for competing the Sacramento workload. The first phase began on November 8, 1996, with the issuance of a request for proposals for a study to analyze the Sacramento depot workload, explore approaches for process improvement, and make recommendations for the maintenance contract solicitation. The Air Force anticipates awarding study contracts to one or two offerors for about $750,000 in January 1997. The second phase, the contract study, is scheduled to run until September 1997, although the Air Force plans to issue a request for proposals for the maintenance contract in July 1997. The final phase, the award of the maintenance contract, is expected in January 1998.", "A two-pronged acquisition strategy has been proposed for San Antonio. One request for proposals is for the C-5 aircraft business area, which has an annual value of $155 million and involves about 1,200 workers. The Air Force issued a draft request for proposals for the C-5 workload in November 1996. The strategy for San Antonio\u2019s engine business area is uncertain, largely because of the 60/40 provision. According to Air Force officials, since the 60/40 provision has not been repealed, only a portion of the $700 million San Antonio engine workload can be privatized along with the other proposed packages. Air Force planners estimated that about $240 million of San Antonio\u2019s engine workload could be privatized without breaching the 60/40 threshold. This limitation would likely allow privatization of only one, or portions of all three, of San Antonio\u2019s three large engine workloads.", "Because of the 60/40 provision, preliminary Air Force plans provide for some workloads to be transferred to the three remaining Air Force depots. These transfers would include electrical components, automatic test equipment hardware, F-15 workload and gas turbine engines, and engine workloads over the 60/40 limitation. San Antonio and Sacramento local manufacturing workloads would also be transferred to one of the three remaining Air Force depots in 2001. Personnel associated with the weapon system and item management functions at the closing centers are also scheduled to be transferred in 2001 to one of the three remaining air logistics centers or to one of the Air Force product centers that manage the acquisition of Air Force systems and equipment. Further, the Air Force microelectronics facility located at the Sacramento depot will transfer to the Defense Logistics Agency.

As we recently reported, this delay will decrease savings and result in interim personnel reductions at Tobyhanna. According to Army officials, delaying all of the workload transfers to Tobyhanna until 2001 could require the depot to undergo a reduction-in-force, followed by a costly rehiring and retraining situation when it does eventually receive the Air Force workloads. Because its workload has been declining, Tobyhanna has already voluntarily separated about 250 of its personnel during 1996. Army officials said that about 800 personnel may be involuntarily separated in fiscal years 1997 or 1998 if no additional workloads are transferred to Tobyhanna. This reduction would include the loss of personnel having critical skills and competencies needed to work on the ground communications workload."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Statutes Affect Efforts to Privatize Workloads", "paragraphs": ["As we previously reported, various statutory restrictions may affect how much of the depot-level workloads can be transferred to the private sector\u2014through privatization-in-place or otherwise. They include 10 U.S.C. 2464, 10 U.S.C. 2466, and 10 U.S.C. 2469. While each of these statutes has some affect on the allocation of DOD\u2019s depot-level workload, 10 U.S.C. 2469 constitutes the primary impediment to privatization in the absence of a public-private competition.", "Competition requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2469 have broad application to all changes to the depot-level workload valued at not less than $3 million that is currently performed at DOD installations, which include Kelly and McClellan. They require DOD to give other public depots the opportunity to compete for the closing depots\u2019 workloads. The statute does not provide any exemptions from its competition requirements and, unlike most of the other laws governing depot maintenance, does not contain a waiver provision. Further, there is nothing in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990\u2014the authority for the BRAC recommendations\u2014that, in our view, would permit the implementation of a recommendation involving privatization outside of the competition requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2469.", "The determination of whether any single conversion to private sector performance conforms to the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2469 depends upon the facts applicable to the particular conversion. While DOD has stated that it will structure these conversions to comply with existing statutory restrictions, details of its privatization plans for Kelly and McClellan are still evolving. Sufficient information regarding the detailed procedures for conducting the competitions for the Sacramento and San Antonio workloads is not available for us to assess whether the planned conversions will comply with the requirements of existing law. Further, the planned privatizations at Sacramento and San Antonio are now the subject of litigation.

As a result, we (1) reviewed the BRAC Commission\u2019s cost and savings estimates and (2) estimated the \u201ceconomy of scale\u201d savings that could be achieved by using the closing depots\u2019 workloads to reduce excess capacity in the remaining depots.", "To estimate the potential from transferring the closing depots\u2019 workloads to the remaining depots, we allocated 8.2 million hours of work, or about 78 percent of the projected fiscal year 1999 workload, to the three remaining centers. We used a scheme developed for BRAC 1995 by the Joint Cross Service Group for Depot Maintenance, but modified it slightly. Based on input from Air Force Materiel Command and Center officials, we assumed that the C-5 workload would be transferred to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center rather than the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center. We provided each center with a breakout of the transferring workload they would receive by commodity group. We then asked center personnel to estimate how additional workloads would affect their hourly rates by analyzing fixed- and variable-cost categories, excluding material, which we assumed would not change. The three centers used the approach and assumptions developed by executive business planners from all five centers to develop the downsize-in-place Air Force proposal developed during the 1995 BRAC round as an alternative to closing depots.", "We discussed the methodology with workload and privatization officials at the Air Force Materiel Command. They agreed that our approach was sound for assessing the impact of additional workload on a depot\u2019s rate structure. We also provided the closing centers with an opportunity to comment on our methodology. San Antonio center officials agreed with the general approach, but commented that increases in variable costs were subjective. Sacramento center officials chose not to comment.", "To determine whether Air Force plans for privatizing the closing depots is consistent with (1) laws relating to the allocation of depot maintenance workloads to the private sector and (2) the BRAC Commission\u2019s recommendations, we identified the applicable requirements and determined their impact on DOD\u2019s plans to privatize depot-level maintenance workloads.", "We conducted our review between October 1995 and October 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of the Air Force; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and interested congressional committees.
