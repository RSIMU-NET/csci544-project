In recent years federal agencies have increasingly used  open innovation strategies to directly engage and collaborate with citizens  and external stakeholders. These strategies help agencies harness ideas,  expertise, and resources to address issues and achieve goals. For  example, agencies have used open innovation strategies to, among many  other things, measurably improve the detection of asteroids that could  threaten Earth, develop plans to rebuild communities following Hurricane  Sandy, and deploy improved air and water pollution sensors.", "Acknowledging the benefits of using open innovation strategies,  Congress and the Executive Branch have taken actions to clarify agency  authorities to use these strategies, and provide implementation guidance  and access to online platforms. For instance, the American Innovation  and Competitiveness Act, enacted in January 2017, authorizes agencies  to use crowdsourcing and citizen science to advance their missions and  stimulate broader public participation, among other things. The act also  directs the General Services Administration (GSA), in coordination with  the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Office of  Personnel Management, to develop relevant products and training, and  identify contract vehicles and platforms to enhance the ability of agencies  to carry out these projects. These new resources, once developed, will  complement resources already developed by these agencies and the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to support the use of  crowdsourcing and citizen science and other types of open innovation  strategies.", "As part of the federal performance management framework originally put  into place by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (GPRA), and updated and expanded by the GPRA Modernization Act of  2010 (GPRAMA), agencies are to identify the strategies and resources  they will use to achieve their goals. GPRAMA also includes a provision  for us to periodically review how implementing its requirements is  affecting agency performance. This report is part of our response to that  mandate, and builds on our October 2016 report that described how  agencies are using open innovation strategies and identified practices  and key actions to ensure that open innovation initiatives are  implemented effectively. Specifically, this report (1) identifies key  government-wide resources OMB, OSTP, and GSA put in place to  support the use of open innovation strategies; (2) examines the extent to  which key government-wide guidance reflects practices for effectively  implementing these strategies; and (3) identifies resources that selected  agencies have developed to support the use of open innovation  strategies.", "To identify the various government-wide resources that OMB, OSTP, and  GSA have developed to support the use of open innovation strategies, we  reviewed relevant policy and guidance documents and websites, and  interviewed staff from those agencies.", "To determine the extent to which key government-wide guidance reflects  practices for effectively implementing open innovation initiatives, we  evaluated relevant guidance and compared the contents to the practices  and related key actions identified in our October 2016 report. We  identified key guidance for each open innovation strategy in consultation  with OMB, OSTP, and GSA staff. In assessing the guidance, we  considered it to fully reflect a key action when it suggested steps in line  with those outlined in our report. If guidance suggested some but not all  steps, we considered it to partially reflect the key action. Finally, when  guidance for a strategy did not suggest any steps in line with a key action,  we considered the guidance to not reflect that action.", "Lastly, to identify the resources that selected agencies have put in place,  we reviewed relevant documentation and websites, and interviewed staff  from six agencies: the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human  Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and  Transportation (DOT); the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We selected  these agencies based on various criteria, including the number and  variety of open innovation strategies outlined in their individual agency  Open Government Plans. These selections also were in line with  suggestions from knowledgeable staff at OMB, OSTP, and GSA familiar  with agencies that have actively used such strategies. See appendix I for  additional details about our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2016 to June 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As identified and described in figure 1, we reported in October 2016 that  agencies have frequently used five open innovation strategies to  collaborate with citizens and other external parties, and encourage their  participation in agency initiatives.", "As we described in our October 2016 report, agencies can use these  open innovation strategies singularly, or in combination as part of a larger  open innovation initiative, to achieve a number of different purposes.  Agencies can use them to efficiently engage a broad range of citizens  and external stakeholders in developing new ideas, solutions to specific  problems, or new products ranging from software applications to physical  devices. For example, DOE\u2019s Wave Energy Prize competition was  designed to achieve a ground-breaking advancement in technology that  produces electricity by capturing energy from ocean waves. DOE\u2019s goals  for the competition were to engage a diverse collection of developers to  create more efficient devices that would double the energy captured from  ocean waves. According to the Wave Energy Prize website, the  competition, which was concluded in November 2016, produced a  significant advancement in this technology. Ultimately, 4 of 9 finalist  teams\u2014selected from 92 that registered to participate\u2014developed  devices that surpassed DOE\u2019s goal, while the winning team achieved a  five-fold improvement.", "Agencies can also use these strategies to enhance collaboration among  citizens and external stakeholders or organizations interested in an issue,  and leverage the resources, knowledge, and expertise of citizens and  stakeholders to supplement that which is available within the agency.  These contributions enhance the agency\u2019s capacity and its ability to  achieve goals that would be more difficult to reach without this additional  capacity or expertise. In another example highlighted in our October 2016  report, the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s (FHWA) Every Day Counts  ideation initiative helps states implement innovations that improve the  efficiency and quality of their highway transportation and construction  projects. Every two years, FHWA engages a range of stakeholders to  identify innovative technologies and practices that merit more widespread  deployment. Once innovations are identified, FHWA creates deployment  teams comprised of experts from FHWA, state transportation agencies,  and industry to help states and other stakeholders implement these  innovations. According to an FHWA report, this open innovation initiative  has had significant and measurable effects in participating states. In one  case, FHWA reported that deploying Accelerated Bridge Construction as  an Every Day Counts innovation has allowed states to reduce the time it  takes to plan and construct bridges by years, significantly reducing traffic  delays, road closures, and often project costs.", "In our October 2016 report, we also identified seven practices and 18  related key actions, described in figure 2, that federal agencies can use to  help effectively design, implement, and assess their open innovation  initiatives. To do so, we analyzed and synthesized suggested practices  from relevant federal guidance and literature, including public and  business administration journals, and publications from research  organizations, as well as interviews with experts and agency officials with  experience implementing open innovation initiatives. In that report, we  also illustrated how the application of these practices helped agencies  effectively implement open innovation initiatives in a way that achieved  intended results.", "Three agencies with government-wide responsibilities\u2014OMB, OSTP, and  GSA\u2014have taken steps to support and encourage the use of open  innovation strategies by federal agencies.", "OMB is the largest component of the Executive Office of the  President, and is responsible for helping agencies across the federal  government implement the commitments and priorities of the  President.

For crowdsourcing and citizen  science, as well as prize competitions and challenges, toolkits provide  step-by-step guidance for agency staff to follow when implementing those  types of initiatives. OMB, OSTP, and GSA staff identified the U.S. Public  Participation Playbook as key guidance for a variety of approaches to  engage the public, including two open innovation strategies: ideation and  open dialogues. They also identified the Open Data Policy and Project  Open Data as the key policy and source of guidance, respectively, that  cover open data collaboration initiatives. They told us that these and  other resources have a broader focus, generally to help agencies  inventory, manage, and release their open data. These sources do  suggest some actions for agencies to take when implementing open data  collaboration initiatives. However, OMB, OSTP, and GSA staff have not  yet developed more detailed, step-by-step guidance for implementing  specific initiatives where agencies use events or websites to engage and  collaborate with outside stakeholders using open data.", "As one example of policy and guidance for an open innovation strategy,  in September 2015, the Director of OSTP issued a memorandum  encouraging agencies to use crowdsourcing and citizen science to  enhance scientific research and address problems by drawing on the  voluntary participation of the public. The memorandum also directs  agencies to improve their ability to use crowdsourcing and citizen science  by identifying internal agency coordinators responsible for seeking  opportunities to use this strategy to meet agency goals. Crowdsourcing  and citizen science coordinators from four of the selected agencies\u2014 DOE, HHS, EPA, and NASA\u2014told us that having this clear statement of  support has helped enhance awareness of and interest in the strategy.  The memorandum was supplemented by the Crowdsourcing and Citizen  Science Toolkit, which provides a step-by-step list of actions agencies  can take to carry out a specific initiative, as shown in figure 3.", "These officials from DOE, EPA, HHS, and NASA told us that that the  toolkit is an important educational resource for agency staff, helping those  interested in using crowdsourcing and citizen science understand what  the strategy can be used to achieve and the full range of actions they can  take to develop and implement an initiative.

According to an  official from GSA\u2019s TTS, this team is the primary point-of-contact for staff  from other federal agencies, fielding their questions about the site or other  aspects of managing a prize competition or challenge. To help familiarize  agency staff with how to manage a prize competition or challenge and  use the Challenge.gov platform, the team conducts training sessions and  has developed on-demand videos and webinars that are available  through the website. In addition, to provide tailored assistance, the team  created the Challenge and Prize Mentorship Program, which matches  staff seeking support with experienced practitioners from other agencies  who can assist with all aspects of planning and implementing an initiative  using this strategy.", "OMB, OSTP, and GSA staff also support communities of practice for  various open innovation strategies. According to staff from these  agencies, these communities provide venues to bring experienced and  knowledgeable agency staff together so that they can learn from one  another. Through regularly-scheduled meetings and e-mail lists, the  communities allow members to share experiences and lessons learned,  seek and provide advice and assistance, and ensure members are up to  date on relevant issues, such as the development and release of new  resources or upcoming initiatives. OMB, OSTP, and GSA staff also have  leveraged the expertise of community members to develop toolkits and  case studies, which capture leading practices and lessons learned to  ensure they are readily available to inform future initiatives. Collectively,  these communities, which are described in table 3, help staff across the  federal government communicate and collaborate with one another.", "The federal Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice further  illustrates the support such communities can provide. According to a GSA  official, this community was created in 2010 to bring together staff from  across the federal government interested in that open innovation strategy.  According to information on the Challenge.gov website, the community is  comprised of federal employees representing a wide range of agency  perspectives and experience levels. Staff from OSTP\u2019s Technology and  Innovation Division and GSA\u2019s TTS told us that they have worked with  volunteers from the community to develop resources, including the  federal Challenges and Prizes Toolkit, to try to meet the diverse needs of  its members. The official from GSA\u2019s TTS also told us that they plan to  work with members of the community to revise the toolkit to reflect the  updated authorities and requirements for prize competitions and  challenges in AICA. This official further stated that the Challenge.gov  program team provides ongoing support to this community by maintaining  its e-mail list, which allows for information sharing between members, and  working with members to identify topics and arrange speakers for the  community\u2019s quarterly meetings.

Acknowledge and, as appropriate, reward the efforts and  achievements of partners and participants.  2.  Seek ways to maintain communication with members of the  community. Doing so can keep them informed of future initiatives and  other opportunities, and facilitate communication within the  community.", "As figure 11 shows, we determined that none of the guidance fully reflects  the first action. The guidance for crowdsourcing and citizen science, and  prize competitions and challenges, both encourage agencies to  acknowledge the contributions of participants, and reward participants  with monetary and nonmonetary incentives (as appropriate). However,  guidance for these strategies does not also encourage agencies to  acknowledge the contributions of partner organizations, which can  provide critical resources, expertise, and capacity for open innovation  initiatives. The guidance for ideation, open dialogues, and open data  collaboration initiatives did not reflect this key action.", "As also shown in figure 11, our assessment found that guidance for most  open innovation strategies fully reflect the second action; however,  guidance for open data collaboration does not. For example, the Federal  Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Toolkit encourages agencies to  continue actively engaging partners and participants, and help direct  participants to other initiatives that might interest them.

We also used different methodologies and sources in pulling together our  practices and key actions than they did in developing their guidance. As  noted earlier, we developed our practices by analyzing and synthesizing  suggested practices and key actions from a wide range of relevant  literature, as well as interviews with nongovernmental experts and agency  officials. Our scope also was to identify practices applicable to  implementing individual initiatives using any open innovation strategy.  The guidance developed by OMB, OSTP, and GSA, by contrast, is  generally strategy specific and based on the experiences of and lessons  learned from individuals involved in the relevant communities of practice.  For example, as was highlighted earlier, OSTP and GSA staff worked  with volunteers from the Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice to  develop the Challenges and Prizes Toolkit.", "Other factors contributed to the guidance for open data collaboration not  fully reflecting our practices and key actions for effectively implementing  open innovation initiatives. As was previously described, OMB, OSTP,  and GSA developed various resources, including websites and guidance,  to help agencies inventory, manage, and release their open data.  According to staff from these agencies, the focus of their efforts and  resources generally has been assisting agencies with the management  and release of open data, while providing some support for agencies  interested in mobilizing and collaborating with participants to use open  data (i.e., open data collaboration), which we identify as an open  innovation strategy. The existing guidance does suggest some actions for  agencies to take when implementing open data collaboration initiatives. In  addition, staff from OMB\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer and  GSA\u2019s TTS shared several ways in which they and members of the Open  Data Working Group provide support for staff interested in carrying out  open data collaboration initiatives. For example, they told us that when  agency staff ask for advice on how to conduct such initiatives, they often  match the individual making the request with experienced staff in another  agency, or rely upon members of the Open Data Working Group to  answer their questions. An official from GSA\u2019s TTS stated that because  members of this community meet regularly, there are frequent  opportunities to share best practices and lessons learned to inform the  planning of any current or future agency open data collaboration  initiatives. In addition, the official told us that agency staff can also use  the open data community\u2019s e-mail list to seek and receive assistance from  fellow members.

This helps ensure staff  carry out initiatives in a manner that is informed by the agency\u2019s previous  experience and that is consistent with agency procedures. In some  instances, agency officials told us that they have not developed certain  agency-level resources, generally for one or more of the following  reasons:  they found government-wide resources to be sufficient;  they have not used a strategy, or use it infrequently, limiting the need  for agency-specific resources; or  they have not yet had sufficient experience using a strategy to be able  to craft policies or other resources informed by experiences and  lessons learned."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Agencies Developed Guidance to Clarify Procedures for Developing and Implementing Open Innovation Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the selected agencies told us that agency-level policies and  guidance help to raise awareness among agency staff of the value of  using open innovation strategies, and how these strategies can be an  effective tool for engaging the public to generate new ideas and solutions.

The policies and guidance at these  agencies (examples provided in table 5) also clarify agency-specific steps  that staff should take when implementing an initiative, which, according to  agency officials, helps ensure that staff take actions necessary to meet  requirements and successfully carry out open innovation initiatives.", "As illustrated in table 5, NASA\u2019s Policy Directive on Challenges, Prize  Competitions, and Crowdsourcing Activities, which was signed by the  NASA Administrator and issued in February 2014, encourages agency  staff to use these open innovation strategies. The directive states that it is  NASA\u2019s policy to encourage the use of challenge activities to obtain  solutions and stimulate innovation. According to an official from NASA\u2019s  Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation (CoECI), the directive  was created to supplement government-wide policies and guidance. It  defines the roles that certain agency officials, such as the Associate  Administrator for the Space Technology Mission Directorate, are to play in  designing and implementing challenges. It also directs staff to develop  and maintain agency-level best practices and implementation guidance  for challenges. In keeping with this policy, in 2014, CoECI, which provides  advice and support for NASA teams to design, implement, and evaluate  challenges conducted through the NASA Tournament Lab, developed a  Challenge Coordinator Toolkit.", "The toolkit provides a detailed checklist for CoECI challenge coordinators  to follow when supporting teams that are conducting those challenges.

In other instances,  agency officials told us they also have staff who, given their interest and  experience using a strategy, have taken on responsibilities to support  others in their agency, but are not devoted full time to these efforts. Some  agencies also have brought together multiple staff to create internal  organizations responsible for supporting the use of open innovation  strategies. These staff and organizations\u2014selected examples of which  are highlighted in tables 6 and 7, respectively\u2014can provide tailored  advice and support based on their experience with these strategies.

He also has coordinated and  supported several open data events that have allowed DOT staff to  collaborate with the public, including private sector companies using  transportation data, state and local stakeholders, academic researchers,  and those working on new technologies. He told us that these events  have served to help the agency better understand how people are using  transportation data and what improvements that they would like to see  made. For example, in 2015, the CDO worked with staff from throughout  DOT to organize a Transportation \u201cDatapalooza.\u201d According to the CDO,  the event allowed DOT to both highlight its own data initiatives and learn  about the applications and products that private companies, developers,  and technologists are developing with DOT data.
