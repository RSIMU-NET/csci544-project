Due to a significant rise in cost, DOE recently proposed terminating the MOX approach in favor of the dilute and dispose approach, which DOE stated may be less expensive. Under this approach, plutonium would be diluted with inert material and then disposed of in a geologic repository.", "GAO was asked to review DOE's planning for both the MOX and dilute and dispose approaches. This report examines: (1) the extent to which DOE's revised cost estimates for completing the construction of the MOX facility and for completing the overall Plutonium Disposition Program met best practices, (2) the status of NNSA's development of a life-cycle cost estimate for the dilute and dispose approach, and (3) the extent to which DOE has sufficient disposal space and statutory capacity at WIPP to dispose of all defense TRU waste, including waste from the dilute and dispose approach.

This estimate substantially met best practices and can be considered reliable as it substantially met all four characteristics of a high-quality cost estimate: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. In contrast, DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has not yet applied best practices when revising its life-cycle cost estimate of $56 billion for the Plutonium Disposition Program using the MOX approach, as GAO previously recommended. This is because NNSA officials developed the revised life-cycle cost estimate to satisfy an annual requirement to record the plutonium environmental liability on departmental financial statements that were due in September 2016.", "NNSA is developing a life-cycle cost estimate for completing the Plutonium Disposition Program using the dilute and dispose approach, which would dispose of diluted plutonium at DOE's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). WIPP is an underground repository for the disposal of transuranic (TRU) nuclear waste, which is waste contaminated by nuclear elements heavier than uranium, such as diluted plutonium. NNSA is currently assessing the extent to which any new equipment and facilities would be needed to pursue this approach, and it expects to develop an independently validated life-cycle cost estimate for the program by late 2018. NNSA has outlined an initial set of milestones for the program using the dilute and dispose approach; these milestones include program elements such as preparing the plutonium for dilution, diluting the plutonium into waste and securely storing it, and disposing of it at WIPP.", "DOE does not have sufficient space at WIPP to dispose of all defense TRU waste. DOE's current plan is to fill the existing disposal space in WIPP by 2026, and additional space will need to be excavated to dispose of all the waste included in DOE's current TRU waste inventory report. While DOE officials recognize that expansion of WIPP's disposal space may be necessary in the future, they have not analyzed or planned for the facility's expansion because their focus has been on resuming operations at WIPP, which had been suspended in 2014 after two separate accidents at the facility. Specifically, GAO found the following:", "DOE's TRU waste management plan, which includes planning for WIPP, covers a 5-year period and does not address possible expansion.

Russia suspended its implementation of the agreement in  October 2016, citing delays in the United States\u2019 implementation of the  agreement, among other reasons, but Department of Energy (DOE)  officials stated that they plan to continue to seek safe disposition of  surplus U.S. plutonium. According to the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA), the amount of plutonium that the United States  and Russia pledged to dispose of under the agreement is sufficient to  manufacture 17,000 nuclear weapons. Plutonium poses a proliferation  risk and a risk to human health and the environment if not managed  safely. The agreement, as modified, provides that disposition shall be by  irradiation as fuel in nuclear reactors or any other methods that both  countries may agree to in writing. Under the agreement, the United States  would dispose of its plutonium as mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel\u2014a mixture of  plutonium and uranium oxides\u2014in modified commercial nuclear reactors.  If MOX fuel is used in a reactor, the plutonium in the fuel is transformed  into radioactive spent fuel similar to the spent fuel produced in  commercial reactors, which prevents it from being reused in a nuclear  weapon. This effort is managed by NNSA through its Plutonium  Disposition Program, which was established in 1997 to address the  disposition of surplus weapons-grade plutonium at the end of the Cold  War.", "As part of its Plutonium Disposition Program, NNSA began constructing  the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX facility) in 2007 at DOE\u2019s  Savannah River Site in South Carolina. In 1997, DOE originally estimated  the MOX facility would cost approximately $1.4 billion and be completed  in 2004; however, by 2012, NNSA had spent about $3.4 billion and  estimated that it needed approximately $4 billion more to complete  construction by 2019. We reported in February 2014 that NNSA\u2019s cost  estimate for completing construction of the MOX facility and its overall  life-cycle cost estimate for the Plutonium Disposition Program were  unreliable and that the program could be at risk for further cost  increases. In its fiscal year 2014 budget justification, DOE stated that  pursuing the MOX approach may be unaffordable due to the growth in  costs for completing the program, and it proposed a slowdown of program  activities while it assesses other alternative plutonium disposition  approaches.", "In April 2014, DOE completed an analysis of plutonium disposition  options that identified an alternative disposition approach that could  significantly reduce the life-cycle cost of the Plutonium Disposition  Program. This alternative would involve diluting the plutonium and  disposing of it in a geologic repository. Two DOE-contracted reviews of  this analysis\u2014one by the Aerospace Corporation\u2019s Federally Funded  Research and Development Center and one by Oak Ridge National  Laboratory\u2014estimated that the dilute and dispose approach could  significantly reduce the life-cycle cost of the Plutonium Disposition  Program, compared with continuing the program using the MOX  approach. Given the conclusions from these reviews, DOE\u2019s fiscal year  2017 budget request proposed to terminate construction of the MOX  facility and pursue the dilute and dispose approach. Under this proposal,  plutonium would be diluted with inert material to inhibit its future use in  weapons. It would then be packaged and shipped to a repository for  permanent disposal, most likely DOE\u2019s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant  (WIPP), an underground repository located near Carlsbad, New Mexico,  that is used for disposing of defense transuranic (TRU) waste. According  to DOE officials, the diluted plutonium meets DOE\u2019s criteria for TRU  waste. However, WIPP\u2019s current design includes a finite amount of  disposal space, and the statute that established the repository also  placed a limit on its TRU waste disposal capacity. WIPP is managed by  DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management (EM) and is the only  disposal site for TRU waste in the United States. Complicating matters,  disposal operations at WIPP were suspended in 2014 as a result of two  separate accidents at the facility involving a fire and a radioactive release.  According to DOE officials, while the majority of the underground  radioactive release was directed through the repository\u2019s ventilation  system filters, a small portion bypassed filters and was released into the  atmosphere. We reported in August 2016 that DOE missed its initial  estimated date of March 2016 for reopening WIPP, in part because it did  not develop the estimates using all cost and schedule estimating best  practices.  DOE resumed disposing of TRU waste at WIPP in January  2017.", "In August 2016, in response to a provision in the National Defense  Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016, DOE\u2019s Office of Project  Management Oversight and Assessments developed a revised cost  estimate of approximately $17.2 billion to complete construction of the  MOX facility by 2048. According to NNSA officials, NNSA included this  new estimate in revising the overall life-cycle cost estimate for the  program using the MOX approach, which NNSA now estimates to be  approximately $56 billion. In addition to these estimates, a provision in the  Explanatory Statement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016  calls for DOE to provide to Congress a life-cycle cost and schedule  estimate if the program were to instead use the dilute and dispose  approach. While NNSA examines the activities needed to implement the  dilute and dispose approach, Congress continues to authorize and fund  the ongoing construction of the MOX facility.", "You asked us to review DOE\u2019s planning for the Plutonium Disposition  Program under both the MOX and dilute and dispose approaches.

To assess the reliability of the DOE\u2019s inventory, we reviewed  documents on its development and interviewed officials responsible for  maintaining it. Based on our review, we determined that the data it  contains are sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also conducted a  site visit to WIPP to interview DOE officials responsible for managing  WIPP operations to understand how the waste disposal space is  managed and how they plan for DOE\u2019s future disposal needs. To  understand what efforts were ongoing to study the impact of disposing of  diluted plutonium at WIPP, we interviewed officials from Sandia National  Laboratories who are responsible for analyzing potential changes at  WIPP. To evaluate potential sources of TRU waste from generator sites  that may not be included in DOE\u2019s inventory report, to understand how  such sites estimate the amount of TRU waste they will need to ship to  WIPP, and to get these sites\u2019 perspectives on potential disposal space  availability and capacity issues, we reviewed documents from and  interviewed officials at DOE\u2019s five major waste-generating sites.  Specifically, we conducted interviews with officials from the Hanford Site  in Washington state, Idaho National Laboratory, Los Alamos National  Laboratory in New Mexico, Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee,  and Savannah River Site in South Carolina. These interviews included a  site visit to Idaho National Laboratory.

In comparison, the report estimated that the remaining costs  to complete the program using the MOX approach would be  approximately $110.4 billion.", "To further evaluate the MOX and dilute and dispose approaches, the  Secretary of Energy requested that a team at Oak Ridge National  Laboratory assess what the preferred approach for the Plutonium  Disposition Program should be. In August 2015, the resulting report,  known as the Red Team report, concluded that the dilute and dispose  approach has lower technical risks and lower costs. Specifically, the  report concluded that the dilute and dispose approach would require  approximately $400 million annually for the duration of the program,  compared to approximately $700 million to $800 million annually using  the MOX approach for approximately the same duration of time.", "In 2015, CB&I AREVA MOX Services LLC, the contractor constructing  the MOX facility, commissioned High Bridge Associates to develop a  series of reports that assessed the MOX approach and the dilute and  dispose approach. In contrast to the other three reports, High Bridge  concluded that using the dilute and dispose approach would introduce  significant risks and thus could be the more costly approach.

The higher costs for the dilute and  dispose approach were primarily driven by High Bridge\u2019s conclusion  that placing the 34 MT of diluted plutonium in WIPP would increase  the potential for an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction in the WIPP  underground and that DOE would need to undertake costly  compensatory steps to avoid such risks. However, according to  DOE officials, High Bridge staff did not consult with DOE officials in  developing its reports. Officials at Sandia National Laboratories who  are responsible for evaluating the impact of any changes to WIPP on  the facility\u2019s long-term performance explained that they had reviewed  the findings of the High Bridge study and found that the study used  unrealistic assumptions regarding the conditions at WIPP and  overstated the potential for an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction as  a result.

DOE estimated the MOX facility  construction would cost $17.2 billion assuming $350 million in funding per  year until project completion, which is consistent with recent  appropriations for the project, or $14.3 billion assuming $500 million per  year until project completion. These two estimates were developed to  illustrate the effect of varying funding levels on the project cost and  duration. DOE\u2019s 2016 revised cost estimate for MOX construction  substantially met all four characteristics of a high-quality, reliable cost  estimate: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible.", "Therefore, we believe it can be considered reliable. Table 2 summarizes  our assessment of DOE\u2019s cost estimate by characteristic.", "Our assessment noted the following for each of the four characteristics:", "Comprehensive: DOE\u2019s revised estimate was substantially  comprehensive because, among other things, it followed the best  practices of including all costs incurred and estimated future costs to  complete construction of the MOX facility, including the government\u2019s  and contractor\u2019s costs. According to DOE officials responsible for  revising this cost estimate, the estimate was based on the  methodology and costs in a 2013 Independent Cost Estimate for  constructing the MOX facility that was developed by the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (Corps). For the revised estimate, DOE updated  the costs of the work completed as of 2016 by adding to the costs for  the work completed in the 2013 Independent Cost Estimate, the cost  of materials that had actually been installed and inspected and that  did not require rework as of 2016, the cost of different management  accounts, escalation, and the costs to account for equipment and  technology that had been or would be acquired and installed but that  DOE officials expected to become obsolete and would need to be  replaced before the facility construction was completed.", "Well-documented: DOE\u2019s revised estimate was substantially well- documented, in part because DOE\u2019s documentation captures the data  sources the department used for this estimate. For example, the  estimate included sources of data from the 2013 Independent Cost  Estimate and from the contractor\u2019s performance data. In addition, the  revised estimate was based on the work breakdown structure used in  the 2013 Independent Cost Estimate, which described in detail the  methodology for each element of work. We also found that DOE\u2019s  revised cost estimate was based on the same program and technical  description as the 2013 Independent Cost Estimate. According to  DOE officials, the revised estimate has a range of minus 10 percent to  plus 10 percent. In addition, in developing its revised estimate, DOE  followed the best practice of presenting the estimate to DOE  management for approval.", "Accurate: DOE\u2019s revised estimate was substantially accurate. Among  other things, we independently verified a selection of the cost output  and found no mathematical errors. We also found that DOE properly  adjusted this estimate for inflation, applying a 4 percent escalation  rate to account for inflation, which is the same factor that the Corps  used in developing the 2013 Independent Cost Estimate and is  consistent with NNSA\u2019s escalation rate used for this type of project,  according to DOE. We assessed this characteristic as substantially  accurate but not fully accurate, in part because it did not fully meet the  best practice of basing the estimate on a historical record of costs  from previous efforts and actual experiences from other comparable  projects. This was because a portion of the estimate was not based  on historical experience of other projects. For example, DOE added  costs to the estimate to account for equipment and technology that  had been or would be acquired and installed but that DOE officials  expected to become obsolete and would need to be replaced before  the facility construction was completed. According to DOE officials,  this added cost was not based on a historical record because the  MOX project is the first project for which this cost was added.", "Credible: DOE\u2019s revised estimate was substantially credible, in part  because DOE followed the best practices of conducting sensitivity,  and risk and uncertainty analyses. For example, DOE conducted  statistical sensitivity analysis to understand the biggest cost drivers for  the funds held by the government and the contractor that might be  needed to cover risks. In addition, DOE\u2019s revised estimate also  followed the best practice of conducting a schedule risk analysis as  specified in our schedule guide. DOE officials conducted schedule  risk analysis to include the costs of possible schedule slippage in the  estimate. Based on this analysis, DOE added a total of approximately  49 months, and this schedule addition increased the cost estimate by  $744 million plus escalation, according to DOE officials. We assessed  this characteristic as substantially credible and not fully credible, in  part because it did not fully meet the best practice of conducting an  independent cost estimate. While DOE\u2019s 2016 revised estimate was  itself not an independent cost estimate, it was based on the 2013  Independent Cost Estimate.

Currently, NNSA operates the  Advanced Recovery and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) project at  Los Alamos National Laboratory, which has equipment for disassembling  nuclear weapons pits and converting the plutonium in these pits into  plutonium oxide. DOE developed this capability as a technology  development project. According to NNSA officials, the ARIES project has  operated sporadically since 1998 and has thus far produced  approximately 667 kilograms of plutonium oxide, which NNSA had  planned to use as feedstock for the MOX Facility. NNSA determined that,  should the Plutonium Disposition Program continue forward with the MOX  approach, NNSA would need to expand the capabilities of ARIES to  produce sufficient plutonium oxide for operating the MOX facility.  According to NNSA officials, the existing capabilities of ARIES are also  insufficient for meeting the plutonium oxide production rates that NNSA  has established for the dilute and dispose approach over the estimated  lifetime of the program. According to NNSA officials, additional  equipment is needed, such as gloveboxes and tools for both  disassembling nuclear weapons pits and converting the plutonium into  plutonium oxide, so that ARIES can achieve the production rates outlined  in the program requirements for the dilute and dispose approach. To  estimate the life-cycle costs associated with expanding and operating the  ARIES project, NNSA currently is assessing the quantities of equipment it  would need to install and the floor space it would need to achieve  specified production rates. NNSA officials in the Plutonium Disposition  Program told us they consulted with the NNSA officials responsible for  managing the relevant space at Los Alamos, who told them that current  plans for the space would allow for an expansion of the ARIES project.  NNSA officials also told us they suspended their assessment of the costs  to expand ARIES for dilute and dispose in January 2017 as they had  reached the initial fiscal year 2017 funding limit for analyzing the dilute  and dispose approach. These officials stated that the completion of the  analysis would be delayed by at least 6 months past the original June  2017 completion date and acknowledged that this estimate must be  completed prior to developing the life-cycle cost estimate for the dilute  and dispose approach.", "According to NNSA officials, NNSA has not initiated the capital asset  acquisition process to expand its plutonium preparation capabilities  because the extent of this expansion will differ depending on whether  NNSA pursues the MOX approach or the dilute and dispose approach.  NNSA officials explained that if NNSA started the acquisition process  using the requirements of the dilute and dispose approach and then this  approach was rejected, NNSA would have to restart the process using  the MOX requirements. These officials stated that if NNSA receives  congressional authorization to pursue the dilute and dispose approach, it  will initiate DOE\u2019s capital asset acquisition process for the expansion of  ARIES to obtain the needed equipment. If this authorization is received,  NNSA would use the ARIES expansion analysis it is currently conducting  to develop the documentation needed for reaching the CD-0 milestone.  The information provided by this analysis would support an assessment  of the gap in capabilities in the existing ARIES project and a rough order- of-magnitude cost estimate to procure the equipment needed to close this  gap. However, if NNSA does not receive authorization to pursue the  dilute and dispose approach, NNSA will need to update its assessment of  ARIES expansion requirements under the MOX approach, according to  NNSA officials. In 2013, NNSA assessed the costs of expanding ARIES  to support the MOX approach and estimated that it would need  approximately $438 million for new equipment and that this expansion  would take approximately 12 years to complete. This estimate was  based on a plutonium oxide production rate that, according to NNSA  officials, was significantly higher than the rate being used in the estimate  for the dilute and dispose approach.

To identify the preferred alternative, the  analysis began with nine potential alternatives that were put through an  initial screening to determine whether each of the alternatives was  sufficiently different from one another and whether each alternative could  meet all the necessary requirements established in the dilute and dispose  program requirements document and other documents. This screening  identified four alternatives that were judged as viable for providing the  necessary dilution and waste storage capabilities to meet the program\u2019s  requirements; NNSA then fully analyzed each of these four alternatives.  These alternatives and their estimated costs are outlined in table 4 below.", "Among the four alternatives, the contractor\u2019s analysis ranked alternative  2, in the table above, as the highest scoring; this alternative proposes to  dilute the 34 MT of both pit and non-pit plutonium at the Savannah River  Site. This alternative was the highest scoring alternative for several  reasons, including that (1) it was judged to have the lowest risk of any of  the four based on the analysis of potential threats and opportunities for  each alternative, (2) diluting the pit and non-pit plutonium at the  Savannah River Site would make the most extensive use of existing  facilities and capabilities and would have a lower impact on other ongoing  site operations during construction and operations than would occur if  dilution capabilities were installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and  (3) it would provide easier access to a third party, such as the  International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor and inspect the plutonium  disposition process as required by the Plutonium Management and  Disposition Agreement.", "According to NNSA officials, they will use the results of the analysis of  alternatives process to develop the conceptual design and estimated cost  of the preferred alternative.

Currently, remote- handled waste is disposed of in WIPP either in boreholes drilled into the  walls or in specially designed shielded containers. DOE officials told us  that it is possible that none of the remaining space at WIPP may be  available for disposing of remote-handled waste using boreholes in the  panels due to two factors. First, contamination from the February 2014  radioactive release accident is now contained in some of the facility\u2019s  walls, making them potentially unsuitable for borehole disposal.

In its current planning documents, NNSA  assumes that WIPP will be the geologic repository for this waste if the  decision is made to move forward with this approach for the Plutonium  Disposition Program. As seen in table 6, if DOE were to dispose of all  potential waste and GTCC LLW and GTCC-like waste at WIPP, it  could exceed the statutory capacity established in the Land  Withdrawal Act even without the 34 MT of diluted plutonium.", "In addition to these estimated sources of waste that may be disposed of  at WIPP in the future, there are other possible sources of TRU waste that  DOE may need to dispose of at WIPP that have been identified but not  yet estimated and are not reflected in the inventory. Specifically, DOE  officials acknowledged that the possible TRU waste that could result from  decontamination and decommissioning of facilities and exhumation of  buried waste may represent a significant quantity of waste. Officials we  interviewed at the five major DOE waste-generating sites told us of at  least 44 facilities that could generate TRU waste during decontamination  and decommissioning or that have buried TRU waste for which no volume  estimates have been reported to DOE. Site officials told us that, in  general, they do not estimate the volume of TRU waste that may result  from these cleanup operations until they have agreements with state  regulators on proposed methods for cleanup and plans to execute these  agreements. Moreover, according to these officials, the amount of TRU  waste that could be generated can vary greatly based on which cleanup  methods are chosen. For a few of these facilities, site officials were able  to make general estimates of the possible quantities of TRU waste. For  example, officials at one site told us about a facility that did not yet have a  cleanup plan and that could generate anywhere from 300 m to 2,600 m to  3,000 mpotentially significant volumes of waste resulting from decontamination  and decommissioning of facilities and exhumation of buried waste that  have not yet been estimated increase the potential for WIPP to exceed its  statutory disposal capacity in the future.

Specifically, as identified in our analysis above, DOE will need to take  steps in order to be able to confirm that waste volumes that could result in  WIPP exceeding its statutory capacity, such as the 34 MT of diluted  plutonium, can be disposed of at WIPP. DOE currently counts the volume  of waste disposed of at WIPP using the volume of the outermost  container rather than the inner containers holding the waste or the volume  of the waste itself. Most of the TRU waste disposed of at WIPP is  packaged initially in 55-gallon drums, but some of these drums are  subsequently packed inside larger containers, called overpacks, that hold  multiple drums. DOE relies on several types of overpacks for the disposal  of TRU waste. For the dilute and dispose approach, NNSA plans to  package the waste inside small cylinders, which are then placed within  55-gallon drums. According to DOE officials, if the method for counting  waste volumes changes for all TRU waste so that DOE counts the inner  containers or the waste itself, this change would likely provide sufficient  additional disposal capacity at WIPP for the waste planned for disposal  identified in the 2016 inventory, potential waste, and the 34 MT of diluted  plutonium.", "In September 2016, DOE completed an analysis of alternative methods  for counting the volume of TRU waste already at WIPP and the waste  expected in the future. The report evaluated 13 prospective alternative  calculation methods and recommended 2 preferred alternatives to  present for final selection to DOE officials responsible for managing WIPP  operations.", "One of the preferred alternatives proposed to recalculate the volume  of waste already disposed of in the repository using only the volume  of the innermost waste container, and proposed that the volume of  waste disposed of at WIPP in the future be determined by the volume  of TRU waste in each container.", "The other preferred alternative proposed to recalculate the volume of  waste already disposed of in the repository and future volumes of  TRU waste using the volume of the innermost container, regardless of  the amount of TRU waste in the container.", "While either of the above methods would provide additional disposal  capacity at WIPP, according to DOE officials, the department is still  considering its options. DOE officials responsible for managing WIPP  operations have previously estimated that revising the method for  counting the amount of waste already disposed of could free up more  than 30,000 m Additionally, while the  volume of the 34 MT of diluted plutonium would be 23,800 m using  DOE\u2019s current counting method, this volume would decrease to 1,417 mexceed the EPA regulatory thresholds for the potential of a radiological  release over a 10,000-year period. According to Sandia National  Laboratories officials, the new model they are developing is required for  expanding WIPP\u2019s disposal space in the areas DOE is currently  considering, and they estimate that this model will be completed and  validated by 2024.", "If NNSA proceeds with the dilute and dispose approach and the 34 MT of  diluted plutonium is sent to WIPP, DOE will need to include in its  expansion planning the results of an assessment of the environmental  impact of disposing of this waste in order to ensure that WIPP will be able  to accept all of the plutonium. Officials from Sandia told us that they are  currently conducting an analysis that will contribute to this environmental  impact assessment and expect to complete it by fiscal year 2019.  According to DOE officials, this analysis includes estimating the impact on  WIPP\u2019s long-term performance to determine whether disposal of the  diluted plutonium at WIPP would cause cumulative radioactive releases  exceeding EPA\u2019s release limits. If the analysis by Sandia National  Laboratories determines that the diluted plutonium would have a  significant enough impact, steps to change the design of future disposal  space at WIPP in order to reduce the potential impact could be  necessary. For example, Sandia officials stated that new panels that are  smaller than the current design could be used to reduce the concentration  of the diluted plutonium in the repository and thereby reduce the potential  for a radiological release.", "DOE will also need regulatory approvals from EPA and the New Mexico  Environment Department to expand the disposal space at WIPP. To get  approval from EPA, DOE will need to submit a formal change request to  the agency. DOE officials told us that expanding WIPP\u2019s disposal space  would constitute a significant change to the original design of the facility,  and according to EPA officials, change requests of this magnitude require  significant review. In some cases, the EPA officials said granting this type  of change could require EPA to go through the federal rulemaking  process, which could include public comment and publication of a  proposed federal rule. EPA officials told us that, historically, these change  requests may take as long as 2 years. According to officials from the New  Mexico Environment Department, to excavate additional waste disposal  panels, DOE must also seek a permit modification from their agency. EPA  officials told us that approval for these kinds of changes generally take  between 1 and 2 years and that they are unsure whether the New Mexico  Environment Department would be able to process a permit modification  request concurrently with EPA\u2019s review. Once all necessary approvals  have been completed, DOE could then begin excavating new disposal  space at WIPP. There is no set time frame for how long the excavation  would take, and DOE officials stated that this time frame would vary  based on the design of the new disposal space. However, DOE officials  noted that it took about two years to excavate each of the existing panels  at the facility.", "DOE officials told us they have begun work on the new model and there  is sufficient time to complete all necessary actions before WIPP  operations are significantly impacted; however, DOE has no plans yet for  seeking the approvals that would show that these approvals and  subsequent construction can be completed before the facility\u2019s existing  disposal space is full. DOE\u2019s most current formal planning document for  WIPP, the TRU waste management plan, covers 5 years. DOE officials  told us that the plan is limited to 5 years because it is an operational plan  that is used to plan near-term waste shipments, not a long-term strategic  plan. The most current version of this plan addresses the period up to  2019 and does not address possible future WIPP expansion needs.  Completion of the new model for WIPP that is needed to begin the  regulatory approval process for expansion is not expected to be ready  until 2024, and then the approval and subsequent construction process  could take another 4 years or longer. Given that these time frames extend  well beyond the period addressed in the TRU waste management plan,  DOE\u2019s current planning is insufficient for addressing possible WIPP  expansion. As discussed above, under federal standards for internal  control, management should use quality information to achieve agency  objectives; among other characteristics, quality information is to be  complete. However, DOE\u2019s TRU waste management plan does not  contain information necessary to plan for the future of WIPP through its  closure. Without developing a long-term plan for WIPP that includes the  need for expanding WIPP\u2019s disposal space and an integrated schedule  that describes how DOE will complete the regulatory approval process  and construction of new space before WIPP\u2019s existing space is full, DOE  will not have reasonable assurance that it will be able to expand the  repository in a timely manner. Instead, according to DOE officials, they  may have to slow or suspend waste shipments to WIPP in the future,  which could delay the implementation of the dilute and dispose approach,  should it move forward. The slowing or suspension of waste shipments  from waste generator sites could also delay the completion of cleanup  projects at those sites and could impact their ability to meet cleanup  deadlines negotiated with state regulators."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Revision of Method for Counting Waste Volumes", "paragraphs": ["To revise the method DOE uses to count waste volumes disposed of at  WIPP against the statutory disposal capacity, DOE officials explained that  they will need regulatory approval from the New Mexico Environment  Department to change the facility\u2019s hazardous waste operating permit,  and such approval could take 2 years. DOE has not yet completed its  internal deliberations about the specifics of this proposed change and, as  such, has not yet sought a determination from the New Mexico  Environment Department about what type of review would be required to  approve this change or clarified how long this approval process may take.  As noted above, DOE officials told us that they have been focused on  efforts related to reopening WIPP, and enough time exists to obtain  regulatory approval to meet the dilute and dispose milestones. However,  one of the assumptions in NNSA\u2019s program requirements for the dilute  and dispose approach is that WIPP will be able to dispose of the diluted  plutonium and that if there are capacity constraints that would impact the  facility\u2019s ability to do so, they would be addressed by 2020. In order to  meet this requirement, DOE would need to implement this change by  2020 or risk delays in planning for the dilute and dispose approach.  According to New Mexico Environment Department officials, the request  to change the method of counting waste volumes could be completed  either through a policy determination by the New Mexico Environment  Department or through the formal WIPP hazardous waste facility  operating permit modification process. New Mexico Environment  Department officials noted that the formal permit modification process  could take as long as 2 years as opposed to a policy determination, which  would likely be completed more quickly. According to DOE officials,  unless they receive approval from the New Mexico Environment  Department to change the method for counting waste volumes, Congress  will need to raise WIPP\u2019s statutory disposal limit by amending the WIPP  Land Withdrawal Act or the repository will be unable to accept significant  quantities of additional waste not currently planned for disposal.", "With the uncertain time frames involved with receiving approval from  regulators to change the volume counting method, it is unclear whether  DOE officials responsible for managing WIPP operations will be able to  meet NNSA\u2019s 2020 milestone for resolving potential disposal space  constraints at WIPP for disposing of the waste from the dilute and dispose  approach. Under federal standards for internal control, management  should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives, and  among other characteristics, quality information is provided on a timely  basis.

However, NNSA\u2019s revised life-cycle cost estimate for the  Plutonium Disposition Program using the MOX approach of $56 billion  does not yet incorporate cost estimating best practices as we have  previously recommended. Reviews by NNSA and some outside experts  found that the dilute and dispose approach has the potential to cost  significantly less, but NNSA is still developing a life-cycle cost estimate for  this alternative. If the decision is made to move forward with the dilute  and dispose approach, DOE will need to ensure that there is sufficient  disposal space and statutory capacity at WIPP to dispose of the diluted  plutonium. WIPP is a geologic repository for defense TRU waste and will  need to accommodate all such waste unless DOE pursues an additional  repository.", "DOE has not adequately planned for all possible waste that it may be  expected to dispose of in WIPP, complicating its ability to determine  whether the waste from the dilute and dispose approach can be disposed  of at WIPP. In particular, DOE does not have a schedule for when TRU  waste generator sites will complete the determinations on whether the  potential waste identified in DOE\u2019s annual TRU waste inventory report  can be disposed of at WIPP. Without developing this schedule, DOE  cannot be assured that it has timely information on whether to include this  waste as part of its planning for WIPP\u2019s future space and capacity needs.  In addition, DOE\u2019s TRU waste inventory report does not capture several  possible future sources of waste, including waste from the  decontamination and decommissioning of facilities or waste that may be  generated after 2050. DOE\u2019s guidance for estimating future waste does  not specify how possible future waste should be estimated and reported.  Without developing guidance that helps sites produce a more  comprehensive estimate for the volumes of TRU waste that may be  generated in the future from cleanup operations, including estimates of  buried waste, waste that may be generated from facility closure and  cleanup, and other potential sources of TRU waste not currently reflected  in the TRU waste inventory report, DOE will not have the information it  needs to effectively estimate the need for future space for TRU waste  disposal and ensure that its plans are in compliance with WIPP\u2019s statutory  capacity.", "To address WIPP\u2019s future space and capacity needs, DOE will need  approvals from EPA and the New Mexico Environment Department.  However, DOE is uncertain about the extent of approvals required and  has not initiated planning efforts to obtain these approvals.

Based on our review, we  determined that the data it contains are sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. However, in discussions with DOE officials, they told us there  is uncertainty in the estimated volume of waste expected to come to  WIPP in the future. For example, DOE officials stated that the actual  volume of waste that is disposed of at WIPP may be higher than their  current estimates, in some cases due to circumstances that DOE cannot  currently predict, such as the need to repackage certain stored wastes  into multiple containers and thereby increase the total volume of waste.  Additionally, a DOE official told us that the actual volume of waste  disposed of at WIPP could be lower than what they currently estimate in  certain cases because they are working on minimizing the volumes of  TRU waste produced in the future by, for example, developing more  efficient waste packaging processes. As part of developing its inventory of  TRU waste, DOE updates on an annual basis the estimates on the  volume of waste expected to be disposed of at WIPP in the future, using  a process we found to be reliable; therefore, we used the information from  this inventory for our analysis.

DOE conducted statistical sensitivity  analysis to understand the biggest cost drivers  within management reserve and contingency.", "A risk and uncertainty analysis was conducted  that quantified the imperfectly understood risks  and identified the effects of changing key cost  driver assumptions and factors.", "Substantially met. DOE conducted a quantitative  risk and uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo  simulation to determine the confidence levels  and associated range of contingencies. DOE did  not independently identify the risks; the  contractor provided the list of risks.  Programmatic risks were considered to be  bounding assumptions and were not included.", "Major cost elements were cross-checked to see  whether results were similar.", "Partially met. We did not find evidence of cross  checking while reviewing the documentation for  both the 2016 estimate and 2013 Independent  Cost Estimate. DOE stated that the estimating  team performed cross checks by evaluating the  2013 Independent Cost Estimate against the  contractor\u2019s actuals and analyzing the costs on a  monthly basis. This allowed DOE to determine  that the actuals were close to the 2013 estimate  and the contractor\u2019s estimate to complete  needed adjustments.", "An independent cost estimate was conducted by  a group outside the acquiring organization to  determine whether other estimating methods  produce similar results.", "Partially met. DOE\u2019s 2016 cost estimate was not  an independent cost estimate, but it was built on  the 2013 Independent Cost Estimate. As part of  the estimate development, DOE consulted  several other independent studies previously  conducted on the construction project, such as  the Red Team and the Aerospace Corporation  reports. DOE concluded that its estimate was in  line with these other reviews."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s (NNSA) Life-cycle Cost Estimates for the Plutonium Disposition Program Using the Mixed-Oxide (MOX) Approach", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Facility or Program Component MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility", "paragraphs": ["MOX Irradiation, Feedstock, and Transportation is the program component that includes: (1)  production of plutonium feedstock for the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility, (2) qualification of MOX fuel  for use in commercial nuclear reactors, and (3) procurement and maintenance of shipping containers  for plutonium feedstock and MOX fuel.

One of the six panels  accommodated nearly 100 percent of its maximum permitted contact- handled waste, while others ranged from 58 percent to 91 percent full.  According to Department of Energy (DOE) officials, DOE was unable to  fill the panels with the permitted volume of waste as planned primarily  because it approved additional waste packaging called \u201coverpacks,\u201d in  which waste containers are encased to increase safety for workers  handling or transporting the waste and to comply with limits on how much  radioactive material can be transported. Encasing waste in overpacks  resulted in a less efficient use of the disposal space because some of  these packages could not be efficiently arranged next to one another, and  others could not be safely stacked on top of one another because of their  weight or size. Overpacks also include some empty space between  containers within the overpack, further reducing available space.", "In addition, DOE has faced challenges accommodating the disposal of  remote-handled TRU waste. Because of the higher hazard, there are  greater restrictions on how remote-handled waste can be disposed of. To  date, remote-handled waste has been permitted for disposal primarily in  boreholes drilled into the walls in panels 4 through 8. According to DOE  officials, some of the boreholes in the walls of panels 4 through 6 were  blocked by overpacks of contact-handled waste containers already  disposed of in those panels before sufficient remote-handled waste  arrived at the site for disposal. Because of the inability to use the  boreholes as planned in panels 4 through 6, none of the borehole  disposal space in these panels was filled to more than 35 percent of its  permitted volume.
