Emergency planners from almost all of the selected counties reported that a majority of the emergency response personnel, such as fire fighters, who arrive first at an accident receive basic training that would enable them to take initial protective actions, including recognizing hazardous materials and calling for assistance in the event of a rail accident involving crude oil and other hazardous materials. Emergency planners from most counties reported that training related to rail hazardous materials was useful in preparing for accidents. Emergency planners reported that some factors present obstacles to responders' receiving training, such as neglecting one's professional duties to take time off for training. Emergency planners from most counties reported that railroads in their jurisdictions have provided them with information about hazardous material shipments and that this information is useful in preparing for potential accidents.", "All seven of the largest railroads (called Class I railroads) and some of the four smaller railroads that GAO surveyed reported providing training and information about hazardous materials to local emergency responders and planners in recent years. The Class I railroads reported training through a variety of means, including locally delivered training exercises or off-site at industry-recognized training centers. In addition, railroads reported providing information about hazardous material shipments to state and local emergency planners in part due to a May 2014 Department of Transportation (DOT) Emergency Order requiring notification of state emergency-planning agencies about shipments of crude oil from North Dakota and Montana where the Bakken shale deposit is located. This information was intended to reach local emergency responders so that they could better prepare for rail accidents involving crude oil.", "The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) within DOT have taken multiple actions to support emergency preparedness for rail incidents involving hazardous materials; some actions focused specifically on trains carrying Bakken crude oil. For example, PHMSA developed a web-based training curriculum on how to prepare for hazardous materials incidents, and FRA determined whether railroads provided information about Bakken crude-oil shipments to states. However, PHMSA learned that some states did not provide the information about Bakken crude oil shipments to local emergency planners, as called for in the Emergency Order. Recently enacted legislation expands FRA's oversight of railroads' actions moving forward; for example, railroads will be required to notify states of large shipments of other hazardous materials. However, FRA and PHMSA have not taken steps to understand whether the shipment information railroads are required to share with states is consistently disseminated to local emergency planners. Therefore, the extent to which DOT's information-sharing requirements have the potential to improve local preparedness for rail accidents involving hazardous materials is unclear."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOT develop a process for regularly collecting information from state emergency- planning agencies about their distribution of railroad-provided hazardous materials shipping information to local emergency planning entities. DOT concurred with our recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, freight railroads safely transport thousands of commodities,  including hazardous materials, across the country. However, over the last  several years, accidents involving crude oil, a hazardous flammable  liquid, have occurred. For example, in June 2016 a derailment occurred  near Mosier, Oregon, resulting in 47,000 gallons of crude oil being  released near the Columbia River Gorge. Furthermore, in July 2013, a  derailment in Lac M\u00e9gantic, Quebec, resulted in the deaths of 47 people  and extensive damage to the city\u2019s downtown area. These accidents have  occurred as railroads have increasingly been used to transport crude oil  from certain regions, such as North Dakota and Montana, where the  Bakken shale deposit lies. According to the Energy Information  Administration, monthly shipments of crude oil transported by rail climbed  from about 1-million barrels in January 2010 to nearly 36-million barrels in  October 2014. Although rail shipments of crude oil have declined overall  recently as domestic production levels have slowed, questions have been  raised about the ability of railroads and local emergency responders to  prepare for and take protective actions in the immediate aftermath of a  serious accident, particularly in rural areas where there may be fewer  resources to respond.", "In light of these questions, the Department of Transportation (DOT)  issued\u2014and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has since  enforced\u2014an Emergency Restriction/Prohibition Order (Emergency  Order) in May of 2014 requiring railroads transporting large volumes of  Bakken crude oil to notify states about their estimated operations in an  effort to enhance local emergency responder preparedness. Also within  DOT, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  (PHMSA) has lead responsibility for ensuring the safe movement of hazardous materials across all transportation modes by issuing and  enforcing safety regulations, including requirements for carriers and  shippers to provide emergency response information and report accidents  involving hazardous materials. PHMSA coordinates with FRA in  developing and interpreting hazardous-materials transportation  regulations related to rail transportation and FRA enforces these  regulations.", "You asked us to review efforts to enhance preparedness for accidents  involving the transportation of crude oil and other hazardous materials by  rail. This report examines:  (1) the factors that selected local emergency  planners reported as affecting preparedness for rail accidents involving  hazardous materials, (2) the actions that Class I and selected other  railroads reported taking to support local emergency planners\u2019  preparedness for rail accidents involving hazardous materials, and (3) the  actions that DOT has taken to support state and local emergency  planners\u2019 preparedness for rail accidents involving hazardous materials  and additional actions, if any, that DOT could take. The scope of our  review was limited to emergency planning and preparedness for rail  accidents involving hazardous materials, and did not focus on other  phases of emergency response for an accident, such as mitigation and  clean-up activities, which are largely the responsibility of federal agencies  other than DOT.", "To inform all of our objectives, we reviewed relevant literature about rail  accidents involving hazardous materials and the response to such  accidents, including journal articles and reports, as well as prior GAO  reports on the transportation of hazardous materials by rail. We also  reviewed relevant statutes, such as the Fixing America\u2019s Surface  Transportation (FAST) Act of 2015 and the Emergency Planning and  Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) and regulations, such  as the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) to determine  requirements for DOT and railroads related to transporting hazardous  materials by rail, as well as requirements for federal agencies, states, and  localities regarding emergency planning and reporting related to  hazardous materials. In addition, we interviewed officials at DOT  (including FRA and PHMSA officials), the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland  Security, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National  Transportation Safety Board to understand the roles and responsibilities  of federal, state, and local stakeholders in emergency preparedness and  response to rail accidents involving hazardous materials.", "To identify views of selected local emergency planners on factors that  affect preparedness, we conducted structured interviews with, and  provided a questionnaire to a nonprobability sample of 25 local  emergency planners, primarily from local emergency planning committees  (LEPC)\u2014the groups responsible for implementing emergency response  plans and managing preparedness activities. We identified LEPCs to  interview that were located in the three urban and three rural counties that  had the highest volumes of hazardous materials in each of the five  PHMSA regions and were able to contact LEPCs in 25 of the 30 counties.  To estimate the volumes of crude oil and other hazardous materials  transported by rail, we used the Surface Transportation Board\u2019s 2013  Waybill Sample, the most recent data at the time of the review. These  data contain information on the origin and destination for a nationally  representative sample of rail shipments. To determine the reliability of the  data, we reviewed the documentation provided by the Surface  Transportation Board on how the sample was taken and did electronic  testing to ensure that we received the complete file. We determined that  the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  review. We received completed questionnaires from emergency planners  in 24 of 25 counties and interviewed all 25 across 17 states. We then  conducted an analysis of responses provided by these officials to the  questionnaire and structured interview questions. Because our work was  based on a nonprobability sample of counties, the information we  obtained and present in this report should not be regarded as an  exhaustive list of factors local emergency planners may consider as  affecting preparedness for rail incidents involving hazardous materials.  Similarly, the information and perspectives that we obtained from these  local emergency planners are not generalizable to other local planners or  counties. Furthermore, we interviewed representatives from associations  representing local emergency responders, such as the International  Association of Fire Chiefs. We also reviewed training standards for first  responders to understand hazardous materials training levels.", "To understand the actions selected railroads have taken to support  emergency preparedness, we developed a questionnaire and  administered it to all seven Class I railroads and six smaller regional and  short line railroads, known as Class II and Class III railroads  respectively. The Class II and Class III railroads were selected because  they operate in counties where we conducted structured interviews with  local emergency planners and to obtain variation in railroads operating in  urban and rural counties. We sent our questionnaire to two Class II  railroads and four Class III railroads, and received responses from both  Class II railroads and two Class III railroads. We also interviewed officials  from 5 of 7 Class I railroads, the Association of American Railroads  (AAR), and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and  Transportation Workers. Because our work was based on a  nonprobability sample of Class II and Class III railroads, the results of the  questionnaires with the smaller railroads cannot be generalized to the  entire population of Class II and Class III railroads.", "To understand DOT\u2019s actions to support preparedness for rail accidents  involving hazardous materials and additional actions, if any, it could take,  we reviewed pertinent FRA and PHMSA documents related to these  actions, including training materials and guidance, grant program  documentation, and documentation on efforts to oversee the  implementation of requirements for railroads to share information on train contents and movements. We compared the agencies\u2019 efforts to oversee  the implementation of information-sharing requirements for railroads with  pertinent Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We  also interviewed emergency planners from 17 selected state emergency  response commissions (SERC) on the use of PHMSA grants to support  preparedness and response efforts. These SERCs were chosen  because their state coincided with the geographic location of the local  emergency planners we selected. Because our work was based on a  nonprobability sample, the information and perspectives we obtained from  these state emergency planners is not generalizable to other state  planners. See appendix I for a more detailed description of our objectives,  scope, and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to November 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the past several years, rail has increasingly been used to ship crude  oil, a flammable liquid. Even though crude oil shipments by rail have  declined in the past year, from January 2010 to October 2014 shipments  increased over 30 times, peaking at almost 36 million barrels or about  51,000 rail carloads in October 2014 (see fig. 1). This increase is due to  pipeline capacity constraints in certain areas of the country, including the  Bakken shale region in North Dakota. As shipments of crude oil have  increased, the number of rail accidents involving crude oil has also  increased, even as rail accidents involving all hazardous materials have  declined. From 2006 to 2010, there were 19 rail incidents involving  crude oil, 4 of which were designated by PHMSA as serious rail  incidents\u2014compared with 399 crude oil rail incidents from 2011 to 2015\u2014 21 of which were designated by PHMSA as serious. Serious accidents  can involve derailments, collisions, and release of materials. Depending  on the commodities a train is carrying, releases can involve not only  crude oil, which is flammable, but also a variety of chemicals such as  sodium hydroxide which can irritate the eyes and burn the skin.", "The railroad industry is dominated by the seven largest railroads, known  as Class I railroads, which transport the majority of rail freight\u2014including  hazardous materials\u2014across a network of 200,000 miles of track, mostly  in rural areas. In addition, numerous Class II and hundreds of Class III  railroads have essential roles in moving freight, typically linking rural  communities to the larger railroad network. According to DOT, about 18  percent of all Class I carload freight originates or terminates on a Class II  or Class III railroad, often called \u201cfirst mile\u201d and \u201clast mile\u201d movements.", "Federal, state, and local entities all play a role related to emergency  preparedness for rail accidents involving crude oil and other hazardous  materials. For example, DOT oversees compliance with safety regulations  applicable to the rail transportation of hazardous materials. Specifically,  PHMSA\u2014through its Office of Hazardous Materials Safety\u2014issues  regulations that apply to shippers and railroads transporting hazardous  materials, like crude oil. PHMSA also provides grants to states to fund  training for local responders. As mentioned previously, DOT issued an  Emergency Order in May 2014 that requires railroads planning to operate  trains transporting 1-million gallons or more of Bakken crude oil to notify  states of the expected movement along the routes. The Emergency Order  focused on ensuring that state and local emergency responders know the  frequency and number of Bakken crude-oil trains moving through their  jurisdictions. FRA provides regulatory oversight for both passenger and  freight rail, issuing and enforcing safety regulations. FRA enforces its  own regulations and the HMR, through its inspections and audits  conducted by FRA officials and state partners in some states. In addition,  state officials, local emergency planners, and the railroads also play  specific roles in planning and preparing for emergencies, specifically:", "Based on EPCRA, each state is required to establish a SERC that  acts as the emergency-planning focal point and that is responsible for  designating emergency-planning districts and appointing LEPCs for  each district. The SERC supervises the activities of the LEPCs.  LEPC membership includes representatives from police, fire, civil  defense, health, transportation (including rail), environmental  agencies, among others. These entities plan, gather, and share  information about emergency preparedness and arrange for  emergency responders\u2019 training.", "Local emergency-planning agencies prepare local emergency plans  that include emergency response plans, training requirements for  emergency responders (e.g., police officers, firefighters, and  emergency medical technicians), and other vital hazardous material  response information. Local emergency-planning agencies may also  prepare commodity flow studies. Most U.S. firefighters are  volunteers.", "Under DOT\u2019s Emergency Order, the railroads support emergency  responders by providing SERCs with information about expected  movements of trains carrying Bakken crude oil. In addition, since  1996, railroads that ship oil in containers exceeding 3,500 gallons  must prepare response plans that document that they have trained  personnel, placed equipment, and established procedures to respond  to an oil spill. PHMSA has recently proposed in coordination with  FRA, expanding the oil-spill response-planning requirements to  require railroads to obtain FRA approval for more detailed,  comprehensive oil-spill response plans for high-hazard flammable  trains carrying petroleum oil.", "Recently enacted legislation may change the responsibilities of some  stakeholders. In December 2015, President Obama signed into law the  FAST Act, which requires DOT to codify and expand the information  sharing requirement relative to the existing Emergency Order\u2019s  notification requirements for trains carrying 1-million gallons or more of  Bakken crude oil. In accordance with the FAST Act, in July 2016  PHMSA proposed regulations (the same as mentioned above) to require  railroads to share information on a monthly basis about high-hazard  flammable trains\u2019 operations with state (i.e., SERC) and tribal emergency  response commissions. \u201cHigh hazard flammable trains\u201d are those that  transport (1) 20 or more tank cars loaded with a Class 3 flammable liquid  in a continuous block or (2) a total of 35 or more tank cars carrying such  materials. The FAST Act also directs DOT to require railroads to  provide, through the applicable fusion center, emergency responders  with real-time access to information about the train\u2019s hazardous materials  shipments in the case of a train accident.", "While planning is conducted by a range of participants, local emergency  responders and railroad train crews are typically first on the scene in the  immediate aftermath of this type of accident. Firefighters, police, and  emergency medical technicians assess and secure the scene, as  described in figure 2. For example, local and sometimes regional officials  may be responsible for advising the public on taking shelter-in-place  actions or conducting evacuations of affected populations. In addition,  assuming they are not affected by an accident, railroad train crews are  expected to provide local emergency responders with information about  the type and quantity of hazardous materials on the train, the position of  the train\u2019s contents, and the emergency contact information (referred to  as hazardous materials documentation), as described in figure 2.  According to the HMR, railroads are required to provide notice of certain  hazardous materials accidents to the National Response Center.", "After the initial response, local emergency responders and railroads as  well as state and federal agencies have various responsibilities for  mitigating and investigating an accident (see fig. 2 above).", "Mitigation: According to AAR, railroads have hazardous materials  accident management personnel and employ hazardous materials  response contractors and environmental consultants that provide spill  response tools and equipment. Federal and state environmental  agencies are responsible for assisting this effort and monitoring and  evaluating the environmental damage. States are required to notify  EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard, which may send representatives to  the accident scene to assist in or direct response activities resulting  from a hazardous materials release or discharge.", "Investigation: FRA monitors train accidents and investigates their  causes and compliance with existing safety laws and regulations. Per  its discretion, the National Transportation Safety Board investigates  some railroad accidents and issues safety recommendations aimed at  preventing future accidents.", "Training is a key aspect of planning and preparing for emergency  response and mitigation. Federal regulations require that firefighters and  other responders receive hazardous-materials emergency response  training. When such training is provided, federal statutes regarding  occupational health and safety indicate that it must be based on training  standards set by a recognized, standard-setting organization, such as the  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). NFPA standards detail the  specific knowledge that trainees must have to be considered competent  to provide varying levels of response to hazardous materials accidents,  as we describe later in this report. Additionally, DOT officials stated that  FEMA\u2019s Emergency Management Institute serves as the national focal  point for the development and delivery of emergency management  training to enhance the capabilities of state, local, and tribal government  officials, volunteer organizations, FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce, federal  agencies, and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of  disasters and emergencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Emergency Planners Reported That Responder Training and Railroads\u2019 Information Sharing Affect Preparedness Emergency Planners Reported That Responder Training for Rail Hazardous Materials Accidents Is Useful, but Some Encounter Impediments to Participating in Training", "paragraphs": ["Local emergency planners from almost all of the counties we contacted  reported that their emergency responders participated in training,  exercises, or drills (\u201ctraining\u201d) to prepare for responding to rail hazardous  materials incidents. Specifically, emergency planners from 21 of 22  counties (13 urban and 8 rural) indicated that emergency responders  had participated in rail hazardous materials classroom or hands-on  training and 20 reported their emergency responders had participated in  rail hazardous materials exercises or drills. About half of the emergency  planners (13 of 22) reported that their emergency responders had  received rail hazardous-materials training by independent study or  webinar. Hazardous materials training may be provided by state or local  emergency management agencies, colleges and associations with  specialized programs, chemical producers, and railroads, among others.  As discussed later, PHMSA provides grants to states to fund training for  local responders. Also, as noted earlier, FEMA\u2019s Emergency  Management Institute serves as a national focal point for emergency  management training.", "Most local emergency planners reported that the rail hazardous-materials  training was useful for helping their emergency responders prepare for  and respond to rail hazardous materials incidents. Local emergency  planners from 18 counties (9 urban and 9 rural) reported that such  training was very useful, 4 reported it was somewhat useful, and 3  reported they were uncertain about its usefulness. Some emergency  planners told us that training that involved \u201chands on\u201d experience was  particularly helpful because it facilitated direct interaction with devices and  props that emergency responders would not normally encounter except in  a real-world incident. Other emergency planners told us that training  provides a way for emergency responders to interact face to face with  some of the stakeholders they might normally encounter in an incident,  such as railroad hazardous materials experts and personnel from other  fire departments. Such interaction can facilitate relationships among  stakeholders by increasing familiarity and building trust. For example, one  local emergency planner told us that the first responders from his county  attended a railroad-sponsored hazardous materials exercise that was  coincidentally held a week before a hazardous materials train derailment.  The emergency planner noted that when the accident happened,  responders were already familiar with the railroad and stakeholders,  familiarity that facilitated cooperation and trust.", "Local emergency planners reported on the percentage of their first  responders who received various levels of hazardous-materials response  training, from basic to more advanced. Generally, as discussed below, a  greater percentage of these first responders received basic training than  received more advanced levels of training, according to responses to the  questionnaires we received. As described previously, there are federal  requirements that firefighters and other responders receive hazardous- materials emergency response training, and when such training is  provided, it must adhere to federal requirements and must be based on  training standards set by a recognized, standards-setting organization,  such as the NFPA. NFPA\u2019s standards identify the types of training  needed to achieve professional competence at four levels, from  \u201cawareness\u201d, the most basic level, to \u201cincident commander,\u201d the most  advanced (see table 1).", "Local emergency planners from most counties (20 of 22) reported that  more than 60 percent of their first responders were trained at the  awareness level, which enables first responders to recognize that they  are dealing with a hazardous materials incident and call for trained  response personnel. However, emergency planners from few (6 of 23)  counties reported that more than 60 percent of their first responders were  trained at the operational level, which allows first responders to take  defensive action in the event of a hazardous materials release.  Emergency planners from even fewer counties reported emergency  responders trained at the technician and incident command levels, a  finding that is to be expected given that these advance levels of  competency require additional hours of training and certification (see fig.  3).", "Local emergency planners in select urban and rural counties reported that  various obstacles impede their emergency responders\u2019 participation in  training activities\u2014activities that would help prepare them to take  defensive action to a rail accident involving hazardous materials. Factors  such as dedicating time for training, taking unpaid time off of work, and  being able to get off from their regular duties may discourage participation  in training (see fig. 4).", "Local emergency planners from 23 counties reported that the leading  factor discouraging participation in rail hazardous-materials training was  the time commitment to attend a training activity. As one emergency  planner put it, despite the fact that the state developed a variety of rail  hazardous materials training and exercises for a county\u2019s emergency  responders, the ability to make use of the training opportunities ultimately  rests on emergency responders\u2019 being able to attend without neglecting  other professional and personal responsibilities. Local emergency  planners from rural counties with largely volunteer firefighter workforce  (i.e., unpaid) reported the dilemma of having to take unpaid leave from  their primary workplace to attend training. One emergency planner told us  that some training providers recognize this limitation and try to schedule  training for periods when volunteers may be more available, such as  evenings and weekends. However, even when training is offered during  weekends or non-work hours, emergency planners told us that it can be  difficult to get participants because of family commitments and other  responsibilities. Along this same line, FRA officials told us that  communities can be unwilling to send employees to training because they  do not want the employees to be away from their professional duties,  despite the fact that the cost of the training itself may be covered by other  entities, such as a railroad, and free to the employer.", "Local emergency planners reported another obstacle to participating in  training is that of backfill\u2014the situation where a replacement worker  needs to cover the shift of the person attending training. As indicated  above, 12 of 23 emergency planners reported that emergency responders  sometimes are not able to get off their regular duties to attend training  because, for example, a replacement cannot be found. Emergency  planners reported that backfill can be difficult and expensive. According to  one emergency planner from an urban county, most fire departments  operate with the bare minimum workforce so sending anyone away to  training has a big impact on the budget because the county may need to  pay existing staff overtime to work an additional shift. One described  backfill as being cost prohibitive, noting that replacing absent workers can  cost up to three times as much as the cost of the training itself.  Emergency planners also told us that a consequence of such obstacles is  that fire departments are not able to train their entire force at one point in  time and that their responders have varying levels of training. Whether  the workforce is comprised of volunteers or career fire fighters, planners  told us that sending their entire force to training is cost prohibitive and  otherwise impractical. In addition, an emergency planner illustrated this  by stating that in a recent railroad scenario-based exercise, only one shift  participated.", "Most emergency planners viewed their emergency responders as  prepared to take defensive actions, such as evacuating affected  populations, sheltering in place, and setting up an incident command post  in the event of a rail hazardous materials accident. Emergency planners  from 22 of 25 counties reported their emergency responders as very (9  counties) or somewhat (13 counties) prepared for taking such actions.  Emergency planners told us that there were differences in preparedness  level within their counties, stating that some jurisdictions place a higher  priority on preparedness than others. One emergency planner indicated a  distinction between urban and rural locations, explaining that urban areas  may have a heightened awareness to hazardous materials by rail  because of the steady presence of trains on their rails. Other planners  attributed a greater level of preparedness to a heightened awareness of  rail accidents in recent years and to increased training. In a related issue,  local emergency planners from all selected counties reported having  mutual aid agreements\u2014pre-established agreements in which first  responders call for assistance from other fire departments\u2014in place.  Such agreements can increase a county\u2019s preparedness since they  increase the resources (and in some instances expertise level) available  for immediate response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergency Planners from Most Counties Reported That Information from Railroads and SERCs Is Useful for Hazardous Response Planning and Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["Local emergency planners from most of the selected counties reported  that railroads and SERCs have provided them with a variety of  information for planning and preparing for hazardous materials accidents  and that this information is useful. The types of information provided  include:", "Railroads\u2019 emergency-response-planning guides: Emergency  planners from two-thirds of the counties (16 of 24) reported railroads  operating in their jurisdictions provided them a copy\u2014or copies if  provided by multiple railroads\u2014of their emergency-response-planning  guides. (Emergency planners from 8 counties reported that they had  not been provided guides.) Railroads\u2019 emergency-response-planning  guides may include information about critical railroad contacts and  railroad incident response guidelines. Emergency planners from most  of the counties that received guides described the guides as being  useful or very useful for preparing for a potential rail accident because  they contained information about what the railroads\u2019 response  activities would be. One planner told us that a guide typically includes  information that can be readily incorporated into a local entity\u2019s own  hazardous-materials response plan. Emergency planners from three  counties told us about deficiencies with the guides and one noted that  the information was not particularly useful because the plan  referenced the national rail network rather than the locality and  focused more on pollution response than on life safety planning.  Another told us that the plans had information that was redacted or  included such strict non-disclosure statements as to prevent  incorporating it into local emergency-planning documents.", "Hazardous materials information: Local emergency planners from  most counties (22 of 24) reported having been provided information  about hazardous materials transported through their areas, including  a few that told us their SERCs provided them with information about  Bakken crude-oil shipments. In addition, most (14 of 20) indicated  having no difficulty getting information. (As discussed below,  emergency planners from six counties indicated they had difficulty  getting information.) According to DOT, besides obtaining information  about planned Bakken crude-oil shipments through the May 2014  Emergency Order, bona fide emergency responders are able to obtain  information on other types of hazardous materials moving through  their community by requesting the information from the railroad.  Emergency planners from 11 counties reported that railroads provided  such information upon request, 6 reported that railroads voluntarily  provided them with such information, and some reported they  received information from SERCs and other entities such as the U.S.  Coast Guard or the Army Corps of Engineers. Some emergency  planners reported receiving information from multiple sources.  Emergency planners from 17 counties reported finding the information  somewhat to very useful and 4 not useful for planning and preparing  for potential accidents involving hazardous materials transported by  rail. One local emergency planner told us that having this information  in advance of an accident helped in putting the appropriate response  plans in place when a derailment involving ethanol and propane  occurred. Some local emergency planners described incorporating the  hazardous materials information into plans and guidance, such as  emergency response plans, commodity flow studies, and county  hazardous-materials plans. One said the information was used to fine  tune the hazardous materials team\u2019s training exercise by focusing on  the use of fire suppression foam since the information indicated an  uptick in the volume of crude oil shipments. In addition, some  emergency planners reported discussing the information with local  emergency responders in order to increase their awareness of  hazardous materials shipments.", "Emergency planners from some (6 of 20) counties reported difficulty  getting information about hazardous materials shipments from the  railroads or SERCs. In describing the behaviors that impeded information  sharing, one emergency planner told us that the railroad was reluctant to  release information because it considered the information security  sensitive. Another noted that the formal process for requesting  information from railroads gets bogged down, perhaps because it is  administered by a different office than the personnel with whom informal  relationships were developed.", "With respect to DOT\u2019s Emergency Order related to railroads transporting  Bakken crude oil, emergency planners from 9 of 25 counties told us that  the Emergency Order improved their access or had other positive  outcomes, while 11 of 25 counties told us that the Emergency Order had  little or no impact on their ability to access hazardous materials  information. Emergency planners from five counties told us that the effect  of the Emergency Order was unclear. Of the emergency planners who  told us that the Emergency Order improved access to information from  the railroads, one told us that the railroad not only provided information  about Bakken crude shipments but information about the 10 most shipped  commodities as well. Other positive outcomes were related to providing a  broader view of hazmat shipments and improving situational awareness.  Emergency planners reporting little or no impact explained that in some  situations they had adequate access to information prior to the  Emergency Order. A couple of planners told us that the Bakken crude  information is very generic and provides only generalities that they could  ascertain just as readily by observing the train traffic. One emergency  planner told us that the information is already accessible because at least  one state provides the Bakken crude-oil information on its website for the  public to access and review.", "The hazardous materials information described above is used by local  emergency planners from railroads and other entities to develop  commodity flow studies. As mentioned previously, these studies describe  the types and amounts of hazardous materials transported through a  specified geographic area and the modes of transportation.

According to one emergency planner, a commodity flow study helps  responders focus on the right response based on the potential hazard.

For  example, one Class I railroad told us that it provides training to fire departments using props such as tank cars. Five Class I railroads  reported targeting training resources to communities based on such  things as the type of hazardous materials being transported in their area,  the volume of such materials, and the train routes. Six Class I railroads  told us that awareness- and operational-level training comprised from 50  to 80 percent of the training they offer. Railroads told us that they  advertise their training to emergency planners and responders in a variety  of ways, including:  (1) directly to local fire departments, LEPCs, and  county emergency management agencies; (2) to emergency responder  organizations, conferences, and training organizations; and (3) to state  agencies, including SERCs, emergency management agencies, and  states\u2019 fire marshal offices.

According to data provided by five Class I railroads, their combined total  spending on training increased from about $1.5 million in 2011 to $4.6  million in 2015\u2014an increase of more than 200 percent (see table 2  below). AAR officials attributed the increase in spending in part to a  response to a call to action by the Secretary of Transportation in January  2014, after which Class I railroads provided $5 million to develop  additional curriculum specifically on emergency response to crude oil  derailments and train first responders. In addition, AAR officials told us  that Class I railroads significantly increased their hazardous materials  training efforts over the last several years in part because of the  tremendous increase in the volume of Bakken crude oil shipped by rail  and high-profile accidents, such as the one in Lac M\u00e9gantic, Quebec.", "Relatedly, railroads reported having trained more responders since 2011.

However, according  to ASLRRA officials, Class II and III railroads generally have fewer  resources than Class I railroads to provide training to emergency responders and others. The officials told us that frequently the most  effective way for Class II and III railroads to provide training to local  emergency responders is for them to collaborate with Class I railroads.  For example, an official from one short-line holding company (i.e., a  company with a controlling interest in multiple Class II and III railroads)  we interviewed told us that one of its railroads recently partnered with a  Class I railroad to gain access to tank car training equipment so that  responders along its line could undergo training on how to respond to an  accident involving a tank car."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Class I and Selected Class II and Class III Railroads Report Providing More Information Than Required to States and Conducting Community Outreach", "paragraphs": ["All Class I railroads reported complying with the Emergency Order by  reporting the Bakken crude-oil shipment information to the relevant  SERCs.

In fiscal year 2015,  PHMSA awarded $19.9 million in these grants to states, territories, and  Native American tribes, allowing them to be used to design and  implement planning and training programs according to need. For  example, SERCs can use the HMEP funds to conduct commodity flow  studies, support training exercises, or to send responders to hazardous  materials conferences or provide grants to LEPCs for the similar  activities.

As railroads continue to ship large  quantities of crude oil and other hazardous materials across the nation,  emergency responders need to be aware of the location and the nature of  the hazardous materials present at the scene of an accident so they are  able to be properly equipped to protect themselves and their community.  As discussed earlier, local emergency planners from the 24 counties who  provided a response told us that the type and quantity of hazardous  materials are the most important pieces of information for first responders  at the scene of an accident. The HMR requires that a train crew carry  hazardous materials documentation including both \u201cshipping papers\u201d\u2014 information about the hazardous materials being carried and the shipper\u2019s  emergency contact information\u2014and the train\u2019s \u201cconsist\u201d\u2014a document  detailing the current position and contents of the cars carrying hazardous  materials.

FRA conducts inspections to determine  railroads\u2019 compliance with safety regulations including those related to  hazardous materials documentation. FRA officials told us that as part of  FRA\u2019s routine inspections of railroads\u2019 compliance with safety regulations,  inspectors collect information on whether or not train crews are in  possession of the required hazardous material documentation and  whether the documentation is accurate.

Prior to the Emergency Order , railroads could provide  information about the types of hazardous materials moving through local  communities to bona fide emergency response authorities upon request,  as described previously. Thus, unless they requested information, state  and local emergency planners may not have known if, or how many such  trains carrying large quantities of Bakken crude oil were moving through  their jurisdiction until after an accident was reported. However, the  Emergency Order has since required each railroad transporting 1-million  gallons or more of Bakken crude oil in a single train to provide the  following information in writing to the SERC for each state in which it  operates such a train: a reasonable estimate of the number of high-hazard flammable trains  expected to travel through each county within a state per week;  the routes of these high-hazard flammable trains; a description of the materials shipped; all applicable emergency-response information; and a point of contact at the railroad.", "Furthermore, the Emergency Order requires railroads to update this  information whenever their reported volumes vary by more than 25  percent, and calls on SERCs\u2014entities that the Emergency Order  indicates are best situated\u2014to convey the information about shipments of  Bakken crude oil to LEPCs in affected counties. This basic information  was meant to inform local emergency responders about the presence of  trains carrying Bakken crude oil.", "By issuing the Emergency Order, DOT required railroads to take action to  assist emergency responders in preparing for rail accidents involving  crude oil by providing information important for local emergency  preparedness. Specifically, the Emergency Order explained that it is  essential that local responders be well informed about the presence of  trains carrying Bakken crude oil because they are typically the first to  arrive on the accident scene. Similarly, it states that local responders  should be as well informed as possible prior to an accident involving a  train carrying Bakken crude oil, and, without the requirement established  by the Emergency Order, local emergency responders may not know to  prepare for potential accidents involving these trains. Furthermore, as  previously discussed, our review found that local emergency planners find  this type of information useful. Specifically, local emergency planners  from 17 of 21 counties reported that information about hazardous  materials shipments was useful for planning and preparing for accidents.  For example, local emergency planners told us that the type of  information that is most useful for planning and preparing for a potential  rail accident involving hazardous materials includes information about the  type of hazardous material (including hazard classification and toxicity  level), quantity of hazardous material, route of the shipments, and railroad  emergency contact\u2019s name and phone number.", "However, the extent that this information actually reaches local  emergency planners is not clear. FRA officials said the agency contacted  railroads and SERCs to confirm that railroads had shared the required  information within 30 days of the Emergency Order\u2019s issuance in 2014,  and then again in 2015, and did not find any evidence that any railroad  had failed to comply. However, FRA officials told us that they did not  collect information about whether the SERCs distributed the information  to local planners. In 2015, PHMSA gathered some limited information  from states about their efforts to distribute the information to local  emergency planners and determined that some states did not share the  information. Specifically, PHMSA participated in discussions with state  officials from 48 states and the District of Columbia as part of an EPA-led  initiative in January 2015. Among the topics discussed was the extent to  which state agencies passed the Bakken crude oil shipment information  to local communities. According to PHMSA officials, although states  indicated that they shared the railroad-provided information with local  communities, some states indicated the information was heavily redacted.  PHMSA officials also learned that some states did not provide any  information to local communities because of varying interpretations about  whether and how much information could be made publicly available. The  extent that this occurred is unclear, however, because neither PHMSA  nor FRA took steps to systematically collect additional information from  SERCs about whether they disseminated the information required by the  Emergency Order.", "This lack of clarity notwithstanding, in July 2016, PHMSA proposed  expanding the information-sharing requirement so that railroads would  have to provide advance notification for all high hazard flammable trains  and would continue to make the SERC the information focal point  consistent with the FAST Act. PHMSA\u2019s proposed rulemaking effectively  codifies the Emergency Order but broadens it by requiring railroads to  provide monthly reports to SERCs on high-hazard flammable trains,  which carry other flammable liquids besides Bakken crude oil. The  impending broadening of the Emergency Order is likely to expand its  applicability beyond only states through which Bakken crude oil is  transported by rail, and affect more railroads. The Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government state that agencies should design and  implement control activities so that they are aligned with their objectives  and review control activities after any significant changes to activities to  determine that the changes are designed and implemented  appropriately. As FRA is responsible for enforcing PHMSA\u2019s regulations in the rail mode, the proposed new reporting requirement would represent  an expansion in FRA\u2019s activities and oversight; therefore, it will be  important to determine if the activities are properly implemented.", "Given the proposed expansion of the Emergency Order, this may be an  opportune time for DOT to consider how it can determine whether the  information-sharing requirements will reach their intended audience.

However, PHMSA\u2019s January 2015 conversations with state officials  demonstrated a shared-interest in enhancing preparedness to rail  accidents and a willingness to share information with federal partners.  Without an understanding of the extent to which the required railroad- provided information has been received by local emergency planners, it is  unclear whether requiring railroads to share this information has the  potential to improve emergency preparedness for a rail accident.  Furthermore, without information on how consistently SERCs share  information, it is possible that some LEPCs will not receive information  on, and be unaware of, large shipments of flammable materials that  would help them improve their preparedness for a potential accident.

To determine the reliability of the data, we reviewed the documentation  provided by the Surface Transportation Board on how the sample was  taken and did electronic testing to ensure that we received the complete  file. Because the waybill data only contain origins, destinations, and  selected transfer points, we used the TRAGIS routing model developed  by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to estimate the rail routes for  hazardous materials and determined that the data were reliable for the  purposes of identifying counties with high volumes of hazardous materials  and crude oil transported by rail. Using this analysis, we identified the 10  counties with the highest volumes of crude oil and other hazardous  materials transported by rail within each of the five PHMSA regions in four  categories: (1) urban counties with carloads of crude oil, (2) rural counties  with carloads of crude oil, (3) urban counties with carloads of hazardous  materials other than crude oil, and (4) rural counties with carloads of other  hazmat. From this list, we identified 30 counties (three urban and three  rural in each of the five PHMSA regions) to interview and were able to  contact local emergency planning officials from LEPCs in 25 of the 30 counties.

We received completed questionnaires from 24 of 25 counties and  interviewed local emergency planners from 25 counties\u2014specifically at  least two urban and at least two rural counties across all but one PHMSA  region for a total of 25 local emergency planners across 17 states.  Because our work was based on a nonprobability sample of counties, the  information we obtained and present in this report should not be regarded  as an exhaustive list of factors local emergency planners may consider as  affecting preparedness for rail incidents involving hazardous materials.  Similarly, the information and perspectives that we obtained from these  local emergency planners are not generalizable to other local planners or  counties.", "We identified the 17 SERCs to interview based on the location of the four  urban and four rural counties that had the highest volumes of hazardous  materials in each of the 5 PHMSA regions we selected. Finally, we  interviewed representatives from associations representing local  emergency responders, such as the International Association of Fire  Chiefs, the National Volunteer Fire Council, and the International  Association of Fire Fighters about factors affecting preparedness.", "To understand the actions Class I and selected other railroads report  having taken to support local emergency planners\u2019 preparedness for rail  accidents involving hazardous materials, we developed a questionnaire  and administered it to all seven Class I railroads and to six smaller  regional and short line railroads, known as Class II and Class III  railroads. We interviewed 5 of 7 Class I railroads (selected in no priority order but which could be scheduled soonest) to develop an  understanding of the types of training and other resources railroads  provide to local emergency responders. We developed the  questionnaire based on our analysis of information gathered from  interviews with stakeholders\u2014such as five of seven Class I railroads, the  Association of American Railroads (AAR), American Short Line and  Regional Railroad Association, a SERC, two LEPCs, and FRA, among  others\u2014who were knowledgeable about hazardous materials information  sharing, emergency preparedness and response training, community  awareness efforts, and railroad response to hazardous materials  accidents. The Class II and Class III railroads were selected using the  Surface Transportation Board\u2019s 2013 Carload Waybill sample to identify  those railroads that operate in counties where we conducted structured  interviews with local emergency planners and to obtain variation in  railroads operating in urban and rural counties. We sent our questionnaire  to two Class II railroads and four Class III railroads and received  responses from both Class II railroads and two Class III railroads.  Because our work was based on a nonprobability sample of Class II and  Class III railroads, the results of the questionnaires with the smaller  railroads cannot be generalized to the entire population of Class II and  Class III railroads. We also reviewed AAR\u2019s Recommended Railroad  Operating Practices for Transportation of Hazardous Materials and  railroad documents such as emergency planning guides, examples of  reports railroads sent to emergency planners, responder requests for  information about hazardous commodities transported in their  communities, and training and outreach material provided to local  emergency responders such as the Transportation Community  Awareness and Emergency Response training program. We also  interviewed officials from AAR, the American Short Line and Regional  Railroad Association, and the International Association of Sheet Metal,  Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers about railroad requirements and  actions for emergency preparedness and response to hazardous  materials accidents, such as the development of electronic applications  that can be used by emergency responders to identify commodities in the  event of a hazardous materials accident. We also reviewed information  on railroad websites, which are used to provide information to  communities about hazardous materials and railroad response to  accidents.", "To understand DOT\u2019s actions to support preparedness for rail accidents  involving hazardous materials and additional actions, if any, it could take,  we reviewed pertinent FRA and PHMSA documents related to these  actions, including training materials and guidance, grant program  documentation, and documentation on efforts to oversee the  implementation of requirements for railroads to share information on train  contents and movements related to the May 2014 Emergency  Restriction/Prohibition Order (Emergency Order). We also reviewed  comments the agency received related to the Emergency Order as part of  its Hazardous Materials: Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational  Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains rulemaking. We compared  the agency\u2019s efforts to oversee implementation of information-sharing  requirements for railroads with pertinent Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government and identified criteria about how agencies  should review internal control activities to ensure they are implemented  properly, particularly after a program change. In addition, we analyzed  information obtained from interviews with local emergency planners on  how they used the information provided by railroads and with emergency  planners from SERCs, including information provided in response to the  Emergency Order, and their views on the usefulness of the information to  support preparedness and response efforts. We also reviewed PHMSA  guidance on Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness (HMEP)  planning and training grants, Hazardous Materials Instructor Training  grants, and Supplemental Public Sector Training grants. We analyzed  information obtained from interviews with SERC emergency planners on  how they used the PHMSA\u2019s HMEP grants. These stakeholders were  chosen because their state coincided with the geographic location of the  local emergency planners we selected, as discussed above. We also  interviewed PHMSA and FRA officials about recent DOT actions to  support emergency preparedness and response to rail hazardous  materials accidents, such as the development of the crude oil reference  sheet, the Transportation Rail Incident Preparedness and Response  training program, and the Assistance for Local Emergency Response  Training and Community Safety Grants grant programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 through November  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual name above, Nancy Lueke (Assistant  Director), Chris Keisling, Gail Marnik (Analyst in Charge), David Hooper,  John Mingus, Joshua Ormond, Jaclyn Nelson, Amy Rosewarne, Kelly  Rubin, Jim Russell, and Chad Williams made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
