Once workers have paid taxes and worked sufficient time in covered employment, they and their families are considered to have earned the right to future benefits.  Social Security benefit payments are calculated based on a formula that replaces a larger portion of wages for low wage earners than for higher wage earners.  Hospital insurance benefits do not vary on the basis of individuals\u2019 wage histories; any benefits paid depend on the health situation of covered workers.

All federal taxes are then deposited in the Treasury.  Treasury credits the Social Security and HI trust funds for the applicable amounts. Neither eligibility for benefits nor the amount of benefits is based on the amount of taxes paid by an individual, and neither IRS nor the Social Security Administration (SSA) directly credits to the individual the annual and cumulative FICA taxes paid by or on behalf of each individual.", "Cumulatively, the OASDI and HI taxes collected represent dedicated receipts.  They are accounted for in earmarked funds:  the Social Security OASI trust fund, Social Security DI trust fund, and Medicare HI trust fund.  These trust funds hold funds in the form of special nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities that are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

This interest is paid in the form of additional Treasury securities.  Until 1983, program revenues and expenses were closely matched, and the reserves were modest.  After the 1983 Social Security Commission recommendations were enacted, balances grew.  As a result, interest credits have become a more important source of revenue for the OASDI trust funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Longer Term Outlook", "paragraphs": ["As we have reported, both Social Security and Medicare face serious financing challenges.

The combination of a larger elderly population, increased longevity, and rising health care costs will drive significant increases in health and retirement spending when the \u201cbaby boom\u201d generation begins to retire.", "Over the long term, the trust funds are not solvent.  SSA projections show that, absent a change in the structure of the program, the OASDI trust funds will only be able to pay full benefits through 2037.  However, as we have reported, because a trust fund\u2019s accumulated balance does not necessarily reflect the full future cost of existing government commitments, it is not an adequate measure of the fund\u2019s solvency or the program\u2019s sustainability.

The credit offsets the impact of Social Security taxes paid by low- income workers and encourages low-income persons to seek work rather than welfare.  The EITC is available to taxpayers with and without children and depends on the nature and amount of qualifying income and on the number of children who meet age, relationship, and residency tests.  The amount of EITC allowed to an individual is first applied as a payment against any income tax liability of that individual.  Any remaining amount is refunded to the individual.  Workers can receive the credit as a lump sum payment after filing an income tax return or in advance as part of their paycheck.", "Table 2 shows, for the past 3 years, the number of EITC recipients, the relatively small number of those who reported receiving an advance EITC, and the total EITC amount.", "In December 1998, the Council of Economic Advisers concluded that \u201cthe EITC is one of our most successful programs for fighting poverty and encouraging work.\u201d Among other things, the report said that the EITC had lifted 4.3 million Americans out of poverty in 1997, had reduced the number of children living in poverty that year by 2.2 million, and had increased the labor force participation of single mothers.", "For many EITC recipients, the credit is more than enough to fully offset Social Security taxes.  Most EITC recipients earn credits that exceed their income tax liabilities.  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that 87 percent of the credit earned in 2000 will be refunded as direct payments to taxpayers.  For many of the recipients these refunds will be more than enough to offset their payroll tax burdens.  For example, a head-of-household filer who has two children and earns $15,000 in wages would have earned an EITC of $3,396 in 2000.  This amount would have exceeded her precredit income tax liability of $24 plus her $1,148 portion of payroll tax liability.  It would also have been more than enough to offset her employer\u2019s $1,148 share of the payroll tax, which most economists believe to be borne by the employee.  However, many low-income individuals and couples, especially those without children, do not earn the EITC.  Looking at all low-income taxpayers together, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that in 1999 households with cash incomes between zero and $10,000, on average, received EITC refunds equal to 4.1 percent of their incomes.  This average refunded credit was enough to offset the average payroll tax liability of these households, but it would not have completely offset the burden of the employer\u2019s portion of the payroll tax.  The average refunded credit for households with cash incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 typically would not have been sufficient to offset any of the employer\u2019s share of the payroll tax and only a portion of the employee\u2019s share for those households."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EITC Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["Since 1995, we have identified EITC noncompliance as one of the high-risk areas within IRS because such noncompliance exposes the federal government to billions of dollars of risk through overpayments of the EITC.

Currently, to be a qualifying child, a child must (1) be the taxpayer\u2019s son, daughter, adopted child, grandchild, stepchild, or eligible foster child (i.e., meet a relationship test); (2) be under age 19, under age 24 and a full-time student, or any age and permanently and totally disabled (i.e., meet an age test); and (3) have lived with the taxpayer in the United States for more than half the year or for the entire year if an eligible foster child (i.e., meet a residency test).  Failure to meet the residency test was the most common qualifying child error identified in both studies.", "IRS\u2019 studies identified the following as other sources of EITC errors.", "Complicated living arrangements--when a child meets the rules to be a qualifying child of more than one person, the person with the higher modified adjusted gross income (AGI) is the only one who can claim the EITC using that child.  The person with the lower modified AGI cannot use that child to claim the EITC even if the other person does not claim the EITC.  This rule does not apply if the other person is the taxpayer's spouse and they file a joint return.", "Misreporting of filing status\u2014these errors involved married taxpayers filing as single or head of household when they should have filed as married filing separately.  Persons who file as married filing separately are not eligible to claim the EITC.", "Income misreporting\u2014these errors included misreporting of earned income and underreporting of investment income.", "EITC \u201cnoncompliance\u201d as identified in IRS\u2019 studies and as referred to in this testimony includes errors caused by mistakes\u2014possibly due to the complexity of the EITC\u2014or an intent to defraud.  Both of these potential sources of error have been of concern to IRS and others.  Some analysts consider the EITC to be a complex tax provision that challenges those applying for it to properly understand and follow the qualifying rules.  On the other hand, the credit\u2019s possible susceptibility to fraud has also been a concern to Congress and IRS for many years.  Although being able to differentiate between these different causes may be important in identifying appropriate corrective measures, IRS\u2019 primary goal in conducting its compliance studies was to identify the level of overall EITC noncompliance.  Determining the causes of overpayments is more challenging and costly, especially determining whether an EITC claim is fraudulent, which requires knowing the difficult-to- prove intent behind the taxpayer\u2019s actions.", "IRS\u2019 reports on its two compliance studies did not discuss the extent to which EITC overclaims were due to mistakes versus fraud. However, as we discussed in a July 1998 report on IRS\u2019 first study, IRS examiners and case reviewers did make a determination of intent for almost every case involving an overclaim.  Based on those determinations, about one-half of the returns with an EITC overclaim and two-thirds of the total amount overclaimed were considered to be the result of intentional errors.  Because these assessments were judgmental and made without any specific criteria, they were considered too imprecise to be included in IRS\u2019 report.  However, as we said in 1998, the results did indicate that IRS\u2019 compliance efforts should include activities aimed at taxpayers who intentionally misclaim the EITC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Reduce EITC Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the level of EITC noncompliance, Congress and IRS have taken various steps to reduce it.  After the 1994 compliance study, Congress took the following steps:   According to law, an EITC is not to be allowed unless the tax return contains the EITC-qualifying-child\u2019s Social Security number (SSN) as well as the SSNs of the taxpayer and the taxpayer\u2019s spouse, if any.  Before 1997, if IRS identified a return with an invalid SSN, it had to resolve that issue through its normal audit procedures.  Because those procedures are resource intensive, IRS was not able to follow up on most of the invalid SSNs identified.  In 1995, for example, IRS stopped the refunds on about 3 million returns with invalid SSNs. However, IRS was only able to follow up with taxpayers on about 700,000 of those returns.  For the other 2.3 million returns, IRS released the refunds without any follow-up.  In 1996, Congress authorized IRS to treat invalid SSNs as \u201cmath errors,\u201d similar to the way that IRS had historically handled computational mistakes.  With that authority, IRS has been able to (1) automatically disallow any EITC claim associated with an invalid SSN and (2) make appropriate adjustments to any refund that the taxpayer might be claiming. collect SSNs of birth parents and provide IRS with information linking the parents\u2019 and child\u2019s SSNs.", "Congress began providing IRS with appropriated funds (about $143 million a year) for a 5-year EITC compliance initiative beginning in fiscal year 1998.", "As part of the 5-year compliance initiative and using the tools provided by Congress, IRS implemented a plan that calls for reducing EITC noncompliance through expanded customer service and public outreach, strengthened enforcement, and enhanced research.  In implementing its plan, IRS has taken several actions, with some significant results.  For example: In 1999 and 2000, IRS identified a total of about 3.4 million \u201cmath errors\u201d related to the EITC, about 24 percent of which involved invalid SSNs.According to IRS, it denied about $675 million in erroneous EITC claims during fiscal years 1999 and 2000 because of EITC-related \u201cmath errors.\u201d", "Other types of EITC noncompliance are not as easy to identify as invalid SSNs.  These types of noncompliance can be detected only through an in- depth review.  For the past few years, IRS has targeted for in-depth review certain types of EITC claims, such as those involving the use of a child\u2019s SSN on multiple returns for the same year, that IRS had identified as important sources of noncompliance.  Returns identified by IRS were to be audited to determine if the EITC claims were valid.  During fiscal years 1999 and 2000, according to IRS, it completed more than 500,000 of these audits and identified about $800 million in overclaims. about $435,000 for 143 of those preparers.  We do not know how, if at all, IRS\u2019 visits resulted in improved due diligence by preparers.  That question may be addressed in IRS\u2019 report on the results of its visits, which, according to IRS, will be issued about May 1.", "IRS implemented a program to enforce the recertification requirements of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.  According to IRS data, (1) about 312,000 taxpayers were required to recertify after being denied the EITC for tax year 1997 and (2) about 193,000 of those taxpayer did not claim the EITC on their tax year 1998 returns.  IRS sees these results as an indication that recertification has reduced the number of improper claims.", "IRS expanded its EITC outreach and educational efforts.  For example, it developed partnerships with groups that are advocates for low-income taxpayers and with businesses and large employers who include EITC information in monthly billings or employees\u2019 pay statements.  IRS also refocused its media campaign and publications toward educating the public about EITC eligibility requirements.", "IRS developed a database that can be used to help verify the accuracy of taxpayers\u2019 claimed dependents and EIC-qualifying children.  It incorporates data from an assortment of sources including the HHS and SSA information provided for in the 1997 Act.  According to IRS, the database is used to screen returns during processing for potential compliance issues and to select for pre-refund audits those with the highest potential.  Also, according to IRS, the returns being selected are primarily ones filed by EITC claimants.", "Despite these initiatives, it remains to be seen how, if at all, Congress\u2019 and IRS\u2019 efforts have succeeded in reducing the 31- percent EITC overclaim rate identified by IRS\u2019 tax year 1997 EITC compliance study.  IRS is doing a study of tax year 1999 returns and plans to study tax year 2001 returns.  The results of those studies, when compared to the results of the tax year 1997 study, should provide a basis for assessing the impact on overall EITC noncompliance.", "Although well-designed and effectively-implemented processes should help reduce EITC noncompliance, certain features of the EITC represent a trade-off between compliance and other desired goals.  Unlike income transfer programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Food Stamps, the EITC was designed to be administered through the tax system.  Accordingly, while other income transfer programs have staff who review documents and other evidence before judging applicants to be qualified to receive assistance, the EITC relies more directly on the self-reported qualifications of individuals.  This approach generally should result in lower administrative costs and possibly higher participation rates for the EITC than the other assistance programs. However, EITC noncompliance may also be higher.  This is especially true when eligibility depends on information that cannot be readily and rapidly verified by IRS as it processes tax returns. EITC eligibility, particularly related to qualifying children, is difficult for IRS to verify through its traditional enforcement procedures, such as matching return data to third-party information reports. Correctly applying the residency test, for example, often involves understanding complex living arrangements and child custody issues.  Thoroughly verifying qualifying child eligibility basically requires IRS to audit individual tax returns, as was done in the tax year 1994 compliance study\u2014a costly, time-consuming, and intrusive proposition. -   -   -   -   - I appreciate this opportunity to appear today to provide a basic description of the payroll taxes funding Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance and to discuss what is known about EITC noncompliance.
