GAO also found that the competition rate in fiscal year 2012 varied by specific DOD component with the Air Force having the lowest at 37.1 percent and the Defense Logistics Agency the highest at 83.3 percent. The majority of the noncompetitive awards cited the availability of only one responsible source to meet the government\u0092s needs as the reason for using noncompetitive procedures.", "A number of factors affect DOD\u0092s competition rate, but these factors are not always considered when setting DOD\u0092s annual competition goals. For example, reliance on an original equipment manufacturer throughout the life cycle of a program has been a long-standing challenge for DOD competition, and budget uncertainty can also hinder DOD\u0092s ability to compete. Noncompetitive purchases that DOD makes on behalf of foreign governments can also affect DOD\u0092s competition rate. DOD does not systematically consider these and other factors when setting its annual competition goals. For example, it sets competition goals for individual DOD components by simply adding two percentage points to the rate achieved in the previous year. Without identifying and tracking the specific factors affecting competition DOD cannot set meaningful goals for improving competition or accurately gauge its progress toward achieving them.", "Many of the noncompetitive justifications GAO reviewed included the required elements as defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation; however, the level of insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards varied. For example, some justifications included clear descriptions of market environments where only one source was available to meet the government\u0092s needs or described planned actions that could help improve competition in the future. However, other justifications provided limited insight into the reasons for the noncompetitive award or did not fully describe actions that the agency could take to increase future competition. Without this information, DOD may be missing opportunities to gain a fuller understanding of why past acquisitions were not competitive and may be unable to apply those lessons to effectively facilitate competition for future acquisitions.", "In 2010, DOD introduced a new requirement that applies to competitive awards that elicit only one offer (one-offer awards); however, the impact of the requirement is unknown because of unreliable data. To address the risk associated with one-offer awards, the requirement established rules that were intended to help ensure adequate solicitation time, ensure that contract requirements are not unnecessarily restrictive, and verify that offers received are fair and reasonable. However, GAO\u0092s analysis of 35 one-offer awards determined that contracting officers had incorrectly coded 10 of these awards in the procurement database that DOD relies on to measure the impact of its new requirement. Six of the 10 awards were noncompetitive awards and the remaining 4 had received multiple offers. As a result, GAO determined that DOD\u0092s data cannot be used to accurately calculate the amount obligated on one-offer awards during fiscal year 2012.

In fiscal year 2012, the  Department of Defense (DOD) obligated $359 billion through contracts  and task orders, of which 57 percent was competed.

Generally, noncompetitive contracts must be  supported by written justifications and approvals (justifications) that  address the specific exception to full and open competition that is being  applied to the procurement.

The conference report for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 directed us to report annually for  the next three years on DOD\u2019s noncompetitive awards and competitive  awards based on receipt of only one offer. Accordingly, we examined (1)  the trends in DOD\u2019s use of noncompetitive awards; (2) the factors  affecting DOD\u2019s competition rate; (3) the extent to which justifications for  exceptions to competitive procedures provided insight into the reasons for  noncompetitive awards; and (4) the impact of DOD\u2019s new requirement on  contracts awarded using competitive procedures but for which only one- offer was received.", "To identify trends in DOD\u2019s use of noncompetitive awards, we used the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to  identify DOD obligations under competitive and noncompetitive contracts  in fiscal years 2008 through 2012. For the purposes of this report, we  defined noncompetitive obligations to include obligations through  contracts that were awarded using the exceptions to full and open  competition listed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3,  orders issued under multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity  (IDIQ) contracts under the exceptions to the fair opportunity process in  section 16.505(b) of the FAR, or under limited sources provisions for  orders issued under the General Service Administration\u2019s (GSA)  schedules program in section 8.405-6 of the FAR. We also used FPDS- NG data to identify the specific exceptions to full and open competition  that were cited for noncompetitive awards in fiscal year 2012. We  calculated the competition rate as the dollars obligated annually on  competitive contracts and orders as a percentage of dollars obligated on  all contracts and orders. For the purposes of this report, we divided DOD  into five components: Air Force, Army, the Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA), Navy, and other defense agencies.", "To understand the factors affecting DOD\u2019s competition rate, we used  FPDS-NG data to examine obligations for new awards and foreign  military sale awards to understand the impact on the competition rate  across DOD and within each component included in our review. We also  spoke with component competition advocates and other DOD officials to  understand how DOD calculates its competition rate and how various  factors may impact it.", "To assess the extent to which justifications for exceptions to competitive  procedures provided insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards,  we randomly selected a nongeneralizable sample of 56 contracts and  orders coded as noncompetitive in FPDS-NG. Our sample included the  largest noncompetitive contracts and task orders, measured by  obligations, as well as a random selection of awards across DOD. For  awards in our sample, we reviewed documentation in the contract files  such as the signed justification and approval memorandum, the  acquisition plan, documentation of market research, the price negotiation  memorandum, and other key information. We reviewed the justifications  for these awards to determine whether they met criteria in the FAR for the  contents, timing, approval, and whether they were made publicly  available. In particular, we assessed whether the justifications contained  sufficient information to justify the use of the specific authority cited as  required by the FAR. In addition, we conducted e-mail and telephone  follow-up with contracting and program officials involved in these awards  to obtain additional information as needed.", "To examine the impact of DOD\u2019s new requirement on contracts awarded  using competitive procedures but for which only one-offer was received,  we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 25 contracts and task orders.  The sample included the 25 largest awards, measured by obligations,  made between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2012. Only awards for which  one offer was received in response to a solicitation issued using  competitive procedures, as coded in FPDS-NG, were included in the  sample. For each selected award, we obtained evidence of the solicitation  issuance and response due date, price negotiation memorandum, and  other key information. If necessary, we contacted contracting and  program officials to obtain additional information. We also reviewed  FPDS-NG data to determine if there had been a decline in the number of  contract awards for which only one offer had been received in response  to the competitive solicitation.

The Competition in  Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984 requires agencies to obtain full and open  competition through the use of competitive procedures in their  procurement activities unless otherwise authorized by law. Using  competitive procedures to award contracts means that all prospective  contractors that meet certain criteria are permitted to submit proposals.  Agencies generally are required to perform acquisition planning and  conduct market research to promote full and open competition.", "While CICA generally requires federal agencies to award contracts using  full and open competition, agencies are allowed to award contracts  noncompetitively under certain circumstances. Generally, these awards  must be supported by written justifications that address the specific  exception to full and open competition that is being used in the  procurement. In addition, federal agencies can establish IDIQ contracts  with one or more contractors and may issue orders under these contracts.  For multiple award IDIQ contracts, agencies are generally required to  provide all contractors on the IDIQ contract a fair opportunity to be  considered for each order above certain dollar thresholds; however,  agencies can award noncompetitive orders under a process called an  exception to the fair opportunity process\u2014which must be supported with  a documented justification. Also, GSA administers IDIQ contracts with  vendors for commercially available goods and services, and federal  agencies place orders under the contracts. When doing so  noncompetitively, procuring agencies must justify the need to restrict the  number of vendors considered, known as a limited sources justification  and approval. Finally, agencies can also competitively award contracts  after limiting the pool of available contractors\u2014a process called full and  open competition after exclusion of sources. For example, agencies are  required to set aside procurements for small businesses if there is a  reasonable expectation that two or more responsible small businesses  will compete for the work and will offer fair market prices.", "The justifications are to provide sufficient facts and rationale to justify the  use of the specific exception to competition. For example, under FAR part  6, justifications must include, at a minimum, 12 elements.these required elements include: a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency\u2019s  needs and their estimated value;  identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and  open competition; a determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to  the government will be fair and reasonable; a description of market research conducted, if any; and a statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or  overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent  acquisitions for the supplies or services required.", "Examples of allowable exceptions to full and open competition include  circumstances when the contractor is the only source capable of  performing the requirement or when an agency\u2019s need is of such unusual  and compelling urgency that the government would be seriously injured  unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources. The FAR  generally requires that justifications be published on the Federal Business  Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov) website and be approved at various  levels within the contracting organization. These levels vary according to  the dollar value of the procurement (see table 1).", "Justifications can be made on an individual or class basis; a class  justification generally covers programs or sets of programs and has a  dollar limit and time period for all actions taken under the authority. Each  justification, individual or class, must be approved through the same  process. Once a class justification has been approved, award of an  individual contract can generally be approved for sole-source award by  the local procuring activity, as long as the amount is within the scope of  the class justification.", "Contracts that are awarded using competitive procedures but for which  only one offer is received (one-offer awards) recently have gained  attention as an area of concern. OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement  Policy noted that competitions that yield only one offer in response to a  solicitation deprive agencies of the ability to consider alternative solutions  in a reasoned and structured manner. In DOD\u2019s September 2010 Better  Buying Power initiative memorandum, competitive procurements for  which only one offer to a solicitation was received even when publicized  under full and open competition are termed \u201cineffective competition.\u201d In  November 2010, DOD introduced a new policy containing two new  requirements concerning competitive one-offer awards. In June 2012,  DOD codified the policy in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement (DFARS) adding a third requirement as follows: If a solicitation allowed for fewer than 30 days and only one offer is  received, then the contracting officer shall: 1.  consult with the requiring activity as to whether the requirements  document should be revised in order to promote more  competition, and  2.  resolicit for an additional period of at least 30 days.", "If a solicitation allowed for at least 30 days and only one offer is  received, the contracting officer shall determine through cost or price  analysis whether the offered price is fair and reasonable and that  adequate price competition exists or if cost and price data have not  been waived obtain necessary cost and pricing data and enter into  negotiations with the offeror to establish a fair and reasonable price.", "DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative also outlines a series of actions and  directives to achieve greater efficiencies in part through the promotion of  competition, such as: presenting a competitive strategy at each program milestone for  removing obstacles to competition; and establishing rules for the acquisition of technical data rights.", "The Better Buying Power initiative increased the role of the DOD  competition advocates by directing them to develop a plan to improve the  overall rate of competition for each component by at least 2 percent per  year, and the rate of effective competition\u2014when more than one offer is  received under a competitive solicitation\u2014by at least 10 percent per year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Competition Rate Continues to Decline", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s overall competition rate has declined over the past five years, and  the competition rate differs among the specific DOD components.

For  example, reliance on an original equipment manufacturer throughout the  life cycle of a program and budget uncertainty are long-standing  challenges impacting DOD\u2019s ability to compete. Noncompetitive  purchases that DOD makes on behalf of foreign governments affect  DOD\u2019s competition rate as well. DOD does not systematically identify,  track, and consider the specific factors that are affecting competition  when setting its annual competition goals.", "A long-standing factor impacting DOD\u2019s competition rate is its reliance on  an original equipment manufacturer throughout the life cycle of a program  because of a previous decision not to purchase proprietary technical data.  Technical data is recorded information used to define a design and to   Prior GAO work has  produce, support, maintain or operate an item.noted that technical data can help control costs and maintain flexibility.Without the technical data rights, it can be difficult to compete a new  award, because another vendor would need the technical data in order to  meet the government\u2019s needs. DOD has recognized the ownership of  technical data as a challenge and is addressing this through its Better  Buying Power initiative. DOD now requires program officials to present a  business case analysis prior to the official start of the program that  outlines an approach for purchasing technical data. For example, this  business case analysis is intended to ensure consideration of competition  throughout a weapon system\u2019s life cycle. The Better Buying Power  initiative also added a new requirement that a competitive strategy be  presented at each milestone for defense acquisition programs. These  strategies may include identifying work currently performed by  subcontractors and competing it separately. At the component level, a  DOD official told us that they have begun to examine sole-source  acquisitions to determine what pieces can be \u201cbroken out\u201d from a  noncompetitive requirement and competed separately. For example, a  Navy surveillance system program identified an opportunity to break out  commercial components. They noted that this resulted in lower pricing  and a larger, more stable supplier base. While these initiatives are  intended to reduce the use of noncompetitive procurements, the effect of  this Better Buying Power initiative may not be felt for several years.", "A more recent factor affecting DOD is budget uncertainty. GAO has  previously reported on the impact of uncertain budget environments on  agencies\u2019 ability to plan.often delay new awards until later in the fiscal year because program  offices do not know if they will receive funding for a new award. Also, with  uncertain budgets, program offices may struggle to adequately plan for  future procurements. For example, one official told us his program  planned to compete a new award to replace aging equipment. However,  due to budget issues, the program office may have to abandon  competition plans for new equipment and continue with a noncompetitive  award to maintain the existing equipment.", "DOD officials told us that continuing resolutions  Another factor that impacts DOD\u2019s competition rate is the amount of  noncompetitive foreign military sales (FMS). FMS awards are government  to government sales of defense articles or defense services, from DOD  stocks or through new procurements under DOD-managed contracts,  regardless of the source of financing. FMS awards may provide a  benefit to DOD. For example, when an FMS award is in addition to  products or services that DOD is already purchasing, it may help DOD to  obtain a lower price with a vendor which can result in a better value for  the government.", "FMS awards are generally noncompetitive and are included in DOD\u2019s  competition rate calculation. In fiscal year 2012, one-fifth of DOD\u2019s  obligations on new, noncompetitive awards were for FMS. A DOD  component competition advocate explained that to the extent a  component has noncompetitive FMS obligations in a fiscal year it will  lower the competition rates. We analyzed FPDS-NG data for fiscal year  2012 to determine the impact of FMS on component competition rates  and noted a negative impact across DOD, with the Air Force being  affected the most. Using DOD\u2019s method for calculating the competition  rate by measuring all contract obligations, we noted an 8 percentage  point increase in the Air Force competition rate by removing FMS awards  from the calculation. An even greater improvement is indicated when  calculating competition for new awards only. For example, we found that  the Air Force\u2019s competition rate for new awards improves from 34.8  percent to 49.8 percent when FMS are removed from the calculation,  almost a 15 percentage point increase (see figure 5).", "DOD does not currently consider the impact of these or other factors that  affect the competition rate when establishing competition goals for each  fiscal year. For example, DOD officials explained that a major  noncompetitive weapon system contract award, such as the Joint Strike  Fighter or an aircraft carrier, would have a significant impact on the  component\u2019s competition rate. Currently, DOD sets component  competition goals by increasing the prior fiscal year\u2019s achieved  competition rate, as measured by all contract obligations, by 2 percentage  points. However, a component competition advocate told us that this  results in goals that are not as meaningful as they could be because they  do not address nor account for the specific factors a particular component  is facing. For example, in its fiscal year 2011 competition report, the Air  Force noted that it expected a significant impact to its fiscal year 2012  competition rate as the result of an anticipated $10 billion FMS award.  DOD officials told us that individual components have an opportunity to  discuss and raise concerns about the competition goals with the Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy officials who set the annual  competition goals. For example, DOD officials noted that the Army raised  concerns about the proposed monetary competition goal for fiscal year  2013 and noted that declining budgets would impact its ability to meet the  goal.

Our sample included 12 class  justifications for awards ranging from $266,000 to $2.6 billion. The  period of actions covered by these justifications ranged from 8 months  to 9 years, and 3 contracts in our sample had justifications that were  prepared 5 or 6 years prior to award. We identified that contracting  officials have different methods for documenting that contract actions  are within the scope of the class justifications. In some instances,  officials told us that although there was no explicit documentation of a  scope determination, this determination was documented by multiple  references to the class justification in other contract file documents,  such as the pre-business clearance memorandum.", "DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative guidance emphasizes the  importance of removing obstacles from competition. Most noncompetitive  awards are required to be supported by written justifications that among  other things document the actions an agency may take to overcome such  barriers to competition. Some of the justifications that we reviewed  provided limited insight into the reasons for the noncompetitive award or  did not fully describe actions that the agency could take to bring about  competitive awards in future acquisitions of the same goods or services.  Without this information, DOD may be missing opportunities to learn why  past acquisitions were not competitive and to employ that knowledge to  help remove obstacles to competition in future acquisitions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Impact of DOD\u2019S One- Offer Requirement Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s one-offer requirement is intended to reduce the number of  contracts awarded using competitive procedures but for which only one  offer is received.

Based on our review of  one-offer awards, we determined that the awards generally complied with  the new requirement; however, some awards did not comply with the  resolicitation rule.

Specifically, in the  case of two contract awards, contracting officials simply did not resolicit  after receiving just one offer during the initial solicitation period; in the  case of three contract awards, agency officials resolicited for a period  shorter than the required 30 days. Our analysis did not consider whether  the awards complied with the program office consultation rule because  the rule was not implemented until June 2012 and did not apply to the  awards in our sample. In addition to our review, the DOD Inspector  General performed a similar compliance review on 78 one-offer awards  from fiscal year 2011. The review found that 15 awards did not comply  with the cost/price analysis rule and 23 did not comply with the  resolicitation rule.", "The new one-offer requirement may result in lower prices and more  accurate cost information when only one offer is received. For example,  during our review of one-offer awards, we identified a proposal that  initially requested a 10 percent profit rate. Cost and price analyses  determined that the rate was unreasonable, and subsequent negotiations  resulted in a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the profit rate. In addition,  as a result of the analyses, the government identified a discrepancy in the  offeror\u2019s cost data that further reduced the price.", "Officials at multiple DOD components told us that, since the  implementation of the new requirement, more contracting officers allow at  least 30 days for responses in order to avoid the resolicitation and  program office consultation rules. Specifically, as illustrated in figure 6, if  a solicitation allows 30 or more days for responses, the contracting officer  is required to follow only one of the three rules established in the new  requirement. Senior DOD officials said that allowing for 30 days is a  positive outcome of the requirement. In the past, some solicitations  allowed less than a week for responses, potentially discouraging  contractors from submitting offers. According to the officials, the new  requirement incentivizes contracting officers to keep solicitations open for  at least 30 days, while still allowing the flexibility for fewer than 30 days  when multiple offers are likely\u2014for example, routine procurements that  consistently elicit multiple offers.", "FAR \u00a7 5.203(c). standing practice to advertise for 30 or more days.

The agency obligated $14.7 billion on new one-offer awards in  fiscal year 2012, representing 13.8 percent of all new contract obligations  during the period. Our analysis of 35 one-offer awards determined that 10  of these awards were incorrectly coded in FDPS-NG by contracting  officers. As a result, we determined that DOD\u2019s data were unreliable for  certain analyses.

The remaining 4 awards received  multiple offers, but the contracting officer incorrectly coded them as  receiving one offer.

For example, while foreign military sales accounted for about a fifth of  new, noncompetitive obligations in fiscal year 2012, DOD\u2019s current  calculations do not consider their impact on its competition rates. We  found the Air Force competition rate for new awards increased by 15  percentage points in fiscal year 2012, when foreign military sales were  removed from the calculations. DOD does not systematically identify,  track, and consider the specific factors that may be affecting competition  when setting its annual competition goals. Lacking a set of measures that  provide meaningful insight into the specific factors that drive competition  rates, it is difficult for DOD to accurately gauge the relative effectiveness  of its multifaceted efforts to enhance competition. Without this information  it is also more difficult for DOD to chart a path to improved competition  that offers a greater likelihood of success and to make the necessary  course corrections along the way.", "While the justifications and approvals for noncompetitive awards that we  reviewed generally met FAR requirements, they varied in the level of  insight that they provided into the reasons for noncompetitive awards.

Others provided little information about the market research  findings that helped justify the decision to pursue a noncompetitive award.  Without this information, DOD may be missing opportunities to gain a  richer understanding of why past acquisitions were not competitive and to  apply those lessons to effectively facilitate competition for future  acquisitions.", "Lastly, due to unreliable data in FPDS-NG, DOD\u2019s ability to measure the  effectiveness of its new one-offer requirement is limited.

We  examined the competition rate at the DOD level and at each component  from fiscal year 2008 through 2012. For fiscal year 2012, we analyzed the  competition rate for products, non-research and development (R&D)  services, and R&D services.

We excluded from our sample:  contracts and orders under the simplified acquisition threshold of  $150,000; noncompetitive orders that were not submitted under multiple award  indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, because these  orders would not require a justification since the decision not to  compete was made and presumably justified when the base IDIQ  contract was awarded to one contractor; noncompetitive contracts and orders justified under the 8(a) program  because we recently reported on challenges implementing new  requirements for these types of justifications; noncompetitive contracts that do not require a justification, including  awards not competed under simplified acquisition procedures, justified  under the \u201cinternational agreement\u201d exception or certain contracts  awarded under the \u201cauthorized or required by statute\u201d exception.", "We initially selected 75 contracts and orders, including: the five largest  contracts from the Air Force, Army, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA),  Navy, and other defense agencies; the two largest orders from each of  these components; and eight randomly selected contracts and orders  from each component.
