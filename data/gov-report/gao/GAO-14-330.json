GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, FAA documents, and interviewed officials from FAA, NTSB, pilot associations, and 20 aviation medical experts primarily identified by the National Academies' Institute of Medicine. Experts were selected based on their type and depth of experience, including recognition in the aerospace-medicine professional community. GAO also interviewed FAA's medical certification division and evaluated the usability of FAA's online application system and the clarity of its application form against federal writing guidelines and best practices in website usability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Aerospace medical experts GAO interviewed generally agreed that the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) medical standards are appropriate and supported FAA's recent data-driven efforts to improve its pilot medical-certification process. Each year, about 400,000 candidates apply for a pilot's medical certificate and complete a medical exam to determine whether they meet FAA's medical standards. From 2008 through 2012, on average, about 90 percent of applicants have been medically certified by an FAA-designated aviation medical examiner (AME) at the time of their medical exam or by a Regional Flight Surgeon. Of the remaining applicants, about 8.5 percent have received a special issuance medical certificate (special issuance) after providing additional medical information to FAA. Approximately 1.2 percent were not medically certified to fly. According to an industry association, the special issuance process adds time and costs to the application process, in part, because applicants might not understand what additional medical information they need to provide to FAA. Officials from FAA's medical certification division have said that technological problems with the aging computer systems that support the medical certification process have contributed to delays in the special issuance process. FAA's medical certification division has identified about 50 potential technological enhancements to its internal computer systems that support the medical certification process, of which about 20 have been identified as high priority, but the division has not yet implemented them or developed a timeline to do so. By developing a timeline to implement the highest-priority enhancements, FAA would take another step toward expediting the certification process for many applicants hoping to obtain a special issuance. FAA recently established a datadriven process using historic medical and accident data that authorizes AMEs to certify a greater number of applicants with medical conditions who had previously required a special issuance. Officials expect this effort to allow more applicants to be certified at the time of their AME visit and to free resources at FAA to focus on applicants with higher-risk medical conditions.", "GAO's analysis and medical experts' opinions indicate that FAA could improve its communication with applicants by making its online application system--part of FAA's internal computer systems discussed above--more user-friendly and improving the clarity of the medical application form. Specifically, GAO found that the online application system requires applicants to scroll through a lengthy terms-of-service agreement and does not provide clear instructions, and that the application form contained unclear questions and terms that could be misinterpreted by the applicant. FAA could enhance its online application system by using links to improve navigability of the system and providing information that is more useful to applicants--for example, links to information about the risk that specific medical conditions pose to flight safety and any additional medical information applicants with those conditions would need to provide to FAA. FAA could also improve the clarity of its medical application form by incorporating guidelines established in FAA's Writing Standards, including shorter sentences and paragraphs, active voice, and clear terms and questions. These clarifications could not only aid an applicant's understanding of the medical standards and requirements, but also may result in more accurate and complete information provided by applicants to better inform FAA's certification decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FAA (1) develop a timeline for implementing high-priority technological improvements to the internal computer systems that support the medical certification process, and (2) enhance the online medical-application system by clarifying instructions and questions on the form and providing useful information.

By ensuring that applicants meet  medical standards, FAA aims to reduce the likelihood of incapacitation of  a pilot due to a medical cause.", "Federal regulations establish three classes of medical certification that  correspond to the types of operations that pilots perform. Airline transport  pilots who serve as pilots in command of scheduled air-carrier operations  must hold first-class medical certificates. Pilots who fly for compensation  or hire generally hold second-class medical certificates. Private pilots hold  third-class medical certificates. (See table 1.) Depending on their age and  the class of medical certificate sought, pilots must renew their medical  certificate periodically, from every 6 months to every 5 years (e.g.,  commercial pilots\u2014generally those needing first- or second-class medical  certificate\u2014must have their medical certificate updated more frequently  than private pilots). After obtaining a medical certificate, and between  renewal periods, pilots are prohibited from performing pilot operations  when they know or have reason to know of a medical deficiency that  would make them unable to fulfill their pilot operation.", "In the fiscal year 2014 budget submission, FAA estimated that its Office  of Aerospace Medicine would need about $56.1 million in funding\u2014about  4.7 percent of the total Aviation Safety budget\u2014to carry out its mission.  To assist in the nearly 400,000 medical evaluations of pilots and new  applicants each year, FAA designates medical certification authority to  approximately 3,300 private physicians, or Aviation Medical Examiners  (AMEs). The AMEs review applicants\u2019 medical histories and perform  physical examinations to ensure that applicants meet FAA\u2019s medical  standards and are medically fit to operate an aircraft at the time of their  medical exam. Although AMEs are not FAA employees, they are trained  in aviation medicine by the FAA and entrusted to make medical eligibility  determinations for the majority of applicants, on behalf of the FAA. In  order to become an AME and be authorized to administer medical exams,  FAA requires AMEs to complete online courses in clinical aerospace  physiology and medical certification standards and procedures before  attending a one-week basic AME seminar. AMEs must also complete at  least 10 pilot medical exams each year and a subsequent refresher  courses every 3 years.", "All applicants for medical certificates and renewals follow a similar  process. Applicants begin the medical certification process by completing  Form 8500-8, Application for Airman Medical Certificate or Airman  Medical & Student Pilot Certificate (medical application form) in  MedXPress (online application system). For applicants with disqualifying  medical conditions or for those who do not meet FAA\u2019s medical  standards, the AME must defer the applicant to FAA to authorize a  special issuance. The special issuance process may require additional  medical information and evaluations from, for example, a primary care  physician or medical specialist. Also, a special issuance may be subject  to operational limitations for safety reasons, or may be valid for a shorter  time period than an unrestricted medical certificate.

FAA\u2019s current medical standards have been  codified in federal regulation since March 19, 1996. The regulations set  out 15 medical conditions that are specifically disqualifying. Medical  conditions identified during an evaluation that are not specifically listed as  disqualifying but do not meet the general medical standard regarding safe  performance of duties and exercise of privileges, are also disqualifying  under general medical standards, according to FAA. (See app. II for a  summary of selected FAA medical standards.) According to FAA officials,  the standards and the medical certification process were developed to  manage the risk of an aircraft accident or incident by identifying  applicants with medical conditions that could potentially incapacitate them  in the flight environment or during critical take-off and landing periods.", "FAA takes steps designed to ensure that its medical policies and  procedures are consistent with current medical and aeromedical practice,  and that these steps result in periodic updates to its medical policies. The  Federal Air Surgeon establishes medical policies and medical certification  procedures that are published in internal guidance for FAA\u2019s Office of  Aerospace Medicine and for AMEs in the Guide for Aviation Medical  Examiners (AME Guide). The agency uses several techniques to update  policies:", "First, the Aeromedical Standards and Policies Branch develops policy  recommendations for the Federal Air Surgeon, which address medical  conditions, medication use, and medical procedures. According to  FAA officials, medical policy review is a continuous process  influenced by several factors, which include (1) announcements of  significant new developments in the medical literature; (2) medical  appeals to the Federal Air Surgeon; (3) announcements and alerts by  the Food and Drug Administration; (4) inquiries by aviation  stakeholder groups and pilot advocacy groups; (5) aircraft accidents  or events; (6) inquiries by the Office of Aerospace Medicine personnel  and AMEs; and (7) communications with international aviation  authorities, and medical advocacy groups, among other things.", "Second, according to FAA officials, the agency refers dozens of  individual cases annually for independent review by experts in a wide  variety of medical specialties, such as cardiology, psychology, and  neuropsychology. FAA officials stated that implicit to the process of  reviewing each case is to consider changes to current policy based on  current medical practice. FAA also periodically uses independent  medical experts to evaluate its medical policies, particularly with  regard to cardiovascular conditions, which were present in more than  one-third of the applicants who received special issuances in 2012. In  January 2013, for example, FAA hosted a cardiology roundtable to  review FAA\u2019s policies with regard to cardiovascular conditions and to  suggest updates to the policies, if necessary. The roundtable\u2019s  suggested policy changes were presented to the Federal Air Surgeon,  who approved several of them. However, FAA officials have said that  they do not convene such roundtables frequently due to time and cost  constraints.", "Third, the results of CAMI\u2019s aerospace medical and human factors  research have been used to inform changes to FAA guidance and  policies. In particular, CAMI\u2019s aerospace medical research focuses on  the biomedical aspects of flight, including studies on aviation safety  associated with biomedical, pharmacological, and toxicological issues.  For example, CAMI\u2019s research on sedating medication influenced  guidance in this area. According to FAA officials, a review of accident  investigation data showed that many pilots involved in accidents were  using over the counter and prescription sedative medications. As a  result, FAA, in coordination with the aviation industry, issued guidance  extending the length of time a pilot should wait after using these  medications and before operating an aircraft. A letter jointly signed by  the FAA and all major aviation advocacy groups was sent to all pilots  and published on the FAA website and in various public and private  publications advising pilots to comply with the new guidance.", "Fourth, CAMI\u2019s library allows research staff to collect and review  academic journals on aviation medical issues, general medical  research, engineering, management, and other general topics. CAMI  researchers have also published approximately 1200 aerospace  medicine technical reports on topics including, for example, pilot age,  alcohol and substance abuse, fatigue, psychology, and vision.  FAA\u2019s policy branch periodically reviews this and other medical  literature, which FAA officials say can also result in a possible  revision. http://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/.", "In addition, FAA has recently begun analyzing aviation accident  information to develop a predictive model based on historic data of  medical conditions that have been identified as contributing factors to  aircraft accidents. The officials stated that they plan to use the model as a  data-driven guide to help inform how they determine the relative risk of  various medical conditions.

In addition, although some of the experts (7  of 20) suggested no changes to FAA\u2019s policies, many of the experts (13  of 20) identified at least one medical standard for which they considered  FAA\u2019s policies to be either too restrictive or too permissive. A restrictive  policy might lead FAA to deny certification to an applicant who may be  sufficiently healthy to safely fly a plane, or may result in FAA requiring a  more thorough medical evaluation than the experts considered  necessary. A permissive policy, on the other hand, might lead FAA to  certify an applicant with health issues that could impair his or her ability to  safely fly a plane, or may result in FAA not completing as thorough a  medical evaluation as the experts considered necessary.", "Although expert opinions varied regarding which standards were too  permissive or restrictive, neurological issues were most commonly  discussed by some (9 of 20) of the experts.noted that the FAA medical certification requirements for applicants who  use antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRI), are restrictive and onerous and may require an applicant not to fly  for an extended period of time. A medical representative from the Aircraft  Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) said that FAA\u2019s policies may  require a pilot using antidepressants to undergo costly cognitive studies  that were viewed as medically unnecessary for milder cases of  depression.", "For example, some experts  Alternately, some medical experts said that policies regarding cognitive  functioning in aging pilots, traumatic head or brain injuries, and attention  deficit disorders may be too permissive. An FAA official stated that the  area of neurology is complex and has been somewhat difficult for AMCD  due, in part, to variation in opinion as to how to assess cognitive function  and when testing should be done. The agency hosted a neurology  summit in 2010 that convened neurology experts to review FAA policies  on neurological issues\u2014including traumatic brain injury, migraine  headaches, and neurocognitive testing\u2014and resulted in  recommendations that the Federal Air Surgeon adopted regarding  migraine treatments, among other neurological conditions. Also, the  Division Manager of AMCD said that they consult with neurologists, as  needed, to review the application of certification policies regarding  individual applicant cases.", "To a lesser extent, some (5 of 20) experts had mixed views on the  policies for diabetes and medical conditions related to endocrine function.  Of those, three experts thought that FAA\u2019s current policies on diabetes  might be too restrictive, for example, because the FAA has not kept pace  with medical advances and treatment options currently available to pilots.  One expert noted that some commercial pilots with insulin treated  diabetes mellitus (ITDM) may be medically fit to fly a plane with a special  issuance if they can demonstrate that their condition is stable, just as  private pilots are allowed to do. In addition, representatives from the  American Diabetes Association and a member of the Regional Airline  Association stated that FAA\u2019s policies for commercial pilots with ITDM  have not kept current, when considering the advancements in medical  treatment of ITDM and the redundancy of having a copilot and crew in  commercial aircraft to reduce the risk associated with commercial pilots  with ITDM. Conversely, two experts thought that FAA may be too  permissive with regard to diabetes, citing, for example, concerns about  the increase in diabetes among Americans, in general, and the potential  for undiagnosed cases. FAA officials agreed that there have been  improvements in the clinical care for diabetes and the Office of Aerospace  Medicine has studied the safety and efficacy of new diabetes treatment  over the past several years, including the risks associated with new  medications and insulin formulations. However, according to FAA  officials, independent consultants\u2014including endocrinologists and  diabetes experts\u2014have told the FAA that the risk of incapacitation related  to hypoglycemia has not changed regardless of advancements in  treatment.", "All of the experts suggested ways FAA could ensure its medical  standards are current, many of which were consistent with approaches  FAA is already taking. For example, some of the experts (9 of 20) said  FAA could review its medical standards at regular time intervals or as  medical advances occur, and some (8 of 20) of the experts said FAA  could review its medical standards based on evidence of the likelihood of  each condition causing an accident. Some experts (5 of 20) specifically  suggested FAA should convene a panel on neurology and mental health  issues.

As part of this  approach, FAA implemented the Conditions an AME Can Issue, or CACI,  program in April 2013. The CACI program authorizes AMEs to issue  medical certificates to applicants with relatively low risk medical  conditions that had previously required a special issuance from the  FAA. FAA developed the program by identifying medical conditions that,  in most cases, did not pose a safety risk, based on FAA analysis of  historic medical and accident data. Agency officials expect the program to  allow more applicants to be certified at the time of their AME visit while  freeing resources at FAA to focus on medically complex applicants with  multiple conditions or medical conditions that may pose a greater risk to  flight safety, such as applicants who have had coronary artery bypass  surgery.", "Based on information provided by FAA, as of December, 31, 2011,  approximately 19 percent of all pilots reported medical conditions that  may now be evaluated by their AME as a result of the CACI program. Of  those pilots, about one-third\u2014or nearly 39,000 pilots\u2014reported no  additional medical conditions, making it more likely that in the future, they  may be certified at the time of their AME visit, rather than through the  special issuance process. Other medical conditions have been proposed for the CACI program but have not yet been approved by FAA officials. Most medical experts (18 of 20) we interviewed approved of the CACI  program, and some (8 of 20) believed that FAA should continue to  expand it to include additional medical conditions. Representatives of an  industry association agreed and noted that by authorizing AMEs to make  a greater number of medical certification decisions, AMCD officials could  speed up the application process for more applicants.", "Medical conditions that were proposed but not yet approved for CACI, include, for  example: carotid stenosis, bladder cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma.", "FAA authorization for a special issuance that they believe should be  considered under the CACI program. Their suggestions included, for  example, non-insulin-treated diabetes, which was a factor in about 17  percent of the special issuances in 2012; sleep apnea and other sleep  disorders, which were a factor in about 11 percent of the special  issuances in 2012; and various forms of cancer, which were a factor in  about 10 percent of special issuances in 2012. FAA officials have begun  to allow AMEs to make medical determinations for applicants with certain  types of cancer under the CACI program and have said that they will  evaluate other medical conditions to include in the CACI program in the  future.", "Although neurological conditions (including migraines, head trauma,  stroke, and seizures) accounted for approximately 4 percent of special  issuances in 2012, some experts (5 of 20) thought, as mentioned above,  that FAA should convene an expert panel to re-evaluate its policies in this  area. Half of the experts we interviewed also said that FAA could evaluate  its medical standards based on the relative risk of incapacitation  associated with various medical conditions, assessed through greater use  of data. That is, with a better understanding of the likelihood of each  medical condition to cause a suddenly incapacitating event in flight\u2014 based on historic data of accidents and incidents\u2014FAA could modify its  risk threshold for various medical standards and policies to manage risk.", "As previously mentioned, FAA has begun to collect and analyze data that  will help it develop a proactive approach to managing aviation medical  risk; however, FAA officials told us that data from historic accidents and  incidents can be difficult to obtain and link to medical causes. The officials  also said that they would need to change how they code, or classify, the  medical information they collect\u2014and re-code medical information they  already have\u2014to more accurately classify medical conditions of  applicants and, therefore, improve the reliability of their predictive model.  Without more granular data collection on health conditions, officials said it  is difficult for FAA to accurately determine the level of risk, associated  with various medical conditions. In addition, officials at FAA and NTSB  noted that data on medical causes of accidents and incidents are likely to  be incomplete because not all accidents are investigated in the same way  and medical causation can be difficult to prove in light of other  contributing factors. For example, an official from NTSB explained that  there are different levels of medical investigations performed after  accidents, depending on factors like whether or not the pilot has survived,  the condition of the aircraft or severity of the crash, and the number of  people impacted. As of February 14, 2013, NTSB and FAA agreed to a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) that will facilitate NTSB\u2019s data  sharing and record matching for aircraft accidents and incidents with  CAMI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Identified Technical Solutions to Improve Its Medical Certification Systems, but Has Not Set Time Frames for Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Although most medical certification determinations are made by one of  the approximately 3,300 FAA-designated AMEs at the time of an  applicant\u2019s medical exam, approximately 10 percent of applications\u2014or  nearly 40,000 annually\u2014are deferred to FAA for further medical  evaluation if the applicant does not meet FAA\u2019s medical standards or has  a disqualifying medical condition. According to FAA officials, the 10  percent of applicants who are deferred requires a significant amount of  resources from FAA\u2019s medical certification division, which in recent years,  has experienced a backlog of special issuance applications in need of  review. As of February 2014, an FAA official estimated this backlog at  about 17,500 applications.", "FAA has not met its internal goals for responding to individuals whose  applications have been deferred. Specifically, FAA has set an internal  goal of 30 working days to make a medical determination or to respond to  an applicant with a request for further information.

If FAA makes multiple requests for  further information from an applicant, the special issuance process can  take several months or longer.", "Officials from AOPA stated that some applicants for private pilot medical  certificates discontinue the application process after an initial denial from  the FAA because the applicants decide that the cost of extra medical  evaluations and added time is too great to support what the applicant  views as a recreational activity.that delays can also occur as a result of applicants who may take a long  time to respond to an FAA request for further evaluation. According to  AOPA, having information upfront would speed up the process by helping  applicants understand FAA\u2019s additional medical requirements for a  special issuance. FAA has increasingly encouraged its Regional Flight  Surgeons to become more actively involved in making medical  determinations for applicants seeking a special issuance.", "However, an official from FAA noted  FAA officials at AMCD stated that there are several reasons for the  increased processing time for applicants requiring special issuances. For  example, AMCD has faced a technical issue deploying the Document  Imaging Workflow System (DIWS), a web-based computer system used  by AMCD to process, prioritize, and track all medical certification  applications. One AMCD official noted that delays in deployment of the  system have decreased productivity of the AMCD to as low as just 25  percent of normal levels. In addition, officials cited multiple backlogs  throughout the division, such as, the electrocardiogram (ECG) unit, which  receives up to 400 ECGs each day, and the pathology-coding unit, which  may require manual coding of medical conditions to feed information into  DIWS.", "Part of the challenge, identified in FAA\u2019s National Airspace Capital  Investment Plan, is that the current medical certification systems are  based on obsolete technology from the 1990s. Accordingly, technical  working groups at AMCD have identified more than 50 problems and  potential technological solutions to enhance their systems, including the  special issuance processes, of which about 20 have been identified as  high-priority, including improvements to the online application system,  AMCS, DIWS, and the ECG transmittal and review process. For example,  officials stated that updating DIWS to import and read electronic files  would reduce the need to manually scan from paper documents, and  providing AMEs or applicants limited access to DIWS so they can check  the status of an application could reduce the number of calls AMCD  receives at its call center. As of February 2014, FAA officials stated they  received funding they requested in June 2013, to upgrade the ECG  system from analog to digital\u2014a process which they estimate will take  about 11 months to complete. In addition, FAA has not established a  timeline for implementing its broader set of technology enhancements,  some of which may be less contingent on resource constraints. A timeline  to guide the implementation of the highest-priority enhancements would  help the agency take another step toward reducing the delays and  bottlenecks in the special issuance process related to FAA\u2019s technology  issues.", "In addition to the proposed enhancements, the Office of Aerospace  Medicine collaborated with the Volpe National Transportation Systems  Center (Volpe Center), in 2013, to define broader challenges of the  current medical certification process and develop a strategy to reengineer  the existing business processes, including the online medical-certification  system and its supporting information-technology infrastructure. Officials  from the Office of Aerospace Medicine have said that their effort with the  Volpe Center will ultimately inform their plan to replace FAA\u2019s current  medical information systems with the Aerospace Medicine Safety  Information System (AMSIS), which the agency plans to begin developing  in fiscal year 2015. FAA officials stated that they envision several long- term positive changes that may result from AMSIS\u2014including redesigning  the online application system and form, providing applicants with  information on actions to complete before they meet with their AME, and  a more transparent special issuance process with the capacity for  applicants to check the status of their applications.

While FAA also offers training and produces  pamphlets, videos, and other educational material for AMEs and pilots,  the online medical application system is used by all applicants to apply for  a medical certificate. (See app. III for FAA\u2019s training programs and other  communication tools for AMEs and pilots). The system includes  information such as the online medical-application form and instructions  used by applicants to submit medical information to their AME and to  FAA, and a link to the AME Guide, which contains pertinent information  and guidance regarding regulations, examination procedures, and  protocols needed to perform the duties and responsibilities of an AME.", "We compared the online application system with select guidelines related  to content, navigation, and design that are considered good practices by   Based on our evaluation and discussion with experts, we  Usability.gov.identified areas in which FAA might enhance the usability of the online  application system by (1) providing useful information directly to  applicants, and (2) using links to improve how applicants navigate  through the application system.", "Providing Additional Useful Information Directly to Applicants: According  to Usability.gov, a good practice in website design includes providing  useful and relevant information that is easy to access and use. Some  experts (7 of 20), including four who were also AMEs, said that applicants  may be unsure about medical requirements and documentation.", "Representatives of two aviation medical associations also said a lack of  clarity can lead to delays in processing the medical certification if  applicants learn during their medical examination that they must obtain  additional test results or documentation from their primary care physician.  Some medical experts (4 of 20) said that technological improvements  would be helpful. For example, FAA could develop a Web page on its  website or within the online application system with more information for  applicants. In addition, two pilot associations stated that a specific Web  page or website for applicants with links to information on various medical  conditions, their risks to flight safety, and additional medical evaluations  that might be needed for applicants with those conditions would be  helpful. The online application system currently contains a link to the AME  Guide; however, applicants may find the 334-page AME Guide\u2014written  for aviation medical examiners\u2014difficult to navigate and understand and  therefore, may be unable to find information about specific documentation  and additional medical evaluations they may need.", "FAA officials in the medical certification division said that providing  documentation requirements to applicants could reduce certification  delays, AME errors, and the number of phone calls to AMCD\u2019s medical  certification call center because the applicants would know what  additional evaluations or documents they should get from their primary  care physician before they visit their AME for a medical exam. Similarly,  the FAA officials noted that applicants may not recall information they had  previously reported in prior medical certificate evaluations or may not  disclose their complete medical history when they see a new AME. NTSB  officials stated that the AME cannot see information about any previous  applications and knows only what the pilot has reported on their current  application. This means that the applicant has to recall all of his or her  past medical history each time they apply for a medical certificate.  Additionally, according to the NTSB officials, it would be useful for the  pilot to access previously reported information and update only what has  changed since their previous exam. As part of the more than 50  technological solutions discussed earlier that FAA has identified to  enhance the special issuance process, the agency has proposed  providing access to worksheets which specify required medical  documentation and providing access to previously reported medical data  to applicants and AMEs. FAA officials stated that these issues, if  addressed, would facilitate information flow between the applicant, the  AME and FAA and allow AMCD officials to more efficiently do their work.", "Additionally, some experts (9 of 20) said that it would be helpful to  applicants and treating physicians if FAA posted a list of banned  medications. In a couple experts\u2019 view, without a public list of banned  medications, applicants may not disclose their medical treatment regimen  to FAA out of fear of losing or not receiving their certification. NTSB  recommended in 2000 that DOT develop a list of approved medications  and/or classes of medications that may be safely used when operating a  vehicle; however, DOT\u2014including FAA\u2014did not implement the  recommendation because, in DOT\u2019s view, a list of approved medications  would be difficult to maintain and would be a liability for the transportation  industry if the Department approved a medication that later caused an  accident. Officials from AOPA told us that the association provides an  unofficial list of approved and banned medications to its members but  believes that this information should be made public and provided by  FAA.", "However, FAA states in its AME guide that maintaining a published list of  approved medications would not contribute to aviation safety because it  doesn\u2019t address the underlying medical condition being treated. Instead,  FAA\u2019s current policy prohibits AMEs from issuing medical certificates to  applicants using medications that have not been on the market for at least  one year after approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and  FAA has recently updated its AME Guide, to include a \u201cDo Not Issue\u2014Do  Not Fly\u201d list of several general classes of medication and some specific   The \u201cDo Not Issue\u201d list  pharmaceuticals and therapeutic medications. names medications that are banned\u2014meaning the AME should not issue  a medical certificate without clearance from FAA\u2014and the \u201cDo Not Fly\u201d  list names medications that the pilot should not use for a specified period  of time before or during flight, including sleep aids and some allergy  medications. FAA officials said that the \u201cDo Not Issue\u2014Do Not Fly\u201d list is  intended to be a \u201cliving document\u201d that they will revisit periodically. NTSB  officials suggested that it would be helpful if medications that an applicant  discloses on the medical application form could be automatically checked  against the \u201cDo Not Issue\u2014Do Not Fly\u201d list to notify their AME of the  applicant\u2019s use of a medication on the list. http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/ph arm/dni_dnf/.", "Easier Website Navigation: Navigation is the means by which users get  from page to page on a website to find and access information effectively  and efficiently. According to Usability.gov, a good practice related to  navigability is to use a clickable list of contents, thus minimizing scrolling.  The Pilot\u2019s Bill of Rights Notification and Terms of Service Agreement\u2014 which contains a statement advising the applicant that responses may be  used as evidence against the applicant, a liability disclaimer, a statement  of privacy, and a Paperwork Reduction Act statement among other  statements\u2014requires the user to scroll through what equates to nearly 10  pages of text (2,441 words over 417 lines of text), viewable through a  small window that shows approximately 10 to 12 words across and four  lines down at a time (see fig. 2).", "FAA might enhance the visibility of this information and help applicants  better understand what they are agreeing to, if it created a larger window  with hyperlinks to help the reader navigate through various sections of the  notification and agreement. Similarly, the question and answer page for  applicants could be enhanced by including clickable links between the  questions and answers to allow readers to more easily find answers of  interest to them.", "Another good practice, according to Usability.gov, is to design websites  for popular operating systems and common browsers while also  accounting for differences. According to a notification on the online  application system\u2019s log-in screen, applicants are advised to use only  Internet Explorer to access the system. The system functions  inconsistently across other browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla  Firefox, and Apple Safari. For example, links to from the medical  application form to its instructions do not work for Firefox or Google  Chrome; instead, they lead the applicant back to the log-in page, causing  any unsaved information to be lost.", "As described in the previous section, FAA officials at the medical  certification division identified technological problems and potential  solutions to enhance the online application system, but as of April 2014,  no changes have been made. For example, the officials observed that  some applicants enter the date in the wrong format, switching the order of  day and month (DD/MM/YYYY, as opposed to MM/DD/YYYY), which can  lead to problems when the AME imports the application. As a result, FAA  officials proposed using drop-down boxes\u2014with the name or abbreviation  of each month, followed by the day, and the year\u2014to collect date  information. This proposed solution is consistent with a good practice\u2014 anticipates typical user errors\u2014highlighted by Usability.gov. Additionally,  the officials noted that it is not uncommon for an applicant to be logged  out of their session due to inactivity, resulting in a loss of data entered  during the session. To address this, FAA proposed that the online  application system incorporate an auto-save feature that would be  activated prior to the session expiring\u2014consistent with Usability.gov  guidelines\u2014to warn users that a Web session may be expiring after  inactivity to prevent users from losing information they entered into the  online application system.", "In addition to these enhancements, FAA collects some information from  applicants and AMEs regarding their experience with the application  process. For example, FAA operates a 24-hour call center to answer  technical questions that applicants, and AMEs may have about the online  application system throughout the application process. FAA also has  surveyed AMEs and pilots to collect information about their experience  with the medical certification process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Could Enhance Clarity of Its Medical Application Form", "paragraphs": ["The Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires federal agencies, including FAA, to  write specified types of new or substantially revised publications, forms,  and publicly distributed documents in a \u201cclear, concise, well-organized\u201d  manner. Several years before the Plain Writing Act of 2010\u2014in 2003\u2014 FAA issued Writing Standards to improve the clarity of its  communication. The Writing Standards include guidance for anyone who  writes or reviews FAA documents intended for internal or external  distribution. FAA has continued to make efforts in recent years to improve  its employees\u2019 understanding of plain language and how to incorporate it  in written documents. FAA\u2019s Plain Language Program in the Office of  Communications trains employees and supports Plainlanguage.gov, a  website devoted to improving communication from the Federal  government to the public.", "Although plain writing is only required for new or substantially changed  government documents, and is therefore not required for the current  medical application form, the goal of plain writing is to help readers find  the information they need, understand what they find, and use it to meet  their needs. In regard to the medical certification process, this would  include helping applicants understand each question and more accurately  complete the application form in the way that FAA intended. In addition,  stakeholders from two pilot associations were concerned that unclear  questions on the medical application form could lead to incomplete or  inaccurate responses, which they said could also lead to applicants\u2019 being  accused of misrepresenting themselves or falsifying information on the  application form\u2014an offense punishable by a fine up to $250,000 and  imprisonment up to 5 years and may also result in a suspension or  revocation or all pilot and medical certificates.", "More specifically, FAA\u2019s Writing Standards also recommend using active  voice and active verbs to emphasize the doer of the action. Our analysis  of FAA\u2019s medical application form and instructions showed that in some  cases, FAA used passive voice although active voice would make the  statements clearer. According to FAA\u2019s writing standards, because the  active voice emphasizes the doer of an action, it is usually briefer, clearer,  and more emphatic than the passive voice. For example, on the medical  application form the current statement, \u201cIntentional falsification may result  in federal criminal prosecution,\u201d may be clearer to the applicant if stated,  \u201cIf you intentionally falsify your responses, you may be prosecuted for a  federal crime,\u201d or a similar, more direct way of notifying the applicant.  However, FAA officials noted that any re-wording of legal warnings or  disclaimers must be approved by legal counsel.", "We also asked the medical experts to review the online application form.  In response, many medical experts (12 of 20) we interviewed stated that  certain questions can be confusing or too broad. For example, some  experts have said that terms like \u201cfrequent,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d or \u201cmedication\u201d  aren\u2019t clearly defined and therefore certain questions could generate  inaccurate responses. For example, many experts (15 of 20) said that  question 17a, on medication use, was unclear because, among other  reasons, the reader may not know whether supplements or herbal  medicines should be included. Some medical experts (7 of 20) also  suggested adding items to question 18, about medical history, for areas  such as cancer and sleep apnea. In 2009, NTSB recommended that FAA  modify its medical application form to elicit specific information about risk   (See app.  factors or any previous diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.IV for a copy of the medical application form.)", "Many of the medical experts we consulted further suggested simplifying  one question on the form; this question has also been examined by FAA  officials. Specifically, the question on the form pertains to an applicant\u2019s  arrests or convictions. For example, many experts (13 of 20) suggested  simplifying the question. FAA\u2019s writing guidance suggests shortening  sentence length to present information clearly or using bullets or active  voice. In addition, FAA officials from the medical certification division used  a computer program to analyze the readability of the question and  discovered that an applicant would need more than 20 years of education  to understand it.", "According to FAA officials, the agency can make changes to the medical  application form for various reasons, including, for example: a response to findings or a recommendation made in a report by  NTSB or by the Department of Transportation Inspector General, or a change in medical practices, for example, resulting from  advancements in medicine.", "Since 1990, FAA revised the application form several times, to add or  remove questions, change time frames related to the questions, or to  clarify the questions, among other types of changes. When FAA  announced in the Federal Register that it would replace its paper  application form with an online application system, the agency said that  the online application system would allow it to make and implement any  needed or mandated changes to the application form in a timelier  manner, resulting in a more dynamic form. However, agency officials  noted that while they maintain a list of questions on the application form  that pose problems for applicants, they do not make frequent changes, in  part, because of the time and resources needed to complete a lengthy  public comment and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval   FAA officials also  processes which, they say, can take up to two years.said that the Office of Aerospace Medicine must balance \u201cplain language\u201d  with the requirements levied by FAA\u2019s General Counsel to make sure that  the wording is legally correct and enforceable.

Expanding the CACI program, as some experts suggested,  could reduce the time it takes for applicants with lower risk conditions to  become medically certified and, more importantly, allow FAA to prioritize  the use of its constrained resources for medical determinations for  applicants with the highest-risk medical conditions.", "FAA has identified approximately 50 potential technological  enhancements to its computer systems that support its certification  process, including adding new functionality to facilitate the process and  provide applicants with more information about medical requirements.  According to FAA officials, these enhancements would potentially reduce  the workload at the medical certification division. Although FAA intends to  eventually replace its current medical-certification computer systems with  a new Aerospace Medicine Safety Information System (AMSIS),  temporary enhancements are expected to help FAA reduce the delays  and bottlenecks currently posing challenges to the agency. FAA has not  established a timeline for implementing its broader set of 50 proposed  technological enhancements, some of which may be less expensive than  others.

We also reviewed academic, trade and  industry articles, government reports, and other relevant literature. We  interviewed officials from FAA and the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB), and other stakeholders in the pilot medical certification  process, including officials representing government advocacy, medical  and legal issues within the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA)  and the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), the Aeromedical Advisor  to the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), attorneys who assist pilots  through the medical certification process, and representatives from the  American Diabetes Association. responses from the President and representatives from three member  airlines of the Regional Airline Association, the Executive Director of the  Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA), and the President and physician  members of the Civil Aviation Medical Association (CAMA). We also  visited the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City to  interview representatives of FAA\u2019s Aerospace Medical Certification  Division (AMCD), and we attended a training seminar for Aviation Medical  Examiners (AME). To obtain expert opinions on FAA\u2019s medical standards,  we collaborated with the National Academies\u2019 Institute of Medicine to  identify aviation medical experts. We provided the Institute of Medicine  with criteria and considerations for identifying experts, including (1) type  and depth of experience, including recognition in the aerospace medicine  professional community and relevance of any published work, (2)  employment history and professional affiliations, including any potential  conflicts of interest, and (3) other relevant experts\u2019 recommendations.", "We also contacted the American College of Cardiology and the American Academy of  Neurology to solicit their views but they did not reply for an interview.", "From the list of 24 experts identified by the National Academies, we  added 3 experts recommended to us and omitted 7 due to their  unavailability, their concern that they may not have the expertise to  respond to our questions, or their stated conflicts of interest. We ended  up with a total of 20 aviation medical experts who represented private,  public, and academic institutions. Fourteen of the experts are board  certified by at least one of the American Board of Medical Specialties  member boards, including 9 who are board certified in aerospace  medicine. Eight of the 20 medical experts we interviewed are AMEs for  the FAA, and 16 are pilots or have had pilot experience in the past. Two  experts are from aviation authorities in Australia and New Zealand, and a  third expert was from the United Kingdom.", "Each expert verified that they had no conflicts of interest in participating in  our study. We conducted semi-structured interviews by telephone with the  experts in August and September 2013 to solicit their views on FAA\u2019s  medical standards and qualification policies, the medical application form,  and FAA\u2019s communication with AMEs and pilot applicants. We also asked  general questions about aviation medical policies, followed by specific  questions about private pilots, where applicable. We provided all medical  experts with relevant background information prior to our interview, and  we provided the option to bypass questions if they believed they were  unqualified to respond in a professional capacity. Prior to conducting the  interviews, we pretested the interview questions with three aviation  medical experts (two were AMEs and one was also a pilot). We  conducted pretests to make sure that the questions were clear and  unbiased and that they did not place an undue burden on respondents.  We made appropriate revisions to the content and format of the  questionnaire after the pretests.", "Each of the 20 interviews was administered by one analyst and notes  were taken by another. Those interview summaries were then evaluated  to identify similar responses among the experts and to develop our  findings. The analysis was conducted in two steps. In the first step, two  analysts developed a code book to guide how they will analyze the expert  responses. In the second step, one analyst coded each transcript of  expert responses, and then a second analyst verified those codes. Any  coding discrepancies were resolved by both analysts agreeing on what  the codes should be. We examined responses to determine if there were  systematic differences in responses between experts who were and were  not pilots and between experts who were and were not AMEs. Because  we found no significant differences between the pilot and AME groups,  we reported the results for the experts as a whole rather than by the pilot  or AME subgroups.", "We used indefinite quantifiers throughout the report\u2014\u201dfew\u201d (2-3 experts);  \u201csome\u201d (4-9 experts); \u201chalf\u201d (10); \u201cmany\u201d (11-15 experts); and, \u201cmost\u201d (16- 19 experts)\u2014to inform the reader of the approximate quantity of medical  experts that agreed with a particular statement.

We interviewed individuals with  broad aerospace-medicine expertise to provide their expert opinion on  FAA\u2019s medical standards and qualification policies. While the experts  provided their opinions on some specific standards, we do not believe  that these opinions alone provide sufficient evidence to recommend any  specific changes to FAA medical standards and policies. Rather, the  information from these interviews provides us with an overall expert  assessment of FAA\u2019s medical standards, policies, and practices.
