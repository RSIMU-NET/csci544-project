One reason why schools\u2019 expenditures rose more than CPI is that schools spend their funds on a different group of components than is measured by CPI: Whereas CPI measures increases in the prices of such items as food, clothing, housing, and health care, schools spend their monies on such items as faculty and administrator salaries, fringe benefits, and library materials.", "Some researchers believe a better measure of school cost increases is the Higher Education Price Index (HEPI)\u2014an index specifically designed to measure changes in the prices of goods and services commonly purchased by higher education institutions. Items that HEPI measures include faculty and administrators\u2019 salaries, fringe benefits, communication and data processing services, supplies and materials, library acquisitions, and utilities.", "The HEPI measurement includes 2-year and 4-year public and private colleges and universities and, therefore, the expenditures of public colleges may have increased somewhat more or less than the expenditures for all schools. Nonetheless, many researchers believe that HEPI is a better measurement of the increases in prices of the types of goods and services purchased by public colleges than is CPI, which measures the increase in a market basket of consumer goods. As shown in figure 3.1, the increases in HEPI consistently outpaced increases in CPI from school year 1980-81 through 1993-94, with HEPI rising 90 percent compared with CPI\u2019s 69-percent increase. Also, the HEPI increase is equivalent to about three-fourths of the 121-percent increase in schools\u2019 expenditures during the period.", "The 31-percentage point difference between the increase in public colleges\u2019 expenditures and the increase in HEPI can be attributed to either an increase in the volume of goods and services schools purchased or a more expensive mix of goods and services purchased\u2014for example, more computers and fewer adding machines.

During this period, public colleges increased their spending from $2,719 to $5,669 per student\u2014an increase of $2,950, or 108 percent. The largest component of instructional expenditures was the increase in salaries and wages. The average salary for faculty at public colleges increased by $23,646 (97 percent), from $24,373 in 1980-81 to $48,019 in 1993-94.", "According to the literature we reviewed, average faculty salaries have increased, in part, because schools have been competing with one another and industry for high-quality scholars and researchers. The average salary has also increased because the faculty workforce has been aging. A greater proportion of faculty are at the full professor level, and this has resulted in a gradual increase in the average salary over the last 10 to 15 years. However, some higher education policy analysts have pointed out that the increase in faculty salaries during the 1980s and 1990s has merely returned salary levels to where they were in the early 1970s, in real terms. Faculty salaries did not keep up with inflation from 1973 to 1982 and did not start to experience any real growth until 1983.", "The literature we reviewed also suggested another reason for the increase in instructional costs: the decline in faculty productivity in terms of teaching workload. Faculty are spending less time in the classroom and more doing research and, partly as a consequence, colleges and universities are hiring more faculty. This additional hiring drives up instructional costs, which in turn results in higher tuition. Some believe the underlying cause of this phenomenon is the reward system that values research over teaching, particularly with regard to granting tenure. To address this issue, a number of states have conducted or initiated studies on faculty workload and productivity. To review these studies and more thoroughly evaluate this complex issue was beyond the scope of our work.", "In addition to the increases in faculty salaries, other factors have contributed to the increase in instructional expenditures. For example, faculty fringe benefits have increased substantially\u2014by 162 percent from 1980-81 to 1993-94. Schools are also spending more for instructional supplies and equipment. A modern science curriculum, for example, calls for the use of more sophisticated laboratory equipment, such as electron microscopes, and this equipment is more costly to purchase and maintain than the equipment used in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Growth in School Administrative Expenditures Outpaced Inflation", "paragraphs": ["Increased administrative expenditures was another significant factor causing school expenditures to outpace inflation from school year 1980-81 through 1993-94.

Another reason cited in the literature was that schools have increased their administrative budgets to ensure compliance with such federal statutes as hazardous waste disposal laws; the Equal Employment Opportunity Act; title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities, including collegiate sports for women); and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public services, programs, or activities)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Expenditures Rose Substantially, but Their Effect on Tuition Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Research expenditures at public colleges increased $1,439 per student (157 percent), from $914 in school year 1980-81 to $2,353 in 1993-94.

As a result, the portion of a household\u2019s income needed to pay for college tuition nearly doubled during the period. The rapid rise in tuition reflects two key trends over the last 15 years: public colleges\u2019 expenditures per student rose over 120 percent and the portion of those costs paid for by tuition rose from 16 to 23 percent. Students and their families have responded to this \u201caffordability gap\u201d by drawing more heavily on their own financial resources and greatly increasing their borrowing.", "On a more positive note, public college tuition is still a \u201cbargain\u201d in that it pays less than a quarter of the costs colleges incur and, at an average of $2,865 in 1995-96, it is only a fraction of the $20,000-a-year tuition charged by some private colleges. Also, although federal grant aid has been stagnant in real terms, the Congress has increased the borrowing limits and expanded the eligibility for federally guaranteed student and parental loans. In addition, many states have made efforts to freeze or hold down the rate of increase in tuition levels, created college savings and prepayment programs, or undertaken initiatives to expedite students\u2019 completion of the college degree requirements.", "College could become more affordable in the future if (1) colleges\u2019 expenditures per student declined or grew at a slower rate, (2) a smaller portion of colleges\u2019 expenditures were paid for by tuition, (3) household incomes increased at a faster rate than that for tuition charges, or (4) grants became a larger portion of federal student aid. However, if none of these changes occur, rising tuition levels may deter many students from attending college. For those that do attend, the debt loads many students and their families assume may increasingly affect students\u2019 career decisions, their parents\u2019 life styles while their children attend college, and students\u2019 life styles after they complete college."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
