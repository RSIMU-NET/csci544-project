The strategy, known as Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) 2, is expected to provide service, compliance, and other benefits to IRS and to taxpayers beginning in 2012. IRS expects to implement CADE 2 in three phases. The first phase is expected to be delivered in 2012, the second in 2014, and the third at a later yet to be determined date. GAO was asked to (1) determine whether IRS has identified the expected benefits of CADE 2 and set targets for measuring success, (2) examine the estimated costs and assess IRS's process for developing them, and (3) assess IRS's process for managing the risks associated with CADE 2 and describe the risks IRS has identified using this process. To do so, GAO reviewed relevant documentation, attended program review meetings, and interviewed IRS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS has identified 20 service, compliance, and other benefits for the first phase of CADE 2, including increasing the percentage of refunds processed daily and reducing the number of erroneous notices due to better account information, and has set quantitative targets for most of these benefits. GAO has previously reported that quantitative targets can be useful for tracking program performance. While it may not always be possible to quantify targets, doing so helps to objectively measure the extent to which expected benefits have been realized. However, IRS has not yet finalized expected benefits for the second phase or set related quantitative targets, because, according to officials, these are contingent upon yet to be made design and funding decisions. Nevertheless, addressing the second phase's benefits and related targets as the design is being considered could influence design decisions and help identify early on how systems and processes might be affected. IRS reported preliminary life cycle cost estimates for the first two phases of the CADE 2 program of about $1.3 billion through 2024. This includes about $377 million for development and $922 million for operations and maintenance. IRS's process for developing the preliminary estimates was generally consistent with best practices. However, the agency did not follow three practices intended to improve the credibility of cost estimates. Specifically, IRS did not (1) consistently document excluded costs or provide a rationale for excluding them; (2) use inflation in calculating costs; and (3) perform an analysis to examine the effects of changing ground rules and assumptions. While IRS stated it would perform the analysis of changing ground rules and assumptions in revised estimates to be available by the completion of our audit, until the agency implements all these practices its estimates may not be credible. IRS's process for managing the risks associated with CADE 2 is generally consistent with best practices. Through its process, IRS identified significant risks facing CADE 2, including that filing season and other top information technology investment priorities may result in contention for key resources, the delivery of the first phase of CADE 2 may be delayed if deficiencies identified in requirements are not corrected in a timely manner, and the risk that technical challenges and other risks to implementing the database identified as a result of prototyping efforts may not be addressed. To its credit, IRS has developed mitigation strategies for each identified risk. While IRS is working to ensure CADE 2 is successfully managed, the schedule for delivering the initial phase is nevertheless ambitious. IRS officials have acknowledged this and are taking actions to increase their chances of meeting it, including moving certain activities up, performing others concurrently, and adding checkpoints to monitor the program's status. While these actions may increase the likelihood of meeting the schedule, some of them, such as performing activities concurrently, could potentially introduce more risk to CADE 2's successful development and implementation. GAO's recommendations include (1) identifying all of the second phase benefits, setting the related targets, and identifying how systems and business processes might be affected; and (2) improving the credibility of revised cost estimates by including all costs or providing a rationale for excluded costs, and adjusting costs for inflation. In its comments on a draft of this report, IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In administering federal tax laws, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  collected approximately $2.35 trillion in 2010 and is projected to collect  over $3 trillion beginning in 2013.

Starting in 2005, CADE processed and recorded tax return and  tax account information for millions of individual taxpayers with simple  returns. However, IRS found that the development of the system was more  complex and taking longer than initially anticipated and decided to  undertake a broad review of its IT systems modernization efforts. The  results of the review led IRS to adopt a new strategy for managing  individual taxpayer accounts that would provide benefits to IRS and the  taxpayers sooner than CADE.

CADE, one of the core  systems of the Business Systems Modernization program, was intended to  provide a modernized system of taxpayer accounts, with the ultimate goal  of eventually replacing the Individual Master File (IMF), a 1960s legacy tax  master file that maintains all taxpayer records for individual taxpayers.", "The IMF is the authoritative data source for individual tax account data.  Tax data and related information pertaining to individual taxpayers are  posted to the IMF, and the IMF is updated annually to incorporate new tax  law procedures and changes. The IMF is a critical component of IRS\u2019s  ability to process tax returns, as all the other IRS information system  applications use data from this source. According to IRS, the IMF is a  complex computer system that maintains all individual taxpayer records  but has inherent limitations that significantly constrain IRS\u2019s ability to  achieve its mission. The delays in weekly updates of taxpayer accounts,  the lack of synchronization of taxpayer data across dozens of systems, the  complexity of the data, the large volumes of data, and the ongoing need to  embed new tax laws and business rules contribute to IRS systems storing,  sharing, and processing data that is often incomplete, untimely, or  inaccurate.", "With CADE, IRS started establishing a database and related functionality  for posting, settlement, maintenance, refund processing, and issue  detection for taxpayer account and return data for relatively simple tax  returns for individual taxpayers.

IRS reported that, in 2010, CADE    processed about 41 million relatively simple returns (about 30 percent of  the total individual income tax returns received); and issued about 36 million refunds that totaled in excess of $66 billion  (approximately 14 percent of total refunds), and processed over 7 million  taxpayer payments amounting to approximately $90 billion\u2014with zero  defects in balancing.", "In addition, IRS reported that it issues refunds with CADE approximately 5  days faster than refunds processed by the IMF."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges and Risks Facing CADE That Led to CADE 2", "paragraphs": ["Although IRS made progress in processing individual taxpayer returns  with CADE, IRS found that each successive release of the system was far  more difficult as more complex accounts were to be supported, raising  concerns about the effort required to address these increasing  complexities. Also, since the CADE system operates concurrently with  IMF processing, work must be done across the two environments,  increasing the complexity of filing season operations and resulting in a  greater risk for errors in processing taxpayer account information. IRS  was concerned that, without a significant change in approach, CADE  would not be completed until at least 2020.", "These challenges led the IRS Commissioner to form a team of senior IRS  technologists and external advisers to review CADE and IRS\u2019s  modernization strategy for individual taxpayer accounts. The review  identified six risks with the CADE strategy.

More specifically, through the Daily  Processing project, IRS is expected to    modify the IMF to run daily, i.e., modify current transaction processing to  occur daily versus weekly;   make changes to the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) and the  notice generation process to support the daily vs. weekly processing cycle;  and    prepare daily \u201cloads\u201d to update the CADE 2 database for IDRS and other  downstream systems as they are able to support daily processing.", "Database Implementation: According to IRS, this project is to establish  the CADE 2 database, a relational database that will house data on  individual taxpayers and their accounts; develop a capability to transfer  data from IMF to the database; and provide for the transfer of data from  the database to downstream IRS financial, customer service and  compliance systems. Specifically, the project is expected to enable IRS to    perform a one-time initialization of the database when TS1 begins (this  will involve loading all taxpayer account data from IMF and the CADE  database into the CADE 2 database and then validating it);   perform daily updates to the database after TS1 begins by extracting,  transforming, and loading daily processing changes to IMF data; and    utilize the database to provide individual taxpayer account information to  selected downstream systems to assist IRS service and compliance  personnel.

It is important to note that, even when all TS1 cost  elements have been updated to accurately reflect the current  understanding of the work to be performed, the total cost of ownership  through TS2 could still significantly differ from the new estimate, given  that, as previously noted, the approach for TS2 has yet to be defined.", "We identified the following three practices IRS did not follow that could  strengthen its methods for estimating CADE 2 costs to ensure they are  more credible:  First, according to best practices, items excluded from estimates should  be documented and explained. While IRS documented four of the five  items that were excluded from the estimates, it did not provide an  explanation for excluding these costs. In addition, IRS did not document  that it excluded the business costs associated with moving to daily  processing. IRS officials stated that, at the time the estimates were  developed, these business costs were not well understood by the  estimators and now believe that these costs would be relatively small,  representing mostly costs for staff already being paid out of existing  budgets. Nevertheless, consistently documenting excluded costs and  providing a rationale for excluding them would improve credibility.", "Second, IRS\u2019s estimates did not include inflation. According to best  practices, adjusting costs for inflation correctly is necessary if the cost  estimate is to be credible. Inflation reflects the fact that the cost of an item  usually continues to rise over time. If a mistake is made in applying  inflation, or if inflation is not included, cost overruns can result.", "Third, IRS did not conduct a sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of  changing assumptions and ground rules on its estimates. While IRS  developed risk-adjusted estimates, it did not perform the formal sensitivity  analysis necessary to understand which variables most affect the cost  estimate. IRS officials stated they intend to include a sensitivity analysis in  the revised cost estimates expected to be available by the completion of  our audit.

Biweekly meetings are held where the Director for Delivery Management  and project officials discuss project status and risks and determine  whether risks need to be escalated as candidate risks to the program level.

Further, as already noted, waiting to finish  (1) defining targets for the TS1 benefits and (2) finalizing benefits and  related targets for TS2 creates a risk of costly or time-consuming late  design changes.", "Recognizing the challenges it faces, IRS has taken additional steps to  increase the likelihood of meeting the schedule. These include moving  certain activities up, performing others concurrently and adding  checkpoints to monitor the program\u2019s status. In addition, IRS has recently  completed a TS1 contingency strategy. While these actions may increase  the likelihood of meeting the schedule, some of them, such as performing  activities concurrently, could potentially introduce more risk to CADE 2\u2019s  successful development and implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Defining benefits and related quantitative targets where feasible is  important to understanding what to expect and how to measure  performance against expectations. For TS1, while IRS has identified  numerous expected benefits, it has not yet defined quantitative targets for  all of them. Given that IRS is finalizing the design and preparing to  implement TS1, it is important for the agency to complete defining the  targets associated with TS1 benefits. Delaying the setting of targets could  result in costly and time-consuming changes to the design and associated  requirements. Similarly, addressing TS2 benefits and related targets as the  design is being considered could influence design decisions and help  identify early on how systems and processes might be affected.", "In developing cost estimates for the first two phases of CADE 2, IRS did  not disclose all excluded costs, provide a rationale for documented  excluded costs, adjust for inflation, or perform a sensitivity analysis to  examine the effects of changing assumptions and ground rules. IRS stated  it would perform a sensitivity analysis in the revised estimates it expects  to release by the completion of our audit.", "To its credit, IRS has established a risk management process that is  generally consistent with best practices and has identified mitigation  strategies to address each identified risk.

Through  document reviews and interviews with appropriate officials, we also  examined the following areas in greater depth: (1) schedule, (2) contractor  oversight, (3) requirements management, (4) prototypes, and (5) human  capital. We selected these areas because, based on our experience, they  represent areas of risk or have been problematic for IRS in the past.
