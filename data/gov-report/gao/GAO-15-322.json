Large payments that exceed costs raise questions as to whether the payments are for Medicaid purposes.", "GAO was asked to review state Medicaid payments to government providers compared to private, that is, for-profit and non-profit providers. GAO examined (1) in selected states, how state Medicaid payments to government hospitals compare to those made to private hospitals, and, for selected hospitals, to their Medicaid costs and total hospital operating costs; and (2) CMS oversight.

States must capture but are not required to report all payments they make to individual institutional providers, nor are states required to report ownership information. For example, large supplemental payments states often make to hospitals are not reported by hospital. GAO assessed data for hospitals in two of three selected states, Illinois and New York; the third state, California, did not have accurate or complete payment data that would allow an assessment of total payments made to individual hospitals. In the two states, GAO's estimates of average daily payments\u2014total payments adjusted for differences in patient health, divided by patient days\u2014made to government and private hospitals showed inconclusive trends, but also identified that a small number of government hospitals were receiving high payments that warrant oversight.", "In Illinois, average daily payments for inpatient services were comparable for government and private hospitals, but these averages masked wide variations in daily payments for both types of hospitals. Daily payments ranged from less than $600 to almost $10,000 for local government hospitals and from $750 to over $11,000 for private hospitals. For seven hospitals with high daily payments, GAO examined how payments compared to each hospital's costs of providing Medicaid services as reported by the hospital in cost reports and found that six of the seven hospitals' Medicaid payments exceeded their Medicaid costs.", "In New York, average daily payments were higher for government hospitals than private hospitals, but as with Illinois these averages masked wide variations, with daily payments ranging from about $200 to over $9,000 for local government hospitals and from less than $200 to $3,400 for private hospitals. Four of nine selected government and private hospitals with high daily payments had Medicaid payments that exceeded Medicaid costs: two were local government hospitals that, all together, received payments exceeding their costs by nearly $400 million.", "One selected hospital in Illinois and two in New York had Medicaid payments that exceeded the local government hospitals' total operating costs, including costs associated with all services provided to all patients they served.", "Oversight of Medicaid payments to individual hospitals and other institutional providers, which is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is limited in part by insufficient information on payments and also by the lack of a policy and process for assessing payments to individual providers. CMS does not collect provider-specific payment and ownership information. CMS also lacks a policy and standard process for determining whether Medicaid payments to individual providers are economical and efficient. Excessive state payments to individual providers may not be identified or examined by CMS. For example, CMS's oversight mechanisms did not identify large overpayments to two New York hospitals until they were identified by GAO.

In 2014, Medicaid was projected to provide health care coverage  for 65 million enrolled individuals at a cost of $508 billion. The federal  government matches each state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures for services  according to the state\u2019s federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP).  Within broad federal requirements, states administer their individual  Medicaid programs under the oversight of the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS). For example, states determine which providers  are eligible to receive payments and which services to cover, set payment  rates that different providers will receive for various covered services, and  pay providers for claims submitted for services rendered. Providers of  these services, particularly institutional providers such as hospitals and  nursing facilities, may be owned and operated by private entities\u2014 including both for-profit and not-for-profit entities\u2014or by state or local  governments. Under federal law, in order to receive federal matching  funds, payments generally (1) must be made for covered Medicaid items  and services; (2) must be consistent with economy, efficiency, and quality  of care; and (3) must not exceed the Medicaid upper payment limit (UPL),  which is a reasonable estimate of what Medicare\u2014the federal health  program that covers seniors aged 65 and over, individuals with end-stage  renal disease, and certain disabled persons\u2014would pay for comparable  services. In addition to regular, claims-based Medicaid payments, states  may also make supplemental payments, which are generally paid in lump  sums, to institutional providers. States receive federal matching funds for  regular and supplemental payments.", "We have previously found that some states have made excessive  Medicaid payments to certain institutional providers\u2014such as local  government hospitals\u2014that resulted in an inappropriate shift in costs from  states to the federal government. Providers that receive supplemental  payments offer important services as they often serve a large number of  Medicaid patients and the uninsured\u2014vulnerable populations who are  generally sicker and have more complex needs than patients served at  other hospitals. However, we found that supplemental payments to these  providers can be excessive. In addition, we found that these payments  typically involved financing arrangements under which a small number of  providers supplied funds to the state for the nonfederal share, generally  through intergovernmental fund transfers or provider taxes, and in turn  received large supplemental payments, enabling states to obtain billions  of dollars in additional federal matching funds. We testified in July 2014  that states\u2019 reliance on government and private providers for financing  Medicaid has increased in recent years, further increasing the potential  for cost-shifting from the states to the federal government.", "CMS plays an important role in ensuring the fiscal integrity of Medicaid.  Its responsibilities include ensuring that federal Medicaid matching funds  are provided for eligible expenditures, and that the federal government  and states share in the financing of the Medicaid program, as established  by law. However, we and others have reported concerns about the  agency\u2019s oversight, including a lack of data on large Medicaid payments  often made to institutional providers. In 2003, we designated Medicaid as  a high-risk program, in part because of concerns about excessive  supplemental payments states made to government institutional providers  and the oversight of these payments, and we recommended closer  federal scrutiny of Medicaid payments to government providers to ensure  that payments are consistent with federal requirements.", "You asked us to study state Medicaid payments to government providers.  This report examines (1) the information CMS Medicaid expenditure  reports include about payments by type of provider ownership nationwide;  (2) for selected states, how state Medicaid payments to government  hospitals compare to state Medicaid payments to private hospitals and,  for selected hospitals, how Medicaid payments compare to hospitals\u2019  Medicaid costs and total operating costs; and (3) the extent to which CMS  oversees payments to government and private providers.", "To determine the information CMS Medicaid expenditure reports include  , we analyzed  about payments by type of provider ownership nationwideMedicaid expenditures for federal fiscal year 2011\u2014the most recent year  for which complete data were available at the time of our analysis.

We compared average payments by type of hospital ownership\u2014state  government, local government, or private\u2014for inpatient hospital  services provided in state fiscal year 2011, the most recent year for  which data were available. To do so, we combined hospital-specific  claims-based payment data from CMS\u2019s national claims data  system\u2014the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS)\u2014with  data provided to us by the three states on hospital ownership and  hospital-specific supplemental payments not included in the Medicaid  claims. We determined that the Illinois and New York data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes by contacting state Medicaid  department officials and clarifying conflicting, unclear, or incomplete  information.

Any changes a state wishes to make in its Medicaid plan, such as  establishing new Medicaid payments to providers or changing  methodologies for determining provider payment rates, must be submitted  to CMS for review and approval as a state plan amendment.", "Federal matching funds are available to states for different types of  payments that states make. For regular, claims-based payments made  directly to providers that have submitted bills for services rendered, states  pay the providers based on established payment rates for the services  provided. For supplemental payments, states generally make monthly,  quarterly, or annual lump sum payments or may include the payments as  adjustments to regular, claims-based payments. Supplemental payments  include Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, which states  are required by federal law to make to certain hospitals. These payments  are designed to help offset these hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs for  serving large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured low-income  individuals. Many states also make other supplemental payments that  are not required under federal law. These payments include Medicaid  UPL supplemental payments, which are Medicaid payments that are  above the regular Medicaid payments but within the UPL, defined as the  estimated amount that Medicare would pay for comparable services. UPL  supplemental payments, like regular claims-based payments, must be  made for allowable Medicaid expenditures and must comply with  applicable federal requirements. Regular and UPL supplemental  payments are not limited to providers\u2019 costs of delivering Medicaid  services; however, as Medicaid payments, they are intended to pay for  Medicaid-covered services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries and must  by law be economical and efficient. States may also make other  supplemental payments to hospitals, nursing facilities, and other  providers authorized under Medicaid demonstrations. (See app. II for  information on our past concerns about Medicaid supplemental  payments.)", "The Medicaid UPL is a ceiling on the amount of federal matching funds a  state may receive for Medicaid payments; it is based on the amount that  Medicare would pay for similar services. Because states\u2019 regular  payments are often lower than what Medicare would pay for comparable  services, states are able to make UPL supplemental payments, which are  separate from and in addition to regular payments, and the federal  government will share in those payments up to the maximum amount  allowed under the UPL. (See fig. 1.)", "The UPL is not a provider-specific limit but instead is applied on an  aggregate basis for certain provider ownership types and categories of  services. Specifically, the UPL is applied on an aggregate basis to the  three ownership types\u2014local government, state government, and private.  Separate UPLs exist for providers of inpatient hospital services,  outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, and physician and  other practitioner services, and for services provided in intermediate care  facilities for the developmentally disabled (ICF/DD).", "To obtain federal funding for both regular and supplemental payments,  states submit their estimated aggregate expenditures by type of service to  CMS each quarter for an upcoming quarter. After CMS has approved the  estimate, it makes federal funds available to the state for the purpose of  making Medicaid payments during the upcoming quarter. States typically  make Medicaid payments to providers with a combination of nonfederal  funds and federal funds. Within 30 days of the end of each quarter, states  are required to submit their actual expenditures for the quarter on the  standardized form CMS-64.

Despite extensive work we conducted in California  to obtain and analyze Medicaid claims and UPL supplemental payment  data, we were unable to compare individual hospitals\u2019 daily payments by  hospital ownership for inpatient hospital services. This was because  California lacked reliable data to enable an assessment of Medicaid  payments made to individual hospitals.

Similarly, states are not  required to report DSH supplemental payments by the uncompensated  care costs related to Medicaid patients versus uninsured patients.  Therefore, we did not include them when determining daily payments.  Illinois, in state fiscal year 2011, paid $335 million in DSH supplemental  payments, of which $304 million was paid to 3 local government  hospitals, $27 million was paid to the state\u2019s 1 state government hospital,  and $4 million was paid to 38 private hospitals. New York, in state fiscal  year 2011, paid over $2 billion in these payments, of which over $1 billion  was paid to 20 local government hospitals, $250 million was paid to 5  state government hospitals, and $670 million was paid to 158 private  hospitals. Because it was unclear what portion of these payments was  related to the cost of providing uncompensated care related to Medicaid  patients versus uninsured patients, we did not include them when  determining Medicaid payments by hospital ownership.", "In addition, claims data for both Illinois and New York could not be used  for analyzing payments to individual providers for outpatient hospital,  nursing facility, and ICF/DD services. For outpatient hospital services,  available claims data did not provide sufficient information to determine  the number of outpatient visits. Some of the outpatient claims were for  bundled services\u2014that is, services that were provided over a series of  visits\u2014and, therefore, we could not calculate outpatient payments on a  per visit basis. For both nursing facility and ICF/DD services, available  claims data were not reliable for determining the number of days of  service provided.

Information that states  are required to report separately for each DSH hospital includes the  hospital\u2019s Medicaid costs, and all Medicaid payments\u2014regular, DSH  supplemental, and UPL supplemental. However, this reporting is not  required for hospitals that are not eligible to receive DSH supplemental  payments.", "Recognizing the need for better data from the states, CMS began  implementing two initiatives in 2013. The first initiative, to improve its  oversight of the Medicaid UPL and state UPL supplemental payments,  requires additional state reporting, but gaps remain.  Beginning in June 2013, states were required to annually submit to CMS documentation of  their Medicaid UPL calculations and provider-specific payment  information. Previously, CMS had performed reviews of UPL  calculations only when a state submitted a proposal to revise existing  payments or add new payments in its state plan. Despite the new  guidance and new reporting requirements, data gaps and challenges  remain that limit CMS\u2019s ability to oversee payments. CMS has not  specified a standardized data reporting format, including the key data  states should report on providers and payments, such as NPIs for each  provider and actual supplemental payments. As a result, some states  may not report actual supplemental payments they make and, without  NPIs, CMS is currently unable to merge UPL supplemental payments with  regular claims-based payment data in MSIS.", "CMS\u2019s second initiative, to improve MSIS, is intended to collect provider- specific ownership and supplemental payment information. CMS is  developing the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T- MSIS)\u2014an enhanced Medicaid data system\u2014to replace MSIS. T-MSIS  will require states to report additional information to CMS that is not  currently collected in MSIS, including provider-specific information on   The agency  supplemental payments received and provider ownership. has cited T-MSIS as a key tool for providing the federal government and  states with better information with which to manage and monitor Medicaid  program integrity, including identifying waste, fraud, and abuse.However, there is uncertainty about when T-MSIS will be operational. In  December 2014, CMS officials reported that the agency was still working  on stabilizing its data systems to begin accepting state claims data  through T-MSIS as states pass testing and are found by CMS to be   ready to transition to T-MSIS. In December 2014, 18 states were in the  final testing phases, and, depending on the nature of remaining issues  with their data, these states could be ready for full implementation in   2 months. However, officials were uncertain when all states would be  capable of reporting claims and payment information via T-MSIS. In  addition, it is uncertain when states will be able to report all of the new  data required under T-MSIS. According to CMS officials, some states  have had problems reporting some of this information, particularly  provider ownership information. Officials were also uncertain about  whether all of the issues we encountered with the existing claims data  submitted by states through MSIS would be addressed when T-MSIS was  fully operational. For example, when we reported that some states were  reporting state-assigned provider numbers rather than NPIs, reporting  multiple NPIs for one provider, or reporting incorrect and inaccurate NPIs,  officials said that under T-MSIS there will be a cross-walk between  provider NPIs and state-issued provider identification numbers that states  use in processing claims. However, beyond looking for obvious errors in  formatting of the NPI numbers, such as incorrect values or provider  numbers that are too short or too long, CMS will not identify erroneous  NPI numbers. Officials said errors involving providers with multiple NPIs  or NPIs assigned to the wrong provider are identified when the data are  analyzed for oversight and monitoring purposes.", "In addition to these two initiatives, CMS officials told us they are also  considering ways to improve data for overseeing payments at the  provider level. As part of this effort, in May 2014, CMS contracted a study  to, among other things, (1) analyze documentation on regular and UPL  supplemental payments that states began submitting in 2013 to  determine opportunities for improvement in CMS oversight; (2) store that  information in a standardized format to enable analysis to be performed at  both the aggregate and the provider-specific levels; and (3) assess the  utility of T-MSIS data for the purpose of assisting CMS oversight of  Medicaid UPL payments.

Further, our analysis showing the wide ranges in hospitals\u2019  average daily payments, and high payments over costs to certain  government and private hospitals, raises further questions about federal  oversight of states\u2019 payments to individual institutional providers, both  government and private. Provider payments that are tens of millions of  dollars, and in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars, greater than  providers\u2019 costs raise questions about whether such payments are  consistent with economy and efficiency as required by law and the extent  to which the payments are ultimately used for Medicaid purposes.  Medicaid payments that exceed the total costs of operating the hospital  raise, even further, questions as to their appropriateness. Moreover, the  fact that CMS is largely unaware of the extent to which state Medicaid  payments exceed Medicaid costs to certain providers highlights the  shortcoming of its current approach to overseeing state Medicaid  payments. To oversee state Medicaid payments to individual providers,  CMS needs accurate and complete provider payment data, as well as a  policy and process for reviewing payments made to individual providers.
