GAO assessed (1) DOE's reported accomplishments for the IPP program, (2) DOE's exit strategy for the program, and (3) the extent to which the program has experienced annual carryovers of unspent funds and the reasons for any such carryovers. To address these issues, GAO analyzed DOE policies, plans, and budgets and interviewed key program officials and representatives from 22 Russian and Ukrainian institutes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOE has overstated accomplishments for the 2 critical measures it uses to assess the IPP program's progress and performance--the number of scientists receiving DOE support and the number of long-term, private sector jobs created. First, although DOE claims to have engaged over 16,770 scientists in Russia and other countries, this total includes both scientists with and without weapons-related experience. GAO's analysis of 97 IPP projects involving about 6,450 scientists showed that more than half did not claim to possess any weapons-related experience. Furthermore, officials from 10 Russian and Ukrainian institutes told GAO that the IPP program helps them attract, recruit, and retain younger scientists who might otherwise emigrate to the United States or other western countries and contributes to the continued operation of their facilities. This is contrary to the original intent of the program, which was to reduce the proliferation risk posed by Soviet-era weapons scientists. Second, although DOE asserts that the IPP program helped create 2,790 long-term, private sector jobs for former weapons scientists, the credibility of this number is uncertain because DOE relies on \"good-faith\" reporting from U.S. industry partners and foreign institutes on the number of jobs created and does not independently verify the number of jobs reported to have been created. DOE has not developed an exit strategy for the IPP program, even though officials from the Russian government, Russian and Ukrainian institutes, and U.S. companies raised questions about the continuing need for the program. Importantly, a senior Russian Atomic Energy Agency official told GAO that the IPP program is no longer relevant because Russia's economy is strong and its scientists no longer pose a proliferation risk. DOE has not developed criteria to determine when scientists, institutes, or countries should \"graduate\" from the program. In contrast, the Department of State (State), which supports a similar program to assist Soviet-era weapons scientists, has assessed participating institutes and developed a strategy to graduate certain institutes from its program. Instead of finding ways to phase out the IPP program, DOE has recently expanded the program to include new countries and areas. Specifically, in 2004, DOE began providing assistance to scientists in Iraq and Libya. In addition, the IPP program is working with DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy to develop projects that support the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership--a DOE-led international effort to expand the use of civilian nuclear power. In every fiscal year since 1998, DOE carried over unspent funds in excess of the amount that the Congress provided for the program. For example, as of September 2007, DOE carried over about $30 million in unspent funds--$2 million more than the $28 million that the Congress had appropriated for the IPP program in fiscal year 2007. Two main factors have contributed to this recurring problem--lengthy review and approval processes for paying former Soviet weapons scientists and delays in implementing some IPP projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the decades before its dissolution, the Soviet Union produced a  cadre of scientists and engineers whose knowledge and expertise would  be invaluable to countries or terrorist groups trying to develop weapons of  mass destruction (WMD). After the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, many  of these scientists suffered significant cuts in pay or lost their government- supported work. The United States and other countries were concerned  that these scientists would sell their expertise to terrorists or countries of  concern, such as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. To address this potential  proliferation concern, the Department of Energy (DOE) established the  Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program in 1994. The  objectives of the IPP program, which is implemented by the National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), are to (1) in the short term,  engage weapons scientists and scientific research and development  institutes located in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union  in nonmilitary work by supplementing their existing salaries and (2) in the  long term, create sustainable, private sector jobs for former weapons  scientists. As of April 2007, DOE reported it had supplemented the salaries  of over 16,770 scientists, engineers, and technicians and created 2,790  long-term, private sector jobs in Russia and other countries of the former  Soviet Union.", "Through October 1, 2007, there were 929 draft, active, inactive, and  completed IPP projects involving personnel at about 200 nuclear,  chemical, and biological institutes in Russia and other countries. Many IPP  projects involve more than one institute, and sometimes a single project  will involve institutes in more than one country. Over 80 percent of the  projects are focused on institutes in Russia, and the majority of these  projects involve scientists and institutes specializing in nuclear weapons- related work. Other countries that currently participate or have  participated in the IPP program include Armenia, Belarus, Georgia,  Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.", "For each IPP project, DOE requires that at least 65 percent of the project\u2019s  funding go to Russia and other countries as payments to individuals  actually working on the project or to the participating institutes in  payment for project-related supplies, equipment, and overhead. Because  the IPP program is not administered through a government-to-government  agreement, as are many other U.S. nonproliferation programs, DOE  distributes funding for IPP projects through three tax-exempt entities to  avoid paying foreign taxes: the International Science and Technology  Center (ISTC) in Russia, the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine  (STCU), and the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation  (CRDF). These organizations transfer IPP funds directly to the personal  bank accounts of IPP project participants in Russia and other countries.  To receive payment for work on IPP projects, project participants must  submit paperwork to these organizations indicating, among other things,  whether they possess WMD experience.", "Project proposals under the IPP program are prepared and submitted to  DOE by officials from the participating national laboratories, although a  project may also result from the initiative of a foreign institute or U.S.  company. Each participating DOE national laboratory provides technical  and financial oversight over a set of projects. Partnerships are formed by  the national laboratories between U.S. companies\u2014known as industry  partners\u2014and institutes in Russia and other countries. Industry partners  are engaged in projects through Cooperative Research and Development  Agreements with the participating DOE national laboratories, which  require cost-sharing to develop technologies for commercial application.  An Inter-Laboratory Board (ILAB) serves as the primary coordinating body  for the national laboratories involved in the IPP program. The ILAB  coordinates, reviews, and facilitates the activities of the participating  national laboratories and makes recommendations to DOE on how to  implement the program. Ultimate decision-making authority lies with the  DOE headquarters IPP program office.", "To improve the potential of IPP projects to create sustainable jobs in  Russia and other countries, DOE requires that a U.S. industry partner be  identified before it approves and funds a project. A consortium of U.S.  industry partners\u2014the United States Industry Coalition (USIC)\u2014was  established in 1994. To participate in the IPP program, a company must  become a member of USIC and pay dues based on its size. USIC reviews  IPP project proposals for commercial potential and requires that all  project proposals have the basic outline of a business plan for  commercializing the technology involved. In addition, USIC annually  surveys its member companies to determine the commercial results of IPP  projects, such as the number of long-term, private sector jobs created.  DOE uses the results of USIC\u2019s surveys to report to the Congress on the  number of jobs the IPP program created.", "DOE\u2019s IPP program is one of several nonproliferation programs focused  on reducing the potential proliferation risks posed by scientists from  Russia and other countries. Other such programs include the Science  Centers program funded by the U.S. government\u2014under the auspices of  the Department of State (State)\u2014and other nations; CRDF; and a variety  of initiatives primarily focused on biological institutes and implemented by  the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, and  State. In addition, from 1998 through 2006, DOE administered the Nuclear  Cities Initiative, whose goal was to create sustainable jobs for weapons  scientists in Russia\u2019s closed nuclear cities and to help Russia accelerate  the downsizing of its nuclear weapons complex. The government-to- government agreement between the United States and Russia governing  this program expired and was not renewed, and, as a result, the program  was terminated in September 2006.", "In 1999, we reviewed the IPP program and made several recommendations  to improve its management, including recommending that DOE (1) obtain  more accurate data on the background and number of scientists  participating in the program, (2) maximize the amount of funds going to  former Soviet Union weapons institutes, and (3) eliminate projects that do  not have commercial potential. The Congress, among other things,  subsequently prohibited DOE from using IPP program funding, available  after fiscal year 1999, to supplement the income of scientists and engineers  who (1) are currently engaged in activities directly related to the design,  development, production, or testing of chemical or biological WMD or a  missile system to deliver such weapons or (2) were not formerly engaged  in activities directly related to the design, development, production, or  testing of WMD or a missile delivery system for such weapons. The  Congress also prohibited DOE from funding any institute or scientist  determined by the Secretary of Energy to have made a scientific or  business contact about WMD with a representative of a \u201ccountry of  proliferation concern.\u201d", "In this context, you asked us to review the IPP program. As agreed with  your office, we assessed (1) DOE\u2019s reported accomplishments for the IPP  program, (2) DOE\u2019s exit strategy for the IPP program, and (3) the extent to  which the IPP program has experienced annual carryover balances of  unspent funds and the reasons for such carryover.", "To address these objectives, we examined 207 of the 929 IPP projects. We  selected this judgmental sample of draft, active, inactive, and completed  projects on the basis of a variety of factors, such as geographic  distribution, representation of all participating national laboratories, and  project costs. Of the 207 projects in our sample, we received or were able  to reconstruct information on payments to project participants for 97  projects. We interviewed key officials and analyzed documentation, such  as program guidance, project proposals, and financial information, from  DOE and its contractors at the Argonne, Brookhaven, Idaho, Lawrence  Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, National  Renewable Energy, Pacific Northwest, Sandia, and Savannah River  National Laboratories; the Kansas City Plant; and Defense and State. We  interviewed officials from 15 Russian and 7 Ukrainian institutes that  participate in the IPP program. We also spoke with officials from the  Federal Agency for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, which  oversees institutes involved in Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons program.  Furthermore, we interviewed officials from 14 U.S. companies that  participate in the IPP program to better understand their perspective on  the program\u2019s benefits and its implementation. In addition, we analyzed  cost and budgetary information from DOE, DOE\u2019s national laboratories,  CRDF, ISTC, and STCU. We interviewed knowledgeable officials on the  reliability of these data, including issues such as data entry, access, quality  control procedures, and the accuracy and completeness of the data. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this review. Appendix I provides more details on our scope and  methodology, and appendix II provides more detailed information on the  institutes that we visited in Russia and Ukraine. We conducted our review  from October 2006 through December 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Historically, IPP projects were placed in one of three categories\u2014Thrust 1,  Thrust 2, and Thrust 3. DOE now only supports Thrust 2 projects.  Specifically:    Thrust 1 projects were geared toward technology identification and  verification and focused on \u201claboratory-to-laboratory\u201d collaboration, or  direct contact between DOE\u2019s national laboratories and weapons institutes  and scientists in the former Soviet Union. These projects had no industry  partner and, according to DOE, were entered into to quickly engage  former Soviet weapons scientists and their institutes. DOE funded 447  Thrust 1 projects, 378 of which were completed. DOE no longer supports  Thrust 1 projects.", "Thrust 2 projects involve a U.S. industry partner that agrees to share in the  costs of the project with DOE to further develop potential technologies.  The U.S. industry partner is expected to match the funds DOE provides,  either by providing in-kind support, such as employee time and equipment,  or by providing cash. Through October 2007, there were 479 IPP projects  in the Thrust 2 category.", "Thrust 3 projects, with the exception of 1 project, did not receive any  financial support from DOE and were intended to be self-sustaining  business ventures. DOE no longer supports Thrust 3 projects. There were  only three Thrust 3 projects and the last project was completed in 2001.", "All proposed IPP projects are reviewed by DOE\u2019s national laboratories; the  IPP program office; and other agencies, including Defense and State,  before they are approved for funding. Initially, a national laboratory  proposes a project for consideration. As the national laboratory prepares  the proposal, the laboratory project manager, generally referred to as the  \u201cprincipal investigator,\u201d is responsible for including, among other things, a  list of intended participants and for designating the WMD experience for  each participant. The proposed participants are assigned to one of the  following three categories:    Category I\u2014direct experience in WMD research, development, design,  production, or testing;   Category II\u2014indirect WMD experience in the underlying technologies of  potential use in WMD; or   Category III\u2014no WMD-relevant experience.", "If the IPP project is approved, DOE transfers funding to the project  participants using payment mechanisms at CRDF, ISTC, or STCU. To be  paid by any of these entities, the project participants must self-declare  whether they possess weapons experience and indicate a more specific  category of WMD expertise, such as basic knowledge of nuclear weapons  design, construction, and characteristics. The weapons category  classifications these scientists declare are certified first by the foreign  institute\u2019s director and then by the foreign government ministry overseeing  the institute. See appendix III for a more detailed list of the WMD  categories used by DOE, CRDF, ISTC, and STCU.", "After the project passes an initial review within the proposing national  laboratory, it is further analyzed by the ILAB and its technical committees,  which then forward the project proposal to DOE headquarters for review.  DOE, in turn, consults with State and other U.S. government agencies on  policy, nonproliferation, and coordination considerations. The IPP  program office at DOE headquarters is ultimately responsible for making  final decisions, including funding, on all projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Overstated the Progress Made on Key Performance Measures, Raising Doubts about the IPP Program\u2019s Nonproliferation Benefits", "paragraphs": ["DOE has not accurately portrayed the IPP program\u2019s progress, according  to our analysis of two key measures used to assess the program\u2019s  performance\u2014the number of WMD scientists receiving DOE support and  the number of long-term, private sector jobs created. Many of the  scientists in Russia and other countries that DOE has paid through its IPP  program did not claim to have WMD experience. Furthermore, DOE\u2019s  process for substantiating the weapons backgrounds of IPP project  participants has several weaknesses, including limited information about  the backgrounds of scientists proposed for an IPP project. In addition,  DOE has overstated the rate at which weapons scientists have been  employed in long-term, private sector jobs because it does not  independently verify the data it receives on the number of jobs created,  relies on estimates of job creation, and includes in its count a large  number of part-time jobs that were created. Finally, DOE has not revised  the IPP program\u2019s performance metrics, which are currently based on a  1991 assessment of the threat posed by former Soviet weapons scientists."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE Has Supplemented the Salaries of Many Scientists in Russia and Other Countries Who Did Not Claim Direct Experience with WMD", "paragraphs": ["A major goal of the IPP program is to engage former Soviet weapons  scientists, engineers, and technicians, and DOE claims to have  supplemented the incomes of over 16,770 of these individuals since the  program\u2019s inception. However, this number is misleading because DOE  officials told us that this figure includes both personnel with WMD  experience and those without any WMD experience. We reviewed the  payment records of 97 IPP projects, for which information was available  and complete, and found that 54 percent, or 3,472, of the 6,453 participants  in these projects did not claim to possess any WMD experience in the  declarations they made concerning their backgrounds. Moreover, project  participants who did not claim any WMD experience received 40 percent,  or approximately $10.1 million, of the $25.1 million paid to personnel on  these projects. For example, in 1 project to develop a high-power  accelerator that was funded for $1 million, 88 percent, or 66, of the   75 participants who have received payments did not claim any previous  weapons-related experience.", "On a project-by-project basis, we also found that DOE is not complying  with a requirement of its own guidance for the IPP program\u2014that is, each  IPP project must have a minimum of 60 percent of the project\u2019s  participants possessing WMD-relevant experience prior to 1991 (i.e.,  Soviet-era WMD experience). According to our analysis of the payment  records of 97 projects for which information was available and complete,  we found that 60 percent, or 58, of the 97 projects did not meet this  requirement. A factor contributing to this outcome may be a poor  understanding of the IPP program guidance among the ILAB  representatives of the 12 national laboratories participating in the  program. During our interviews with national laboratory officials, we  heard a range of opinions on the appropriate minimum percentage of  WMD scientists on individual IPP projects. For example, ILAB  representatives from 5 national laboratories indicated that they strive for a  minimum of 50 percent of WMD scientists on each IPP project; the ILAB  representative from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated a  goal of 55 percent. The ILAB representative from the National Renewable  Energy Laboratory indicated that he was not aware of any DOE policy  establishing a minimum percentage of participants with WMD  backgrounds on an IPP project.", "Finally, many IPP project participants that DOE supports are too young to  have supported the Soviet Union\u2019s WMD programs. Officials at 10 of the   22 Russian and Ukrainian institutes we interviewed said that IPP program  funds have allowed their institutes to recruit, hire, and retain younger  scientists. We found that 15 percent, or 972, of the 6,453 participants in the  payment records of the 97 projects we reviewed were born in 1970 or later  and, therefore, were unlikely to have contributed to Soviet-era WMD  efforts. This group of younger participants received approximately   14 percent, or about $3.6 million, of $25.1 million paid to project  participants in the 97 projects we reviewed.", "While DOE guidance for the IPP program does not specifically prohibit  participation of younger scientists in IPP projects, DOE has not clearly  stated the proliferation risk posed by younger scientists and the extent to  which they should be a focus of the IPP program. The absence of a clear  policy on this matter has contributed to confusion and lack of consensus  among national laboratory officials involved in the program about the  extent to which younger scientists, rather than older, more experienced  WMD experts, should be involved in IPP projects. For example, the ILAB  representative at the Argonne National Laboratory told us that it would be  appropriate to question the participation of personnel born in the   mid-1960s or later since they most likely lacked weapons-related  experience. A representative at the Los Alamos National Laboratory who  has been involved with the IPP program for over a decade said that the  program should engage \u201csecond-generation\u201d scientists born in 1980 or  later because doing so can help create opportunities for \u201cthird- and fourth- generation\u201d scientists at facilities in Russia and other countries in the  future. Senior officials at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  told us that scientists in Russia and other countries, regardless of their age  or actual experience in weapons-related programs, should be included in  IPP projects because weapons expertise can be passed from one  generation to the next."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Lacks Necessary Information and a Rigorous, Formalized Review Process to Assess the WMD Credentials of IPP Project Participants", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, we recommended that, to the extent possible, DOE should obtain  more accurate data on the number and background of scientists  participating in IPP program projects. DOE told us that it has made  improvements in this area, including development of a classification  system for WMD experts, hiring a full-time employee responsible for  reviewing the WMD experience and backgrounds of IPP project  participants, and conducting annual project reviews. DOE relies heavily on  the statements of WMD experience that IPP project participants declare  when they submit paperwork to receive payment for work on IPP projects.  However, we found that DOE lacks an adequate and well-documented  process for evaluating, verifying, and monitoring the number and WMD  experience level of individuals participating in IPP projects.", "According to DOE officials, all IPP projects are scrutinized carefully and  subjected to at least 8, and in some cases 10, stages of review to assess  and validate the WMD experience of the project participants.  Responsibility for verifying the WMD experience and backgrounds of IPP  project participants rests not only with DOE, but with the national  laboratories, other federal agencies, and the entities responsible for  transmitting funding to the scientists in Russia and other countries (CRDF,  ISTC, or STCU). However, the ultimate responsibility for this assessment  rests with DOE\u2019s IPP program office. Table 1 provides an overview of the  different stages involved in DOE\u2019s assessment of IPP project participants\u2019  WMD backgrounds.", "In reviewing project documentation and in our discussions with officials  responsible for conducting these reviews, we found limitations throughout  this multistage assessment process. Specifically:    DOE has limited information to verify the WMD experience of personnel  proposed for IPP projects because government officials in Russia and  other countries are reluctant to provide information about their countries\u2019  scientists. For example, ISTC officials told us that the Russian government  refuses to provide r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for scientists involved in projects funded by  the Science Centers program, including IPP projects that use the ISTC  payment process; while CRDF officials indicated that both the Russian and  Ukrainian governments have shown increasing resistance to the policy  requiring the scientists to declare their WMD-related experience. Three  national laboratory officials stated that it is illegal under Russian law to  ask project participants about their backgrounds, and that instead they  make judgments regarding the WMD experience of the project participants  on the basis of their personal knowledge and anecdotal information.", "Some IPP project proposals may advance from the national laboratories  for consideration by DOE with insufficient vetting or understanding of all  personnel who are to be engaged on the project. Contrary to the process  DOE laid out for the review of the WMD scientists\u2019 backgrounds, senior  representatives at five national laboratories told us that they and their  project managers do not have sufficient time or the means to verify the  credentials of the proposed project participants. Furthermore, they believe  that DOE is primarily responsible for substantiating the weapons  experience of the individuals who are to be engaged in the projects.", "DOE does not have a well-documented process for verifying the WMD  experience of IPP project participants, and, as a result, it is unclear  whether DOE has a reliable sense of the proliferation risk these  individuals pose. DOE\u2019s review of the WMD credentials of proposed  project participants relies heavily on the determinations of the IPP  program office. We examined the proposal review files that the program  maintains, and we were unable to find adequate documentation to  substantiate the depth or effectiveness of the program office\u2019s review of  the WMD experience of proposed IPP project participants. DOE officials  noted that they do not usually check the weapons backgrounds of every  individual listed in an IPP project proposal, but only the key project  scientists and a few of the personnel working with them. Specifically, in  none of the IPP project files that we reviewed did we find formal, written  documentation analyzing and substantiating the WMD backgrounds and  proliferation risks of the personnel to be engaged in those IPP projects.  Each of these files did, however, contain a comprehensive formal  assessment by DOE\u2019s Office of International Regimes and Agreements  analyzing export control issues and compliance with U.S. nonproliferation  laws.", "Officials at the three organizations DOE uses to make tax-free payments  for IPP projects\u2014CRDF, ISTC, and STCU\u2014also downplayed their  organizations\u2019 ability to validate the backgrounds of the scientists  participating in IPP projects. CRDF officials stated that their organization  has not independently validated any of the weapons backgrounds of the  participating scientists, and they do not consider that a responsibility  under CRDF\u2019s contract with DOE. Similarly, ISTC officials told us that  their organization cannot verify the backgrounds of scientists in projects  funded by the Science Centers program, including IPP projects that use  the ISTC payment process, and instead relies on the foreign institute\u2019s  certification of the project participants. Finally, STCU relies on the  validation provided by the foreign institute\u2019s director, and verifies this  information in annual project reviews during which a sample of project  participants are interviewed to confirm their WMD experience.", "Because it can be a matter of months or longer between development of  an IPP project proposal and project implementation, the list of personnel  who are actually paid on a project can differ substantially from the  proposed list of scientists. For several IPP projects we reviewed, we did  not find documentation in DOE\u2019s project files indicating that the  department was notified of the change of staff or had assessed the WMD  backgrounds of the new project participants. For example, 1 IPP project\u2014 to discover new bioactive compounds in Russia and explore their  commercial application\u2014originally proposed 27 personnel and was  funded at $1 million. However, 152 personnel were eventually paid under  this project, and we did not find an updated list of the project personnel or  any indication of a subsequent review of the additional personnel by DOE  in the IPP project files. In another project to develop straw-fired boilers in  Ukraine funded at $936,100, DOE reviewed the backgrounds of 18  personnel who were part of the project proposal. However, CRDF  payment records indicated that 24 personnel were subsequently paid on  the project, only 5 of whom were listed in the original proposal DOE had  reviewed and approved. As a result, it is unclear whether DOE conducts  sufficient oversight on changes in the number or composition of the  workforce involved in IPP projects. For its part, CRDF informed us that  when an institute requests a change in project staff and that change is  approved by the participating national laboratory, CRDF does not report  these changes to DOE, but relies on the national laboratory to notify  relevant DOE officials.", "The limited information DOE obtains about IPP project participants and  the weaknesses in DOE\u2019s review of the backgrounds of these individuals  leave the IPP program vulnerable to potential misallocation of funds. In  our review, we found several examples that call into question DOE\u2019s  ability to adequately evaluate IPP project participants\u2019 backgrounds before  the projects are approved and funded. For example:    A National Renewable Energy Laboratory official told us he was confident  that a Russian institute involved in a $250,000 IPP project he oversaw to  monitor microorganisms under environmental stress was supporting  Soviet-era biological weapons scientists. However, during our visit to the  institute in July 2007, the Russian project leader told us that neither he nor  his institute was ever involved in biological weapons research. As a result  of this meeting, DOE canceled this project on July 31, 2007. DOE\u2019s  cancellation letter stated that the information provided during our visit led  to this action. It further stated, \u201cit is well documented in statute and in the   General Program Guidance that our projects must engage  Russians, and others, with relevant weapons of mass destruction or  strategic delivery means backgrounds. Violation of this requirement is an  extremely serious matter.\u201d", "In November 2006, DOE canceled a project in Ukraine intended to develop  a new type of fuel combustion system, 18 months after approving the  project and after spending about $76,000. DOE canceled this project when  it discovered an inadequate number of personnel with WMD backgrounds  involved in the project and after a Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)  audit revealed other irregularities, including a conflict of interest between  the primary Ukrainian institute and the U.S. partner company. During the  interagency review of the project proposal, State officials questioned the  primary Ukrainian institute\u2019s involvement in WMD. However, in our review  of DOE\u2019s project files, we did not find evidence that these concerns  triggered a more-intensive evaluation of this institute by DOE prior to the  project\u2019s approval.", "A 2005 DCAA audit found that 90 percent of the participants on an IPP  project administered by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory lacked  WMD experience. This project, which was designed to develop improved  biological contamination detectors, was funded at $492,739. Officials at the  national laboratory insisted that DCAA \u201cwas just plain wrong.\u201d DOE and  national laboratory officials asserted that the project participants were  under instruction not to discuss their weapons involvement and, on the  basis of their personal knowledge of the Russian project leader and the  institute, they believed the project participants constituted a proliferation  risk. However, according to the payment records we reviewed, the Russian  project leader and other scientists involved in the project were not  prevented from declaring their WMD backgrounds to CRDF. Such  conflicting accounts, the absence of clear information, and the judgments  made by IPP program officials in assessing the proliferation risks posed by  IPP project participants underscore the difficulties the program faces and  the possibility that the program is funding personnel who do not constitute  a proliferation risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Overstated the Number of Former Weapons Scientists Reemployed in Long-term, Private Sector Jobs", "paragraphs": ["Although a senior DOE official described commercialization as the  \u201cflagship\u201d of the IPP program, we found that the program\u2019s  commercialization achievements have been overstated and are misleading,  further eroding the perceived nonproliferation benefits of the program. In  the most recent annual report for the IPP program available at the time of  our review, DOE indicated that 50 projects had evolved to support 32  commercially successful activities. DOE reported that these   32 commercial successes had helped create or support 2,790 new private  sector jobs for former weapon scientists in Russia and other countries. In  reviewing these projects, we identified several factors that raise concerns  over the validity of the IPP program\u2019s reported commercial success and  the numbers of scientists employed in private sector jobs. For example:    The annual survey instrument that USIC distributes to collect information  on job creation and other commercial successes of IPP projects relies on  \u201cgood-faith\u201d responses from U.S. industry partners and foreign institutes,  which are not audited by DOE or USIC. In 9 of the 32 cases, we found that  DOE based its job creation claims on estimates or other assumptions. For  example, an official from a large U.S. company told us that the number of  jobs it reported to have helped create was his own rough estimate. He told  us he derived the job total by estimating the amount of money that the  company was spending at Russian and Ukrainian institutes and dividing  that total by the average salary for Russian engineers in the company\u2019s  Moscow office.", "We could not substantiate many of the jobs reported to have been created  in our interviews with the U.S. companies and officials at the Russian and  Ukrainian institutes where these commercial activities were reportedly  developed, due to conflicting information and accounts. For example,  officials from 1 U.S. company we interviewed claimed that 250 jobs at   2 institutes in Russia had been created, on the basis of 2 separate IPP  projects. However, during our visit to the Scientific Research Institute of  Measuring Systems to discuss one of these projects, we were told that the  project is still under way, manufacturing of the product has not started,  and none of the scientists have been reemployed in commercial  production of the technology. Similarly, during our site visit, officials at  the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences  could not confirm the creation of 350 jobs they had reported as a result of  several IPP projects relating to the production of radioisotopes. They  indicated that no more than 160 personnel were employed at their institute  in commercial activities stemming from those IPP projects, that most of  these jobs were only part time, and that they could not account for jobs  that may have been created at other institutes previously involved in the  projects. \u201cA product, process, or service is generating revenue from sales or other economic value  added in the  or the U.S., based on an IPP project (either completed  or ongoing); and/or there is a private contractual relationship between the U.S. industry  partner and the  institute covering research and development work to  be done by the institute for the U.S. industry partner growing out of an IPP project.\u201d", "The lack of consensus among DOE and national laboratory officials  involved in the IPP program on a common commercialization definition  has created confusion and disagreement on which IPP projects should be  considered commercially successful. For example, DOE counted as a  commercial success one IPP project administered by the Pacific  Northwest National Laboratory to facilitate biodegradation of oil spills.  However, the national laboratory officials responsible for this project  disagreed with DOE\u2019s characterization, in part because the project has not  generated any commercial revenues.", "Furthermore, DOE\u2019s broad-based definition of commercialization has  allowed it to overstate its commercialization accomplishments to include  part-time jobs created from and revenues derived from grants or contract  research. Specifically:    DOE counts part-time private sector jobs created, even if the scientists  employed in these part-time jobs also continue to work at the former  Soviet weapons institute. DOE policy does not require scientists  employed in a private sector activity resulting from an IPP project to sever  their relationship with their institute. In fact, in our review of the 2,790  jobs created, we found that 898, or nearly one third, of these jobs were  part-time jobs, meaning that the scientists in some cases may still be  affiliated with the institutes and involved in weapons-applicable research.", "The sources of revenue for some commercially successful IPP projects  also call into question the long-term sustainability of some of the jobs  created. DOE reported that $22.1 million in total revenue was generated by  the foreign institutes or their spin-off companies as a result of commercial  activities stemming from IPP projects. Of this total, approximately   $4.5 million, or 20 percent, consisted of grants (including grants from the  Russian government); contract research; and other sources of income that  appear to be of limited duration, that are not based on commercial sales,  and that may not offer a sustainable long-term source of revenue. For  example, DOE reported that 510 jobs were created at the Kurchatov  Institute and other Russian institutes as the result of an IPP project to  develop thorium-based fuels for use in nuclear reactors. However, we  found that over 400 of those jobs were supported by a separate DOE  contract to evaluate the use of thorium fuels for plutonium disposition.  The Russian project participants told us that over 500 workers were  supported while receiving funding from the 2 DOE sources, but the project  is now completed, it has not been commercialized, and there are no more  than 12 personnel currently involved in efforts related to the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Not Revised the IPP Program\u2019s Performance Metrics to Reflect Updated Threat Information", "paragraphs": ["The IPP program\u2019s long-term performance targets do not accurately reflect  the size and nature of the threat the program is intended to address  because DOE is basing the program\u2019s performance measures on outdated  information.

However, DOE bases these targets on a 16-year-old, 1991 National  Academy of Sciences (NAS) assessment that had estimated approximately  60,000 at-risk WMD experts in Russia and other countries in the former  Soviet Union. DOE derived 17,000 scientists as its share of the total target  population by subtracting from the NAS estimate the number of WMD  scientists engaged by other U.S. government and international WMD  scientist assistance programs (such as State\u2019s Science Centers program)  and making assumptions about attrition rates in the former Soviet WMD  workforce.", "DOE officials acknowledged that the 1991 NAS study does not provide an  accurate assessment of the current threat posed by WMD scientists in  Russia and other countries. A 2005 DOE-commissioned study by the RAND  Corporation estimated that the population of unemployed or  underemployed weapons scientists in Russia and other former Soviet  states had decreased significantly. The RAND study provided rough  revised estimates of the number of WMD scientists in the former Soviet  Union, and DOE acknowledged in 2006 that the target population of WMD  experts in the former Soviet Union had dropped from the 1991 NAS  estimate of 60,000 to approximately 35,000 individuals. However, DOE has  not formally updated its performance metrics for the IPP program and, in  its fiscal year 2008 budget justification, continued to base its long-term  program targets on the 1991 NAS estimate.", "Moreover, DOE\u2019s current metrics for the IPP program are not complete or  meaningful indicators of the proliferation risk posed by weapons scientists  in Russia and other countries and, therefore, do not provide sufficient  information to the Congress on the program\u2019s progress in reducing the  threat posed by former Soviet WMD scientists. The total number of  scientists supported by IPP grants or employed in private sector jobs  conveys a level of program accomplishment, but these figures are broad  measures that do not describe progress in redirecting WMD expertise  within specific countries or at institutes of highest proliferation concern.  DOE has recognized this weakness in the IPP program metrics and  recently initiated the program\u2019s first systematic analysis to understand the  scope of the proliferation risk at individual institutes in the former Soviet  Union. DOE believes that setting priorities for providing support to foreign  institutes is necessary because (1) the economies in Russia and the other  countries of the former Soviet Union have improved since the program\u2019s  inception, (2) former \u201cat-risk\u201d institutes are now solvent, and (3) the threat  of mass migration of former Soviet weapons scientists has subsided.  However, DOE believes that a concern remains over the \u201ctargeted  recruitment\u201d of scientists and former WMD personnel. DOE officials  briefed us on their efforts in September 2007, but told us that the analysis  is still under way, and that it would not be completed until 2008.

Russian officials told us  that the overall financial condition of the institute has improved markedly  because of increased funding from the government as well as funds from  DOE. In addition, one institute we visited in Ukraine had recently  undergone a $500,000 renovation, complete with a marble foyer and a  collection of fine art.

DOE then transfers funding to the  Oak Ridge Financial Service Center, which pays the invoice by transferring  funds to ISTC or STCU. The funds arrive at ISTC or STCU, which  disburses them in quarterly payments to IPP project participants, upon  receipt of project invoices, quarterly technical reports, and documentation  from the participating former Soviet Union institutes that deliverables  were sent to the national laboratories. However, DOE and national  laboratory officials told us that this payment process has limitations.  Specifically, these officials told us that if there is a problem with a  deliverable, it is usually too late for DOE or the participating national  laboratory to request that ISTC or STCU stop the payment to the project  participants for the current quarter.", "The other two processes that DOE uses to make payments to IPP project  participants involve CRDF. In most cases, DOE administers the CRDF  payment process through a subcontract with the participating national  laboratory. In some rare cases, DOE contracts directly with foreign  institutes through a CRDF \u201cmaster contract.\u201d For projects that use CRDF  to process payments, the entire amount of project funding is first  transferred to the participating national laboratory, where it is placed in  two separate accounts. The first account consists of no more than 30  percent of project funding for oversight costs incurred by the national  laboratory. The second account has all funding for the foreign project  participants, which is at least 70 percent of project funding.", "As figure 3 illustrates, before IPP project participants receive payment  from CRDF, invoices and approvals of deliverables from the national  laboratories, as well as CRDF forms, are sent to DOE headquarters for  approval. DOE headquarters reviews the invoices against the contract and,  if the amounts match, approves them and sends documentation to the  DOE Procurement Office. DOE headquarters also notifies the participating  national laboratory of its approval, and the laboratory sends the funds  listed on the invoices to DOE\u2019s Energy Finance and Accounting Service  Center. The DOE Procurement Office approves payment on project  invoices and notifies CRDF and DOE\u2019s Energy Finance and Accounting  Service Center that payments should be made. Funds are then transferred  from the Energy Finance and Accounting Service Center to the Oak Ridge  Financial Service Center and then to CRDF. Once CRDF has received the  funds and the necessary approvals from DOE, it makes payments to the  project participants\u2019 bank accounts.", "DOE officials acknowledged the enormity of the problem that the lag time  between the allocation of funds, placement of contracts, and payment for  deliverables creates for the IPP program and told us they are taking steps  to streamline their payment processes. In addition, Russian and Ukrainian  scientists at 9 of the 22 institutes we interviewed told us that they  experienced delays in payments ranging from 3 months to 1 year. Among  the 207 projects we reviewed, we found several examples of payment  delays. For example:  In one project on the development and testing of a device to detect hidden  explosives, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory official who  heads the project told us that the U.S. industry partner had to pay Russian  scientists\u2019 salaries until IPP funding could be released. Lawrence  Livermore officials involved in this project noted that delays in payments  to project participants slowed the project\u2019s completion.", "Officials at another Russian institute told us about two projects that  experienced payment delays. On the project to develop nuclear material  container security devices, they had shipped a deliverable to Sandia  National Laboratories in October 2006, but it took more than 4 months for  them to receive payment. On the project to produce a new computer  modeling code for use in Russian nuclear reactor simulators, Russian  institute officials told us payments were delayed 3 to 4 months. Officials  said that when they asked Brookhaven National Laboratory officials about  the delay, they were told it was due to DOE\u2019s complex payment processing  systems.", "Delays in implementing some IPP projects also contribute to DOE\u2019s large  and persistent carryover of unspent funds. According to officials from U.S.  industry partners, national laboratories, and Russian and Ukrainian  institutes, some IPP projects experience long implementation delays. As a  result, project funds often remain as unspent balances until problems can  be resolved. For example, the ILAB representative from the Argonne  National Laboratory told us that, in his experience, IPP projects do not  finish on schedule about 60 percent of the time owing to a variety of  problems. These problems include implementation issues due to  administrative problems, the withdrawal or bankruptcy of the U.S.  industry partner, and turnover in key project participants. In our review of  207 IPP projects, we found several examples of projects that had  experienced implementation delays. For example:    One project to produce a low-cost artificial leg for use in developing  countries had $245,000 in unspent funds as of April 2007\u201419 percent of  the $1.3 million DOE allocated for the project. Because a testing device  needed for the project was not properly labeled when it was sent from the  United States, the Russian Customs Service rejected the device. Sandia  National Laboratory officials told us that this rejection had delayed project  implementation for nearly 1 year.", "About 3 years into a project to create banks of chemical compounds  linked with computer databases for industrial use, the project\u2019s U.S.  industry partner was bought out by a larger company.

We believe that DOE has failed to clearly articulate the current  threat posed by WMD scientists in Russia and other countries and has not  adjusted the IPP program to account for the changed economic landscape  in the region and improved conditions at many of the institutes involved in  the program. Instead, DOE has continued to emphasize a broad strategy of  engagement with foreign scientists and institutes, much as it did more than  a decade ago, and it has not developed comprehensive plans for focusing  on the most at-risk individuals and institutes or for developing an end- game for the program. We believe that DOE\u2019s inability to establish a clear  exit strategy for the IPP program has contributed to a perception among  foreign recipients that the program is essentially open-ended, represents  an indefinite commitment of U.S. support, and serves as a useful  marketing tool to attract and retain young scientists who might otherwise  emigrate to the United States or other western countries.", "We believe that it is time for DOE to reassess the program to explain to the  Congress how the program should continue to operate in the future or to  discuss whether the program should continue to operate at all. Without a  reassessment of the program\u2019s objectives, metrics, priorities, and exit  strategy, the Congress cannot adequately determine at what level and for  how long the program should continue to be supported. We believe that  such a reassessment presents DOE with an opportunity to refocus the  program on the most critical remaining tasks, with an eye toward reducing  the program\u2019s scope, budget, and number of participating organizations.", "Beyond reassessing the continuing need for the IPP program, a number of  management problems are negatively affecting the program. Specifically:    The fact that DOE has paid many scientists who claimed no WMD  expertise is particularly troubling and, in our view, undermines the IPP  program\u2019s credibility as a nonproliferation program. The lack of  documentation of DOE\u2019s review of IPP project participants also raises  concerns.", "DOE does not have reliable data on the commercialization results of IPP  projects or a clear definition of what constitutes a commercially  successful IPP project, preventing it from providing the Congress with a  more accurate assessment of the program\u2019s results and purported benefits.", "Regarding its efforts to expand the IPP program, DOE\u2019s projects in Iraq  and Libya represent a significant departure from the program\u2019s original  focus on the countries of the former Soviet Union. While there may be  sound national security reasons for expanding efforts to these countries,  we are concerned that, unlike other federal agencies, DOE did not receive  explicit authorization from the Congress before expanding its program  outside of the former Soviet Union. Furthermore, in its efforts in Libya,  DOE is not adhering to its own guidance restricting the percentage of IPP  program funds that can be spent at DOE\u2019s national laboratories on  oversight activities.", "The lack of clear, written guidance for IPP projects intended to support  GNEP has led to confusion among national laboratory officials who  implement the IPP program.", "Regarding the financial state of the IPP program, DOE\u2019s long-standing  problem with large balances of unspent program funds raises serious  concerns about DOE\u2019s ability to spend program resources in a timely  manner and about the method DOE uses to develop requests for future  budgets. Reform of the complex payment system used by the IPP program  to pay foreign scientists could help address some of these concerns.", "Because Russian scientists and institutes benefit from the IPP program, it  seems appropriate that DOE should seek to take advantage of Russia\u2019s  improved economic condition to ensure a greater commitment to jointly  held nonproliferation objectives.", "The absence of a joint plan between DOE\u2019s IPP program and ISTC\u2019s  Commercialization Support Program, which is funded by State, raises  questions about the lack of coordination between these two U.S.  government programs that share similar goals of finding peaceful  commercial opportunities for foreign WMD scientists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Energy, working with the  Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, reassess  the IPP program to justify to the Congress the continued need for the  program.

Our report  acknowledges actions DOE is taking to improve program management,  such as the development of a new program and financial management  system. Our review identified numerous problems and raised concerns  about the IPP program\u2019s scope, implementation, and performance that we  believe should be addressed by DOE as part of a reassessment of the IPP  program. However, DOE disagreed with our recommendation that the IPP  program needs to undergo such a reassessment and noted in its comments  that the department believes it has already conducted such an assessment  of the program. We were aware that such broad internal reviews took  place in 2004 and 2006, but these assessments were conducted not of the  IPP program exclusively, but rather of all DOE efforts to assist weapons  scientists, including a complementary DOE program to assist workers in  Russia\u2019s nuclear cities that has since been canceled. As a result, we believe  these assessments are outdated because the IPP program operates under a  significantly different set of circumstances today than when DOE  conducted its previous internal assessments.", "Finally, DOE disagreed with our recommendation that the department  ensure compliance with the statutory restriction on the percentage of IPP  program funds spent on oversight activities at the DOE national  laboratories to no more than 35 percent. We believe DOE has  misconstrued our recommendation concerning its funding of projects in  Libya. We did not recommend, nor did we mean to imply, that DOE should  allocate 65 percent of total project funds to Libya for projects in that  country. Instead, our recommendation urges the department to ensure that  it complies with existing statutory restrictions on the percentage of IPP  funds that can be spent on oversight activities by DOE national  laboratories. Specifically, as DOE notes, section 3136 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 provides that not more  than 35 percent of funds available in any fiscal year for the IPP program  may be spent by DOE national laboratories to provide oversight of  program activities. DOE\u2019s IPP guidance and its standard practice have  been to implement this provision of law on a project-by-project basis, so  that no more than 35 percent of the funds for each project are spent by  national laboratories. However, with respect to projects in Libya, DOE is  deviating from its IPP guidance by placing no restrictions on the amount  of IPP program funds that can be spent at DOE national laboratories for  oversight of projects in Libya. We found that 97 percent of funds DOE  spent on projects in Libya through May 2007 were spent at DOE\u2019s national  laboratories for project management and oversight.

For example, we focused primarily on active  projects\u2014that is, Thrust 2 projects that were approved, funded, or under  way\u2014regardless of their dollar value. We also considered draft and  inactive Thrust 2 projects where proposed funding was over $800,000, as  well as completed Thrust 1 and Thrust 2 projects that spent over $250,000.  We also selected projects for review across a variety of institutes in the  former Soviet Union, including facilities with backgrounds in nuclear,  chemical, biological, and missile research and development.", "The foreign countries and institutes where we planned to conduct  fieldwork also played a significant role in our project selection. Time and  cost constraints, as well as Russian government restrictions on access to  some facilities, limited the number and types of sites we were able to visit.  We concentrated on projects at institutes in Russia and Ukraine because  over 90 percent of all IPP projects are in these two countries. We focused  on IPP projects at institutes in the Russian cities of Moscow, Nizhny  Novgorod, and Sarov because these cities ranked high in our analysis of  several variables, including the total number of IPP projects, the number  of projects supporting commercial activities, and the total amount of  funding proposed in IPP projects in those locations. We also focused on  projects in the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv, because over 54 percent of IPP  projects in Ukraine are there, and Kharkiv, because of its relative  proximity to Kyiv and the number of projects there. We selected institutes  in the Russian and Ukrainian cities for site visits on the basis of several  criteria, including the total number of projects, the number of active  projects, the type of institute, and the number of projects commercialized  at each location.", "We also selected projects administered by each of the national  laboratories and the Kansas City Plant that participate in the program as  well as projects managed by DOE headquarters.

We followed a similar process to  calculate the percentage of older personnel versus younger personnel. We  classified workers born in 1970 or later as younger workers because they  were unlikely to have contributed to Soviet-era WMD programs. We also  calculated the total amount of funds paid to these four different categories  of participants\u2014those claiming WMD experience, those who did not, older  workers, and younger participants. In some cases, birth dates were not  available for some participants in the documentation we received; in those  instances, those individuals and the payments made to them were tracked  in separate categories.", "We collected this information by providing officials at each of the 12  participating national laboratories with a template, requesting that the  laboratory project leader provide information on the personnel involved in  each project in our sample, including each participant\u2019s full name, institute  affiliation, date of birth, WMD experience, and amount paid under the  project. In instances where we did not receive complete information from  the laboratories, we used payment records and other information on IPP  project participants maintained by the three payment mechanisms\u2014 CRDF, ISTC, and STCU\u2014to complete data missing from the templates, or  to reconstruct payment records for the project participants in cases where  the national laboratory did not provide any information on the project  participants. Because of potential data reliability concerns raised by CRDF  on older IPP projects for which it processed payments, we consulted with  CRDF representatives and received recommendations on specific projects  that we should exclude from our analysis.", "Among the 207 IPP projects we reviewed, no payments had yet been made  on 42 projects and 14 projects were inactive. Of the remaining 151 IPP  projects in our sample, we determined that 54 projects were too old for  evaluation, because DOE did not collect rosters of individual project  participants before 2000, or that sufficient and reliable information on the  project participants was not readily available.

We are aware that DOE conducted internal assessments in 2004 and  2006 of its overall efforts to engage WMD scientists in the former  Soviet Union and other countries. However, these assessments did not  evaluate the IPP program exclusively and were conducted at a time  when the IPP program was complemented by and coordinated with a  similar DOE program focused on downsizing facilities and creating  new jobs for personnel in Russia\u2019s nuclear cities. This complementary  program\u2014the Nuclear Cities Initiative\u2014has since been canceled. As a  result, the IPP program operates under a significantly different set of  circumstances today than when DOE conducted its previous internal  assessments. Moreover, we note that some recommendations and  action items from DOE\u2019s previous internal assessments, such as the  development of an exit strategy, have not been implemented. Finally,  during our review and as discussed in this report, we found numerous  shortcomings and problems with the IPP program. We made a number  of recommendations for improving the program, many of which DOE  agreed with, including issues that should be addressed in the context  of a program reassessment, such as the need to develop a program exit  strategy. For these reasons, we are recommending that DOE undertake  a fundamental reassessment of the IPP program, in concert with other  agencies, to determine the continuing value of and need for the  program.  2.  DOE has incorrectly characterized how we collected information and  conducted our analysis of the participants on IPP projects. Contrary to  DOE\u2019s assertion, we did not base our analysis of this issue on  responses to questions we posed directly to officials at Russian and  Ukrainian institutes. We used data and statements provided directly by  DOE program officials to determine the total number of former Soviet  weapons scientists, engineers, and technicians the program has  engaged since its inception. Regarding the level and number of WMD  experts involved in individual IPP projects, as explained in the scope  and methodology section of our draft report, we used a number of  methods for assessing these totals, including analyzing data provided  by project managers at the national laboratories; reviewing payment  records provided by CRDF, ISTC, and STCU; and assessing the  reliability of data we received.  3.  DOE has incorrectly asserted that we implied that DOE and State did  not concur on the project in question, and that DOE ignored State\u2019s  concerns regarding the primary Ukrainian institute\u2019s involvement in  WMD. We used this case as an example of how DOE\u2019s limited ability to  assess the proposed participants on an IPP project can lead to  misallocation of funding. In our view, a more thorough evaluation of  the entities involved in the project by DOE during its proposal review  might have uncovered the conflict-of-interest issues between the  primary Ukrainian institute and the industry partner discovered by the  Defense Contract Audit Agency after the project was under way and  funds had been spent.  4.  Our finding was based on an in-depth review of the personnel involved  in 97 IPP projects, representing over 6,450 individuals, or over 38  percent of the total personnel DOE has reported to have engaged  through the IPP program. We have no way of assessing the accuracy,  reliability, or validity of DOE\u2019s assertion that a majority of IPP project  participants have WMD experience. However, we are skeptical that the  department was able to conduct a thorough analysis of all IPP project  payment records during the time it took to review and comment on our  draft report.  5.  During our visit to the Russian institute in question, institute officials  told us that they were not the source for the reported job creation  figure and could not substantiate the total number of jobs created as a  result of the IPP projects we asked about. For this reason, we declined  the institute official\u2019s offer to obtain further documentation regarding  the number of jobs created at other institutes involved in these  projects. Although DOE claims to have received additional information  from this institute to corroborate the number of jobs reported to have  been created, DOE did not provide this information to us. As a result,  we cannot determine the reliability or accuracy of DOE\u2019s claim that the  number of jobs it had reported as created is correct.  6.  We have accurately described what we observed during our visit to the  Ukrainian institute in question. Based on our observations, this  institute clearly was not in dire financial straits or in poor physical  condition like some of the institutes in the former Soviet Union we  have visited in the past. The donation of funding to improve the  physical condition of the institute has no material bearing on the facts  that we presented in our draft report.  7.  DOE has mischaracterized our findings and our process for evaluating  the continued need for the program. As we pointed out in our draft  report, officials at 10 of the 22 Russian and Ukrainian institutes we  visited stated that they did not believe they or the other scientists at  their institutes posed a proliferation risk, while officials at 14 of the 22  institutes also attested to the financial stability of their facilities.  Moreover, a senior Russian Atomic Energy Agency official told us, in  the presence of IPP program officials, in July 2007 that the program is  no longer relevant. DOE asserted that we did not include  endorsements of the program in our draft report. However, we do state  that many officials at the Russian and Ukrainian institutes we visited  noted that the program was especially helpful during the period of  financial distress in the late 1990s.  8.  DOE misstates the number of institutes that we included in our  fieldwork in Russia and Ukraine. The correct number is 22. Regarding  DOE\u2019s comment, our draft report clearly stated that DOE policy does  not require IPP project participants reemployed in peaceful activities  to cut ties to their home institute. However, more than one institute we  visited stated that they are still involved in some weapons-related  work, and many institutes remain involved in research and technology  development that could be applied to WMD or delivery systems for  WMD. We do not believe it is possible for DOE to verify the full extent  and intended purpose of all activities at the institutes where the IPP  program is engaged. Moreover, we believe that DOE misrepresents the  IPP program\u2019s accomplishments by counting individuals who have  been reemployed in private sector jobs but also are employed by their  institutes and, therefore, may still be involved in weapons-related  activities. In our view, the reemployment of former weapons scientists  into new long-term, private sector jobs\u2014one of the primary metrics  DOE uses to measure progress of the IPP program\u2014implies that these  individuals have terminated their previous employment at the  institutes and are dedicated solely to peaceful commercial activities  outside of their institutes.  9.  While there is no IPP program requirement to exclude former weapons  scientists employed on a part-time basis from the total number of jobs  created as a result of IPP projects, DOE\u2019s reported job creation total  fails to delineate between part-time and full-time jobs. By not more  clearly distinguishing the number of jobs created in each category, this  metric is misleading and also misrepresents the program\u2019s  accomplishments regarding the employment of weapons scientists in  commercial activities. However, we have added information to our  report that states that there is no IPP program requirement to exclude  former weapons scientists employed on a part-time basis from the  total number of jobs created as a result of IPP projects.  10. Our draft report stated that the IPP program does not prohibit  participation of younger scientists in IPP projects. In our view,  however, DOE has a mistaken and na\u00efve impression of how institutes  in the former Soviet Union view the benefits of allowing younger  scientists to participate in the IPP program. DOE believes that  participation of some younger generation scientists on IPP projects  must be permitted to successfully implement projects. This practice  has the unintended consequence of allowing former Soviet Union  institutes to use the IPP program as a long-term recruitment tool for  younger scientists and, thereby, may perpetuate the proliferation risk  posed by scientists at these institutes. As we stated in our draft report,  officials at 10 of the 22 institutes we visited in Russia and Ukraine said  that the IPP program has allowed their institutes to recruit, hire, and  retain younger scientists. In our view, this is contrary to the original  intent of the program, which was to reduce the proliferation risk posed  by Soviet-era weapons scientists. That is why, among other reasons,  we are recommending that DOE conduct a reassessment of the IPP  program that includes a thorough analysis of the proliferation risk  posed by weapons scientists in Russia and other countries, a well- defined strategy to more effectively target the scientists and institutes  of highest proliferation concern, more accurate reporting of program  accomplishments, and a clear exit strategy for the program.  11. DOE incorrectly characterized our description of its program  management system. Specifically, we stated in the draft report \u201cDOE  and national laboratory officials told us they are attempting to improve  financial oversight over the IPP program, in part, to address concerns  about unspent program funds. To that end, DOE is developing a new  program management system, which it expects to fully implement in  2008\u201414 years after the start of the program.\u201d Throughout our review,  numerous DOE and national laboratory officials expressed concern  about the existing systems that DOE used to manage IPP projects. Our  description of DOE\u2019s planned implementation of its new program  management system is accurate.  12. DOE officials concurred with our recommendation of reducing large  balances of unspent funds and adjusting future budget requests  accordingly. The data we present are based on DOE\u2019s own financial  reporting and accurately reflect the state of the program\u2019s uncosted  balances (unspent funds) over the last 10 years. We noted in our draft  report that the program\u2019s uncosted balances are declining, but, as DOE  officials acknowledge, uncosted balances remain a serious problem for  the IPP program.  13. We are pleased that DOE concurs with our recommendation to  improve coordination between the department\u2019s IPP program and  ISTC\u2019s Commercialization Support Program, which is funded by State.  In its comments, State also concurred with this recommendation.  14. We believe DOE has misconstrued our recommendation concerning its  funding of projects in Libya. We did not recommend, nor did we mean  to imply, that DOE should allocate 65 percent of project funds to Libya  for projects in that country. Instead, our recommendation urges the  department to ensure that it complies with existing statutory  restrictions on the percentage of IPP funds that can be spent on  oversight activities by DOE national laboratories. Specifically, as DOE  notes, section 3136 of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2000 provides that not more than 35 percent of funds  available in any fiscal year for the IPP program may be spent by DOE  national laboratories to provide oversight of program activities. As our  report indicates, DOE\u2019s IPP guidance and its standard practice have  been to implement this provision of law on a project-by-project basis,  so that no more than 35 percent of the funds for each project are spent  by national laboratories. Our point in our report and in our  recommendation is that, with respect to projects in Libya, DOE has not  followed its IPP guidance restricting national laboratory expenditures.  Instead, we found that 97 percent of funds DOE spent on projects in  Libya through May 2007 were spent at DOE\u2019s national laboratories for  project management and oversight. In this regard, we note that DOE  concurred with our recommendation that the department seek explicit  congressional authorization to expand IPP efforts outside of the  former Soviet Union. In seeking such authorization, DOE may wish to  clarify the nature of other restrictions on the program, such as those  set forth in section 3136 of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2000.  15. DOE has mistakenly asserted that our selection of projects for review  served as the sole basis for our conclusions and recommendations. As  we explained in the draft report\u2019s scope and methodology section, the  selection and evaluation of a sample of IPP projects was one of several  analytical tools we employed during our review. We not only  conducted an in-depth assessment of over 200 IPP projects, but also  met multiple times with DOE officials; analyzed program plans,  policies, and procedures; interviewed representatives at each of the 12  national laboratories involved in the program; interviewed staff of the  U.S. Industry Coalition and 14 U.S. industry partner companies with  long-standing participation in the program; and had discussions with  numerous recipients of IPP program assistance at 22 institutes in  Russia and Ukraine. We also met several times with State officials who  are responsible for funding a similar program; interviewed and  assessed information provided by officials at CRDF, ISTC, and STCU;  and met with nongovernmental experts familiar with the program. As  further noted in our draft report, to develop our judgmental sample of  207 projects we used project selection criteria supplied by DOE and  considered a variety of factors\u2014such as project status, project  funding, type and location of institutes where projects have been  implemented, and a project\u2019s commercial success\u2014to ensure we  addressed a broad cross-section of IPP projects.
