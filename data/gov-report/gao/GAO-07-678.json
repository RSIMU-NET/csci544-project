All of the financial regulators awarded some pay increases during the appraisal cycles we reviewed that were linked to employees' performance ratings, although two also provided across-the-board pay adjustments, even to employees who had not received acceptable performance ratings, weakening the linkage of pay to performance. Both agencies have indicated in the future annual pay adjustments will not be awarded to unsuccessful performers. The agencies have generally aligned individual performance expectations and organizational goals, connected performance expectations to crosscutting goals, used competencies to provide a fuller assessment of performance, and involved employees and stakeholders in the process. All of the agencies built safeguards into their performance management systems to enhance credibility and fairness. However, the extent to which the agencies communicated overall results of performance rating and pay increase decisions to all employees varied, and some could increase transparency by letting employees know where they stand relative to their peers in the organization, while protecting individual confidentiality. Financial regulators have hired external compensation consultants to conduct pay and benefits comparability surveys, exchanged pay and benefits information, explored the feasibility of conducting a common survey, and adjusted pay and benefits to seek to maintain comparability with each other. Although financial regulators have adjusted pay and benefits partly based on the results of their comparability efforts, there is some variation in pay ranges and benefit packages among the agencies. According to agency officials, factors such as the year the agencies first became subject to comparability provisions, budget constraints, and the needs and preferences of workforces play a role in compensation decisions and contribute to this variation. Furthermore, agency officials emphasized that it was not their goal to have identical pay and benefits packages; rather, they considered pay and benefits as a total package when seeking to maintain comparability and when setting pay policies aimed at recruiting and retaining employees. Between fiscal years 1990 and 2006, few employees moved among financial regulators and the movement among these agencies presented no discernible trend. Specifically, 86 percent (13,433) of the 15,627 employees that left during this period (i.e., moving or resigning but not retiring), resigned from federal employment. Annually, the percentage of employees who moved to another financial regulator ranged from a low of 1 percent in fiscal year 1997 (16 out of the 1,362 who moved or resigned) to a high of 8 percent in fiscal year 1991 (97 out of the 1,229 who moved or resigned).

Yet  the government has not transformed, in many cases, how it classifies,  compensates, develops, and motivates its employees to achieve maximum  results within available resources and existing authorities. One of the  questions being addressed as the federal government transforms is how to  update its compensation system to be more market based and performance  oriented. In this type of system, organizations consider the skills,  knowledge, and performance of employees as well as the labor market  when making pay decisions.", "Congress has recognized the need for flexibility in how selected agencies  compensate employees. Congress granted the federal financial regulatory  agencies the flexibility to establish their own compensation systems  recognizing that the existing approach to compensating employees could  impede these agencies\u2019 ability to recruit and retain employees critical to  meeting their organizational missions.

The individual performance  plans, selected in conjunction with agency officials to reflect a mix of key  locations, occupations, and grade levels at each agency, as well as the  performance management data from each agency that we examined,  pertained to each agency\u2019s last completed performance appraisal cycle  when we began this review.", "To address our second objective, we analyzed relevant statutes and  legislative histories for the selected agencies; reviewed the most recent pay  and benefits surveys from these agencies; obtained agency pay and benefits  data; and discussed agencies\u2019 informal interactions to assess pay  comparability with agency officials. For the third objective, we analyzed  data from the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF), which includes  information on pay, benefits, personnel actions, and other data to support  statistical analyses of executive branch personnel management programs,  to determine employee movement.", "We conducted various inspections and electronic testing of agency data  obtained for the first objective for reasonableness and the presence of any  obvious or potential errors in accuracy and completeness. We also  reviewed related agency documentation, interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about the data, and brought to the attention of these  officials any concerns or discrepancies we found with the data for  correction or updating. On the basis of these procedures, we believe the  data are sufficiently reliable for use in the analyses presented in this report.

For example, FHFB is the smallest agency with just over 120  employees, while FDIC, the largest agency, had more than 4,300 employees  as of September 2006 and has been implementing pay for performance  since 1998. Likewise, these agencies regulate a range of activities including  banking and securities and futures. Appendix II includes the financial  regulators\u2019 missions, funding structures, and whether they are unionized  and bargain with a union over pay and benefits.", "Under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, the financial regulatory agencies have the  flexibility to establish their own compensation programs without regard to  various statutory provisions on classification and pay for executive branch  agencies. At the same time these financial regulators received increased  flexibility regarding compensation, Congress also generally required that  they seek compensation comparability with each other. A provision in  FIRREA requires six agencies\u2014FDIC, OCC, NCUA, FHFB, FCA, and OTS\u2014 in establishing and adjusting compensation and benefits, to inform each  other and Congress of such compensation and benefits, and to seek to  maintain comparability regarding compensation and benefits. Additional  FIRREA provisions require FCA, FHFB, NCUA, OCC, and OTS to seek to  maintain compensation and benefit comparability with the Federal Reserve  Board. Although the Federal Reserve Board is under no obligation to seek  to maintain compensation or benefit comparability with these or any of the  other financial regulators, it has agreed to share compensation information  with the other financial regulators.", "The other three agencies are subject to their own compensation  comparability provisions. As required by its 1992 enabling legislation,  OFHEO must maintain comparability with the compensation of employees  from the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, FDIC, and OTS and consult with  those agencies in that regard. In 2002 legislation, SEC and CFTC were  placed under comparability requirements. SEC must consult with and seek  to maintain compensation comparability with FDIC, OCC, NCUA, FHFB,  FCA, OTS and CFTC. However, as shown in table 1, this legislation did not  require these agencies to seek to maintain compensation comparability  with SEC. Similarly, CFTC must consult and seek to maintain  compensation comparability with the six FIRREA agencies, but those  agencies are not required to seek to maintain compensation comparability  with CFTC.", "We previously identified key practices for effective performance  management based on public sector organizations\u2019 experiences both here  and abroad. High-performing organizations seek to create pay, incentive,  and reward systems that clearly link employee knowledge, skills, and  contributions to organizational results. Performance-based systems reward  employees according to their performance by using performance ratings as  the basis for pay increases. Linking pay to performance can help to create a  performance-oriented culture by providing monetary incentives to become  a top- performing employee. At the same time, as a precondition to linking  pay to performance, performance management systems need to provide  adequate safeguards to ensure fairness and guard against abuse. Providing  adequate safeguards that help to ensure transparency can improve the  credibility of the performance-based pay system by promoting fairness and  trust. Safeguards can include establishing clear criteria for making rating  decisions and determining merit increases, and providing overall results of  performance rating and pay increase decisions to all employees, while  protecting confidentiality. Effective performance management systems  also make meaningful distinctions between acceptable and outstanding  performance of individuals and appropriately reward those who perform at  the highest level. As we have previously reported, effective performance  management systems can provide management with the objective and fact- based information it needs to reward top performance and provide the  necessary information and documentation to deal with poor performers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Regulators Generally Have Linked Pay to Performance and Made Distinctions in Performance, but Opportunities Exist for Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the federal financial regulators have implemented key practices for  effective performance management systems in ways that consider the  unique needs of their organizational cultures and structures, but some have  not fully implemented certain practices. For purposes of this section, we  focus on the regulators\u2019 implementation of the two key practices of (1)  linking pay to performance (which includes building in safeguards), and (2)  making meaningful distinctions in performance. First, we found that while  the regulators generally linked pay to performance, two regulators  awarded across-the-board increases to employees regardless of their  performance. Second, while most regulators generally used safeguards in  varying ways to increase transparency, one did not establish and  communicate performance standards to its nonexecutives, which resulted  in questions about how decisions were made and could compromise the  credibility of the performance system. Third, many regulators did not fully  implement the safeguard of providing overall ratings and pay results to all  employees, which reduced the transparency of their performance-based  pay systems. Fourth, we found that while most regulators used multiple  rating levels to make meaningful distinctions in performance, employees  were usually concentrated in one or two rating categories and all had very  few poor performers. Finally, one agency did not complete performance  ratings for senior officers due to lack of funding for pay increases, thereby  missing an opportunity to provide valuable feedback. For information  about the other four key practices as well as additional material pertaining  to the linking pay to performance practice, see appendix III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Financial Regulators Generally Have Linked Pay to Performance, but Two Regulators Still Provided Increases to Performers at All Levels", "paragraphs": ["All of the regulators awarded some performance-based increases during  the appraisal cycles we reviewed that were linked to employees\u2019  performance ratings, although two financial regulators also provided  annual pay adjustments to employees, regardless of performance, during  the appraisal cycles we reviewed. Specifically, CFTC provided an across- the-board pay increase to all employees to be equivalent to the cost of  living adjustment received by General Schedule employees of the federal  government in January 2006. During the 2005 appraisal cycle, SEC also  provided all employees an across-the-board pay adjustment of 2.1 percent,  regardless of their performance. SEC officials noted that this across-the- board pay adjustment was in accordance with the negotiated compensation  agreement with the union. While the percentages of employees rated as  unsuccessful or unacceptable at CFTC and SEC during those cycles were  extremely small (less than 1 percent), these agencies lost opportunities to  reinforce the linkage of pay to performance in their performance  management systems. CFTC officials told us that the performance-based  pay portion of the new performance management system that will begin on  July 1, 2007, will require a minimum threshold performance rating for an employee to be eligible for a pay increase. SEC and its union are currently  negotiating implementation of a new Compensation and Benefits  Agreement, which provides that employees rated as unacceptable will not  receive annual pay adjustments. SEC officials acknowledged that a  negative perception occurs when employees who are not performing  satisfactorily receive a pay increase.", "Most of the financial regulators used their rating systems to differentiate  individual performance to award performance-based increases and reward  top performers during the appraisal cycles we reviewed. Furthermore, all  of the agencies also provided increases that, while not directly linked to  performance ratings, considered employee performance in some way.  These increases included special bonuses or awards given to individuals or  teams for special accomplishments or contributions, as well as promotions  and within-pay-band increases. For example, FCA provided Achievement  or Special Act Awards to employees for significant achievements or  innovations towards a special program, project, or assignment that  contributed to the agency\u2019s or organizational unit\u2019s mission, goals, and  objectives. To receive these awards, employees had to have performed  their regular duties at least at a fully successful level of performance. FCA  also provided some pay increases for competitive and noncompetitive  promotions during the completed appraisal cycle we reviewed.", "Pay increases linked to performance ratings accounted for only part of the  total increases awarded to individual employees during the appraisal cycles  we reviewed.

For example, with the exception of SEC, the agencies have  used the safeguard of establishing and communicating (1) standards for  differentiating among performance rating categories and (2) criteria for  performance-based pay decisions, thus enhancing transparency, which can  improve employee confidence in the performance management system.  (See app. III for information on the financial regulators\u2019 implementation of  additional safeguards.)", "CFTC\u2019s four-level rating system (i.e., unsuccessful, successful, highly  successful, and exemplary) defined the successful level of performance for  areas that CFTC had identified as critical to employees\u2019 job performance,  and included some information on how to distinguish variations from the  successful level of performance. However, an employee representative at  CFTC maintained that the rating level descriptions did not sufficiently  communicate to employees the skills and behaviors employees needed to  demonstrate in order to move, for example, from the \u201csuccessful\u201d to the  \u201chighly successful\u201d level. Employee representatives stated that even though  there was helpful guidance on distinguishing between levels of  performance in a CFTC manual, these descriptions were hard to  understand and most employees did not refer to the CFTC manual for  guidance. An agency official told us that the revised performance  management system that went into effect in October 2006 is a five-level  system, and includes descriptions of all five performance levels rather than  only the successful rating level described in the system it replaced.", "Similarly, OFHEO defined how employees would be rated on its five-level  rating scale for each of the performance elements included in their  performance plans. These performance standards defined the middle level  of performance (fully successful), and included what the rater should look  at to determine if an employee is performing better or worse than this  benchmark. An employee\u2019s performance for each element was assessed  and a total score was determined. OFHEO further distinguished between  \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d levels within rating categories. For example, a rating of  \u201coutstanding\u201d would be classified as being in either the high or low level of  the outstanding rating category based on the performance score the  employee received. Merit increases at OFHEO have been determined  directly by employees\u2019 performance ratings, so employees could ascertain  the merit increases they would receive for given performance ratings. For  example, an employee rated \u201chigh\u201d commendable receives a higher merit  pay increase than one who is rated \u201clow\u201d commendable. OFHEO employee  working group members noted that both supervisors and employees  understand how the performance elements and standards have been  applied through rating decisions, and they stated that employees generally  understood what was expected of them to attain higher levels of  performance and associated merit increases. However, an employee  working group member also commented that when distinguishing between  performance rating levels, some managers seemed to apply the  performance standards more effectively than others, which could result in  differences in how rating decisions were made.", "At FDIC, for nonexecutive/nonmanager employees to be eligible for  performance-based pay increases, employees had to first earn a \u201cmeets  expectations\u201d rating. Then, in a second process called the \u201cPay for  Performance\u201d system, FDIC nonexecutive/nonmanagers were placed into  one of four pay groups, based on an assessment of total performance and  corporate contributions as compared with other employees in the same pay  pool. The pay for performance program was essentially comparative,  meaning that the contributions and performance of each employee were  evaluated and rewarded on a relative basis within his or her pay pool, as  compared to peers. According to union representatives, employees were  not informed about how management made the distinctions in pay increase  groupings. According to FDIC officials, there are no definitive descriptions  or definitions of the performance levels for each of the three pay groups  because employees are assessed compared to each other, not against fixed  standards. Officials also said that information on the system for  determining pay groups was provided to all employees in early 2006 after  the compensation and benefits agreement became effective, when the  system was first rolled out, and is explained to new employees at  orientation. We did not determine how widespread the concern about how  management made distinctions in pay increase groupings was among FDIC  employees.", "In contrast, SEC officials did not establish standards upon which to base  rating decisions for nonexecutive employees, nor did they communicate  criteria used to make performance-based pay decisions to these  employees. For its nonexecutive employees, SEC used a two-level rating  system in which individuals\u2019 performance was rated as acceptable or  unacceptable. According to agency management, SEC followed the  definitions under Title 5 that are used by the rest of the government for  differentiating between acceptable and unacceptable performance.  However, SEC did not establish written performance standards for  appraising employees\u2019 performance as acceptable or unacceptable.", "To determine performance-based pay increase amounts for nonexecutive  employees, SEC developed a second phase process that involved making  distinctions in contributions for those individuals who received a summary  performance rating of acceptable. As part of the second phase, employees  and their supervisors submitted contribution statements summarizing the  employees\u2019 accomplishments during the appraisal cycle. Using the  summary statements and the supervisors\u2019 own assessments, supervisors  placed employees into one of four categories: (1) made contributions of the  highest quality, (2) made contributions of high quality, (3) made  contributions of quality, and (4) made no significant contribution beyond  an acceptable level of performance. Next, a compensation committee  within each office or division evaluated the contribution statements and  the supervisors\u2019 placements. For each employee, the committee  recommended a merit pay increase ranging from zero to 4.41 percent  (corresponding to \u201csteps\u201d 0 to 3) to an official from each office or division,  who made the final determination of the employee\u2019s merit increase.", "However, SEC did not develop criteria to differentiate between the four  contribution categories that the compensation committees considered  when recommending merit pay step increase amounts. In addition, SEC  employee representatives told us that it was not clear to employees how  the contribution statements and the subsequent supervisory  recommendations were translated into the decisions about the four  contribution categories into which employees would be placed. SEC  officials noted that employees received copies of narratives written by their  supervisors to describe the employees\u2019 contributions; however, they  acknowledged that the system could be more transparent. According to  SEC officials, in an effort to increase transparency in the future, they plan  to share with employees information on supervisors\u2019 preliminary  recommendations on ratings that are provided to the compensation  committee, so that employees can see into which of the four contribution  categories they were recommended for placement and the supporting  documentation. If the committee changes an initial recommendation from  a supervisor, SEC will provide the employee with the rationale for the  change.

An employee\u2019s summary performance rating conveys  information about how well an employee has performed against  established performance standards, which is important, but not sufficient  to provide a clear picture of how the employee\u2019s performance compares  with that of other employees within the organization.

Further, FDIC officials told  us that, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, after  completion of each annual pay for performance cycle they share data on  the results of the pay grouping decisions for employees covered by the  bargaining unit contract with union representatives. These include  summary pay group data analyzed according to the agreement with the  union, such as certain demographic data and individual rating information.", "According to an agency official, OCC began to post some limited  information on the average size of some performance-based pay increases  on the agency intranet in November 2006. The information included the  average, agencywide percentage increases for merit increases, merit  bonuses, and special act and spot awards, as well as the percentage of  employees receiving the increases.", "During the performance appraisal cycle we reviewed, OTS shared with  union representatives some data on average pay increases. The agency did  not share ratings distribution data with the union, and did not make either  performance-based pay increase or rating results information available to  all employees. However, in November 2006, OTS distributed to all  employees information for the recently completed appraisal cycle on the  percentage of employees who received each performance rating level and  the average pay increase percentages to be received by people at each  level. The information was disaggregated by regions and Washington, D.C.", "While SEC did not make the results of performance rating decisions  available to all employees, officials said that they reported information on  performance awards (bonuses) to the union and that, under  implementation of the compensation and benefits agreement currently  being negotiated, they plan to publish aggregated information on  performance ratings under the planned new performance management  system for nonexecutive employees. SEC officials also told us that they  plan to provide information at the lowest possible organizational level  while still protecting individual confidentiality.", "The remaining five financial regulators did not share overall data on ratings  or performance increases widely with all employees, although in some  cases some information was shared with managers. The following outlines  how information was shared:   CFTC shared information on the results of ratings and award decisions  with managers on a Pay Parity Governance Committee, but not with all  employees, for the appraisal cycle we reviewed. CFTC officials told us  that there is no prohibition against sharing this type of information  under the new performance management system directive, and they are  aware that there is some interest among employees in receiving it. They  said that the pay parity committee will determine whether there is value  in releasing this information to all employees in the future.", "At FHFB, an official told us that office directors see all the ratings within  their offices and make the decisions about the performance-based pay  increases for employees, but this information is not shared across  offices or with all employees. However, the director of the Office of  Supervision, FHFB\u2019s largest office, has shared information with all staff  in the office on the ranges of pay increases corresponding to different  performance rating levels and base salary levels that were received by  staff within the office for a given year, as well as the standards used to  assign the merit increase amounts.", "Officials at OFHEO told us that just last year they started sharing  information on the results of ratings and pay increase decisions with  management, but that they have not yet shared this type of information  with all employees.", "FCA officials told us that they do not share aggregate results of the  performance rating and pay increase decisions with all employees. They  explained that, under a previous administration, in early 2000, an  executive summary was prepared and posted that all employees could  potentially access, which contained information on the results of ratings  and pay increases. However, this information was not broadly  disseminated directly to employees.", "NCUA shares information on the results of the merit pay decisions with  directors, but not with all employees. An NCUA official told us that it is  up to the directors to decide whether or not to share this information  with their staff. In comments on the draft report, NCUA explained that  this is one of the issues involved in its current negotiations over pay and  benefits with the National Treasury Employees Union, and that the  agency\u2019s proposal to the union does provide for this type of  transparency.", "Agencies provided a variety of reasons for not sharing overall ratings and  pay increase information more widely. Officials from FHFB and FCA told  us that the relatively small size of their agencies, 122 and 248 employees,  respectively, makes it harder to share this type of information while  protecting individual confidentiality and that an FHFB official was not  aware of employee demand for this type of information. FCA officials also  mentioned that the emphasis in their performance management system is  on rating individual employees against the standards, not against other  employees and they wanted employees to focus on their individual ratings  and performance. According to union representatives at OCC, the union  has made multiple requests for data on the results of the performance  rating and pay increase decisions but management has declined to share  information that would enable the union to, in their words, perform a  meaningful independent analysis of the ratings and pay increase decisions.  OCC officials told us that they prefer not to share with employees  disaggregated information on ratings and pay increase distributions  because organizational units administer the process differently. For  example, the percentages of individuals rated at the highest level (4) and  next highest level (3) vary from unit to unit. Because units receive fixed  pools of funds for performance-based increases, the average size of a merit  increase that an employee receiving a level 4 may receive can vary from  unit to unit, depending on how many individuals receive the highest  rating. OCC officials told us that sharing information on average merit  increases by unit with employees, without sufficient context of the factors  considered when making these decisions, including more detailed rating  information (which is privacy protected), could lead to misinterpretation of  the data.", "However, not sharing information on the results of the performance rating  and pay increase decisions processes can detract from the goal of a  transparent and fair performance management system. This information  needs to be presented in ways that protect individual confidentiality, such  as by aggregating it. Without access to this type of information, individual  employees can lose a valuable opportunity to understand how their  performance stands relative to others in their organization. In cases where  agencies negotiate agreements with unions, an important consideration is  to reach agreement to share aggregate results of the rating and pay increase  decisions with employees, while protecting individual confidentiality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Financial Regulators Generally Used Multiple Rating Levels to Make Meaningful Distinctions in Performance, Employees at Most Agencies Were Concentrated in One or Two Rating Categories, with Very Few Poor Performers", "paragraphs": ["While most of the financial regulatory agencies used multiple rating levels  to assess employee performance and make distinctions in performance, at  most agencies employees were concentrated in one or two rating  categories and very few received poor performance ratings.

Effective performance  management systems make meaningful distinctions between acceptable  and outstanding performance of individuals and appropriately reward  those who perform at the highest level. As we have previously reported,  performance management systems can provide management with the  objective and fact-based information it needs to reward top performers and  provide the necessary information and documentation to deal with poor  performers. More specifically, using multiple rating levels provides a  useful framework for making distinctions in performance by allowing an  agency to differentiate, at a minimum, between poor, acceptable, and  outstanding performance. We have reported that two-level rating systems  by definition will generally not provide meaningful distinctions in  performance ratings, with possible exceptions for employees in entry-level  or developmental bands.", "Eight agencies used four or more rating levels. For example, as described  earlier, OFHEO used a five-level rating category system to appraise  employee performance and contributions toward achieving agency goals,  and further distinguished between high and low performance scores within  rating categories. As shown in figure 1, at the eight agencies with four- or  five-level rating systems, the largest percentage of employees fell into the  second highest rating category, except at OFHEO and the Federal Reserve  Board. At OFHEO, more than half of the employees were placed into the  high or low levels of the top rating category. Conversely, at the Federal  Reserve Board (excluding economists), almost half of the employees fell  into the third highest or middle (commendable) rating category. Across the  eight agencies shown in figure 1, the percentage of employees who fell into  the highest rating category varied from 10.6 percent for economists at the  Federal Reserve Board, to 55 percent of employees at OFHEO. (This page is left intentionally blank.)", "SEC and FDIC used two-level rating systems (essentially pass/fail systems)  to appraise the performance of certain groups of employees. Although two- level rating systems by definition will not provide meaningful distinctions  in performance ratings, both SEC and FDIC used a second process to  determine performance-based pay increases and effectively make more  meaningful performance distinctions. As figure 2 shows, the highest  percentage of employees at FDIC fell into the second highest of four  categories, in keeping with the fixed percentages included in the negotiated  agreement with the union. At SEC, the largest percentage of employees fell  into the third highest of four rating categories.", "As shown in figures 1 and 2, the percentage of employees rated as poor  performers at each agency was very small during the completed  performance appraisal cycles we reviewed. Employees rated at below the  successful and meets expectations rating levels accounted for less than 3  percent of employees across the agencies. OTS had zero employees in the  bottom two rating categories combined\u2014all OTS employees received fully  successful or higher ratings. Similarly at NCUA, no executives and 2.1  percent of nonexecutives were rated below minimally successful.", "While the financial regulators rated very few employees as poor  performers, all of the agencies have established procedures to deal with  poor performers. When an employee does not perform up to a threshold  standard for satisfactory performance, most agencies place the employee  on a performance improvement plan or provide counseling for the  employee, and the employee does not receive a performance-based  increase at the end of the performance cycle. For example, OTS has  addressed poor performance by working with the employee to improve his  or her area of deficiency. An employee who receives a rating at the  unacceptable level is placed on a performance improvement plan for a  minimum of 90 days. Specifically, OTS policy advises supervisors to  develop a performance improvement plan by identifying the performance  areas in which the employee is deficient and the types of improvements,  including specific work products and steps to be followed which the  employee must complete to attain the fully successful performance level.  In addition, according to OTS policy, the agency may provide the employee  with closer supervision, or on-the-job or formal training.", "However, governmentwide, 29.7 percent of employees indicated in the 2006  Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Human Capital Survey  that they agreed or strongly agreed that differences in performance within  the work unit were recognized in a meaningful way. Positive responses to  this question for the eight financial regulators who participated in the  survey ranged from 24.9 percent for CFTC to 41.6 percent for OCC. None of  these agencies had a majority of their employees provide positive  responses to this question, and only three of the eight agencies had more  than one third of their employees provide positive responses to this  question."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Did Not Complete Performance Ratings for Senior Officers, Missing an Opportunity to Provide Valuable Feedback", "paragraphs": ["While it may have been an isolated incident, for senior officers, SEC  effectively did not make distinctions in rating their performance during the  appraisal cycle we reviewed because the agency did not complete  performance ratings for them in 2005. According to SEC officials, no funds  were available for performance-based bonuses (which are normally  dependent on performance ratings) during that assessment cycle. As a  result, divisions performed assessments of senior officers, but the  assessment process was not completed and their ratings were not signed  by the Chairman for the October 1, 2004, to September 30, 2005,  performance appraisal cycle. A recent SEC Inspector General report  confirmed that senior officers in SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division did not  prepare performance review documents for the performance cycle that  ended on September 30, 2005, and recommended that required steps of the  senior officer performance appraisal process be conducted in accordance  with Commission policy, even when merit increases are not awarded. All  senior officers received annual across-the-board salary increases during  that cycle. Conducting performance appraisals and making distinctions in  performance are important not only for determining performance-based  pay increases, but for providing feedback to help employees improve their  performance and assess how their work contributed to achieving  organizational goals. By not appraising their performance, SEC missed an  opportunity to provide valuable feedback to senior officers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Taken Various Actions to Seek to Maintain Pay and Benefits Comparability", "paragraphs": ["Financial regulators have hired external compensation consultants to  conduct individual, formal comparability surveys, exchanged pay and  benefits information, explored the feasibility of conducting a common  survey, and adjusted pay and benefits to seek to maintain pay and benefits  comparability. The majority of the financial regulators conducted pay  comparability surveys that have included other financial regulators and in  some instances, private-sector entities. To compare pay across agencies,  consultants send questionnaires on behalf of the sponsoring agency and  ask participating agencies to match the jobs based on the job descriptions  provided. To compare benefits, consultants use various methods, such as  side-by-side comparisons of benefits and calculation of total cost of  benefits per employee. In addition to these surveys, human capital officials  at the 10 financial regulators have formed an interagency group to  exchange information and consult on topics such as updates on merit pay  ranges and bonuses. However, agency officials told us that because many  of the financial regulators conduct separate comparability surveys, their  staffs have to respond to numerous and often overlapping inquiries, which  can be inefficient. To begin addressing the inefficiencies of this process, the  agencies formed a subcommittee in December 2006 to study the feasibility  of conducting a common survey on pay and benefits. According to agency  officials, the subcommittee also has discussed the feasibility of establishing  a Web-based data system to make the most current pay and benefits  information available to participating agencies.", "In the absence of a legislative definition of what constitutes comparability,  agency officials told us that they use various methods to assess pay and  benefits comparability after they have obtained relevant data from the  other agencies. For example, FDIC has sought to set its total pay ranges  (base pay plus locality pay) for specific occupations and grade levels within  10 percent of the average of FIRREA agencies. FCA used the average  market rate paid by other financial regulators as a benchmark. Finally,  partly on the basis of the results of the comparability surveys and  discussions among the agencies, the financial regulators have adjusted  their pay and benefits policies in their efforts to seek to maintain  comparability. For example, as a result of gaining pay flexibilities, CFTC  implemented new pay ranges for its 2003 pay schedule, and increased base  pay by 20 percent for all eligible employees to partially close the 25 percent  gap between CFTC and FIRREA agencies. Appendix IV provides additional  information on our analysis of individual agency actions.", "While the regulators have taken actions to seek to maintain comparability  in their pay and benefits, there are some variations in base pay ranges and  benefit packages among the agencies. Figure 3 shows the base pay ranges  (minimum and maximum) for the mission-critical occupations, excluding  executives at the 10 agencies. As shown in the same figure, the actual  average base pay among the 10 agencies also varies somewhat in relation to  the agencies\u2019 respective base pay ranges, which according to agency  officials, could be affected by the average length of service of employees,  and the fact that some agencies tend to hire employees at certain grade  levels.", "Because each financial regulator sets its own locality pay percentage based  on its respective policies, locality pay percentages often differ from those  that OPM sets for General Schedule employees (with the exception of  CFTC) and vary among agencies for the same duty station. For example, in  New York City, the OPM locality pay percentage is 22.97 percent but the  regulators\u2019 locality pay percentages range from 21.19 at FDIC and FHFB to  33.20 percent at OTS. Table 2 shows the locality pay percentages for OPM  and for the eight financial regulators that have locality pay percentages for  selected cities.", "The benefits that the 10 financial regulators offered also varied, which we  discuss in detail in appendix IV. For example, half of the regulators offer  their employees 401(k) retirement savings plans with varying employer  contributions in addition to offering the governmentwide Federal Thrift  Saving Plan (except for the Federal Reserve Board). According to agency  officials, factors such as the year an agency first became subject to  comparability provisions, budget constraints, the needs and preferences of  different workforces, and ways to attract and retain workforces play a role  in compensation decisions and contribute to the variations in pay ranges  and benefits. Moreover, agency officials emphasized that it was not their  goal to have identical pay and benefits packages; rather, they considered  pay and benefits as a total package when seeking to maintain pay and  benefits comparability and when setting pay policies aimed at recruiting  and retaining employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Employees Have Moved among the Financial Regulators, Most Resigned from Federal Employment", "paragraphs": ["While the total number of financial regulatory employees resigning from  federal employment between fiscal years 1990 and 2006 generally declined,  there was no clear trend among the number who moved to another  financial regulator. As shown in figure 4, the number of employees leaving  one federal regulator for another declined from the previous fiscal year in  10 of the 16 years and increased from the previous fiscal year in the other 6  years. Figure 4 also shows the percentage of financial regulatory  employees who went to another financial regulator, went to other federal  agencies, and resigned from federal employment, and the total number of  financial regulatory employees during this period. Of all the employees  who left their financial regulatory agency voluntarily (moved to another  financial regulator or executive branch agency, or resigned) from fiscal  year 1990 through fiscal year 2006, the vast majority\u201486 percent (13,433)\u2014 of the 15,627 employees leaving the regulators voluntarily (i.e., moved or  resigned), resigned from the federal government. The number of employees  who moved to another financial regulator ranged from a low of 16 of 1,362  who moved or resigned in fiscal year 1997 to a high of 97 of 1,229 who  moved or resigned in fiscal year 1991. The total number of financial  regulator employees was 15,400 and 19,796 during those 2 years,  respectively. Similar lows were also experienced in 1996 and 2003. Some  agency officials told us that they believe that the FIRREA comparability  provision and similar provisions in subsequent laws applicable to financial  regulators have been effective in ensuring that regulators\u2019 pay and benefits  are generally comparable among the 10 agencies, which probably helps  minimize employee movement among financial regulatory agencies. Of the  financial regulator employees who moved or resigned, the percentage of  those who resigned from federal employment fluctuated slightly over the  period, ranging from a low of 73.7 percent in fiscal year 2003 to a high of  94.8 percent in fiscal year 1996.", "The movement of mission-critical employees among financial regulators  also did not reveal a discernible trend. For the number of employees who  moved to another financial regulator from fiscal year 1990 through fiscal  year 2006, see table 10 in appendix V. The numbers ranged from no  movement for 7 of the 11 occupational categories (accountants, auditors,  business specialists, economists, financial analysts, investigators, and  information technology (IT) specialists) in at least 1 of the fiscal years we  reviewed to a high of 37 employees (38.1 percent of all those who moved  that fiscal year) for the \u201call other\u201d occupational category in fiscal year  1991. During this period (fiscal years 1990 to 2006), some occupational  categories experienced very little movement. For example, fewer  accountants, auditors, business specialists, and investigators moved than  employees in the other categories. In contrast, examiners had the largest  number of employees moving among financial regulators in 8 of the 17  years, including the 3 most recent years for which data were available. The  average number of employees in mission-critical occupations moving  among the 9 financial regulators from fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year  2006 ranged from 0.1 for investigators to 11.7 for examiners. See appendix  V for additional data on employee movement.", "For those employees that did not move to another financial regulator, we  could not determine in all cases where the employees moved because  CPDF, the most complete data set available with federal employment  information, does not include information on employment outside  executive branch agencies.

These numbers ranged from a low of 48 in  fiscal year 1994 to a high of 128 in fiscal year 1991, higher than the number  of employees who moved to another financial regulator, which was 23 in  fiscal year 1994 and 97 in fiscal year 1991. Officials from the 9 agencies told  us that they do not track the employment of their employees after the  employees leave their agencies.

These regulators have taken various  approaches to revise their performance management systems and  introduce performance-based pay. Although the regulators have  incorporated many of the key practices for effective performance  management systems, opportunities exist for a number of them to make  improvements as they continue to refine their systems. Specifically, some  regulators have opportunities in the areas of strengthening safeguards to  enhance transparency and fairness and making meaningful distinctions in  performance. As some regulators develop new systems or revise their  existing systems, they have an opportunity to build in aspects of the key  practices, such as improving transparency by communicating the overall  results of performance appraisal rating and performance-based pay  increase decisions to all employees to help employees understand how  they performed relative to other employees in their organization, while  protecting individual confidentiality. For regulators that negotiate with  unions, there are also opportunities to work together to accomplish this.", "SEC has some additional opportunities to pursue improvements in specific  aspects of its performance management system, which it is in the process  of revamping. For example, SEC can establish and communicate to  nonexecutive employees using the new system clear criteria for making  performance rating and pay increase decisions. Finally, while it may have  been an isolated incident, by not completing performance assessments of  senior officers in the 2005 performance appraisal cycle we reviewed, SEC  missed an opportunity for two-way feedback and assessments of individual  and organizational progress toward organizational goals. While funding  circumstances specific to that appraisal cycle contributed to this situation,  in the future it will be important to complete assessments regardless of the  availability of funding for increases.", "The agencies have taken a variety of actions in seeking to maintain pay and  benefits comparability. While we did find some variation in base pay  ranges, locality pay percentages, actual average pay, and benefits among  the agencies, we found that a number of reasons could contribute to the  variation, including the following: regulators were granted flexibility under  Title V and subject to comparability requirements at varying times, pay and  benefits are considered comprehensively in seeking comparability, the  average length of service of employees, and where employees are located.", "While pay and benefits comparability cannot be precisely determined, all  the agencies are working to maintain comparability in pay and benefits.  One recent initiative\u2014studying the feasibility of conducting a common  survey on pay and benefits\u2014should help to increase the efficiency of this  effort. In addition, given the relatively small amount of employee  movement among federal regulators, the variation in pay, benefits, and  locality pay percentages in some locations across the regulators does not  appear to be encouraging large numbers of employees to move among  financial regulators. This may be an indication that the comparability  provisions of FIRREA and other pertinent legislation have been working as  intended.

These agencies are the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  (CFTC), the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Housing Finance Board  (FHFB), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve Board), the National Credit Union Administration  (NCUA), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Office of  Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the Office of Thrift  Supervision (OTS), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).", "To address our first objective, we analyzed documents on the regulators\u2019  performance management and pay systems, including guidance, policies,  and procedures on the systems; performance planning and appraisal forms;  union contracts and agreements; training materials; internal evaluations of  systems; and materials used to communicate with employees about the  systems.

Specifically, employees at FDIC, OCC, NCUA, and SEC are represented by  the National Treasury Employees Union, and OTS headquarters staff and  CFTC staff at two regional offices are represented by the American  Federation of Government Employees. Employees at FCA, the Federal  Reserve Board, FHFB, and OFHEO did not have a union; at these agencies  we spoke with employees who served on employee committees or working  groups.", "In addition, we examined small, select sets of individual performance plans  for employees, which outline the annual performance expectations for  employees. The selection of these performance plans was not intended to  allow us to make generalizations about all performance plans at the  agencies, and we have used information from the plans for illustrative  purposes only. The performance plans we received were selected by  agency officials based on our request for a mix of occupations and grade  levels at each agency. The smallest number of performance plans we  examined from an agency was one, in a case where the performance plans  for all employees are completely standardized. The largest number of plans  we reviewed from an agency was 32. The individual performance plans we  examined pertained to each agency\u2019s last completed performance appraisal  cycle when we began this review. Table 3 shows the appraisal cycle by  agency.", "Finally, we analyzed data from each agency on performance ratings and  performance-based pay awarded to employees as well as aggregate data on  all types of pay increases at each agency not linked to performance ratings.  We used these data to calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient  to show the strength of the relationship between employee performance  ratings and the associated performance-based percentage pay increases at each agency. In computing the correlation coefficients, we noted that a  few agencies used a table or procedure that specified particular pay  increases corresponding to specific ratings. Taken in isolation, the use of  the table or procedure would be expected to produce a perfect correlation,  i.e., +1.0. However, other aspects of these agencies\u2019 systems contributed to  the resulting coefficients being less than +1.0. For example, at one agency,  employees with rating scores below a certain threshold were not eligible  for any pay increase. While these employees may have had different rating  scores, none of them received a pay increase, which contributed to a  coefficient that was less than perfect. Other mechanistic factors in these  agencies\u2019 systems, such as adjusting or changing the specified percentage  pay increase based on the grade level or current salary of the employee,  also had the effect of producing a less than perfect coefficient at these  agencies. Given the influence that these procedural but nondiscretionary  variations may have had on the resulting coefficients at these agencies, the  coefficients are primarily useful in their overall demonstration of the  positive linkage between ratings and pay increases at all the agencies, and  the range of coefficients that occurs. The magnitude of the coefficients,  however, is not sufficient for ranking the agencies or making other types of  comparisons.", "We also analyzed agency data on performance ratings to determine the  distribution of employee performance ratings at each agency.

To show the financial  regulators\u2019 locality pay percentages and general schedule employees\u2019  locality pay percentages, we selected the cities where four or more  financial regulators had duty stations in fiscal year 2006.

For each fiscal year, we identified the number of employees in  selected mission-critical occupations at a financial regulator who (1)  moved to another financial regulator, (2) moved to other federal agencies,  and (3) resigned from federal employment. We identified those who moved  from one financial regulatory agency to another by identifying employees  who had a CPDF separation code for a voluntary transfer and who also had  a CPDF accession code from another financial regulatory agency within 25  days of the transfer out. Also, for each mission-critical occupation, we  examined the number of financial regulator employees who moved to  another financial regulator in each fiscal year and the average number of  employees who moved among the nine financial regulators over the 16  years of our review. Our analysis of supervisors included executives, who  constituted 1 to 2 percent of all supervisors who moved to another financial  regulator.

The agency provided us some data for fiscal years  1997 to 2005, including data on employees who transferred, resigned, were  fired, were subject to a reduction in force, or otherwise separated, and the  agency\u2019s total number of employees, but was unable to identify whether  their employees left for another financial regulator. Because the data the  agency provided were not comparable with the CPDF data we used for the  other financial regulators, we did not include the Federal Reserve Board in  our analysis. We also did not include information on the employment of  financial regulatory employees after they left federal employment because  CPDF does not include data on employment outside some agencies and  officials told us that they do not track the employment of their employees  after the employees leave their agencies.", "We assessed the reliability of the various sets of data used in our study. To  assess the reliability of the performance and pay increase data provided by  the agencies, we conducted various inspections and electronic testing of  the data for reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential  errors in accuracy and completeness. We also reviewed related agency  documentation, interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the  data, and brought to the attention of these officials any concerns or  discrepancies we found with the data for correction or updating. Based on  the results of these procedures, we believe the data are sufficiently reliable  for use in the analyses presented in this report. We did not independently  verify the pay and benefits data we received from the agencies but consider  these data sufficiently reliable for the illustrative purpose of our review.  Based on our data reliability testing of CPDF data, we believe the CPDF  data are sufficiently reliable for this review. When analyzing employee  movement using CPDF data, we found exceptions from standard personnel  procedures, such as employees with a transfer-out code but with an  accession code in the hiring agency that was not a transfer-in code, or  employee records with transfer-out and transfer-in dates that exceeded 3  calendar days. We also found duplicate separation or accession records for  the same individual on the same day. We deleted one of the duplicate  records. We also found cases where an individual had two separation  actions on the same day but they were different types of actions (e.g., a  transfer out and a resignation). Because we could not determine which  separation action was the correct one, we deleted both records. However,  these types of data problems represented less than one-tenth of 1 percent  of the data used.

This is especially the case for smaller agencies, such as FCA  and FHFB, which tend to have smaller human capital (personnel)  departments than larger agencies that may have pay and benefits  specialists who can handle comparability issues full time, including filling  out and processing various comparability surveys. According to officials  from a few regulators, partly as a result of the substantial investment of  time and resources, some agencies have not been timely or forthcoming in  sharing their pay and benefits information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Are Exploring the Feasibility of a Common Survey", "paragraphs": ["According to several agency officials, in response to renewed interest of  upper management from several agencies in consolidating pay and benefits  surveys, the regulators are studying the feasibility of such a method. In  December 2006, the regulators formed a subcommittee within the Financial  Regulatory Agency Group to study the feasibility of a common survey.  Agency officials are exploring whether consolidating the various  comparability surveys into a common survey will improve the process for  job matching and result in more efficient use of resources. They also told  us that the subcommittee also has discussed the feasibility of establishing a  Web-based data system to make the most current pay and benefits  information available to participating agencies. The subcommittee is  working on the details of allocating costs of a common survey among the  agencies, but has suggested that costs might be prorated based on the size  of each regulatory agency. As of March 2007, agency officials had not yet  received cost figures from potential consultants.", "Agency officials who attended the first subcommittee meeting told us that  implementation of a common survey would require collaboration and  agreement on a number of matters, such as   choice of external compensation consultant to conduct the common  survey, since different consultants have different approaches to carry  out the common survey;  group of jobs to be benchmarked for the common survey and best  approach for job matching, as some jobs are unique to certain agencies;  timing and frequency of the common survey to meet everyone\u2019s needs  since agencies determine pay and benefits at different times of the year  and would need the updated information when the need arises;   number and types of organizations to include in the common survey  because while all agencies would want to include the financial  regulators, some may need information from certain private-sector  entities; and,   cost of the common survey may be substantial, which according to some  agencies, is a potential concern.", "By forming the subcommittee to explore issues associated with developing  a common survey, agency officials have adopted some of the practices that  we identified that would enhance and sustain collaborative efforts. These  practices include defining and articulating a common outcome,  establishing means to operate across agency boundaries, and leveraging  resources.", "Agency officials who are members of the subcommittee told us that the  officials have sent a formal request for information to several consultant  candidates. The request inquired about the consultants\u2019 ability to plan and  execute a common survey that will provide customizable reports for each  agency and also create a secure, centralized data source on pay and  benefits. In addition, agency officials asked how the consultants would  approach job matching, a complicated task. For example, officials from  FDIC, OFHEO, and SEC told us that the use of different pay plans and  grades among agencies and the location of field offices in cities with  different employment market conditions contributed to the difficulty in  matching jobs across regulators. In addition, some agency officials said  that it is difficult to match jobs because agencies have different job  requirements that may differ even when a job title is the same. The  subcommittee received responses from various consultants and as of  March 2007 was in the process of contacting the consultants to gather more  details and to discuss the options available to them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Regulators Used Benchmarks Developed from Surveys and Other Data to Assess Comparability and Make Adjustments to Pay and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of a legislative definition, agency officials told us that  agencies have used various benchmarks, as shown in table 6, to assess pay  and benefits comparability. For example, FDIC has sought to set its total  pay ranges (base pay plus locality pay) for specific occupations and grade  levels within 10 percent of the average of FIRREA agencies, a benchmark  that pay and benefits consultants have used in their comparability surveys.  FCA uses benchmarks, including average market rate paid by other  financial regulators. CFTC uses average payroll and salary structure  relative to other regulators. FHFB, NCUA, OTS, and SEC told us that they  have not used specific benchmarks, and OTS uses informal benchmarks as  needed.", "Agency officials told us that all agencies, including the three agencies that  have not conducted formal benefits surveys, have assessed their benefits  comparability by comparing individual benefit items as well as agency  contributions to specific benefits. They added that most agencies have  used the interagency group spreadsheet that lists all the benefits and  agency contributions offered.", "According to agency officials, the financial regulators have used  information from the pay and benefits comparability surveys and  discussions among the agencies in their efforts to seek to maintain  comparability. Table 7 provides some recent examples of these efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Pay and Benefits Policies and Several Other Factors Contribute to Variations in Pay and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Although the financial regulators have adjusted their pay and benefits to  seek to maintain comparability, several factors influence compensation  decisions that lead to some variations in pay ranges and benefit packages.  As shown in figure 3 in the report, with the exception of the Federal  Reserve Board and OFHEO, the financial regulators\u2019 total pay ranges  consist of base pay and locality pay percentages that are calculated based  on the employees\u2019 duty station. The Federal Reserve Board and OFHEO do  not have separate locality pay percentages because Washington, D.C., is  their only duty station. Figure 3 also shows that, for examiners, FDIC and  NCUA pay ranges generally have lower minimum base pay than other  agencies, and FDIC and OCC have higher maximum base pay for  examiners. In addition, for economists, CFTC and FDIC pay ranges have lower minimum base pay than other agencies, and the CFTC and OCC pay  ranges have higher maximum base pay.", "Actual average base pay figures that we obtained from the Central  Personnel Data File and from the Federal Reserve Board also vary among  the 10 agencies in relation to the agencies\u2019 respective base pay ranges, as  shown in figure 3 in the report. For example, the actual average base pay  for examiners at OCC ($92,371) is 52 percent of the maximum pay range of  $177,600. However, actual average base pay as a percentage of maximum  pay can vary considerably, as in the case of SEC attorneys. Their actual  average base pay ($124,379) is 98 percent of the maximum pay range of  $126,987.", "According to agency officials, two factors affect where actual average base  pay falls within an agency\u2019s pay range. One is the distribution of the length  of service among employees. For example, the actual average base pay for  agencies with a higher proportion of long-tenured employees would be  closer to the maximum of its pay range. Conversely, actual average base  pay for agencies with a higher proportion of new hires would fall closer to  the minimum of the pay scale. An OCC official told us that despite the fact  that OCC also has a large number of experienced examiners, the actual  average pay for OCC examiners may seem low compared to other agencies  because OCC has hired a large number of examiners during the last 2 years.  Officials from several federal regulators also told us that they rarely hire at  the lower grade level for some occupations. For example, FHFB tends to  hire mid-level employees because its relatively small office cannot afford a  long training period for new hires.", "As shown in table 2 in the report, locality pay percentages vary among  agencies for the same duty station. Table 8 shows the methods that  agencies are currently using to determine their respective locality pay  percentages and adjustments.", "The benefits that the 10 financial regulators offered also varied. Although  all of the agencies offer standard federal government benefits, there are  variations in the extent of agency contributions and types of additional  benefits these agencies offer. For example, all financial regulators offer the  Federal Employees Health Benefits program, but agency contributions  differ. Some agencies pay for a percentage of the health premium (e.g. 70  percent at FCA and 90 percent at OFHEO). CFTC contributes 100 percent  for reservists called to active duty. The following are selected examples of  the additional benefits that some financial regulators offer as of September  2006 unless noted otherwise:   Five of the 10 regulators\u2014 FDIC, FHFB, the Federal Reserve Board,  OCC, and OTS\u2014offer their employees 401(k) retirement savings plans  with varying employer contributions. In addition, all agencies except the  Federal Reserve Board offer the federal Thrift Savings Plan.", "The Federal Reserve Board and OCC offer domestic partner benefits for  some types of plans.", "FCA and SEC offer child care subsidies, and FDIC and OTS offer on-site  day care.", "FCA, FDIC, FHFB, and OCC reimburse employee expenses related to  items such as fitness, recreation, and adoption in their wellness  accounts. Amounts differ from $250 per year at FDIC to $700 per year at  FHFB.", "According to agency officials, a number of factors have influenced their  pay and benefits policies and could have contributed to the variations in  their pay ranges and benefits. For example, the length of time an agency  has been under the comparability requirements and related compensation  flexibility provisions affected compensation. CFTC and SEC officials told  us that because their agencies received pay and benefits flexibilities and  were put under a comparability requirement much later (in 2002) than the  six FIRREA agencies (in 1989), CFTC and SEC have taken an incremental  approach to slowly increase their pay and benefits to close the gap with the  other financial regulators. According to a CFTC official, this would allow  time for employee input and acceptance while building agency capacity to  manage the authority. Budgetary constraints represent another factor.  OFHEO officials told us that OFHEO did not implement a new 401(k)  retirement savings plan recommended by its external compensation  consultant, Watson Wyatt, in its 2005 comparability survey because OFHEO  is working to control the growth of its personnel expenses and because  budget limitations resulting from being part of the appropriations process  has caused OFHEO to curtail new benefits programs. Furthermore, agency  officials said that an agency has to consider the particular needs and  preferences of the agency\u2019s workforce as well as ways to attract and retain  its workforce. For example, CFTC added a fully paid dental benefit as a  result of an online vote by employees on preferred benefits options. FDIC  officials indicated that its employees greatly value the matching  contribution FDIC provides on its 401(k) plan, and found that the matching  contribution is also an effective retention tool. Similarly, OCC added a  401(k) retirement savings plan in order to attract and retain employees.  According to an SEC official, SEC uses a student loan repayment benefit  because the benefit helps to attract and retain employees, many of whom  are recent law school graduates. Agency officials emphasized that it was  not their goal to have identical pay and benefits packages; rather, they  considered pay and benefits as a total package when seeking to maintain  pay and benefits comparability and when setting pay and benefits policies  aimed at recruiting and retaining employees. See table 9 for more detailed  information on the benefits that the 10 financial regulators offer.", "The following table lists selected benefits identified by 10 financial  regulators as of September 2006, unless otherwise noted in the table. We  included the following categories of benefits: insurance, pre-tax benefits,  child care, leave, travel and relocation, educational and professional  expenses, retirement, work/life benefits, and other benefits and payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Movement Data of Financial Regulator Employees from Fiscal Years 1990 through 2006", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed the movement of financial regulator employees from fiscal  year 1990 through 2006 using data from the Central Personnel Data File  (CPDF).
