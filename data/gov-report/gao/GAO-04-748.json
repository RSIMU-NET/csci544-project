GAO assessed the New Starts process for the fiscal year 2005 cycle. GAO identified (1) the number of projects that were evaluated, rated, and proposed for new FFGAs and how recent changes to the process were reflected in ratings; (2) the proposed funding commitments in the administration's budget request and legislative reauthorization proposals; and (3) the extent to which amounts appropriated since 1998 fulfilled FFGAs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the fiscal year 2005 cycle, FTA evaluated 38 projects, rated 29 projects, and proposed 7 projects for funding. FTA recommended 5 of the 7 projects for full funding grant agreements (FFGAs). FTA considered the remaining 2 projects to be meritorious and recommended a total of $50 million for these projects in fiscal year 2005. However, FTA does not clearly explain how it decides which projects will be recommended for funding outside of FFGAs or what project sponsors must do to qualify for such a recommendation. Last year, in response to language contained in appropriations committee reports, FTA instituted a policy favoring projects that seek a federal New Starts share of no more than 60 percent of the total project cost--even though the law allows projects to seek up to 80 percent--in its recommendation for FFGAs. According to FTA officials, this policy allows more projects to receive funding and ensures that local governments play a major role in funding such projects. FTA describes the 60 percent policy as a general preference; however, FTA's fiscal year 2005 New Starts report suggests that this policy is absolute in that projects proposing more than a 60 percent federal New Starts share will not be recommended for an FFGA. Therefore, FTA agreed to describe the policy as a general preference in future reporting instructions, thus allowing for the possibility of exceptions. Although most of the projects evaluated during the current cycle proposed a federal New Starts share of less than 60 percent of total project costs, some project sponsors GAO interviewed raised concerns about the difficulties of securing the local funding share. However, the overall impact of this policy on projects is unknown. The administration's fiscal year 2005 budget proposal requests $1.5 billion for the New Starts program, a $225 million increase over the amount appropriated for the fiscal year 2004 cycle. Congress is currently considering legislative reauthorization proposals, which contain a number of provisions and initiatives for the New Starts program including streamlining the New Starts evaluation process for projects requesting less than $75 million in New Starts funds, expanding the definition of eligible projects, changing the ratings categories, and maintaining the maximum federal New Starts share at 80 percent of total project cost. Project sponsors GAO interviewed had varying views on these provisions, but most said that clear definitions would be needed for any proposed changes to the New Starts process. All 26 projects with existing FFGAs have not received funds as scheduled--the amount of funding appropriated was less than the amount authorized and scheduled by the FFGA. According to FTA, all completed projects have received the total amount authorized in the FFGAs, but not necessarily according to the original FFGA schedule. As of March 2004, the 26 projects have received a total of $294 million, or 5 percent, less than the amount scheduled by the projects' FFGAs. The amount and timing of differences varied for each project. Project sponsors GAO interviewed have developed methods to mitigate the impact of receiving less than the scheduled annual amount for their project, but these methods can generate additional costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1970s, the federal government has provided a large share of  the nation\u2019s capital investment in mass transportation. Much of this  investment has come through the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA)  New Starts program. The New Starts program awards full funding grant  agreements (FFGAs) for fixed-guideway rail, certain bus projects, trolley,  and ferry projects. An FFGA establishes the terms and conditions for  federal participation in a project, including the maximum amount of federal  funds available for the project, which by statute cannot exceed 80 percent  of its net cost. Since 1998, FTA has funded or recommended 26 projects for  FFGAs\u2014the total estimated cost of these projects exceeds $17.5 billion.", "Under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) and  subsequent amendments, Congress authorized approximately $8.3 billion  in New Starts contract authority through 2003. Although this level of  funding was higher than it had ever been, the demand for these resources is  also increasing. For example, in 1998, TEA-21 identified over 190 projects  nationwide as eligible to compete for New Starts funding. Several  additional projects not authorized in TEA-21 have since received  congressional appropriations. Because of this demand, TEA-21 directed  FTA to prioritize projects for funding by evaluating, rating, and  recommending potential projects on the basis of specific financial and  project justification criteria and to issue regulations outlining its evaluation  and rating process. FTA issued the regulations for evaluating and rating  New Starts projects in fiscal year 2001. For the fiscal year 2004 cycle, FTA  made two changes to the evaluation and ratings process. First, FTA  implemented the Transportation System User Benefits (TSUB) measure as  a variable in the calculation of cost-effectiveness and mobility  improvements. The new measure is intended to calculate the change in the  amount of travel time and costs that people incur for taking a trip. Second,  in response to language contained in appropriations committee reports,  FTA instituted a preference policy favoring projects that seek a federal New  Starts share of no more than 60 percent of the total project cost. Both of the  changes are reflected in the project justification and financial ratings of a  project, respectively, which, in turn, are combined to form a project\u2019s  overall rating.", "TEA-21 also requires us to report each year on FTA\u2019s processes and  procedures for evaluating, rating, and recommending New Starts projects  for federal funding and on the implementation of these processes and  procedures. This report discusses (1) the number of projects that were  evaluated, rated, and proposed for new FFGAs for fiscal year 2005 and on  how the recent changes to the process were reflected in ratings; (2) the  proposed funding commitments for New Starts in the administration\u2019s  fiscal year 2005 budget request and legislative reauthorization proposals;  and (3) the extent to which amounts appropriated since 1998 fulfilled  FFGAs. To address these objectives, we reviewed the administration\u2019s  fiscal year 2005 budget request and legislative reauthorization proposals as  well as FTA\u2019s annual New Starts reports and records on funding authorized  and appropriated to projects with existing FFGAs. We also interviewed FTA  officials, representatives of the American Public Transportation  Association and sponsors of 15 projects in preliminary engineering or final  design, and 5 projects with existing FFGAs. In addition, we attended FTA\u2019s  meeting with project sponsors, the New Starts Roundtable, in April 2004.

Under one of  these programs, New Starts, FTA identifies and funds worthy fixed- guideway transit projects, including heavy, light, and commuter rail; ferry;  and certain bus projects (such as bus rapid transit). We have recognized the  New Starts program as a model that the federal government could use for  approving other transportation projects.", "FTA generally funds New Starts projects through full funding grant  agreements (FFGAs). An FFGA establishes the terms and conditions for  federal participation in a project, including the maximum amount of federal  funds available for the project, as well as the project\u2019s scope, schedule, and  cost. By statute, the federal funding share for a New Starts project cannot  exceed 80 percent of its net cost. To obtain an FFGA, projects must go  through an extensive process from a regional multimodal transportation  planning process to preliminary engineering to final design and  construction. (See fig. 1.) As required by TEA-21, New Starts projects must  emerge from a regional, multimodal transportation planning process. The  first two phases of the New Starts process\u2014systems planning and  alternatives analysis\u2014address this requirement. The systems planning  phase identifies the transportation needs of a region, while the alternatives  analysis phase provides information on the benefits, costs, and impacts of  different corridor-level options, such as rail lines or bus routes. The  alternatives analysis phase results in the selection of a locally preferred  alternative\u2014which is intended to be the New Starts project that FTA  evaluates for funding. After a locally preferred alternative is selected,  project sponsors submit a request to FTA for entry into the preliminary  engineering phase. Following completion of preliminary engineering, the  project may be approved by FTA to advance into final design, after which  the project may be approved by FTA for an FFGA and proceed to  construction. FTA oversees the management of projects from the  preliminary engineering phase through construction and evaluates the  projects for advancement into each phase of the process, as well as  annually for the New Starts report to Congress.", "To determine whether a project should receive federal funds, FTA\u2019s New  Starts evaluation process assigns ratings on the basis of a variety of  financial and project justification criteria and determines an overall rating.  These criteria are identified in TEA-21 and reflect a broad range of benefits  and effects of the proposed projects, such as capital and operating finance  plans, mobility improvements, and cost-effectiveness. As figure 2 shows,  FTA has developed a series of measures for the project justification  criteria. FTA assigns proposed projects a rating of \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium-high,\u201d  \u201cmedium,\u201d \u201clow-medium,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d for each criterion. The individual  criterion ratings are combined into the summary financial and project  justification ratings. However, FTA does not weigh each individual criterion  equally when calculating the summary financial and project justification  ratings. For the summary project justification rating, FTA uses primarily  two criteria\u2014cost-effectiveness and land use. Each of these criteria  account for 50 percent of the summary project justification. Although FTA  considers the full range of criteria, according to an FTA official, the other  criteria do not produce meaningful distinctions among projects and,  therefore, are not given an official weight in the ratings process. FTA plans  to consider revisions to the measures for the other criteria after the  authorizing legislation is passed.", "On the basis of the summary project justification and financial ratings, FTA  develops the overall project rating. (Table 1 describes the criteria FTA uses  to assign overall project ratings.) The exceptions to the evaluation process  are statutorily \u201cexempt\u201d projects, which are those that request less than $25  million in New Starts funding. These projects are not required to submit  project justification information and do not receive ratings.", "Last year, we reported that FTA implemented two changes to the New  Starts process for the fiscal year 2004 cycle. (These changes are shaded in  fig. 2.) First, FTA changed the calculation of the cost-effectiveness and  mobility improvements criteria by adopting the Transportation System  User Benefits (TSUB) measure. This measure replaced the \u201ccost per new  rider\u201d measure that had been used in past ratings cycles. According to FTA,  the new measure reflects an important goal of any major transportation  investment\u2014reducing the amount of travel time that people incur for  taking a trip (i.e., the cost of mobility). In contrast to the \u201ccost per new  rider\u201d measure, the new measure considers travel time savings to both new  and existing transit system riders. Second, in response to appropriations  committee reports, FTA instituted a preference policy favoring projects  that seek a federal New Starts share of no more than 60 percent of the total  project cost. Under this preference policy, FTA gives projects seeking a  federal share of New Starts funding greater than 60 percent a \u201clow\u201d  financial rating, which further results in a \u201cnot recommended\u201d overall  project rating.", "As required by statute, FTA uses the evaluation and ratings process, along  with its consideration of the stage of development of New Starts projects,  to decide which projects to recommend to Congress for funding.  Although many projects receive an overall rating of \u201crecommended\u201d or  \u201chighly recommended,\u201d only a few are proposed for FFGAs in a given fiscal  year. FTA proposes \u201crecommended\u201d or \u201chighly recommended\u201d projects for  FFGAs when it believes that the projects will be able to meet certain  conditions during the fiscal year that the proposals are made. These  conditions include the following:  The local contribution to funding for the project must be made available  for distribution.", "The project must be in the final design phase and have progressed to the  point where uncertainties about costs, benefits, and impacts (e.g.,  environmental or financial) are minimized.", "The project must meet FTA\u2019s tests for readiness and technical capacity,  which confirm that there are no cost, project scope, or local financial  commitment issues remaining."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Changes to the Evaluation and Rating Process Present Challenges and Raise Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Of the 38 projects evaluated for the fiscal year 2005 cycle, 29 were rated  and 9 were statutorily exempt from the rating process because they  requested less than $25 million in New Starts funding.

FTA proposed 7 projects for funding for the fiscal year 2005  cycle, including 5 projects for FFGAs.

FTA officials explained that the 2 projects considered to  be meritorious this cycle are closer to being ready for an FFGA than the  other projects evaluated; however, FTA did not believe the 2 projects would  be ready for an FFGA in fiscal year 2005. FTA officials also told us that  decisions to recommend funding for projects outside of FFGAs are made  on an annual basis and are dependent on the readiness of the projects and  the availability of funds after funding for existing or new FFGAs is  allocated.

For example, for the fiscal year  2003 cycle, FTA considered 5 projects in preliminary engineering to be  meritorious.

FTA reported in its  annual New Starts report that the 5 projects \u201cmay be ready to progress  through final design and construction by the end of fiscal year 2003.\u201d  However, by the fiscal year 2005 cycle, only 1 of the projects had an FFGA.

Last year, we reported that many project sponsors  experienced difficulties that prevented them from producing accurate local  travel forecasts to calculate the TSUB measure, resulting in 11 projects  designated as \u201cnot rated\u201d for cost-effectiveness. Since that time, the  sponsors for 8 of those 11 projects were able to submit sufficient  information to receive a rating for cost-effectiveness, suggesting that they  were able to overcome the travel forecasting problem that they had  experienced during the first year of the measure\u2019s implementation.  However, 6 additional project sponsors were unable to generate reliable  local travel forecasts and thus could not calculate a valid TSUB value for  the fiscal year 2005 cycle, resulting in a total of 9 of the 29 projects  designated as \u201cnot rated\u201d for cost-effectiveness. According to FTA, the  major problem in implementing the measure this cycle stemmed from  problems with the underlying local travel forecasting models, not FTA\u2019s  software or the TSUB measure. For example, FTA noted that 22 of the 29  projects rated this year required some involvement by FTA to improve the  accuracy of their travel forecasts. Last year, we recommended that FTA  issue additional guidance describing its expectations regarding the local  travel forecasting models and the specific types of data FTA requires to  calculate the measure. FTA concurred with this recommendation and  provided additional guidance in its updated reporting instructions, issued  in June 2003, and has continued to provide technical assistance to project  sponsors.", "Despite the difficulties encountered in implementing TSUB, FTA and most  of the project sponsors we interviewed believe that this new measure is an  improvement over the \u201ccost per new rider\u201d measure because it takes into  account a broader set of benefits to transit riders. These benefits include  reductions in walk times, wait times, ride times, and numbers of transfers,  all of which produce perceived savings in travel time or \u201ctravel time  benefits\u201d for new riders as well as existing transit riders. By contrast, the  \u201ccost per new rider\u201d measure recognized benefits only for new transit  riders and did not measure benefits to existing transit riders.", "Although the majority of project sponsors we interviewed believe the new  measure is an improvement over the old one, many raised concerns about  the implementation of TSUB, including the approach for calculating TSUB  and the weight FTA applies to the cost-effectiveness criterion. For example,  they were concerned that the measure did not capture all benefits that  accrue to the transportation corridor, notably for highway users; the  amount of time provided to incorporate changes to their local travel  forecasting software was insufficient; and the weight FTA applies to the  cost-effectiveness criterion is disproportional to other criteria. Specifically,  many project sponsors were unclear about the basis for a 45-minute cap on  travel time savings included in the calculation of TSUB. According to an  FTA official, this cap allows FTA to limit travel time savings to less than 45  minutes, which they feel is appropriate, when examining the benefits of  each project. FTA\u2019s experience has been that time savings in excess of 45  minutes is usually due to problems with the local travel forecasting model.  However, FTA has allowed for exceptions to the cap in the past if well  justified by local project sponsors.", "FTA assigns a significant weight to the cost-effectiveness criterion in  comparison with other criteria used to calculate the project justification  rating. According to the New Starts report, cost-effectiveness accounts for  50 percent of the project justification rating. Land use accounts for the  other 50 percent. Thus, although cost-effectiveness accounts for 50 percent  of the project justification rating, a \u201clow\u201d cost-effectiveness rating can be  offset by a \u201chigh\u201d land use rating. This appears to be the case for the  majority of projects proposed for funding for the fiscal year 2005 cycle. As  table 2 shows, five of the seven projects proposed for funding received a  \u201clow-medium\u201d cost-effectiveness rating. However, the projects\u2019 land use  ratings raised their summary project justification ratings to \u201cmedium,\u201d  which allowed them to receive an overall \u201crecommended\u201d rating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Project Sponsors Proposed a Federal New Starts Share of Less Than 60 Percent, but Some Raised Concerns about FTA\u2019s Push for Lower Federal New Starts Share", "paragraphs": ["FTA instituted a policy favoring projects that seek a federal New Starts  share of no more than 60 percent of the total project cost in fiscal year  2004.

The report states \u201cthe conferees direct  FTA not to sign any new FFGAs after September 30, 2002, that have a  maximum federal share of higher than 60 percent.\u201d Similar language has  been included in all subsequent appropriations committee reports. Further,  FTA officials told us that this policy would allow more projects to receive  funding by spreading limited resources among them and ensure that local  governments whose regions stand to receive substantial benefits for the  project play a major role in funding such projects. However, when FTA  implemented the 60 percent policy, it did not amend its regulations to  support the change in policy or its current procedures. As a result, we  noted last year that FTA did not provide an opportunity for public comment  on the impact of the preference policy. We further advised that explicitly  stating criteria and procedures in regulations would ensure that project  sponsors were fully aware of the preference policy. Accordingly, last year  we recommended that FTA amend its regulations governing the New Starts  share for projects to reflect its current policy. FTA disagreed with our  recommendation, noting it was not required to issue regulations because  the policy was not legally binding. Moreover, according to FTA officials, the  preference policy is explained in both the fiscal year 2004 and 2005 New  Starts reports and in its June 2003 reporting instructions.", "Although FTA\u2019s preference policy, as expressed in the recent New Starts  report, favors projects that request a federal New Starts share of no more  than 60 percent, FTA is encouraging project sponsors to request an even  lower federal New Starts share. Specifically, some project sponsors have  stated that FTA encourages project sponsors to propose a federal New  Starts share of no more than 50 percent\u2014which is consistent with the  administration\u2019s reauthorization proposal. This push for a lower New Starts  share is reflected in FTA\u2019s rating process. As table 3 indicates, the lower the  amount of New Starts funding requested, the higher the New Starts share  rating. According to the New Starts report, the non-New Starts share rating  accounts for 20 percent of a project\u2019s financial rating.", "The project sponsors we contacted expressed concerns about the  preference policy. Although the majority of the projects evaluated during  the current cycle requested a federal New Starts share of less than 60  percent, many of the project sponsors we interviewed indicated that they  had proposed a share that was in line with FTA\u2019s policy in order to remain  competitive. More than half of those interviewed told us they faced  difficulties in advancing New Starts projects under such a policy. For  example, some project sponsors told us that transit projects have a difficult  time competing with highway projects in the local planning process  because highway projects typically require a 20 percent local match,  whereas New Starts projects require a match of at least 40 percent. Other  project sponsors described the limited resources available at the local level  to advance New Starts projects. A number of project sponsors also  expressed concerns about FTA\u2019s efforts to lower the federal New Starts  share to 50 percent. For example, one project sponsor indicated that their  project would have to drop out of the process, others indicated that the  projects would have to be redesigned, and one project sponsor indicated  that requesting a lower federal New Starts share would weaken the  project\u2019s financial plan.", "According to the fiscal year 2005 New Starts report, projects that request  more than a 60 percent federal New Starts share are not recommended to  Congress for FFGAs.

TEA-21 required FTA to consider the strength of  the local financial commitment, including the extent to which the project  will have a federal New Starts share of less than 80 percent. In our view,  FTA\u2019s policy to favor projects with a lower federal share is permissible as  long as projects are not required to request less than an 80 percent federal  New Starts share in order to be considered for recommendation for an  FFGA. FTA\u2019s description of the preference policy in its fiscal year 2005 New  Starts report suggests that this policy is absolute in that projects proposing  more than a 60 percent federal New Starts share will not be recommended  for an FFGA.

FTA\u2019s project management oversight contractors  have been conducting the assessments, focusing on the projects that are  closest to receiving an FFGA.

Currently, TEA-21 limits New  Starts funding to fixed-guideway projects. Both the House and Senate  reauthorization proposals would allow certain nonfixed-guideway  transit projects (e.g., bus rapid transit operating in nonexclusive lanes)  to be eligible for New Starts funding, opening the program up to projects  that currently are ineligible. Specifically, the Senate proposal would  allow nonfixed-guideway projects requesting less than $75 million to be  eligible for New Starts funding. The House proposal would expand New  Starts funding eligibility to include nonfixed-guideway projects with a  majority of fixed-guideway components seeking between $25 million  and $75 million, as part of its \u201cSmall Starts\u201d initiative. The majority of  project sponsors we interviewed supported this initiative, some noting  that broadening the program to include nonfixed-guideway projects  would open more transit possibilities for localities. However, some  project sponsors did express concerns about the already high demand  on New Starts funding and noted that nonfixed-guideway projects could  receive funds through other federal programs or capital funds. As a  result, a number of project sponsors that support expanding the  program said increased and/or separate funding and a clear definition of  eligible projects are needed.

FFGAs are multiyear contractual agreements  between FTA and project sponsors for a specified amount of funding,  which are subject to the annual appropriations process. The full amount of  funding is committed to the projects over a set period, and the FFGA  contains a schedule of annual federal payments to fulfill FTA\u2019s  commitment. According to FTA, all completed New Starts projects received  the total FFGA amount but not necessarily according to the original FFGA  schedule. FTA will continue to request funds to be appropriated to meet the  amounts authorized in existing FFGAs.

As of March 2004, 7 had received over 10 percent  less than the scheduled amount, 2 had received between 5 and 10 percent  less than scheduled, and 17 projects had received up to 5 percent less than  scheduled. The timing of the differences in funding also varied. Some  projects experienced substantial differences between appropriated and  scheduled amounts at the beginning or near the end of their FFGA, but it  was more common for projects to experience funding differences  throughout. (See app. III for the total amount of differences for each  project with an existing FFGA.)", "Several factors contributed to projects receiving less New Starts funding  than scheduled. The amount of funding authorized by an FFGA is subject to  the annual appropriations process and, therefore, differences may arise  because of congressional decision making. In addition, projects receive  less than the amounts authorized by the FFGAs because FTA retains 1  percent of the funding provided each year to cover the cost of its project  management oversight. According to FTA officials, each year FTA  requests funding to cover the project management oversight costs, but  these funds are typically not appropriated. FTA may also request that less  New Starts funding be appropriated to a project than scheduled by the  FFGA if it is concerned about a specific project\u2019s progress; however, FTA  officials said they rarely recommend less funding than is scheduled.", "Faced with these variances in funding, project officials we interviewed  have developed methods to mitigate the impact of receiving less than the  scheduled annual amount for their project. Some project officials entered  into partnerships with the state and/or local government. For example, one  transit agency arranged for the state to contribute more funds early on in  the project and, as a result, the funding schedule did not adversely affect  the project. Other projects implemented interim funding mechanisms to  cover any FFGA variances, including issuing bonds or loans to generate  necessary funds. None of the 5 project officials we contacted had to change  the scope or schedule of their project solely due to funding variances.  However, officials from these projects said that interim financing  ultimately increased the cost of the project. For example, the Portland  Interstate MAX project incurred approximately $3 million in borrowing  costs, which equaled 4 percent of the total local commitment to the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To receive an FFGA, projects must go through a lengthy evaluation process  by FTA\u2014from planning to preliminary engineering to final design. The  steps for advancing through the evaluation process and securing an FFGA  are well documented in FTA\u2019s New Starts reports and other published  guidance. Documentation of these steps is important to ensure a common  understanding among projects sponsors and to increase the transparency  of the process. Like other programs, the transparency of the New Starts  process is critical in ensuring that project sponsors view the process as fair  and objective. Although the process for securing an FFGA is well-defined,  FTA\u2019s identification of meritorious projects\u2014and the subsequent proposed  funding of these projects\u2014is not. While FTA officials were able to provide  us additional insight regarding funding recommendations for these  projects, FTA\u2019s New Starts reports and other published guidance are not  clear in its meaning. In particular, the rationale for the funding  recommendation for these two projects in FTA\u2019s New Starts Report for  Fiscal Year 2005 is very broad and lacks necessary detail. FTA does not  explain how it decides which projects will be recommended for funding  outside of FFGAs and what project sponsors must do to qualify for such a  recommendation. In addition, FTA did not justify the level of funding  proposed for these projects for fiscal year 2005\u2014which is a substantial  increase compared to amounts proposed for similar projects in the past.  Consequently, it is difficult to understand why these two meritorious  projects are more worthy of funding than other projects in the pipeline.", "The implementation of FTA\u2019s policy favoring projects requesting a federal  New Starts share of less than 60 percent also continues to create challenges  for some project sponsors and raises concerns. According to FTA, its policy  is in response to language contained in appropriations committee reports  and will result in more projects receiving funding by spreading limited  resources among them and ensuring that local governments whose regions  would benefit from the project play a major role in funding such projects.  However, many of the project sponsors we interviewed experienced  challenges in trying to secure a larger local match to comply with FTA\u2019s  preference policy. Several project sponsors also stated that FTA\u2019s push for a  lower federal New Starts share would likely affect their decision to  advance future transit projects.
