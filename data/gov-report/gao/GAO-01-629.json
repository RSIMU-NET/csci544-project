The National Security Council (NSC) told GAO that international crime and the framework for the U.S. response are under review by the new administration. The extent of International crime is growing, but measuring its true extent is difficult. Several efforts have been made to gauge the threat posed to the United States and other countries by international crime. The 1999 threat assessment was classified, but a published version of the 2000 assessment divided the threat into the following five broad categories: (1) terrorism and drug trafficking; (2) illegal immigration, trafficking of women and children, and environmental crimes; (3) illicit transfer or trafficking of products across international borders; (4) economic trade crimes; and (5) financial crimes. NSC identified 34 federal entities with significant roles in fighting international crime. These included the Department of Justice, Treasury, and State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The efforts to combat public corruption internationally involves two strategies: the elimination of bribes in transnational business activities, such as government contracting, and the implementation of law assistance, which focuses on U.S. support for legal, judicial, and law enforcement reform efforts by foreign governments. Much of the technical assistance that the U.S. provides to other nations for fighting international crime involves training, particularly training at law enforcement academies established abroad. There are no standard measures of effectiveness to assess the federal government's overall efforts to address international crime. Justice's, Treasury's, and State's plans describe their efforts to combat specific types of crime, along with the performance measures to be tracked. In some cases, however, these measures do not adequately address effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your August 2000 request that we review the nature and extent of the federal response to international crime\u2014 including drugs and arms trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, public corruption, and other criminal activities that transcend national borders.

In 1995, the President identified international crime as a threat to the national interest of the United States. Prior to and since then, the federal government has been engaged in a crosscutting effort to address various types of such crime, including money laundering, terrorism, and public corruption. Despite the multiagency nature of the federal response, no sustained executive-level coordination\u2014for which NSC has the designated responsibility\u2014has been apparent. Furthermore, in the past, the government has neither tracked nor prioritized the billions of dollars in spending on certain elements of the response, such as combating terrorism. In addition, because of the absence of governmentwide, outcome-oriented performance measures, the effectiveness and impact of the response are unclear. Our prior work on other national issues that involve crosscutting responses\u2014ranging from employment training to counterterrorism\u2014shows that, ultimately, achieving any meaningful results requires firm linkages of strategy, resources, and outcome-oriented performance measures. Otherwise, scarce resources are likely to be wasted, overall effectiveness will be limited or not known, and accountability will not be ensured. Accordingly, we are recommending that the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs take appropriate action to ensure sustained executive-level coordination and assessment of the multiagency federal efforts in connection with international crime.", "Presented below is summary information about each of the topics that we studied. More detailed information about each topic is presented in appendixes II through VII, respectively:   U.S. framework for addressing international crime. The U.S. government\u2019s framework for addressing international crime was the result of several developments. For example, in October 1995, recognizing that international crime presented a direct and immediate threat to national security, Presidential Decision Directive 42 (PDD-42) directed the development of an effective U.S. response. As a key part of the response, in May 1998, the President announced the U.S. government\u2019s International Crime Control Strategy, which was formulated with input from multiple law enforcement agencies and was intended to serve as a dynamic, evolving roadmap for a coordinated, long-term attack on international crime. The strategy consists of 8 overarching goals (e.g., \u201ccounter international financial crime\u201d) and 30 implementing objectives (e.g., \u201cseize the assets of international criminals through aggressive use of forfeiture law\u201d) and was intended to complement and not supplant related strategies, such as the National Drug Control Strategy. The crime control strategy has not been updated since its inception to reflect changes in the threat from international crime. In April 2001, in response to our inquiry, NSC officials told us that the issue of international crime and the framework for the U.S. response were under review by the new administration. The NSC officials had no estimate of when the review would be completed; however, the officials said that PDD-42 and the International Crime Control Strategy were still considered to be in effect during the ongoing review process. (See app. II.)", "Extent of international crime. While there is general consensus among law enforcement officials, researchers, and others that international crime is growing, there is also agreement that measuring the true extent of such crime is difficult. Nevertheless, several efforts have attempted to gauge the extent of and the threat posed by international crime to the United States and other countries. For example, in 1999 and 2000, threat assessments were prepared to support the International Crime Control Strategy. While the 1999 threat assessment was classified, a published version of the 2000 assessment provided various indicators or measures of international crime within five broad categories\u2014(1) terrorism and drug trafficking; (2) illegal immigration, trafficking of women and children, and environmental crimes; (3) illicit transfer or trafficking of products across international borders; (4) economic trade crimes; and (5) financial crimes. Furthermore, within each of the five broad categories, specific types of crimes were discussed. Regarding the financial crime category, for example, the assessment noted that worldwide money laundering could involve roughly $1 trillion per year, with $300 billion to $500 billion of that representing laundering related to drug trafficking. The assessment acknowledged, however, that there is little analytical work supporting most estimates of money laundering. According to NSC, whether the threat assessment would continue to be updated periodically is being considered as part of the new administration\u2019s review of international crime and no decisions had been made in this regard. (See app. III.)", "Selected federal entities\u2019 roles in responding to international crime and coordination of the response. In response to our inquiry, NSC identified 34 federal entities\u2014including cabinet-level departments and their components, and independent agencies\u2014that it considered as having significant roles in fighting international crime. The federal entities included those that are the focus of this report, namely the departments of Justice, Treasury, and State, and USAID. Within Justice, for example, relevant components include the Criminal Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. National Central Bureau of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), U.S. Marshals Service, and U.S. Attorney Offices. Relevant Treasury components include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF); Customs Service; Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation; Secret Service; Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Within State, the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has a significant role, which includes coordinating and funding U.S. training assistance provided to foreign law enforcement entities; also within State, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Coordinator for Counterterrorism have roles in combating international crime. To illustrate the broad interagency nature of international crime control, in 1997 we identified 43 federal entities with terrorism-related programs and activities. Similarly, 41 federal entities have an interest or are involved in operations at U.S. seaports; 15 of these entities have some jurisdiction over criminal activities occurring at these seaports, according to an interagency commission report.", "Implementation of the International Crime Control Strategy inherently involves some jurisdictional overlaps, which necessitate coordination among agencies. To facilitate executive-level coordination of the strategy, PDD-42 established the Special Coordination Group on International Crime, composed of high-level officials from relevant agencies and chaired by a senior NSC official. The Special Coordination Group was to meet periodically to ensure an integrated focus on the federal response to international crime. According to State and NSC officials, however, while the Special Coordination Group met 14 times in 1998, it met infrequently thereafter. At one point the Special Coordination Group did not meet at all for about 9 months (between September 1999 and June 2000) because some of its members were involved in other activities, such as preparing for year-2000 computer compliance and because of staffing shortages. In this regard, two NSC staff were assigned to coordinate international crime matters.", "A Presidential directive issued in February 2001 (National Security Presidential Directive 1, or NSPD-1) reorganized NSC and abolished the existing structure of interagency groups, including the Special Coordination Group. The directive did not indicate how the overall response to international crime would be coordinated at the time under NSC\u2019s new structure. In April 2001, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs established a Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) for International Organized Crime. The PCC is to be comprised of officials at the Assistant Secretary level from relevant federal entities and is to be chaired by the NSC Senior Director for Transnational Threats. The PCC is to coordinate policy formulation, program oversight, and new initiatives related to a number of international crime issues, including arms trafficking, trafficking in persons, and foreign official corruption. According to NSC, one of the PCC\u2019s priorities is to evaluate the 1998 International Crime Control Strategy.", "Various other departmental and agency-level coordination mechanisms\u2014 such as coordination centers, interagency coordinators, and working groups\u2014have been established over the years to address specific types of international crimes. For example, Justice and State recently created a center for combating trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling. (See app. IV.)", "Efforts to combat public corruption internationally. The International Crime Control Strategy addresses corruption in two contexts. One context involves efforts to eliminate the use of bribes in transnational business activities, such as government contracting. In this context, an international anti-bribery agreement adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) represents an effort to eliminate bribery of foreign public officials in business transactions. This agreement\u2014the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions\u2014entered into force in 1999. The Convention generally requires signatory nations to criminalize bribes to foreign public officials made to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business. Essentially, the Convention, according to State, reflects the long-term U.S. interest in creating a level playing field among the world\u2019s major trading nations by internationalizing the anti- bribery principles of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (P.L. 95-213),which the United States enacted in 1977. The Departments of State and Commerce are required to provide the Congress with annual reports on the implementation of the OECD Convention. In its third annual report, issued in July 2001, Commerce noted that progress has been made on the first priority of ensuring that all signatories deposit an instrument of ratification with OECD. As of July 2001, 33 of the 34 signatories to the Convention had deposited instruments of ratification and 30 have legislation in place to implement the Convention. The report pointed out that the United States continued to have concerns about the adequacy of countries\u2019 legislation to meet all commitments under the Convention.", "The strategy\u2019s other context on public corruption involves rule of law assistance, which focuses on U.S. support for legal, judicial, and law enforcement reform efforts undertaken by foreign governments. Generally, proponents view such assistance as being especially important in that widespread corruption among justice and security officials can potentially destabilize governments. In a 1999 report to congressional requesters, we noted that the United States provided at least $970 million in rule of law assistance to countries throughout the world from fiscal years 1993 through 1998. Four regions\u2014Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Central Europe, and the New Independent States\u2014received about 80 percent of the total. Our 1999 report also noted that at least 35 federal entities\u2014consisting of 7 cabinet-level departments and 28 related agencies, bureaus, and offices\u2014had a role in providing the assistance. Furthermore, the report recognized that, due to longstanding congressional concerns about ineffective coordination, in February 1999, State appointed a rule of law coordinator to work with all the relevant U.S. governmental entities. More recently, in April 2001, we reported that\u2014 after 10 years and almost $200 million in funding\u2014rule of law assistance to 12 countries of the former Soviet Union had shown limited results. We recommended that program management be improved by implementing requirements for projects to include specific strategies for (1) achieving impact and sustainable results and (2) monitoring and evaluating outcomes. (See app. V.)", "U.S. programs for providing technical assistance. Much of the technical assistance that the United States provides to other nations for fighting international crime involves training, particularly training at law enforcement academies established abroad. For instance, State Department-funded academies have been established in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Southern Africa, and plans are underway to establish an academy to serve Central America. Also, the Department of Justice strives to strengthen justice systems abroad through training and assistance in developing criminal justice institutions provided through two programs\u2014 (1) the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program and (2) Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training. In addition to training, federal agencies\u2014particularly Justice and Treasury\u2014 help foreign nations combat international crime by providing technical assistance through specialized support services and systems, such as computerized databases and forensic laboratories. For example, the National Tracing Center\u2014operated by ATF\u2014traces firearms for foreign law enforcement agencies, as well as for federal and state agencies. (See app. VI.)", "Measures of the effectiveness of U.S. efforts. There are no standard measures of effectiveness to assess the federal government\u2019s overall efforts to address international crime. As one of its objectives, the International Crime Control Strategy indicated that a governmentwide performance measurement system for international crime would be established\u2014similar to the system for measuring the effectiveness of the nation\u2019s drug control efforts implemented by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. However, according to NSC officials, no actions were ever taken to establish such as system. Rather, the task of developing performance measures was deferred to the individual federal entities with roles in combating international crime.", "Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), federal agencies are to prepare strategic and performance plans, which describe their respective program activities and how effectiveness will be measured. Regarding international crime, Justice\u2019s, Treasury\u2019s, and State\u2019s plans each have sections describing their efforts to combat specific types of crime, along with the performance measures to be tracked. In some cases, however, these measures do not adequately address effectiveness. For example, in June 2000, we reported our observations on key outcomes described in Justice\u2019s performance report and plan. Among other things, we noted that Justice\u2019s performance measures focused on outputs rather than outcomes and did not capture all aspects of performance. Furthermore, in a broader context\u2014despite the existence of GPRA-related reports and plans\u2014there has been no effort to consolidate the various federal agencies\u2019 results into an overall performance measurement system, as envisioned by the International Crime Control Strategy.", "Another performance measurement mechanism applicable to international crime involves focusing on selected types of crimes. That is, for a few types of international crimes, the government has developed separate strategies that include measures of results and effectiveness. The most notable such strategy is the National Drug Control Strategy, which identifies goals, objectives, and performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of the nation\u2019s war on drugs. Similar national strategies have been developed for money laundering and counterterrorism. These national strategies\u2014although focused on specific types of crimes\u2014are nonetheless similar to the International Crime Control Strategy in that challenges are presented in developing goals, objectives, and indicators that adequately measure results and effectiveness. (See app. VII.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["We believe it is appropriate that the new administration is currently reviewing the existing framework for addressing international crime and considering options for top-level coordination mechanisms. But, it is also important for systems to be in place to ensure that crosscutting goals are consistent, program efforts are mutually reinforcing\u2014and, where appropriate, common or complementary performance measures are used as a basis for results-oriented management. In past reports, we have noted instances across a wide range of federal programs where a lack of executive-level coordination has led to inefficient and/or ineffective programs, including those to combat specific types of international crime such as terrorism. Generally, at the field or operational levels in relation to specific types or aspects of international crimes, a wide range of inter- and intra-agency coordination activities arguably are being carried out routinely. However, these activities cannot take the place of top-level leadership in setting and implementing an overall strategy to ensure that priorities are being established, federal goals and objectives are being met, and governmentwide performance is being measured.", "International crime is a complex and multifaceted issue of great national importance. Accordingly, the U.S. response to international crime involves a wide variety of federal entities spending a significant amount of time and money. We recognize that individual federal entities have developed strategies to address a variety of international crime issues. We also recognize that for some crimes, integrated mechanisms exist to coordinate efforts across agencies, and that, at the operational level, law enforcement and other personnel are working across agencies. However, we believe that without an up-to-date and integrated strategy and sustained top-level leadership to implement and monitor it, the risk is high that scarce resources will be wasted, overall effectiveness will be limited or not known, and accountability will not be ensured. Accordingly, we note that the establishment of the PCC for International Organized Crime in April 2001 is a step in the right direction and\u2014on the basis of what is known about its role and priorities\u2014appears to address some of the coordination and related issues discussed in this report, such as providing oversight of international crime issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the establishment of the PCC for International Organized Crime and its intended responsibilities and priorities, we recommend that the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs take appropriate action to ensure that this PCC provides sustained and centralized oversight of the extensive and crosscutting federal effort to combat international crime. Consistent with the coordination and related issues we have discussed in this report, we recommend that as the responsibilities of the PCC are defined, they include systematically   updating the existing governmentwide international crime threat assessment to maintain a thorough understanding of credible existing and emerging threats;   updating the International Crime Control Strategy, or developing a successor\u2014to include prioritized goals and implementing objectives\u2014as appropriate to reflect changes in the threat;   designating responsibility for executing the strategy and resolving any jurisdictional issues; identifying and aligning the necessary resources with the strategy\u2019s execution;   developing outcome-oriented performance measures linked to the strategy\u2019s goals and objectives to track and assess progress, identify emerging challenges, and establish overall accountability; and   periodically reporting the strategy\u2019s results to the President and the Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, and the Administrator of USAID.

The comments are reprinted in appendixes VIII through XI and discussed briefly in the next sections. In addition to their comments, NSC, Justice, State, and USAID provided technical comments that are incorporated in this report where appropriate. Treasury did not submit written comments but provided technical comments.", "NSC generally concurred with the thrust of the report\u2019s recommendation, indicating that the coordination of the federal government\u2019s efforts to combat international crime should be improved further; that NSC is the logical choice to provide enhanced coordination and policy direction at the most senior levels of government; and that comprehensive measures should be developed to assess the effectiveness of international crime control programs and form an iterative cycle of regular threat, strategy, and program reviews. NSC also indicated that the PCC for International Organized Crime would consider our recommendation as it reviews the International Crime Control Strategy and works to enhance the government\u2019s approach to fighting international crime. At the same time, NSC expressed concern that the report did not adequately reflect a number of initiatives it led\u2014including the establishment of the Special Coordination Group and the development of the International Crime Control Strategy\u2014that were aimed at a more integrated U.S. government approach to fighting international crime. Furthermore, NSC indicated that the report overstated the Council\u2019s proper role in international crime control efforts. In this regard, NSC said that senior-level interagency coordination by NSC and its formal committee structure is only part of the picture and that the overwhelming majority of coordination at that level\u2014 as well as at the operational level\u2014occurs without any involvement by the Council.", "Regarding NSC\u2019s comment about the report not adequately reflecting the initiatives undertaken to integrate the government\u2019s response to international crime, we believe that the report\u2014in keeping with its intent to provide overview-level information on the subject\u2014adequately identifies and describes, in a framework context, key components of the response. These include PDD-42, the International Crime Control Strategy, the International Crime Threat Assessment, and the now-defunct Special Coordination Group. Regarding NSC\u2019s comment about its role in international crime control efforts, the report recognizes that extensive day-to-day coordination does occur at the operational and executive levels. The report\u2019s discussion of NSC\u2019s role in coordinating efforts to combat international crime centers on the delineation of that role in, among other documents, NSPD-1 and the memorandum establishing the PCC for International Organized Crime. For example, NSPD-1 states that the various PCCs shall be the main day-to-day mechanisms for senior interagency coordination of national security policy issues, of which international crime control is one.", "Justice agreed with the report\u2019s concluding observations regarding, among other things, the executive branch\u2019s need to prioritize its response to the increasing threat from international crime. However, Justice expressed what it characterized as \u201cserious reservations\u201d about the report\u2019s discussion and recommendation concerning interagency coordination of the federal response to international crime. Specifically, Justice believed that the report understated the extent of interagency coordination that has occurred in the past, especially at the lower levels where, according to Justice, law enforcement coordination has often led to successful international criminal investigations and prosecutions. Justice also said that the report's recommendation for high-level coordination overestimated the importance of the Special Coordination Group and its sub-groups. Justice indicated that while high-level interagency coordination may be useful for general policy matters, such coordination is generally not appropriate for particular criminal investigations. Finally, Justice said that the report did not give proper recognition to what it characterized as the Attorney General\u2019s \u201ccentral role\u201d in addressing international crime, especially in determining whether, and under what circumstances, to prosecute international criminal conduct. Consequently, according to Justice, the report\u2019s recommendation appears to be an intrusion into the \u201ctraditional law enforcement responsibilities of the Attorney General.\u201d", "Regarding Justice\u2019s statement that the extent of interagency coordination is understated, the report is not intended to be an exhaustive representation of the federal response to international crime and the coordination of this response. Rather, the report describes the various means through which coordination occurs\u2014especially at the operational level\u2014and presents illustrative examples, provided by a variety of federal law enforcement and other agencies, without reaching any conclusions about the effectiveness of coordination at this level. Regarding Justice\u2019s statement that the importance of the Special Coordination Group and its sub-groups is overestimated, the report discusses the roles and responsibilities of the Group as envisioned by and delineated in PDD-42 and the International Crime Control Strategy. According to these documents\u2014which form the framework of the federal response to international crime\u2014the Group was intended as the high-level mechanism to ensure an integrated and sustained focus on the federal response to international crime. Regarding Justice\u2019s statement that the report does not recognize the Attorney General\u2019s central role in combating international crime and that its recommendation appears to intrude on his law enforcement responsibilities, we offer two points in response. First, the report, reflecting a consensus view, describes Justice\u2019s role in combating international crime as \u201csignificant\u201d and accordingly provides a detailed description of the relevant responsibilities and programs of its various components. Second, building upon a mechanism already put in place by NSC, the recommendation seeks to enhance executive-level coordination and oversight of the large-scale federal effort to combat international crime. The recommendation\u2019s specific components\u2014which focus on strategic-level matters\u2014are not intended to delve into operational-level matters, such as decisions to prosecute specific instances of international criminal conduct.", "State indicated that it agreed with the basic premise and recommendation of the report. It further indicated that centrally led coordination\u2014focusing on general policy rather than particular criminal matters and issues\u2014can be useful in sorting out and better delineating the many overlapping responsibilities of federal law enforcement agencies and avoiding duplications and gaps in anticrime programs that can waste limited resources and reduce program effectiveness. State did note that since some activities discussed in the report, such as nonproliferation and counterterrorism, involve broader political and national security issues that extend beyond international crime, they should remain under the jurisdiction of the appropriate PCC, such as the one for Nonproliferation, Counter-proliferation, and Homeland Defense. In this regard, we acknowledge this distinction and, to the extent that they continue to be considered also as part of the broader context of international crime, defer to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to determine the appropriate PCC jurisdiction for activities such as nonproliferation and counterterrorism.", "USAID submitted a letter with technical clarifications, which we included in the report where appropriate.", "As indicated earlier, the Department of the Treasury had no written comments on a draft of this report.
