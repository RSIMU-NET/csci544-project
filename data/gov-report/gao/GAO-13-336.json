These changes include new logistics  program requirements that VAMCs and veterans integrated service  networks (network) must implement and other efforts aimed at  enhancing VHA\u2019s logistics program. Members of Congress have raised  questions about both the extent to which VAMCs and networks are  complying with these requirements and VHA\u2019s progress in enhancing its  logistics program.

These deficiencies included the following:  Limitations with inventory management systems. A 2011 GAO report and  VHA internal reports from 2008 and 2011 identified that the two inventory  management systems that VHA currently requires VAMCs to use to track  the type and quantity of medical supplies and equipment at their facilities  rely on antiquated technology and therefore have limited functionality.Specifically, the Generic Inventory Package (GIP)\u2014used to track medical  supplies, such as needles and scalpel blades\u2014and the Automated  Engineering Management System/Medical Equipment Reporting System  (AEMS/MERS)\u2014used to track medical equipment, such as  endoscopes\u2014cannot provide VHA or VAMCs with system-wide data on  the types and quantities of medical supplies and equipment in use at  VAMCs. This occurs because each VAMC maintains its own inventory  management systems, and data have not been entered consistently  across VAMCs. Without system-wide information, VHA\u2019s ability to identify  VAMCs\u2019 noncompliance with certain inventory management requirements  is limited, which in turn may pose risks to veterans\u2019 safety and limit VHA\u2019s  cost effectiveness. In addition, because of the antiquated technology on  which GIP and AEMS/MERS are based, these systems can only be  updated to a limited extent, meaning that VHA is largely unable to expand  the capabilities of these systems.", "Gaps in requirements for managing inventories. In 2011, we reported that  VHA\u2019s requirements for managing medical supply and equipment  inventories had gaps concerning the types of medical supplies and  equipment VAMCs must track in their inventories, and that, as a result,  VAMCs did not track all the items being used in their facilities. In that  report, we also found that items clinical department staff had purchased  were sometimes not captured in the medical supply and equipment  inventories. Because VAMCs did not track all the items being used in  their facilities, they had difficulty ensuring that they maintained  appropriate quantities of items to stock, resulting in unavailable or expired  medical supplies. VAMCs with incomplete inventories may also have  been unable to quickly identify and remove medical supplies and  equipment that are the subject of a manufacturer or U.S. Food and Drug  Administration recall or patient safety alert so that they would not be used  when providing care to veterans.", "Lack of standardization of medical supplies and equipment. While VHA  has had efforts in place to standardize medical supplies and equipment, a  2011 VHA internal report found that VHA did not have a systematic  process for identifying the medical supplies and equipment that could be  standardized. In addition, VHA did not have a systematic process to  determine the potential financial and clinical effects of standardizing a  particular item throughout VAMCs, and VHA lacked appropriate  involvement of clinical staff in the standardization process. Clinical staff  must be involved in this process, because\u2014as the users of medical  supplies and equipment\u2014they have a unique understanding of the  features offered by each item. Greater standardization could allow VHA to  better leverage its purchasing power by establishing national contracts  and blanket purchase agreements and to increase veterans\u2019 safety. For  example, if a VAMC standardized certain types of reusable medical  equipment (RME), it could reduce the number of different types of RME  available for use in the facility.different reprocessing methods that VAMC staff would need to be familiar  with in order to clean, disinfect, and sterilize each piece of RME properly,  which might reduce instances of inadequate or improper reprocessing of  these items."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VAMCs and Networks We Visited Have Partially Complied with New VHA Requirements to Address Deficiencies in Its Logistics Program", "paragraphs": ["To address deficiencies in its logistics program, VHA issued new  requirements in 2011 mainly in three areas\u2014management of medical  supplies and equipment in VAMCs\u2019 inventories, the standardization of  these items, and the monitoring of VAMCs\u2019 logistics programs.

Staff at these two facilities cited a lack of staffing  resources in light of the additional responsibilities that logistics  department staff had to take on as the reason for not fully meeting the  VHA requirement. One of these VAMCs only allows staff from two  clinical departments to manage medical supplies and requires these  staff to comply with VHA\u2019s review, approval, and tracking processes.  Since our visit, the other VAMC with partial compliance was able to  secure additional staffing resources and expects to achieve  compliance with this requirement in the near future. The purchase of  medical supplies by clinical department staff may circumvent the  required review, approval, and tracking processes and thereby poses  risks to veterans\u2019 safety and limits the cost-effective use of resources.", "Although all five VAMCs had established a list of medical supplies and  RME approved for use at the facility, these lists were incomplete at  each of the five VAMCs. Specifically, at the five VAMCs, based on  VHA data, between 1 percent and 14 percent of medical supplies and  RME that had been purchased in October 2012 were not captured on  the list, although the percentage of items not captured has decreased  at three of these VAMCs since September 2012. VAMC and  network officials mainly attributed the incomplete lists of approved  medical supplies and RME to two factors. First, a lack of training for  logistics program staff has led to inaccuracies in entering medical  supplies and RME on this list. Second, such items may not be  consistently entered on the list when they are managed by clinical  department staff rather than logistics staff. VAMCs with an incomplete  record of medical supplies and RME in use at the facility may have  difficulty determining whether they possess an item targeted by a  manufacturer or Food and Drug Administration recall, or patient safety  alert. Moreover, VHA\u2019s Procurement and Logistics Office is in the  process of establishing an electronic database that will contain all  medical supplies and RME approved for use across VHA, which will  eventually allow VHA to determine which items each VAMC has  approved for use. Because data are extracted from each VAMC\u2019s  list of approved medical supplies and RME to populate VHA\u2019s  database, each VAMC needs to achieve full compliance with this  requirement in order for the database to be complete.", "Officials from four of the five VAMCs said that they had not entered all  stock surgical and dental instruments into GIP because they lack the  staffing resources necessary to do this. A VAMC official said given the  high volume of existing surgical and dental instruments that have not  been entered into GIP at each VAMC, this requirement would likely  take months to complete. VAMC officials stated that in light of limited  resources available to comply with this requirement, they would  benefit from guidance from VHA such as how to prioritize the entry of  instruments into GIP. At the one VAMC that reported achieving full  compliance with this requirement, an official told us that the process of  entering these instruments into GIP was cumbersome and resource- intensive and that achieving compliance required extensive  collaboration between logistics staff and sterile processing staff within  the VAMC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "One VAMC We Visited and Two Networks Have Fully Complied with VHA\u2019s Standardization Requirements", "paragraphs": ["One VAMC we visited and two networks fully complied with VHA\u2019s new  standardization requirements, and the remaining four VAMCs and three  networks have partially complied.

An official at this VAMC stated that the  committee had only been meeting sporadically because clinical staff\u2014 who are required to be represented on the committee\u2014were not  available to attend the meetings. In addition, at another VAMC, the  committee was not established until recently\u20149 months after the  deadline for establishing it. However, prior to the establishment of the  clinical product review committee, some of its required functions, such  as the review and approval of items that had not previously been  purchased, were being performed by another VAMC committee.  Regular clinical product review committee meetings, which include  appropriate representation of clinical and nonclinical staff, are key to  ensuring that new medical supplies and RME are reviewed and  approved prior to their use and to identify opportunities for  standardization.", "Three of the five VAMCs lacked a documented process for reviewing  emergency purchases. Specifically, at one VAMC, emergency  purchases were made without any approval, while at the other two  VAMCs, the process for reviewing and approving these purchases  was not documented; however, officials told us that an informal review  is conducted. Without a documented process for review and approval  of emergency purchases, the VAMCs may purchase these items  without evaluating their cost effectiveness or likely effect on veterans\u2019  care.", "Three VAMCs did not perform all of the required standardization  activities. Specifically, one VAMC did not identify opportunities for  standardization within its clinical product review committee. Officials at  this VAMC told us that this was because the committee had not been  meeting regularly because of a lack of clinical department staff  availability. Identifying opportunities for standardization is an important  first step to standardizing medical supplies and RME, which may  ultimately result in cost savings and greater continuity of care.  Furthermore, officials at this VAMC and two others did not have  measures in place to fully ensure compliance with national contracts  and blanket purchase agreements for medical supplies and RME.  Officials at one of these VAMCs were only assessing compliance with  newly issued national contracts and blanket purchasing agreements.  Officials at the other two VAMCs used an electronic tool\u2014made  available by VHA\u2014to ascertain whether items they were purchasing  were available at lower prices through a national contract or blanket  purchasing agreement. However, VHA officials told us that this tool  was insufficient to assess compliance because it does not provide  enough information to determine whether VAMCs are purchasing all  of the standardized medical supplies and RME available on these  contracts and blanket purchasing agreements. At the two VAMCs  that were in full compliance with this requirement, the corresponding  networks had developed a spreadsheet that enabled the VAMCs to  assess whether they were purchasing standardized items on national  contracts and blanket purchasing agreements by manually reviewing  their purchase histories. Both of these networks required the VAMCs  to assess their compliance with a certain number of national contracts  and blanket purchasing agreements each month and report their  findings to the network. Assessing compliance with national contracts  and blanket purchasing agreements is important because VAMCs that  are not in compliance may not be taking advantage of cost-effective  options for purchasing medical supplies and RME that have been  standardized.", "Extent of network compliance. Two of the five networks we visited fully  complied with all of VHA\u2019s new standardization requirements, and the  remaining three only partially complied.

Officials at two networks told us that clinical staff serve on this  committee as a collateral duty and often lack the time to participate in  committee meetings. Similarly, officials at another network told us that  VAMC logistics staff were not always available to participate in  committee meetings in light of additional responsibilities they had to  take on. Regular network commodity standardization committee  meetings, which include appropriate representation of clinical and  nonclinical staff, are key to identifying and pursuing opportunities for  standardization.", "One of the five networks did not review the activities of the VAMC  clinical product review committee. Network officials told us that they  were not receiving committee minutes from the VAMCs but that they  would begin requesting these minutes in the future, which would allow  the network to review the committees\u2019 activities. Review of the  VAMCs\u2019 clinical product review committees\u2019 activities is important to  ensure that the committees are functioning effectively and to help  identify standardization opportunities, which can lead to financial  savings. Officials at one of the two networks that was partially  complying with this requirement told us that instead of reviewing the  activities of the VAMCs\u2019 clinical product review committee, network  officials extract data on the VAMCs\u2019 purchases to identify items that  are frequently used or costly\u2014in an effort to standardize them across  the network. Officials at the other network that was partially complying  told us that they review the activities of the VAMCs\u2019 clinical product  review committee only once annually, as part of a network external  review of VAMCs\u2019 logistics programs. Because these networks did not  regularly review the activities of the VAMC committees, they may not  have been aware of new supply and RME purchases the VAMCs are  considering. If other VAMCs within the networks are considering  similar purchases, the networks may be able to consolidate these  purchases across multiple VAMCs and thereby achieve financial  savings.", "At one network, the commodity standardization committee had not  performed any standardization activities because clinical staff from the  VAMCs within the network were not available to attend the committee  meetings and identify medical supplies and RME for standardization.  At another network that achieved partial compliance, the commodity  standardization committee and its subcommittees had not met  regularly because VAMC logistics staff were not available to attend  committee meetings. Instead, network officials performed some  standardization activities outside of the committee. At another  network, the committee had just begun the process of reviewing  VAMCs\u2019 purchase histories to identify opportunities for standardization  but had not developed specific plans to standardize medical supplies  or RME because of a lack of clinical staff involvement. In contrast, the  two networks that fully complied with this requirement were able to  identify items for standardization, facilitate the standardization  process, and implement the standardized items at the VAMCs within  the network.

For example, SOARD  currently does not have the capability to interface with VHA\u2019s financial  management system. If this capability is not established, VAMC staff  would have to manually enter information on medical supply and  equipment purchases in two separate systems, which would increase  their workload. SOARD project team officials told us that they are  working on solving this interoperability issue but have not estimated a  time frame for doing so.", "Furthermore, SOARD project team officials told us that the Web- based product on which SOARD relies was designed to be used for  equipment management and that\u2014to their knowledge\u2014only a small  number of health care entities use this product to manage medical  supply inventories. SOARD project team officials told us that they are  working with officials at several entities that use the product for this  purpose in order to develop this capability for VHA; however, they  have no timeline for when they expect to achieve this capability.", "SOARD project team officials told us that\u2014over the course of the pilot\u2014 officials are monitoring the development and implementation of SOARD,  including whether each phase of the pilot remains on-time and within its  budget, and making changes to the system based on feedback that they  receive from users at the pilot sites and other stakeholders. However, we  found that they had not yet developed formal criteria that rely on data  collected from the pilot sites for measuring the overall performance of the  pilot, including whether anticipated benefits are being achieved.  According to GAO internal control standards, performance measures  need to be established and monitored, so that analyses can be made and  appropriate actions can be taken. Measuring performance would allow  VHA to track the progress it is making towards achieving its anticipated  benefits from SOARD implementation and would give officials crucial  information on which to base their decisions regarding the necessary  modifications and successful implementation of SOARD. Furthermore,  VHA\u2019s implementation plan for SOARD is ambitious\u2014with nationwide  implementation of SOARD\u2019s equipment management capabilities  expected by September 2015\u2014which may not allow adequate time to  address the uncertainties associated with the program, evaluate the  performance of the pilot, and address identified concerns.

However, VHA\u2019s nationwide RTLS contract was  subjected to a bid protest in 2012, which was upheld and resulted in VHA  having to reopen the acquisition. In January 2013, VHA selected a new  RTLS contractor which, according to RTLS program officials, will allow for  the implementation of RTLS VHA-wide to begin in March 2013\u20146 months  later than anticipated.

In addition, 6 months prior to RTLS implementation, each  network will dedicate one staff member to RTLS implementation activities.  However, like SOARD, there are uncertainties with respect to  interoperability issues and resources that may prevent RTLS from being  fully implemented by the end of fiscal year 2014:  System interoperability issues. Once it is operational, RTLS is meant to  interface with VHA\u2019s current GIP and AEMS/MERS systems as well as  with SOARD.

According to RTLS program officials,  once RTLS is implemented at the 44 VAMCs that already have a system  for instrument tracking, 14 VAMCs will have to replace these systems  because they are not compatible with the instrument tracking capability  provided by RTLS. In fiscal year 2012, after RTLS program officials  discovered that 24 additional VAMCs were planning to purchase their  own instrument tracking systems, these officials placed a moratorium on  VAMCs acquiring their own instrument tracking systems in order to  prevent this incompatibility issue from arising at additional VAMCs.", "Resources needed for implementation. Currently, not all VAMCs have  wireless capabilities\u2014which are necessary before RTLS can be  implemented\u2014and at some facilities that have these capabilities, the  wireless signals do not cover the entire facility. RTLS program officials  told us that some VAMCs are difficult to equip with wireless capabilities  because of the age or configuration of the buildings, or both, and that this,  among other issues, has resulted in the installation of wireless capabilities  taking longer than initially anticipated. Furthermore, funding has not  been identified for the installation of wireless capabilities at the VAMCs in  several networks; however, RTLS program officials told us that they are  working with VA\u2019s Office of Information Technology to secure funding for  this purpose. RTLS program officials plan to implement RTLS first at  VAMCs that have full wireless capabilities, but nationwide RTLS  deployment hinges on wireless capabilities being in place at each VAMC.", "Furthermore, as with SOARD preparation activities for updating existing  inventory management systems, data in AEMS/MERS must be updated  in preparation for RTLS implementation, so that the data used to populate  RTLS is accurate. According to RTLS program officials, these activities  are resource intensive and have resulted in some VAMCs requesting that  RTLS be installed at their facilities during the later stages of RTLS  implementation.
