This report examines (1) how federal and private exposure to losses has changed since GAO's 2007 report on the subject, and what is known about how climate change may affect insured and uninsured losses; (2) how public insurers are preparing for climate change, and any challenges they face; and (3) how private insurers are preparing for climate change and any challenges they face. GAO reviewed 20 studies, examined federal and private sector data on exposure to losses from 2000 to 2013, reviewed agency documents, and interviewed agency officials and a nonprobability sample of eight insurers and reinsurers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO's 2007 report on flood and crop insurance, exposure growth in hazard-prone areas has increased losses, and climate change and related increases in extreme weather events may further increase such losses in coming decades. Scientific and industry studies GAO reviewed generally found that increasing growth and property values in hazard-prone areas have increased losses to date and that climate change may compound this effect. From 2007 through 2013, data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Risk Management Agency (RMA) show that exposure to potential losses for insured property grew from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion (8 percent). According to industry data, private sector exposure to such loss grew from $60.7 trillion to $66.5 trillion (10 percent) from 2007 through 2012. Federal exposure to uninsured loss also increased by 46 percent over this period, based on a 2013 analysis by the Congressional Research Service. According to the studies GAO reviewed, climate change may substantially increase losses by 2040 and increase losses from about 50 to 100 percent by 2100.", "FEMA and RMA have taken some steps to better understand and prepare for climate change's potential effects under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the federal crop insurance program by, for example, commissioning climate change studies. However, both agencies face challenges that may limit their ability to minimize long-term federal exposure to climate change. For example, because of the short-term nature of insurance (i.e., contracts typically estimate and communicate risk of property losses for the 1-year term of a policy), FEMA and RMA face a challenge in encouraging policyholders to reduce their long-term exposure to climate change risks. Specifically, flood insurance policyholders who build to NFIP standards\u2014which are based on current flood risk and not on long-term risks\u2014may unintentionally increase their vulnerability to climate change as sea-level rises. Also, while federal law prohibits crop insurance from covering losses due to a farmers' failure to follow good farming practices, such as various irrigation methods, some of these practices maintain short-term production but may inadvertently increase the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change through increased erosion and inefficient water use. A recent executive order directed federal agencies to reform policies that may, perhaps unintentionally, increase the vulnerability of economic sectors or communities to climate change. Without encouraging NFIP and crop insurance policyholders to adopt building and agricultural practices that reduce long-term risk, FEMA and RMA may send policyholders signals that unintentionally encourage their vulnerability to climate change, counter to the direction of the executive order, which could exacerbate federal exposure to losses.", "Many private insurers and reinsurers have taken steps since 2007 to better understand and prepare for climate change effects and related challenges, including participating in industry climate change surveys, and issuing reports that identify and assess climate change risks and trends in weather-related losses. According to industry officials, they can manage their exposure to climate change and related challenges through risk-based premiums, reinsurance, and other practices, although estimating weather-related risks still includes elements of uncertainty."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FEMA and RMA take additional steps to encourage flood and crop insurance policyholders to adopt building and agricultural practices that reduce long-term risk and federal exposure to losses.

While the magnitude and extent of  future climate change effects are uncertain, climate change presents a  significant financial risk to the federal government in many areas. As a  result of these risks and the nation\u2019s fiscal condition, in February 2013,  we added Limiting the Federal Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better  Managing Climate Change Risks to our list of areas at high risk to fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or most in need of transformation.", "The uncertain and potentially large losses associated with weather- related events are among the biggest risks that property insurers face.  The property and casualty segment of insurance, which spans both the  public and private sectors, bears a large portion of the financial impact of  weather-related losses. In the public sector, federal insurance programs  include the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security, which makes flood insurance available  to residential property owners and businesses, and the federal crop  insurance program, administered by the Risk Management Agency  (RMA) within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which protects  farmers against financial losses caused by drought, floods, and other  natural disasters, among other things. In addition, the federal government  provides disaster assistance through FEMA and other federal agencies.  In certain states, insurance pools are administered by governmental  entities or entities established pursuant to state law that provide coverage  for losses caused by weather-related events. In the private sector,  primary insurers provide insurance to individuals and businesses directly,  and reinsurers provide insurance to primary insurers.", "As of June 2014, FEMA\u2019s debt to the U.S. Treasury from flood insurance  payments totaled about $24 billion\u2014primarily to pay claims associated  with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012\u2014and FEMA  had not repaid any principal on its loan since 2010. NFIP has been on our  High-Risk List since March 2006 because of concerns about its long-term  financial solvency and related operational issues. While FEMA is  implementing some changes to NFIP in response to recently enacted  legislation, it is unclear to what extent these changes will improve the  program\u2019s financial condition. Additionally, in our 2013 High-Risk Update,  we concluded that FEMA obligated over $80 billion in federal assistance  for disasters declared during fiscal years 2004 through 2011. As of June  2014, FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund had spent $3.8 billion for fiscal year  2014, with an unspent balance of over $11.3 billion. We have previously  found that the federal government does not fully budget for these costs\u2014 in part because supplemental appropriations are largely used to fund  them\u2014obscuring the full cost of disaster relief commitments.", "Further, as we reported in 2014, the federal government\u2019s crop insurance  costs have increased in recent years, with appropriations more than  doubling from $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $7.6 billion in fiscal year  2012 as program expansion and rising crop prices have led to increasing  subsidy values and higher claims payments. In 2007, we found that  climate change could increase federal insurers\u2019 financial risk and  recommended that the Secretaries of Agriculture and Homeland Security  analyze the potential long-term fiscal implications of climate change for  crop insurance and flood insurance, respectively, and report their findings  to Congress. USDA and DHS agreed with these recommendations and  in response issued reports containing such analyses.", "You asked us to review the implications of climate change on public flood  and crop insurance and private sector insurance. This report examines  (1) how federal and private exposure to losses has changed since our  2007 report on flood and crop insurance and how climate change may  affect insured and uninsured losses; (2) how public insurers are preparing  for climate change and associated challenges, if any; and (3) how  selected private insurers and reinsurers are preparing for climate change  and associated challenges, if any.", "To determine how exposure to losses has changed since our 2007 report  on flood and crop insurance and how climate change may affect insured  and uninsured losses, we reviewed scientific studies and other available  literature on climate change and analyzed federal and private sector  exposure data from 2007 through 2013. To understand longer-term  trends in exposure, we also analyzed federal exposure data from 2000.  We assessed the reliability of the exposure data and reviewed the  methodological soundness of each study and determined that the data  and studies were sufficiently reliable for describing trends in exposure  and the potential effect of climate change on insured and uninsured  losses. To determine how public insurers are preparing for climate  change, we reviewed FEMA and RMA documents and interviewed  agency officials and a nonprobability sample of three state insurers that  were identified by an industry forecaster as most at-risk of natural  disasters, whether the state had an insurance pool administered by a  governmental entity or entity established pursuant to state law, and  whether the state had experienced an extreme weather event in the past  decade. Further, to determine how private insurers and reinsurers are  preparing for climate change, we reviewed over 20 industry reports and  other information from industry representatives we interviewed. We  interviewed a nonprobability sample of eight insurers and reinsurers,  representing over 25 percent of the U.S. property and casualty insurance  market, 15 percent of the private crop insurance market, and over 30  percent of the U.S. reinsurance market. We selected both large and small  insurers with relevant experience in flood or crop insurance, to collect a  variety of perspectives. We also interviewed two catastrophe modeling  firms, two reinsurance brokerage firms, and eight industry groups  representing more than 1,000 large and small property and casualty  insurers. Because we used a nonprobability sample to select  interviewees, our results are not generalizable to the industry as a whole  but provide illustrative examples. Appendix I presents a more detailed  description of our objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2013 to October  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Insurance can spread risk over time, across geographical areas, and  among industries and individuals. While private insurers assume some  financial risk when they write policies, they employ various strategies to  manage risk so that they limit potential financial exposures, earn profits,  and build capital needed to pay claims. For example, insurers charge  premiums for coverage and establish underwriting standards, such as  refusing to insure customers who pose unacceptable levels of risk, or  limiting coverage in particular geographic areas. Insurance companies  may also purchase insurance from reinsurers to cover specific portions of  their financial risk. Reinsurers use similar strategies to limit their risks,  including charging premiums and establishing underwriting standards.  States regulate private insurance and may impose various restrictions on  insurers\u2019 risk management practices, such as premium rate increases and  coverage limitations, to protect consumers and to ensure insurer  solvency. However, many of these risk management strategies are not  available to NFIP, which is required to assume and retain all of the risk  and to generally accept all insurance applicants, including those with  potentially high-risk properties.", "The uncertain and potentially large losses associated with weather- related events are among the biggest risks that property insurers face.  Virtually anything that is insured\u2014property, crops and livestock, business  operations, or human life and health\u2014is vulnerable to weather-related  events. For insurers, remaining financially solvent generally involves  estimating and setting rates that reflect insured risks; any unanticipated  changes in the frequency or severity of weather-related events can have  financial consequences for them. Recent scientific assessments have  found that climate change has or will alter the frequency and/or severity of  damaging weather-related events\u2014such as droughts and floods, alter  crop productivity, and threaten coastal communities as sea-level rises.", "Under certain circumstances, the private sector may consider some risks  uninsurable. In other instances, the private sector may offer to insure a  risk, but at rates that many property owners cannot afford. Without  insurance, affected property owners must rely on their own resources or  seek disaster assistance from local, state, and federal sources in the  event of a loss. In situations where the private sector will not insure a  particular type of risk, the public sector may create markets to ensure the  availability of insurance. For example, several states have established  Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) and windstorm plans, that  pool resources from insurers doing business in the state to make  insurance available to property owners who either cannot obtain coverage  in the private insurance market or cannot do so at an affordable rate.", "Similarly, at the federal level, the NFIP and the federal crop insurance  program were established to provide coverage where private markets did  not exist, and partly to provide an alternative to disaster assistance. NFIP  has three components: (1) the provision of flood insurance; (2) the  requirement that participating communities adopt and enforce floodplain  management regulations that are at least as stringent as FEMA\u2019s national  minimum standards; and (3) the identification and mapping of floodplains,  which helps to determine which insurance premiums and regulations  apply to a particular property. Community participation in NFIP is  voluntary. However, communities must join NFIP and adopt FEMA- approved building standards and floodplain management strategies in  order for their residents to purchase flood insurance through the  program. In addition to meeting these federal standards, the regulations  that each community enacts and implements must meet the minimum  state requirements, which are established consistent with NFIP  standards. For example, communities must adopt at least the minimum  standards for floodplain management regulations, including building  requirements to reduce future flood damage, such as requiring new and  substantially improved or substantially damaged structures in special  flood hazard areas to be elevated to or above base flood elevation levels.  Additionally, FEMA provides premium reduction incentives for  policyholders within communities that take measures to mitigate flood risk  beyond NFIP minimum requirements through the agency\u2019s program, the  Community Rating System. Under NFIP, the federal government  assumes the liability for covered losses and sets rates and coverage  limitations. While NFIP does not subsidize most policies, policyholders  with certain types of insured properties pay subsidized premiums.", "For crop insurance, farmers participate voluntarily, but the federal  government encourages participation by subsidizing their insurance  premiums. USDA\u2019s RMA administers the federal crop insurance program,  including issuing new insurance products and expanding existing  products to new geographic regions. RMA administers the program in  partnership with private insurance companies that share a percentage of  the risk of loss or the opportunity for gain associated with each policy.  Federal law prohibits crop insurance from covering losses due to a  farmer\u2019s failure to follow good farming practices. Good farming practices  are identified by agricultural experts in a given area and provide  acceptable farming methods for crop insurance policyholders to use in  producing yields consistent with historical production. Agricultural experts  are individuals employed by USDA\u2019s Cooperative Extension System or  the agricultural departments of universities, or other approved persons,  whose research or occupation is related to the specific crop or practice for  which expertise is sought.", "The federal government\u2019s disaster relief and flood and crop insurance  programs create fiscal exposure to weather-related events and climate  change. For the purposes of this report, fiscal exposures are  responsibilities, programs, and activities that may either obligate the  federal government to future spending or create the expectation for future  spending. For example, the government\u2019s response to a weather-related  event or series of events can strengthen expectations that the  government will respond in the same way to similar events in the future.", "Differences exist in the types of property that public insurers insure, as  well as their time horizons. For example, federal flood and crop insurance  programs insure different types of property, with different time horizons.  While state insurers and NFIP insure permanent structures that are  designed to last years or decades, federal crop insurance primarily covers  agricultural commodities that farmers plant and harvest each year. This  annual cycle can allow farmers to adapt their insured property to changes  in weather-related risk more easily than state or NFIP policyholders can  adapt their permanent structures to changing wind or flood risks.", "Uncertainty about the magnitude, timing, and extent of the effects of  climate change in the future presents challenges to both public and  private insurers. For example, NFIP will likely be affected by future sea- level rise. According to the May 2014 National Climate Assessment,  although global mean sea level may increase anywhere from 8 inches to  7 feet in this century, the magnitude of the projected future sea-level rise  varies considerably along the U.S. coastline due to a variety of factors,  such as land subsidence and uplift. Officials from public insurers and  some representatives from private industry stated that uncertainty  regarding climate projections presents challenges to these insurers\u2019 ability  to plan for the future. However, as stated in a 2010 National Research  Council (NRC) report, even though uncertainties exist regarding the exact  nature and magnitude of impacts, mobilizing now to increase the nation\u2019s  resilience can be an insurance policy against future climate change  risks.", "We define resilience as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb,  recover from, and more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse  events. Hazard mitigation\u2014actions that reduce the long-term risks of life  and property by lessening the impact of disasters\u2014and climate change  adaptation\u2014the adjustments to natural or human systems in response to  actual or expected climate change\u2014promote resilience to extreme  weather events, among other things.", "Recent executive orders have addressed the topics of vulnerabilities to  extreme weather events and climate change-related risks.

For example,  farmers\u2019 annual production history determines their coverage and, if  yields decrease under climate change, the program\u2019s exposure adjusts  downward as well. RMA may also adjust the availability of coverage for  crops to respond to geographic shifts in production as conditions become  more or less favorable for certain crops. According to RMA officials,  farmers\u2019 desire to maximize their profits and maintain their businesses will  motivate them to alter their production practices as climate change effects  occur. However, the agency\u2019s 2009 study also recommended that RMA  should better monitor weather and climate to understand potential rapid  changes in future conditions and how to adapt agricultural and risk  management practices to address climate change. RMA entered into a  cooperative agreement with Oregon State University\u2019s Parameter- elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), Climate  and Weather Group that will enhance RMA\u2019s monitoring of weather and  climate.

RMA officials  told us that they also recently worked with USDA\u2019s Natural Resources  Conservation Service to ensure consistency between crop insurance and  conservation programs that protect soil and water resources.", "RMA also participates in the broader USDA climate change effort, such  as USDA\u2019s Global Change Task Force, according to RMA and USDA  officials. This task force coordinates USDA activities related to climate  change and provides a venue for sharing information within the agency,  according to an agency document. In addition, USDA\u2019s Agricultural  Research Service (ARS), has identified several climate change  adaptation strategies to promote long-term resilience to climate change  effects such as increased soil erosion and water scarcity. Specifically, a  2013 ARS report found that resilient agricultural practices such as  conservation tillage\u2014where farmers leave some crop residue on fields\u2014 and water conservation will help minimize climate change costs and  sustain agricultural production in a changing climate. According to USDA  officials, the agency also plans to develop region-specific adaptation  strategies through its newly established Regional Climate Hubs, which  are to deliver science-based, practical information to farmers and to  support decision making related to mitigation of, and adaptation to,  climate change.", "Additionally, for a variety of reasons, federal insurers have adjusted their  rate-setting calculations in ways that may better position them to respond  to climate change. Although not specific to climate change, the Biggert- Waters Act requires NFIP to establish a reserve to help meet expected  future obligations and to establish standards that ensure that its flood  maps\u2019 flood risk determinations are adequate, both of which should help  the agency collect funds that more closely match the risks it incurs or that  are more likely to be sufficient to cover losses. FEMA officials said the  agency has also increased the reserve amount in premiums to cover  flood risk uncertainty, to better reflect the current flood risk associated  with properties below base flood elevation. Recently enacted legislation  required FEMA to phase out subsidies for some properties such as  nonprimary residences and business structures through 25 percent  annual premium increases until the full-risk rate is reached.", "In response to a 2011 rate study, RMA changed its rate calculations to  more heavily weigh recent weather data, which RMA documents suggest  could enable premiums to more quickly and fully reflect changes in the  climate. By law, RMA must set crop insurance premiums at rates  sufficient to cover projected claims. Due in part to weather variability, in  some years, RMA will likely collect more premiums than it pays in claims,  and vice versa. RMA currently uses an average of the previous 20 years  of yields to calculate its rates, rather than the previous method of  assigning equal weight to all years back to the fixed base year of 1975\u2014 which was in place prior to 2012.", "Moreover, FEMA, in conjunction with other federal agencies, has taken  some recent steps to manage future risks related to climate change for  disaster relief. For example, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force  implemented a minimum flood risk reduction standard for Sandy-related  disaster funding to account for future sea-level rise in response to  Executive Order 13632. Under this standard, structures repaired or  rebuilt must meet forward-looking standards, such as elevating the  ground floor of a building 1 foot higher than existing FEMA standards. In  addition, according to FEMA officials, a current interagency effort seeks to  develop a Federal Flood Risk Reduction Standard that would apply to  future disaster relief appropriations\u2014although it is too early to know  whether such a standard will incorporate future risk. Furthermore,  according to a July 2014 White House statement, FEMA will issue new  guidance that requires states to incorporate climate change into their  hazard mitigation plans as a condition for receiving disaster relief.  FEMA\u2019s Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs and post-disaster grants  currently do not require grantees to incorporate sea-level rise into their  cost-benefit calculations for proposed projects, although they do allow it.", "Regarding other public insurance programs, at the state level, some state  insurers in hazard-prone areas have transferred risk to the private sector  to reduce their exposure to claims. Specifically, officials at two of the state  insurers we interviewed told us they have sold policies (\u201cdepopulation\u201d),  bought reinsurance to transfer a portion of the risk in their portfolio to  another insurer, and sold bonds that provide funding to the insurer should  a catastrophic weather event occur (\u201ccatastrophe bonds\u201d). These risk  transfer methods reduce exposure to losses from extreme weather.  Reinsurance and catastrophe bonds are short-term, market-based risk  transfer methods, typically of 1 to 3 years in duration. We previously  concluded that there are several strategies\u2014many which would require  statutory authority to implement but a few that FEMA currently has  authority to implement\u2014to be considered at the federal level to allow the  transfer of risk to the private sector. The Biggert-Waters Act also  required FEMA to issue a report in 2013 that assessed the capacity of the  private reinsurance, capital, and financial markets to assume a portion of  the insurance risk of NFIP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Insurers Face Challenges Managing Future Exposure to Climate Change", "paragraphs": ["Federal insurers face two main program challenges that may constrain  their ability to manage their fiscal exposure and address future climate  change risk. First, federal law encourages federal insurers, such as  FEMA and RMA, to provide affordable insurance to policyholders through  subsidized rates, which lessens the agencies\u2019 ability to collect sufficient  premiums from policyholders to pay claims, increases the federal  government\u2019s fiscal exposure, and may reduce policyholders\u2019 incentives  to manage risk by giving them inaccurate signals about the level of risk.  Specifically, federal insurers face a challenge between providing  affordable premiums through subsidies and managing financially self- sufficient programs by charging policyholders full-risk premiums.  Additionally, while insurers, in general, communicate the risk of incurring  losses to policyholders through their premium rates, by subsidizing some  policies, federal insurers have not provided all policyholders with accurate  price signals about their risk of incurring losses. As a result, some NFIP  and federal crop insurance policyholders may perceive their risk of loss to  be lower than it really is and may have less financial incentive to reduce  this risk.", "For example, FEMA offers subsidized premium rates for policies covering  certain structures, some of which are in high-risk areas. As a result of  NFIP\u2019s historical rate structure, the program has generated sufficient  premiums to cover claims in years with average losses but has not had  sufficient funds to cover claims in catastrophic loss years, and FEMA has  an outstanding balance with the U.S. Treasury of $24 billion to pay for  claims in these years. Although FEMA is phasing out most subsidies, they  may remain in place for many years, and while they are in place, newly  purchased residential properties may qualify for subsidized NFIP rates.  As long as some NFIP policyholders only pay for a portion of their risk of  losses due to subsidized premiums, they receive inaccurate price signals  about their property\u2019s full flood risk\u2014regardless of what other information  FEMA may provide. Consequently, policyholders who receive subsidized  rates may have limited financial incentive to take steps, such as  floodproofing their homes above base flood elevation, to reduce their  risk.", "For federal crop insurance, although RMA is required to collect sufficient  premiums to cover projected claims, the premiums are subsidized by the  federal government. For example, we previously found that the  government paid about 62 percent of premium costs for the program in  2011. The government continued to pay 62 percent of premium costs in  2013, which totaled about $7.3 billion. Also, in August 2014, we found  that the costs of federal crop insurance have grown, primarily due to an  increase in the value of premium subsidies. According to an April 2014  Congressional Budget Office report, crop insurance program costs are  expected to average $8.9 billion annually, for fiscal years 2014 through  2023. Similar to flood insurance, federal crop insurance policyholders  receive inaccurate price signals about their potential risk of loss when  they receive such premium subsidies. Although farmers are informed of  the subsidy amount and have an incentive to maximize their annual  yields, they do not bear the true cost of their risk of loss due to weather- related events, such as drought\u2014which could affect their farming  decisions.", "In prior work, we concluded that reducing subsidies and charging full-risk  premiums to individual policyholders would decrease the federal  government\u2019s fiscal exposure under the flood and crop insurance  programs. Reducing the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure to losses  under federal insurance programs and sending more accurate signals to  policyholders about their risk, become even more important as the risks  from climate change and related extreme weather events increase.", "Second, given the short-term nature of insurance, public insurers face a  challenge in encouraging their policyholders to reduce their long-term  exposure to climate change risks. Property insurance contracts typically  estimate and communicate risk of property losses for the 1-year term of a  policy. However, climate change effects on insured property, such as  buildings or fields in production, may span decades. Because FEMA and  RMA only provide policyholders with price signals for expected losses in  the upcoming year, these policyholders may not be encouraged to reduce  long-term risks for their property. Similarly, in agriculture, the tension  between the short- and long-term extends beyond insurance into farming  operations. According to RMA officials, farmers make annual decisions on  the starting times and types of crops they plant and buy seed for the  following year. They focus more heavily on this short-term time horizon, in  part because seed and farming technology constantly change.", "Furthermore, building to community standards that are identical to  existing NFIP standards\u2014which are based on near-term flood risk\u2014may  unintentionally increase policyholders\u2019 long-term vulnerability to climate  change as sea-level rises or erosion increases properties\u2019 flood risk\u2014 which does not reflect the direction contained in Executive Order 13653.", "This is because, in the short-term, policyholders may be less likely to  consider taking actions to protect their homes or localities against future  risk and may continue to build in high-risk areas. According to FEMA  guidance, the NFIP standards are periodically revised to incorporate new  regulations or clarify old ones. Communities in turn must then update their  own regulations to maintain consistency with the NFIP standards. Without  incorporating forward-looking minimum standards into NFIP\u2019s  requirements, similar to the minimum standard applied by the Hurricane  Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, NFIP policyholders and localities may  continue to build and rebuild structures to current community standards  that may not reflect the changing weather-related risks faced over  structures\u2019 designed life spans\u2014thereby exacerbating the federal  financial risk to climate change.", "Regarding the federal crop insurance program, federal law prohibits crop  insurance from covering losses due to farmers\u2019 failure to follow good  farming practices. RMA\u2019s good farming practices provide acceptable  farming methods for crop insurance policyholders to use in producing  yields consistent with historical production. However, these practices are  focused on maintaining historic crop yields over the term of the annual  insurance contract, and some of these practices may unintentionally  increase the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, contrary to  Executive Order 13653\u2019s directive for agencies to manage vulnerabilities  to climate change. For example, certain practices, such as conventional  tillage and traditional irrigation methods, may maintain historic crop yields  in the short-term, but they may inadvertently reduce agriculture\u2019s long- term resilience through increased erosion, depleted soil quality, and  inefficient water use. RMA officials said that crop insurance adjusts to  farmers\u2019 best management practices and should follow their adjustments  rather than dictate their behavior. However, a variety of factors influence  farmers\u2019 production practices and, in some cases, farmers may not adopt  resilient practices unless these practices also maximize farmers\u2019 short- term net benefits, consistent with crop insurance\u2019s focus on maintaining  historic production. By not encouraging agricultural experts to  recommend or incorporate resilient agricultural practices into their expert  guidance for growers\u2019 good farming practices, RMA is likely missing an  opportunity to decrease existing and future fiscal exposures to climate  change. Consequently, crop insurance may continue to cover losses  resulting from practices that increase vulnerability to climate change."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many Private Insurers and Reinsurers Have Identified and Assessed Climate Change Risks, but Preparing for Long- Term Effects Is Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Many private property and casualty insurers and reinsurers have taken  some steps since our 2007 report on flood and crop insurance to  understand and report on their risks associated with climate change,  including participating in industry climate change surveys, and issuing  reports that identify and assess climate change risks and trends in  weather-related losses.

For example, many insurers  have reported on how they incorporate climate change into their risk  management practices through an annual industry survey adopted by the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in 2010.  According to an analysis by the California Department of Insurance,  which administers the survey, 1,067 insurers participated in the climate  risk disclosure survey in 2013, for reporting year 2012. The California  Department of Insurance found that 74 percent of insurers that  participated in the 2012 survey indicated that they have a process for  identifying and assessing climate change-related risks, and 65 percent of  insurers indicated that they have encouraged policyholders to reduce the  losses caused by climate change-influenced events. According to several  insurers and industry representatives we interviewed, insurers generally  manage their exposure to weather-related losses associated with climate  change through their underwriting practices, which include charging risk- based premiums, managing coverage options, and sharing exposure to  losses by purchasing reinsurance.", "In addition to insurers\u2019 participation in the climate risk disclosure survey,  other insurance industry representatives have identified and assessed  risks associated with climate change. For example, representatives from  three of four reinsurers we interviewed said that they have issued reports  on climate change risks or weather-related losses. In addition, one of two  reinsurance brokers we interviewed has reported on climate change risks  and scientific assessments.

One key challenge is similar to that identified  by public insurers: the short-term nature of insurance contracts. Insurers  generally write property coverage for 1-year terms. While short-term  contracts allow insurers flexibility to manage their exposure to losses  through (1) changes in coverage or pricing or (2) not renewing a particular  policy, the annual period of each contract makes it challenging for  insurers to incorporate long-term climate change projections into their risk  management practices.", "According to several industry representatives we interviewed, insurers  and reinsurers use advanced computer modeling, known as catastrophe  models, to help estimate risks and price insurance policies. While  catastrophe modeling helps insurers and reinsurers estimate potential  short-term weather-related losses, they said that incorporating the effects  of climate change into catastrophe models remains a challenge.  According to a representative of a catastrophe modeling firm we  interviewed, catastrophe models that insurers use to price policies  generally estimate short-term risks based on historical weather data and  past losses and not on long-term climate change projections. Many  industry representatives said that advances in catastrophe modeling have  improved risk measurement over time. However, estimating weather- related risks still includes elements of uncertainty, and catastrophe  modeling information is limited for some weather-related risks. We  interviewed representatives from two catastrophe modeling firms and a  reinsurance broker that have developed models to estimate risks  associated with hurricanes, including wind and storm surge impacts, as  well as a model for estimating the effects of weather on crops. Several  firms are developing catastrophe models for inland flood risk, which will  help estimate potential flood risks, although FEMA officials and several  industry representatives said these models are not yet advanced enough  to allow insurers to estimate or price flood risk for individual properties.", "Even with these challenges, several industry representatives said that,  barring any additional regulatory restrictions, insurers and reinsurers are  positioned to continue managing risks associated with climate change  through their ability to set risk-based prices, write coverage, or manage  exposure to losses. However, two reports by an industry group and  academics have found that past catastrophic events have caused the  private property casualty insurance market to retract following a major  disaster, placing greater pressure on public insurers to provide coverage.  For example, according to a 2012 Insurance Information Institute report,  some insurers became insolvent or stopped writing coverage in certain  areas following Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and, since then, Florida\u2019s state  insurer has grown from a market of last resort to the state\u2019s largest  insurer. While some industry representatives we interviewed said  insurers and reinsurers have successfully managed weather-related risks  through underwriting, some said additional incentives are needed to help  the private sector, government programs, and individuals manage their  exposure to risks associated with climate change. For example, several  industry representatives have said that South Carolina\u2019s tax credit  program for homeowners who fortify their homes to make them more  resistant to hurricanes, catastrophic wind events, or flooding could  encourage individuals to take steps to reduce their exposure to such  risks.", "Some industry representatives we interviewed also suggested that  federal, state, and local government adoption of building and land use  practices that recognize potential climate change effects would help  decrease both public and private exposure to insured and uninsured  weather-related losses. For example, land use practices and zoning  regulations that recognize potential climate change impacts could help  reduce public and private exposure to climate change by limiting new  construction or relocating existing structures from hazard-prone areas. In  addition, several insurers and reinsurers we interviewed and other  industry representatives have suggested that incentives are needed to  encourage more state or local governments to adopt resilient building  standards to help mitigate against weather-related losses. The Hurricane  Sandy Rebuilding Task Force reported in August 2013 that using  disaster-resistant building codes is the most effective method to ensure  new and rebuilt structures are designed and constructed to a more  resilient standard. The task force recommended that states and local  governments adopt the most current building codes to ensure that  buildings and other structures incorporate the latest science, advances in  technology, and lessons learned. A representative from one industry  group said updated and more resilient building codes, as well as  improved enforcement measures, would help reduce exposure to  weather-related risks including hurricanes, floods, wildfires, hail, and wind  storms, which are associated with climate change. The industry group  reported in December 2011 that while several hurricane-prone states,  including Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey, have adopted more resilient  building codes, opportunities exist for others to adopt stronger standards  and better enforcement measures.", "To examine these and other issues, in November 2013, the President  established a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience  composed of state, local, and tribal leaders to advise the President and  an interagency council on how the federal government can support state,  local, and tribal preparedness for and resilience to climate change,  among other things. The task force\u2019s recommendations, expected in the  fall of 2014 according to a White House press release, will address  removing barriers to resilient investments\u2014such as improving data and  tools available to state and local decision makers, reforming existing  policies and federal funding programs, and identifying opportunities to  support more climate-resilient investments by states, local communities,  and tribes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FEMA and RMA have commissioned climate change studies,  incorporated climate change adaptation into their planning, and taken  other steps to address aspects of their federal flood and crop insurance  programs that create fiscal exposures associated with climate change  and extreme weather.

We have previously concluded,  among other things, that reducing subsidies and charging full-risk  premiums to individual policyholders would decrease the federal  government\u2019s fiscal exposure under the flood and crop insurance  programs.", "Executive Order 13653 directs federal agencies to, consistent with their  missions, reform policies that may, perhaps unintentionally, increase the  vulnerability of natural or built systems, economic sectors, natural  resources or communities to climate change. Regarding FEMA\u2019s flood  insurance program, the agency is phasing out most subsidies, and is  studying how to incorporate the projected effects of climate change, such  as future sea-level rise and erosion, into its flood maps, but the mapping  advisory council\u2019s recommendations aren\u2019t expected until September  2015. Until the agency implements these changes, some NFIP  policyholders will continue to receive inaccurate signals about their  current risk of loss, and all may not receive signals about their future risk  of loss over the designed lifespan of their insured property. Furthermore,  NFIP standards may not fully reflect policyholders\u2019 long-term vulnerability  to climate change because these standards are based on current risk that  does not reflect future sea-level rise, erosion, or other changes. Without  incorporating forward-looking minimum standards into NFIP\u2019s  construction and rebuilding requirements, similar to the minimum  standard adopted by the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, NFIP  policyholders and communities may continue to build and rebuild  structures to current NFIP standards that do not necessarily reflect the  changing weather-related risks faced over structures\u2019 designed life  spans\u2014which could exacerbate federal fiscal exposure amid already  strained federal resources.", "In addition, a variety of agricultural practices are available to farmers that  would improve their long-term resilience to climate change, such as  practices that would promote long-term water conservation and soil  conservation. However, federal crop insurance policyholders may receive  inaccurate price signals about their current risks because of subsidized  premiums and because of the short-term nature of annual insurance  contracts they may not receive signals that reflect the long-term  implications of their short-term farming practice decisions.

USDA did not specify their  agreement or disagreement with our recommendation, and DHS agreed  with our recommendation.", "In its written comments, USDA referenced our finding that RMA\u2019s good  farming practices focus on maintaining historic crop yields over the term  of the annual insurance contract and that some of these practices may  unintentionally increase the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change,  contrary to Executive Order 13653\u2019s directive for agencies to manage  vulnerabilities to climate change. USDA stated that RMA does not direct  producers to take or carry out certain agronomic practices, but rather  relies on guidance from agricultural experts in the area.  USDA also  stated that to the extent that agricultural experts in an area recommend or  incorporate resilient practice recommendations into their expert guidance  for growers in a given area, then RMA would consider such in its good  farming practice determination for coverage of losses. While RMA may  not direct producers to follow certain agronomic practices, it can provide  incentives for farmers' adoption of resilient practices by working with  agricultural experts to recommend or incorporate resilient practices into  their expert guidance for growers\u2019 good farming practices and therefore  eligibility determinations for claim payments. As we note in the report,  RMA has an opportunity to potentially reduce agriculture's long-term  vulnerability to climate change by encouraging the adoption of resilient  practices now. For that reason, we recommend that RMA consider  working with agricultural experts to recommend or incorporate resilient  agricultural practices into their expert guidance for growers so that good  farming practices take into account long-term agricultural resilience to  climate change.", "In addition, USDA refers to one of our identified program challenges to  insurers that federal law encourages them to provide affordable insurance  to policyholders through subsidized rates, which may reduce  policyholders\u2019 incentives to manage risk by giving them inaccurate signals  about the level of risk. USDA states that, while the federal government  does subsidize a significant share of a producer\u2019s premium, every  producer receives a notification from his or her insurance provider, which  explains how much premium was paid by the government and how much  is to be paid by the producer. Therefore, USDA states that all producers  are made aware of the full risk. While notifying farmers of the subsidy  amount provides useful information, farmers do not bear the true cost of  their risk of loss. As a result, the market signal sent by federal insurers for  the price of the policyholders\u2019 risk is the amount the policyholders actually  pay.

In particular,  DHS stated that FEMA has already taken action to consider amending  NFIP minimum standards by (1) commissioning a 2006 study to assess  the adequacy of the NFIP\u2019s minimum standards, (2) participating in a  2004 forum with key stakeholders about amending the NFIP minimum  standards, and (3) encouraging communities to participate in the NFIP\u2019s  Community Rating System, which offers discounted flood insurance rates  in exchange for a community\u2019s proactive efforts to reduce its flood risk.", "We do not believe that these actions meet the intent of our  recommendation for several reasons. First, commissioning a study and  participating in a policy forum that discussed several aspects of NFIP  minimum standards are not sufficient evidence that FEMA officials  considered adopting forward-looking standards. FEMA has not provided  documentation of internal policy discussions or other actions taken in  response to the study or forum\u2019s findings. Additionally, the study  commissioned by FEMA is 8 years old, and it therefore does not reflect  scientists\u2019 current understanding of sea-level rise and other climate  change effects identified in more recent National Climate Assessments.   Similarly, the discussion with stakeholders occurred 10 years ago, and it  therefore does not reflect the current state of the program, stakeholders\u2019  current understanding of climate-related risks, the adequacy of FEMA\u2019s  floodplain maps, and recent advances in mapping technology.  Moreover,  the Community Rating System is voluntary and, as of March 2014, 1,296  of the nearly 22,000 NFIP-participating communities are in the program.  These communities represent about 67 percent of NFIP policyholders.  Accordingly, amending the NFIP minimum standards could reach the over  20,000 nonparticipating communities.", "As the summary report from the 2004 forum notes, building in a margin of  error such as adding a foot or more to the calculated base flood  evaluation for flood hazard assessment at the outset of the program could  have avoided many of the program\u2019s current problems regarding  uncertainty\u2014including the uncertainty of climate change.

To understand longer-term trends in exposure, we also analyzed  federal exposure data from 2000, and we reviewed scientific studies and  other available literature on climate change. Specifically, we collected  agency data on the total value of property insured under the National  Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the federal crop insurance program.  For the private sector, we collected estimates of the total value insured by  property-casualty insurers\u2014excluding auto\u2014as determined by two  industry catastrophe modeling firms, AIR Worldwide and Risk  Management Solutions. We assessed the reliability of the agency and  industry data we collected and determined it was sufficiently reliable for  describing the total value of property insured.

Specifically, we searched for  scholarly articles, industry articles and reports, think-tank reports,  conference reports, and government publications published from 2007  onward. Through the literature search, we identified a number of studies  that discussed climate change\u2019s potential effects on insured and  uninsured losses and stakeholder perspectives of climate change risks.  For summarizing the effect of climate change on insured and uninsured  losses, we limited our review to scientific, empirical studies that evaluated  the historical loss record or projected future losses. Each of these studies  used various techniques to discern the respective influences on the loss  record of changes in exposure (e.g., wealth, population, insurance  penetration) versus changes in weather patterns. Based on these criteria,  we identified a total of 64 studies that were relevant and applicable to our  report, 20 of which directly addressed the issue of climate change\u2019s effect  on losses.
