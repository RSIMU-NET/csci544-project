To meet this need, DOD and the intelligence community are collaborating on the ambitious Space-Based Radar (SBR) program. By leveraging the newest generation of radar technologies, the SBR concept promises to deliver high-quality data to a wide array of users. DOD intends to start product development in 2006 and to field SBR satellites as quickly as possible so that warfighters, the intelligence community, and national decision makers can gain a better understanding of what adversaries are doing in specific locations around the world. GAO reviewed the SBR program to assess DOD's progress in attaining the knowledge it needs by 2006 in terms of customer needs (or requirements) and resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although SBR is 2 years away from product development, the program already faces major challenges. DOD officials say SBR will likely be the most expensive and technically challenging space system ever built by DOD. The acquisition time frame is much shorter than what has been achieved in the past for other complex satellite systems. Finally, DOD is setting precedence by taking the lead on developing SBR with the intelligence community as a partner. Most DOD space programs that GAO has reviewed in the past several decades were hampered by schedule and cost growth and performance shortfalls. Problems were largely rooted in a failure to match requirements with resources when starting product development. Commitments were made without knowing whether technologies being pursued would work as intended. To avoid these problems, leading commercial firms have adopted a knowledge-based model that enables decision makers to be reasonably certain about their products at critical junctures and helps them make informed investment decisions. Although DOD has taken positive steps to strengthen the involvement of senior leaders within DOD and the intelligence community in setting requirements, SBR's concept of operations has not been approved and signed by requirements boards for either of the two partners. Without documentation and formal approval, it is unclear who will be held accountable for setting requirements or how disagreements among SBR's partners will be resolved when DOD moves SBR into ensuing phases of acquisition. DOD has adopted noteworthy practices to gain knowledge about SBR's resources. These include maximizing the use of systems engineering to close gaps between requirements and resources; estimating all of SBR's costs; exploring alternatives for SBR if the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA)--the communications infrastructure that is expected to relay SBR data across a network of users--incurs schedule and performance shortfalls; and asking contractors to propose multiple operations concepts for SBR with or without TCA. Despite these accomplishments, DOD is at risk of knowledge gaps. SBR's critical technologies will not be mature when product development starts, as called for by best practices. One of TCA's primary components may not be ready in time to support SBR data. These knowledge gaps make it harder for DOD to reliably estimate how much time and money are needed to complete SBR's development. If TCA is delayed, DOD's alternatives may involve reducing SBR's capabilities or significantly increasing program cost. Without sufficient knowledge, DOD may not be able to determine by the time SBR's product development starts in 2006 whether space-based radar is best suited to tracking moving targets on land or at sea or whether air-based radar would provide enough capabilities at far less cost. More specific analyses would help DOD weigh the merits of various alternatives and assess how much to invest in the SBR acquisition program versus air platforms with similar capabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) currently has ground-based and  air-based radars but no capability to track moving targets from space.

SBR is to enhance  information gathering by providing intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance data in a meaningful and timely manner.", "This is an ambitious program for DOD. DOD\u2019s initial total cost estimate for  SBR is about $28.6 billion from fiscal year 2003 to 2024. And although the  technologies for tracking moving targets from space are still in  development, DOD is scheduling almost 7 years between the start of  product development and launch of the first SBR satellite\u2014a time frame  that is considerably shorter than what has been achieved in the past for  other complex satellite systems. DOD would like to field SBR satellites as  quickly as possible because it believes that SBR represents a major leap  forward in providing the warfighters, intelligence community, and national  decision makers with significant tactical, operational, and strategic  advantages over potential adversaries. For example, DOD envisions that  SBR will be able to see deep inside enemy territory without risk to  personnel or resources and that it will operate over areas where  conventional airborne surveillance systems are at risk from the enemy\u2019s  surface-to-air missiles, which can travel increasingly longer ranges.

DOD expects to begin product  development in fiscal year 2006; at which point it will make a commitment  to invest in a formal acquisition program for SBR. Our past work has  shown that successful weapon system programs are able to match their  needs to their resources\u2014that is, money, technology, and time\u2014before  product development. With achievable requirements and commitment of  sufficient investment to complete development, programs are better able  to deliver products at cost and on schedule.

Because of this partnership, SBR\u2019s acquisition process is  more complex than that used for typical DOD programs. While DOD and  the intelligence community will likely use all the data that SBR produces,  their priorities differ. DOD\u2019s warfighting community is particularly  interested in tracking targets moving over land or sea as well as other  objects of interest. The intelligence community is more focused on  obtaining detailed global imagery and combining it with other data for  advanced processing. SBR is expected to meet both needs and be fully  integrated with other space and non-space systems, including TCA, which  is to transmit SBR\u2019s data to receivers in the air, at sea, or on the ground.", "A key advantage of radar in space is having the ability to \u201csee\u201d  through clouds and sand storms and any type of weather, day or night.  Radar-equipped aircrafts, on the other hand, require U.S. air dominance to  collect radar information and must steer clear of hostile areas\u2014the result  being limited radar coverage. The SBR concept offers other added  features, including electronic steering of the radar signal toward a  particular area and capturing high volumes of very fine resolution radar  images of targets and terrain. With the ability to perform these functions  almost simultaneously, SBR is expected to help analysts gain a better  understanding of what is occurring in specific locations.", "To help meet some of its goals, DOD plans to leverage key technologies  that were developed in the late 1990s to demonstrate a space-based radar  capability. According to DOD officials, contractors developed some  satellite hardware and prototype components under the Discoverer II  program, which began in 1998 and was to identify and validate by 2008 the  capability of tracking mobile ground targets from space. Discoverer II,  comprising two radar demonstration satellites, was a joint initiative by the  Air Force, DOD\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the  intelligence community\u2019s National Reconnaissance Office. DOD officials  told us that the Discoverer II program had reached the preliminary design  review phase when it was cancelled in 2000 because of cost and schedule  uncertainties, poorly explained requirements, and the lack of a coherent  vision to transition the system to operational use.", "The Secretary of Defense concluded that space-based radar could provide  a military advantage and in 2001 approved SBR as a new major defense  acquisition program, delegating it to the Air Force. In July 2003, an  independent cost assessment team consisting of representatives from  DOD and the intelligence community estimated that $28.6 billion would be  needed to pay for SBR\u2019s life-cycle costs\u2014development, production,  launch, and operation. The program entered the study phase in August  2003. The Air Force has requested $328 million for SBR in fiscal year 2005  and has programmed about $4 billion for the program from fiscal years  2005 to 2009. Given concerns about affordability and readiness, the Fiscal  Year 2005 Defense Appropriations Conference Report reduced funding for  SBR to $75 million, with the direction to return this effort back to the  technology development phase. In 2003, Congress reduced the Air Force\u2019s  $274 million budget request for SBR by $100 million due to concerns about  technology maturity and schedule.

In some cases, capabilities have not been delivered to  the warfighter after decades of development. Our reports have shown that  these problems, common among many weapon acquisitions, are largely  rooted in a failure to match the customer\u2019s requirements (desired  capabilities) with the developer\u2019s resources (technical knowledge, timing,  and funding) when starting an acquisition program.", "In particular, our past work has shown that for space systems, product  development was often started based on a rigid set of requirements that  proved to be unachievable within a reasonable development time frame.  Other cases involved unstable requirements. In some cases where  requirements had been identified and approved, even more requirements  were added after the program began. When technology did not perform as  planned, adding resources in terms of time and money became the primary  option for solving problems because the customer\u2019s expectations about  the product\u2019s performance capabilities already had been set.", "The path traditionally taken by space programs\u2014and other DOD weapon  system programs\u2014stands in sharp contrast to that taken by leading  commercial firms.

However, we recently reported that the policy is not likely  to achieve these goals because it allows programs to continue to develop  technologies after product development starts. Our past work has shown  that this approach makes it more difficult to estimate cost and schedule at  the onset of product development and increases the likelihood that  programs will encounter technical problems that could disrupt design and  production and require more time and money to address than anticipated.  Over the long run, the extra investment required to address these  problems could reduce funding for developing other technological  advances, slow the overall modernization effort, delay capabilities for the  warfighter, and force unplanned\u2014and possibly unnecessary\u2014trade-offs  between space and other weapon system programs. By contrast, DOD\u2019s  revised policy for other weapon acquisitions encourages programs to  mature technologies to the point of being tested in an operational  environment before beginning product development.

Specifically, it is expected that some critical  SBR technologies will not be mature when product development starts,  that is, not tested in a relevant or operational environment.

For each alternative identified, the contractor is to conduct an  assessment of the cost, risk, and effect on SBR\u2019s performance. DOD  officials told us that when SBR initiates product development in 2006, it  would know whether TCA will be available to support SBR or whether to  pursue a TCA alternative. In addition, DOD also awarded two contracts  totaling $510,000 for a yearlong study to propose several alternatives to  TCA capable of supporting SBR\u2019s communications requirements and to  analyze the viability of such alternatives.

Called Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), this tool associates a TRL with  different levels of demonstrated performance, ranging from paper studies  to actual application of the technology in its final form. The value of using  a tool based on demonstrated performance is that it can presage the likely  consequences of incorporating a technology at a given level of maturity  into a product\u2019s development, enabling decision makers to make informed  choices. Our previous reviews have found the use of TRLs, which range  from 1 to 9, to be a best practice.

A TRL 3 means that most of the work performed so  far has been based on analytical and laboratory studies. At a TRL 5, the  basic technology components are integrated and tested in a simulated or  laboratory environment. Table 2 shows the current TRL for each of SBR\u2019s  critical technologies and the expected TRL at product development start  in 2006. In general, the program office\u2019s key risk reduction efforts are  scheduled to mature these technologies to TRL 5 by the middle of  fiscal year 2006. These efforts include the awarding of research and  development contracts to three payload contractors for efforts to continue  to develop and mature these components (the electronically scanned array  and on-board processor). The period of performance of each contract is  about 2.5 years.", "To mature the electronically scanned array and on-board processor  technologies from a TRL 3/4 to 5, the contractors plan to conduct various  developmental and integrative tasks in about 3 years. For example, one  contractor plans to conduct 18 tasks to develop the electronically scanned  array and 8 tasks to integrate the on-board processor with other system  components. In addition, the development of the integrated circuits and  programmable microcircuits that support the on-board processor  requires extensive tests and evaluations and the radiation-hardening  requirement further complicates the development. Given the challenges  of the state-of-the-art technologies being developed and the algorithms  involved, the testing programs must be rigorous and transparent and the  results fully documented. We have determined that the time allotted to  mature the SBR technologies to TRL 5 is ambitious given the tasks that  need to be accomplished. Furthermore, the development of the signal  processing algorithms and communications downlink involves significant  software development. Based on our past experience of software  assessments in other programs, the establishment of a structured testing  regime for software development has always been underestimated.", "By planning to start product development in fiscal year 2006 with  technologies at TRL 5, DOD is very likely to continue designing the  system and to conduct other program activities at the same time it  builds representative models of key technologies and tests them in an  environment that simulates space conditions (such as a vacuum chamber).  This approach is common with DOD space acquisitions but has a  problematic history. Our past work has shown that it can lead to  significant cost and schedule increases because of the need to fix  problems later in development. A continuing problem is that software  needs are poorly understood at the beginning of a program. We have  previously recommended that DOD not allow technologies to enter into a  weapon system\u2019s product development until they are assessed at a TRL 7,  meaning a prototype has been demonstrated in an operational  environment. DOD has accepted lower TRL thresholds for space  programs because testing in an operational environment\u2014in space, for  example, or even in a relevant environment\u2014is difficult and costly.  However, DOD\u2019s new space acquisition policy does not identify what the  minimum TRL level should be before starting product development for  space programs, how risks should be mitigated if technologies are  included in programs without full testing, or how lower TRL levels affect  the confidence of cost and schedule estimates. Moreover, the policy does  not address the option of maturing technologies outside a program and  pulling them in once they prove to be viable.", "One way to mitigate technology risk is to rely on backup technologies,  should newer technologies prove to be problematic during product  development. According to DOD officials, there are backup technologies  that are more mature for each of SBR\u2019s critical technologies. The backups  are the same technologies but rely on a previous and more mature version.  Using previous versions of these technologies would result in a lower level  of desired performance\u2014such as a reduced area collection rate, a  reduction in the total number of targets collected per satellite per day,  increased product delivery time frames to the user, an increased weight of  the spacecraft, and higher cost. For example, more mature versions of the  electronically scanned array exist and if used, would result in a reduction  in its performance level. In addition, some previous versions of SBR  technologies have not been demonstrated or tested in space. But  according to DOD officials, even with backup technologies, the total  performance of the SBR system can be maintained through systems  engineering trades. DOD says it has been able to leverage some of the key  technologies (such as the electronically scanned array) that were under  development during the previous effort, Discoverer II, to demonstrate a  space-based radar capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communications Infrastructure May Not Be Ready in Time to Support SBR", "paragraphs": ["Current plans call for TCA to transmit SBR\u2019s large volume of data to  ground-, air-, ship-, and space-based systems. However, one of TCA\u2019s  primary components, the Transformational Satellite\u2014which will use  technologies that DOD has never before tried in space\u2014is facing  uncertainties in its scheduled 2011 launch. DOD started product  development for the Transformational Satellite in December 2003 even  though technologies were immature. If the Transformational Satellite  falters but SBR launches as expected in 2012, then DOD will have a fully  operational, new-generation satellite that is missing its primary means of  data transmission. Recognizing the challenges, DOD is to decide by  November 2004 whether to move forward or delay the Transformational  Satellite\u2019s acquisition program and instead procure another Advanced  Extremely High Frequency satellite, which already are under development  and are based on mature technologies.", "Our analysis shows that alternatives to TCA may involve a greater reliance  on processing aboard the SBR satellites, thereby increasing software  development efforts. This approach would reduce the volume of data  requiring transmission, allowing conventional satellite systems, such as  the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites, to handle the  transmission. Another likely alternative is to have SBR satellites transmit  only selected portions of data, again, so that the Advanced Extremely High  Frequency satellite could handle the lower volume of information. Finally,  a dedicated system of satellites could be fielded for the sole purpose of  transmitting SBR data, significantly increasing program cost and raising  affordability issues. Currently, DOD is working closely with officials from  the Transformational Satellite program office to evaluate the relative  merits of various alternatives and to document the interfaces needed  between SBR and the Transformational Satellite for each alternative.  During the course of our audit work, SBR program officials met weekly  with the Transformational Satellite program\u2019s integrated product teams  and were coordinating efforts on a memorandum of agreement on  requirements development, joint engineering practices, and studies of   air- and space-based options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBR\u2019s Cost Estimate Unlikely to Be Realistic Because of Multiple Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["Based on a notional constellation of nine (plus one spare) satellites  operating in low-earth orbit, an independent cost assessment in 2003 put  SBR\u2019s cost at the $28.6 billion mark, making SBR the most expensive DOD  space system ever built. When this initial cost estimate is revised in 2006,  before SBR\u2019s product development starts, DOD is to have decided a  number of issues, such as how many satellites are to be acquired, what  their capabilities will be, and at what altitude(s) the satellites are to  operate. This system refinement allows DOD to develop a more realistic  total system cost estimate\u2014a critical knowledge point if a successful  match between requirements and resources is to be made. However, if  DOD begins product development with less than mature technologies and  without knowing the availability of TCA, accurate cost estimates for SBR  will be much more difficult to prepare. We have previously reported that  improving the reliability of cost estimates is critical and affords DOD  decision makers with the appropriate information to decide whether a  weapon system is worth the overall investment and whether the time is  right to proceed with such an investment. Once a total cost is known, DOD  needs to secure the funding so it can design, produce, operate, and sustain  the system.", "DOD may also lack knowledge needed to make a corporate-level decision  as to how much it should invest in SBR versus air platforms with similar  capabilities at the time it begins the SBR acquisition program. In  November 2003, the Air Force completed an analysis of alternatives (AOA)  for SBR, which was supposed to evaluate whether space- or air-based  radar platforms (such as manned and unmanned aircraft with radar  capabilities) or a combination of both are better suited for tracking  moving targets on land or at sea and analyze the capabilities and costs of  each suitable option. However, DOD officials raised a concern that the  AOA only weighed the merits of various space-based solutions. The Air  Force decided to undertake a follow-on study to explore the optimal ways  to gather information on ground moving targets from radars based in  space versus air. The plan is to also use this follow-on study as part of  DOD\u2019s preparations for submitting a fiscal year 2006 budget to Congress to  secure funding for SBR and other radar systems on air platforms. A more  thorough AOA, completed before the start of the study phase, might  conceivably have determined that air-based radar could provide many or  most of the capabilities promised by space-based radar but at a fraction of  the cost. Moreover, this type of analysis could help DOD officials better  decide whether SBR should be initiated at a later date, when critical  technologies will have been matured, or when the communications  infrastructure to support SBR will be available.", "DOD officials have mentioned other ongoing studies that are examining  the optimal mix between SBR and other platforms for specific capabilities,  such as ground-moving target indication.

During this period, it is critical for programs to work toward  closing knowledge gaps about requirements, technologies, funding, and  other resources so they can be positioned to succeed when DOD decides  to commit to making significant investments. For SBR, this would mean  testing technologies to the point of knowing they can work as intended  before starting program development, securing agreement on  requirements with the intelligence community, and fully assessing the  cost and benefits and risks of relying on TCA and alternatives, including  different mixes of air and space-based platforms. DOD is taking positive  steps toward this end, but without maturing critical technologies or  securing formal commitment on requirements, it will not be able to assure  decision makers that the program can be completed within cost and  schedule estimates. Should DOD decide to proceed on a path that leaves  open important questions, including those about technologies, then it  should do so with (1) assessments of technical risks and what additional  resources (in terms of time and money) would be needed to address  problems that may occur during development as well as what trade-offs  would need to be made with other space programs should DOD need to  invest additional resources in SBR, and (2) a formal commitment for  providing additional resources if problems do occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that DOD and its intelligence community partners obtain  the additional knowledge they need to determine whether and when to  begin the SBR acquisition program, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of the Air Force to:    Direct the SBR Executive Steering Group to ensure that outcomes from  the requirements management process are formally approved and  documented as the program proceeds through product development  before an investment is made beyond technology and concept  development for the SBR program. This group should identify how key  document review comments are to be obtained and addressed and identify  all the officials and/or organizations responsible for taking specific  approval action. In addition, the group should establish a mechanism and  time frame for providing approval/disapproval. Finally, the group should  establish a formal mechanism for addressing unresolved issues as they  relate to key program documentation, as well as how changes to approved  requirements will be assessed.", "Modify DOD\u2019s space acquisition policy to reflect protocols for setting  requirements when DOD undertakes programs in partnership with the  intelligence community.", "Delay approval to commit funding to product development (key decision  point B) for SBR until technologies have been demonstrated in a relevant  or operational environment so DOD can more reliably estimate the  resources needed to complete the program. If the Under Secretary  determines that the program should go forward with less mature  technologies, then we recommend that the Under Secretary (1) undertake  an assessment of the backup technologies that may lessen capability and  add cost to the program and the additional time and money that may be  required to meet SBR\u2019s performance objectives to address those risks,  (2) undertake an assessment of trade-offs that may need to be made with  other space programs to assure SBR\u2019s successful outcome, and (3) secure  formal commitments from DOD to provide funding for total estimated  costs as well as costs estimated to address potential technical risks.    Strengthen the ongoing study of options for tracking ground-moving  targets by ensuring this work includes: (1) a full range of air and space  options; (2) measures of effectiveness that would help justify choosing  SBR over air options; and (3) the possibility of having to rely on TCA  alternatives for space options. This work should also consider the results  of analyses being conducted by other DOD entities on tracking ground- moving targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense (Programs, Requirements, and Resources)  within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.  DOD generally agreed with our findings and our recommendation to  strengthen its study of SBR alternatives. DOD partially agreed with our  recommendations to strengthen its requirement setting process for SBR  and to demonstrate SBR technologies in a relevant or operational  environment before committing to product development. DOD did not  agree with our recommendation to modify its acquisition policy to  strengthen requirements setting.", "In commenting on our recommendations, DOD agreed in principle with  the need to extensively define, analyze, and validate requirements for SBR,  but it did not believe this necessitated a different requirements setting  process than the one that is in place for SBR or changes to its space  acquisition policy or that additional controls were needed within the  program\u2019s study phase. To clarify, our recommendation was not intended  to construct a new requirements setting process or supplant activities  undertaken by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council or the Mission  Requirements Board, as DOD asserts. Rather, we recommend that DOD  build on the positive requirements setting procedures it has already put in  place by instituting controls and mechanisms that ensure transparency,  discipline, and accountability with requirements setting. As noted in our  report, while DOD has taken steps to increase senior leader and  stakeholder involvement in requirements setting, it is not fully  documenting commitments made during the requirements approval  process, nor has it established a process to resolve potential  disagreements that may occur after approval. It is important that this  discipline be instilled in the study phase and throughout the SBR effort. As  noted in previous reports, many space programs have not been executed  within cost and schedule estimates because of an inability to establish firm  requirements and to make and enforce trade-off decisions. For SBR, the  potential for difficulty in requirements setting is higher because of the  distinct needs of the intelligence community and DOD\u2019s desire to integrate  SBR with other radar platforms. Moreover, revising the acquisition policy  to clearly communicate protocols that should be followed when DOD  undertakes space programs in the future involving diverse users\u2014such as  the intelligence community, military services, industry, and/or other  agencies\u2014would further help DOD to rationalize requirements setting and  to solidify relationships with users, which DOD reported was a top SBR  management issue.", "In regard to our recommendation to delay product development until SBR  technologies are sufficiently matured, DOD stated that it has planned for  critical and most other enabling technologies to be demonstrated at least  at the component level in a relevant environment on the ground. DOD also  stated that where technically feasible and fiscally feasible, it planned to  pursue on-orbit demonstrations. It also stated it has taken some actions  relating to our recommendation such as accounting for technical risks in  the costing and budgeting process. DOD asserted, however, that our  recommendation encourages pursuit of older, more proven, technologies.  We recommended that DOD pursue relevant or operational environment  demonstrations of all critical technologies and even an integrated system  before committing to a formal acquisition program because this practice  enables a program to align customer expectations with resources, and  therefore minimize problems that could hurt a program in its design and  production phase and drive up costs and schedule. Further, we agree that  continuing to develop leading edge technology is important for space  system capabilities. However, history has shown and we have repeatedly  reported that conducting technology development within a product  environment consistently delays the delivery of capability to the user, robs  other programs of necessary funds through unanticipated cost overruns,  and, consequently, can result in money wasted and fewer units produced  than originally stated as necessary. A technology development  environment is more forgiving and less costly than a delivery-oriented  acquisition program environment. Events such as test \u201cfailures,\u201d new  discoveries, and time spent in attaining knowledge are considered normal  in this environment. Further, judgments of technology maturity have  proven to be insufficient as the basis for accurate estimates of program  risks as it relates to cost, schedule, and capability. Lastly, our report noted  that DOD was taking positive actions to gain knowledge about technology  readiness, including strengthening systems engineering, undertaking risk  assessments, and assessing various technical concepts. Given the potential  cost of the program, our recommendation focuses on taking these steps  further by assessing what trade-offs may need to be made with other space  programs should the program encounter technical problems that require  more time and money than anticipated and securing commitments to  provide resources needed to address such problems.", "DOD\u2019s detailed comments are provided in appendix II.", "We plan to provide copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Secretary of the Air Force, and interested congressional committees.", "We will make copies available to others upon request.

DOD stated that DOD does not require formal approval for the  concepts of operations from the Joint Requirements Oversight Council  or the Mission Requirements Board, but noted that the Joint  Requirements Oversight Council communicated agreement in a memo.  As we reported, the Under Secretary of the Air Force requested that  both DOD and the intelligence community approve the initial  capabilities document and concept of operations in light of the  complexity of SBR\u2019s acquisition process, the partnership with the  intelligence community, and the proposed integration with other radar  platforms.  2.  DOD stated that it is not engaged in a partnership with the intelligence  community on SBR, as our report states. Specifically, DOD stated that  SBR is wholly funded in the defense budget and that a programmatic  commitment with the intelligence community does not exist. DOD\u2019s  SBR System Acquisition Strategy was signed by senior-level officials  from DOD, National Reconnaissance Office, and the National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and approved on January 14, 2004. This  strategy states that the Air Force, in close partnership with the  National Reconnaissance Office and National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency, is responsible for leading development of an SBR capability.  This strategy further identifies the responsibilities related to SBR that  each mission partner (National Reconnaissance Office and National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) is supposed to carry out. We disagree  with DOD\u2019s assertion that these organizations must provide funding to  SBR in order to consummate a partnership. Because SBR is being  justified on the basis of the system\u2019s ability to provide intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance products to both DOD and the  intelligence community, the part of the budget used is not relevant to  our finding.  3.  To clarify, we did not recommend that DOD pursue lower risk  technologies that would result in lower levels of desired performance.
