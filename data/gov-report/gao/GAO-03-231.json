AOC is also responsible for making all necessary capital improvements  within the complex, including major renovations and new construction.  The historic nature and high-profile use of many of these buildings creates  a complex environment in which to carry out this mission. For example,  the U.S. Capitol building is, at once, a national capitol, museum, office  building, ceremonial site, meeting center, media base, and tourist  attraction. In making structural or other physical changes, AOC must  consider the historical significance and the effect on each of these many  uses. Further, AOC must perform its duties in an environment that requires  balancing the divergent needs of congressional leadership, committees,  individual members of the Congress, congressional staffs, and the visiting  public. The challenges of operating in this environment were compounded  by the events of September 11, 2001, and their aftermath, including the  October 2001 discovery of anthrax bacteria on Capitol Hill, and the  resulting need for increased security and safety.", "Given the important role AOC plays in supporting the effective functioning  of the Congress and neighboring institutions, the Legislative Branch  Appropriations Act, 2002, mandated this review, and Senate and House  Appropriations Committee reports directed our review on certain  management shortcomings at AOC that needed attention, with a focus on  recommending solutions\u2014strategic planning, organizational alignment,  strategic human capital management, and financial management. The  committees also asked us to assess information technology, and three key  program areas\u2014worker safety, recycling, and project management\u2014both  to illustrate the management issues we are addressing and to help AOC  identify best practices and areas for improvement in these important  programs. This report also discusses actions taken to date by AOC and our  recommendations for further enhancements. In April 2002, at the request of  the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, Senate Committee on  Appropriations, we submitted a statement for the record for AOC\u2019s  appropriations hearing that outlined our preliminary observations on what AOC needed to do to improve its management. This report completes our  review. The act also requires AOC to develop a management improvement  plan to address our recommendations.", "We recognize that this report outlines a large and complex agenda for  achieving organizational transformation at AOC, and that AOC cannot  tackle all these changes at once. The experiences of successful major  change management initiatives in large private and public sector  organizations suggest that such initiatives can often take at least 5 to 7  years until they are fully implemented and the related cultures are  transformed in a sustainable manner. Nonetheless, this agenda provides the  broad landscape of issues confronting AOC and is therefore important to  crafting a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing AOC\u2019s  challenges and setting appropriate priorities, even though by necessity it  will have to be phased in over time. By drawing on the full potential of its  management team, AOC can begin to take immediate steps on a number of  actions, although we recognize that AOC will be able to implement some of  these actions more quickly than others."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2002, AOC operated with a budget of $426 million, which  included $237 million for capital expenditures associated with the  construction or major renovation of facilities within the Capitol Hill  complex.

These jurisdictions include the Senate Office  Buildings, the House Office Buildings, the U.S. Capitol Buildings, the  Library of Congress Buildings and Grounds, the Supreme Court Buildings  and Grounds, the Capitol Grounds, the Capitol Power Plant, the U.S.  Botanic Garden. There are over 2,300 employees in AOC; nearly 1 out of  every 3 employees is a member of a union.", "New requirements to meet long-standing labor and safety laws have added  to the complexity of AOC operations. For example, the Congressional  Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) applied 11 civil rights, labor, and  workplace laws to AOC as well as other legislative branch agencies. In  particular, meeting the obligations of labor laws, such as the Fair Labor  Standards Act of 1938 and the Federal Service Labor-Management  Relations Statute, while overcoming a history of poor labor-management  relations has been a struggle. CAA also requires AOC to meet standards set  by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which applied new life  and fire safety codes, as well as other building codes, to the agency. CAA  established the Office of Compliance (OOC) to enforce the provisions of  the act through inspections, investigations, and prosecution of potential  violations. In addition, OOC provides education to employees and  employing offices, and administers dispute resolution procedures if  violations are found.", "AOC has demonstrated a commitment to change through the management  improvements it has planned and under way.

Under this  mandate, we address three objectives: (1) What improvements in strategic  planning, organizational alignment, and strategic human capital  management would help AOC better achieve its mission and accomplish its  strategic goals? (2) What actions can the AOC take to improve its overall  management infrastructure in other key functional areas, such as financial  management and information technology management, to improve its  performance and better accomplish its goals? (3) What specific  improvement can AOC make in selected program areas, including worker  safety, project management, and recycling, vital to achieving its mission?", "To address these objectives, we have been working constructively with  AOC managers to understand their complex operating environment and the  long-standing challenges they must address. In addition to the standard  audit methods described below, as part of our constructive engagement, we  provided AOC briefings and GAO reports on best practices in the areas we  reviewed. For example, at AOC\u2019s request, GAO officials provided briefings  on our own approach to strategic planning and establishing congressional  protocols along with copies of our strategic planning and protocol  documents. In addition, we provided GAO reports on areas such as  strategic human capital management and world-class financial  management and other guidance on GAO\u2019s human capital policies and  procedures. Finally, upon request we provided details of our focus group  methodology discussed below to assist AOC in replicating our approach in  AOC jurisdictions we did not cover.", "For each of the management functions and the worker safety and health,  recycling, and project management programs, we reviewed AOC\u2019s  legislative authority and internal AOC documents, including selected AOC  policies and procedures, internal and consultant reports on AOC  management issues, reports by the Inspector General and GAO, and other  reports on best practices.", "To obtain management\u2019s perspective on the objectives, we interviewed key  senior AOC officials, including the Architect; the Chief of Staff; the  Assistant Architect; the Chief Financial Officer; the General Counsel; the  Deputy Chief of Staff; the Director of Safety, Fire, and Environmental  Programs; the Director of the Office of Labor Relations; and the Acting  Chief of the Office of Design and Construction. We also interviewed AOC  officials at the next level of management responsible for strategic planning,  human resources, information technology, budget, accounting, project  management, architecture, engineering, construction, and recycling. We  also spoke to senior AOC managers and toured facilities in the following  AOC jurisdictions: U.S. Capitol Building, House Office Building, Senate  Office Buildings, Library Buildings and Grounds, Supreme Court, Capitol  Power Plant, and the U.S. Botanic Garden. We interviewed the Inspector  General to discuss the work his office had done on the management areas  we reviewed.", "In addition to formal interviews, AOC allowed us to attend as observers a  number of key internal meetings, including two budget review meetings on  budget formulation and execution progress and issues for two  jurisdictions, three quarterly capital project review meetings to discuss the  status of AOC projects, an August 2002 National Academy of Sciences  workshop to discuss Capitol Hill complex-wide master planning efforts,  and a June 2002 workshop by DuPont Safety Resources on strategies for  safety excellence.", "To obtain additional perspectives on the areas examined as part of our  review and as an initial effort to support AOC planned efforts to begin to  routinely obtain employee feedback, we used focus groups to gather  employee and supervisor perceptions, opinions, and attitudes about  working at AOC. For our focus groups at AOC, we were interested in  obtaining (1) employees\u2019 views of what aspects of working at AOC were  going well or needed improvement, (2) whether employees had the  resources needed to perform their jobs, and (3) employees\u2019 perspectives on  AOC\u2019s worker safety program. We contracted with the firm of  Booz|Allen|Hamilton to conduct the focus groups and summarize and  analyze the results. We conducted 13 of these focus groups with employees  randomly selected from the House and Senate Office Building jurisdictions,  Capitol Power Plant, Senate Restaurants, and the Construction  Management Division. We selected employees from these parts of AOC in  accord with our specific review areas of worker safety and project  management and also because they contained some of the largest  employee populations. The other two focus groups consisted of randomly  selected employee supervisors from the House and Senate jurisdictions. In  all, we invited 200 employees to attend 15 focus groups and 127 employees  participated.", "To obtain a better understanding of project management at AOC, we also  conducted a focus group with full-time AOC project managers. For the  focus group, we asked about what is working well at the AOC in project  management and where there might be areas for improvement. We also  discussed (1) the project management process at AOC, (2) the project  management environment, and (3) resources and tools used in performing  project management duties at AOC. We invited 14 project managers and 8  attended. A more detailed discussion of our focus group objectives, scope,  and methodology, including a list of our focus group questions is contained  in appendix I.", "To further understand how project management works at AOC, we  conducted two in-depth case studies of projects currently under way\u2014the  relocation of the Senate Recording Studio and the modernization of the  coal handling system at the Capitol Power Plant. We selected these case  studies using the following criteria: both were drawn from AOC\u2019s \u201chot\u201d\u2014or  high priority\u2014projects, one was a medium project and one was a large  project, and one had a project manager from the central Assistant  Architect\u2019s office and the other from a jurisdiction.

The Architect disagreed with our statement that AOC\u2019s 5-year  Safety Management Plan was drafted independent of its broader strategic  planning effort. Although we believe that this statement was true at the  time of our review, AOC has subsequently made efforts to improve the  alignment between its draft strategic and worker safety plans.

In this environment, AOC faces the challenge of how best to  marshal its jurisdiction-based resources to address the strategic planning,  performance management, human capital, project management, and other  functional issues that cut across the organization. AOC also faces the  challenge of how to shift from reacting to problems as they arise to getting  in front of the problems to address root causes, while still responding to  the day-to-day service needs of its clients.

In practice, these organizations see the production of a  strategic plan\u2014that is, a particular document issued on a particular day\u2014 as one of the least important parts of the planning process. This is because  they believe strategic planning is not a static or occasional event. It is,  instead, a dynamic and inclusive process. If done well, strategic planning is  continuous and provides the basis for everything the organization does  each day. Therefore, it is important for an organization to go through the  strategic planning process first, and then align the organization to  accomplish the objectives of that plan.

Similarly, a number of business units within AOC, such as the  Human Resources Management Division, the Office of Inspector General,  and the House Office Buildings jurisdiction have developed their own  strategic plans, and the Capitol Buildings jurisdiction is developing a new  master plan for the Capitol, but these plans do not flow directly from, and  therefore are not necessarily consistent with, an AOC-wide plan.", "According to AOC officials, turnover in key planning staff and inability to  reach agreement on how to measure performance led AOC management to  discontinue the AOC-wide strategic planning effort. Subsequently, in 2001  AOC shifted to a scaled-back strategic planning approach that focused on  tasks to be completed in a number of key priority areas: (1) develop a  process and establish realistic goals and priorities, (2) improve employee  support by, for example, addressing space and equipment needs and  improving communication about where the organization is going,  (3) improve safety, (4) improve project delivery, and (5) focus on quality  assurance.

We further  stated that one way of implementing such a strategy is to conduct routine  employee feedback surveys and/or focus groups. In addition, we continue  to believe that AOC could benefit from knowledge sharing to encourage  and reward employees who share and implement best practices across the  various jurisdictions, teams, and projects.", "The need for an organizationwide communications strategy is borne out by  the results of the focus groups that we conducted with AOC employees and  supervisors from June through July 2002. When we analyzed the results of  the focus groups, several themes became apparent. One of the themes  cited by focus group participants involved supervisory communications  and employee relations\u2014specifically, that communications from  supervisor to employee is insufficient. AOC plans to followup on our  efforts by seeking employee feedback through focus groups and surveys. In  a May 23, 2002, memorandum from the Architect to AOC\u2019s employees  announcing the focus groups we conducted, the Architect stated that AOC  planned to gather the views of employees from the jurisdictions that we did  not cover. Moreover, in its draft strategic plan, AOC noted that employee  surveys is one strategy it plans to use to help achieve the human capital  strategic goal of attracting, developing, and retaining diverse, satisfied, and  highly motivated employees.", "AOC must continue to improve its external communications and outreach  by (1) further developing congressional protocols, (2) improving its  accountability reporting, and (3) continuing to measure customer  satisfaction with its services organizationwide. In our April 2002 statement,  we encouraged AOC to consider developing congressional protocols,  which would help ensure that AOC deals with its congressional customers  using clearly defined, consistently applied, and transparent policies and  procedures. After working closely with the Congress and after careful pilot  testing, we implemented congressional protocols in 1999. In response to  our preliminary observations concerning the need for such protocols at  AOC, on June 17, 2002, GAO\u2019s Director of Congressional Relations and her  staff briefed the Architect of the Capitol and AOC\u2019s senior managers on  lessons learned from GAO\u2019s development of congressional protocols. They  shared key lessons and success factors from our experiences in developing  the protocols\u2014that it is a time-consuming process that involves (1) the  personal commitment and direction from the agency head, (2) senior  management participation and buy-in, and (3) continuous outreach to and  feedback from external stakeholders. As a result of our preliminary  observations and our best practices briefing, AOC drafted an initial set of  congressional protocols modeled after our congressional protocols. AOC  noted that these protocols need to be finalized and distributed. In doing so,  and consistent with the approach for AOC\u2019s strategic plan, AOC needs to  continually involve its stakeholders in developing these protocols.", "Although AOC is not required to comply with the 1993 Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) because it is a legislative branch  agency, we believe that AOC could adopt the reporting elements of GPRA  to strengthen accountability and transparency by annually reporting  program performance and financial information. For example, although  GAO is a legislative branch agency, since fiscal year 1999, we have annually  produced performance and accountability reports as well as our future  fiscal year performance plan. Such results-oriented accountability  reporting would help AOC communicate what it has accomplished, as well  as its plans for continued progress to its external stakeholders.", "In tandem with AOC\u2019s efforts to gather internal feedback from its  employees, we noted in April 2002 that AOC\u2019s communications strategy  should also include tools for gauging customer satisfaction with its  services. Customer feedback is an expectation for AOC\u2019s senior managers  and conducting client surveys is one proposed method in AOC\u2019s draft  strategic plan to achieve the strategic objective related to facilities  management. In June 2002, AOC made a concerted effort to gather the  views of some of its clients through a building services customer  satisfaction survey for the Senate, House, Capitol building, and Library of  Congress jurisdictions, which it plans to conduct annually. The Architect of  the Capitol indicated to the survey participants that he will use the results  of the survey to initiate service improvements based on the priorities they  identify. AOC surveyed a total of 1,883 congressional staff members and  received 275 responses. The results of the survey were shared with the  jurisdictions\u2019 superintendents.

This is the case for AOC  where the role of protecting and preserving the historic facilities under its  control may occasionally conflict with its role of providing maintenance  and renovation services to occupants who use the facilities to conduct  congressional business. For example, according to AOC officials, following  elections, new members of the Congress may ask AOC to modify office  suites containing historic architectural features. In those cases, AOC must  balance the members\u2019 needs for functional office design with its  responsibility for protecting the architectural integrity of the rooms.  Consequently, AOC, like other organizations, must weigh its mission  requirements against its priorities. AOC could better gauge its success by  first employing a balanced set of measures that encompasses its diverse  responsibilities and requirements, such as maintaining historic facilities  and satisfying customers and then benchmarking its results both  internally\u2014across its jurisdictions\u2014as well as against other leading  organizations with comparable facility management operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AOC Should Revisit Link between Its Performance Management Systems and Mission-Critical Goals in Its Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["Once AOC has reached agreement with its stakeholders on its strategic  plan, AOC should revisit both its senior executive and employee  performance management systems to strengthen individual accountability  to organizational goals and performance.

The six core components of an effective  safety and health program are (1) management commitment, (2) employee  involvement, (3) identification of problem jobs, (4) analysis and  development of controls for problem jobs, (5) education and training, and  (6) medical management. Table 2 lists these components, along with a  description of the key activities upon which each component is built.", "Our April 2002 statement assessed AOC\u2019s efforts in implementing the first  four components.

As a next step, it needs to develop safety program goals  that are integrated with broader agency goals. In an effort to highlight the  importance of worker safety, the Architect proclaimed safety to be the  agency\u2019s top priority in fiscal year 2001, and established the goal of  reducing total injuries and illnesses by 10 percent each year through fiscal  year 2005. As we reported in April 2002, AOC further demonstrated its  commitment by devoting additional resources to safety, such as increasing  staffing levels in its central safety office and assigning safety staff to seven  of its eight jurisdictions. Additionally, AOC has consulted with the  Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA) on how to record illnesses and injuries and with the congressional  Office of Compliance on how to comply with OSHA requirements. AOC has  also contracted with DuPont Safety Resources to provide a baseline  assessment of AOC\u2019s safety activities and to provide best practices  briefings for AOC senior executives and safety specialists for adopting a  safety culture, including key components of an effective safety and health  program. AOC has also contracted with the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 Public Health Service (PHS), which is developing AOC\u2019s  43 specialized safety programs, providing safety training, and identifying  hazards associated with AOC job tasks. AOC is developing a 5-year Safety  Master Plan that, when completed, is to be used as a road map to identify  its safety goals and philosophy, establish priorities, assign responsibilities,  and identify project and funding needs. AOC employees who participated  in our focus groups also noted positive changes in communicating worker  safety. Many participants felt that AOC takes safety-related incidents  seriously and that there has been an increased emphasis on safety.", "To achieve a safer workplace, AOC needs to integrate the safety goals in its  draft Safety Master Plan with the strategic goals in its draft Strategic Plan.  The Director of AOC\u2019s Safety Program has acknowledged that as a next  step, the two strategic planning efforts must be integrated. Private sector  best practices indicate that an organization needs safety goals that are  consistent and integrated with other organizational goals. Safety goals  should be well integrated into the organizational culture so that it becomes  second nature for employees to perform all tasks safely, and so that there is  little tolerance for unsafe work practices.", "AOC has not yet developed performance measures to assess progress in  achieving these safety goals. AOC officials have indicated that the  development and implementation of the 43 specialized safety programs is  their primary focus, and they plan to implement all of these programs by  fiscal year 2005. Although 15 of these programs have been written and  approved by the Architect, the standard operating procedures that are  needed to fully implement these programs in the jurisdictions have not  been approved. AOC\u2019s draft Safety Master Plan currently provides  information about the development and expected approval dates for the  remaining programs, but does not provide other milestones or performance  measures for the full implementation of these programs in the jurisdictions,  including the anticipated time frames for developing and approving the  standard operating procedures. Identifying interim milestones would help  AOC assess its progress in achieving its fiscal year 2005 completion target  and underscore for AOC employees and external stakeholders the  importance AOC places on worker safety.", "The only performance measure that AOC has developed for assessing the  worker safety program is a 10 percent reduction in injuries. This measure  was based on a general sense of how much of a reduction would be  achievable overall and how high the goal should be to motivate  improvements. As we reported in April 2002, AOC is measuring its progress  in achieving this reduction using the number of claims for compensation  for workplace injuries and illnesses under the Federal Workers\u2019  Compensation Program. However, it provides an incomplete picture of the  overall level of safety because the number of claims in any organization can  be affected by factors not directly related to safety, such as poor morale  among employees or a lack of knowledge about how or when to file a  claim. Also, the use of these data as a measure of safety program  performance is not directly comparable to key measures used in the private  sector, which uses \u201cOSHA recordables\u201d to assess worker safety.We  reported in April 2002 that AOC had begun to collect these data on a limited  basis. Since that time, AOC has begun to develop a more standardized  approach to collect and track OSHA recordables. AOC is also trying to  formalize partnerships with the Office of Compliance and OSHA to provide  technical assistance that could facilitate standardizing these data.", "Moreover, AOC employees at all levels need to be held accountable for  achieving the safety goals. For example, the first goal in AOC\u2019s draft Safety  Master Plan\u2014providing a safe and healthful environment through the  identification and elimination of hazards\u2014has as an objective to ensure  that all facilities, processes, and equipment include safety considerations in  their design, development, and implementation to eliminate hazards. Yet, at  this stage, AOC has not fully linked employee performance with the  achievement of these safety goals and objectives. For example, there was a  recurring observation made by focus group participants that time  constraints to complete jobs and supervisory pressure adversely affect  attention to safety. Although the incentive to focus on safety has been built  into the performance appraisal system for employees, it is not addressed  for senior managers and does not apply to employees who do not  participate in AOC\u2019s performance appraisal system.", "We also reported in April 2002 that AOC needed to clearly define roles,  responsibilities, and authorities of safety personnel at the central and  jurisdictional levels. According to the central and jurisdictional safety  staffs, AOC has now clearly defined their respective roles and  responsibilities. However, it is still unclear how they are being held  accountable for achieving the safety program\u2019s goals. The central safety  office staff are responsible for the overall management of the 43 specialized  programs, and they rely on the jurisdictional safety specialists to develop  the specific procedures necessary for AOC to fully implement these  programs. The jurisdictional safety specialists report to jurisdictional  superintendents and not to the Director of Safety, Fire, and Environmental  Programs, and they have other safety responsibilities and tasks, such as  training and investigating accidents and injuries. Because jurisdictional  safety specialists must focus on safety priorities as established by  superintendents and line managers in their jurisdictions, they have limited  time to spend on developing procedures to implement the specialized  safety programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employee Involvement: AOC Has Established Mechanisms for Involvement, but Complete Reporting of Hazards Is Not Assured", "paragraphs": ["AOC has a number of mechanisms to obtain employee involvement in its  safety program and encourages employees to report injuries and hazards.  AOC now needs to establish a formal reporting mechanism in order to  provide assurance that these safety data are complete. AOC has established  employee safety committees at both the jurisdictional and senior  management levels. The jurisdictional committees, referred to as  Jurisdictional Occupational Safety and Health committees, include  frontline employees and jurisdictional specialists who perform a variety of  activities ranging from training to accident investigations. The senior  management committee, referred to as the Safety, Health, and  Environmental Council, or SHEC, consists of superintendents and AOC  safety staff. This committee meets quarterly and addresses various topics  on an ad hoc basis. As we reported in April 2002, establishing these  committees is a positive step toward achieving employee involvement. In  its baseline assessment of AOC, DuPont Safety Resources cited these  mechanisms as a strength of the agency\u2019s worker safety program.", "Employee involvement also includes establishing procedures for  employees to report job-related illnesses, injuries, incidents, and hazards  and encouraging them to do so. In April 2002, the Architect issued a  memorandum encouraging employees to report all injuries and illnesses,  regardless of severity. Many of the focus group participants indicated that  they generally felt comfortable reporting injuries, incidents, and hazards.  However, there were participants in some focus groups who indicated that  they were hesitant to report hazards because they were not sure how  seriously their supervisors would treat these reports. Many participants  commented that they did not feel protected from safety and health hazards.  For example, some participants said that they were not adequately  prepared to deal with hazardous substances. In that respect, policies and  procedures for reporting accidents should also apply to hazards and other  conditions that may lead to accidents. The recent implementation of a  performance appraisal system that holds frontline employees under this  system accountable for observing and promptly reporting safety issues to  supervisors is a very encouraging step. If effectively implemented, this  appraisal system will also help ensure that employees will be encouraged  to report hazards, that supervisors will take those reports seriously, and  that senior managers will be accountable for acting on these reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identification, Analysis, and Development of Controls for Problem Jobs: AOC\u2019s Inconsistent Approach Does Not Ensure a Risk-Based Approach to Addressing Workplace Hazards", "paragraphs": ["AOC has a number of procedures in place to identify the underlying  hazards that make jobs dangerous and to develop remedies for those  hazards.

In the  absence of an AOC-wide system, we found that some of the jurisdictions  have (1) developed their own specific procedures for conducting  investigations, (2) involved different staff members in the investigations,  and (3) developed their own forms to gather accident or incident data.  However, there were a few focus group participants who questioned  whether sufficient controls existed to ensure that supervisors acted on all  reports, particularly those that are not documented. We found that only two  of AOC\u2019s eight jurisdictions have procedures for tracking hazard reports  and the follow-up actions taken to address those reports, even when there  has not been an accident. In the absence of consistent AOC-wide processes  for conducting investigations, we found generally ad hoc or infrequent  efforts to use existing information from either the internal workers\u2019  compensation database or from other sources to look for common problem  areas to identify potentially hazardous jobs.", "Because AOC has not yet established an agencywide procedure to ensure  that all jurisdictions perform at least a basic level of investigation and data  gathering, it does not have the means for assuring that actual and potential  causes of accidents will be abated.

Eventually, this information on job hazards will be integrated with the  agency\u2019s Computer Aided Facility Management System, although AOC has  not set a date for when this will be accomplished. Also, AOC has procured a  data system\u2014the Facility Management Assistant system\u2014that it plans to  use for recording and monitoring the results of inspections.

In the meantime, at the recommendation of DuPont Safety  Resources, AOC has convened several work groups composed of safety  and other relevant staff to help improve accident and near-miss reporting  and investigations, which we hope will guide AOC\u2019s efforts to develop an  agencywide system for conducting investigations and follow-up."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education and Training: Activities Could Be More Supportive of Improving the Safety Culture; Effectiveness Evaluated in Achieving a Safer Workplace", "paragraphs": ["AOC has adopted a compliance-based approach to providing safety training  to its employees.

Most of this training is driven by  federal safety and health regulations, which provide the basis for AOC\u2019s 43  specialized safety programs. This safety training, covering such topics as  asbestos management, is offered by or through AOC\u2019s HRMD. AOC safety  specialists and supervisors have also provided informal training\u2014such as  general safety awareness talks\u2014to frontline staff in the jurisdictions. These  efforts were acknowledged in our focus groups, as almost all of the focus  group participants reported receiving safety training in the last 12 months.", "In addition to helping AOC achieve compliance, training should support  AOC\u2019s safety goal of changing workplace culture to increase staff  awareness, commitment, and involvement in safety and health. Comments  from DuPont Safety Resources\u2019 representatives and some AOC safety  specialists suggest that in order to change the safety culture, AOC could  target its safety awareness training so that it better motivates employees at  all levels to incorporate safety into all aspects of their work. Many focus  group participants reported that they did not understand how some of the  training provided was pertinent to their work. Once AOC has gathered the  safety data it needs to help it assess the areas of highest risk for hazards,  injuries, accidents, and illnesses, AOC\u2019s safety training could also be  targeted to address these high-risk areas.", "A comprehensive approach to evaluate the effectiveness of training  includes assessments of changes in employee behaviors and how the  training influences organizational results. While AOC performs quality  control assessments for each course offered, it has not evaluated the  overall effectiveness of its training activities to determine if they are  helping AOC achieve a safer workplace and improving the safety culture. In  this regard, as noted above, the majority of the formal training provided is  required by federal safety and health regulations, and although AOC  routinely obtains feedback from employees and subject matter experts on  the quality of individual courses, there is little effort to evaluate whether  these courses are having an impact on AOC employees\u2019 work habits, so it is  not clear to AOC if this training is effective in achieving this objective.", "AOC safety and HRMD staffs have not yet established a systematic process  to identify training needs for individual employees to help ensure the safety  program\u2019s success. Instead jurisdictional safety specialists, working with  HRMD, are developing this training on an ad hoc basis.

The  House jurisdiction worked through HRMD and the National Safety Council  of Maryland to deliver this type of training to supervisors in the House.", "Also, the procedures and responsibilities for monitoring training  requirements for the safety program are not well defined. Currently, the  HRMD staff, the central safety office staff, jurisdictional safety specialists,  and frontline supervisors share responsibilities for monitoring safety  training. HRMD maintains a central record of AOC-sponsored training  courses and employees\u2019 training attendance but does not identify when  employees need training. As a result, jurisdictional safety specialists and  frontline supervisors must determine when employees need required  training and ensure that they receive such training. For example,  jurisdictional safety specialists are tracking this information themselves  using individual systems, thus leading to inconsistencies across  jurisdictions and potentially duplicative record-keeping activities. AOC\u2019s  draft Safety Master Plan refers to a \u201ctickler\u201d that, once developed, is to be  included in the central training system and will identify training needs for  individual employees.

Overall, AOC\u2019s medical management activities are  aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of work-related injuries and  illnesses and controlling workers\u2019 compensation costs, which have  changed little over the last several years. (See figure 2). AOC has partnered  with the congressional Office of the Attending Physician (OAP) to conduct  OSHA-mandated medical examinations for AOC employees exposed to  hazardous substances, while HRMD has developed a return-to-work  program that offers modified-duty assignments to enable recovering  employees to return to work as soon as practical. HRMD also provides  active outreach to AOC employees to keep them informed about their  rights and duties with respect to the federal workers compensation  program. In addition, HRMD follows up on reports of program abuses  through private investigations and ongoing contact with the Department of  Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs.", "Although these activities generally support AOC\u2019s safety program, we have  observed a lack of clarity regarding the roles of the many offices involved  in these efforts. Medical management activities typically involve a number  of separate entities, including human resources staff, health care providers,  occupational health and safety experts, employees, and managers. To be  effective, these activities require a high level of coordination among these  entities. However, the lack of clarity at AOC has led to a limited exchange  of important information that could be used to improve the safety  program\u2019s performance.", "In particular, the role of OAP could be more clearly defined and expanded,  in accordance with the 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between  AOC and OAP. OAP provides primary care and emergency, environmental,  and occupational health services in direct support of members of the  Congress, their staffs, pages, visiting dignitaries, and tourists. As specified  in the Memorandum of Understanding, OAP conducts OSHA-mandated  medical examinations for AOC employees exposed to hazardous  substances, provides first aid for many AOC employees, and approves  modified-duty assignments for recovering AOC employees. However, the  Memorandum of Understanding allows a broader role for OAP in  providing medical expertise, which could potentially include providing  valuable data on the hazards causing injuries and illnesses at AOC,  providing trend information on the results of medical examinations, and  helping AOC standardize reporting procedures. According to the Director  of AOC\u2019s Safety, Fire, and Environmental Programs, as many as 30 percent  of AOC\u2019s reported injuries are probably not serious enough to warrant  medical treatment. However, it is difficult to determine the severity of  reported injuries without better injury data, underscoring the need for  standardized reporting procedures. OAP could be instrumental in helping  AOC develop these procedures.", "AOC central safety staff and HRMD could coordinate more to facilitate the  exchange of information to further control workers\u2019 compensation costs.  In particular, HRMD staff uses injury data primarily for processing workers\u2019  compensation claims, but the central safety office does not systematically  or routinely analyze these data to better understand and address the causes  of injuries and illnesses. Also, superintendents do not routinely receive  data on the costs associated with injuries in each jurisdiction, so they are  not fully aware of them. Having these data would help AOC hold these  managers accountable for reducing these costs. Furthermore, although  HRMD encourages supervisor involvement in identifying and overseeing  modified-duty assignments that would enable AOC to engage injured  workers in productive work to reduce injury costs, some jurisdictional staff  we spoke with generally do not feel it is their responsibility to do so. One  way to ensure that information is fully disclosed and analyzed is to provide  a regular forum, such as a work group of superintendents, HRMD staff,  OAP staff, and safety specialists, to discuss new and ongoing claims. This  strategy has been adopted by the Department of Defense (DOD) and has  proved to be useful in managing workers\u2019 compensation claims and costs,  according to DOD officials who specialize in this area.

Also, AOC could benefit from a clearer definition of  responsibilities for tracking and recording training that is received. AOC  could also make better use of OAP\u2019s resources. There are a number of  additional functions OAP can provide for AOC that we believe are  consistent with the current Memorandum of Understanding, such as  providing valuable data on the hazards causing injuries and illnesses at  AOC. We also believe that a senior-management group that routinely  discusses workers\u2019 compensation claims and costs will help highlight these  issues to all managers, and ultimately make managers more accountable  for reducing these costs.

Based on the results of the workshop, which  was held September 23 through 24, 2002, AOC will develop a request for  proposal for the master plan. While these initial efforts are positive steps,  the overall effort has been slow to take shape given that the workshop took  place over a year after the Senate\u2019s directive. Moreover, as stated in chapter  2, AOC needs to tie its various long-term planning initiatives, including the  master planning effort, to the agencywide strategic planning effort and  obtain stakeholders\u2019 input throughout the process.

According to AOC officials, AOC\u2019s recent pilot  effort to conduct an assessment of the Capitol Building was unsuccessful  due to miscommunication of expectations between the agency and the  contractor performing the assessment. Without BCAs, the agency has no  assurance that it has fully documented the Capitol Hill complex\u2019s  preventive maintenance needs and cannot develop an overall plan with  which to address those needs.

The project  manager focus group participants also pointed out that the BCAs will  require substantial involvement from employees of many of the  jurisdictional shops who will be asked to provide technical information,  logistical support, and other forms of assistance to the assessment teams.

For  example, officials responsible for overall project management use the  Project Information Center (PIC) system to prioritize work and ascertain  the progress of individual projects. However, PIC is not capable of  producing a unified document that shows schedules of active projects,  their interrelationships, and required staffing.

Also, at the direction of the  Senate Committee on Appropriations, AOC has begun issuing quarterly  capital project reports on the status of all ongoing capital projects.  However, the reports we reviewed described the status of all ongoing  capital projects without highlighting those projects that were behind  schedule, over budget, or otherwise of interest to clients. AOC needs to  begin to incorporate stakeholder feedback to better structure this reporting  mechanism.

We have found that the data produced by the system and  reported out by AOC are questionable because project managers do not  consistently update the information in PIC. For example, a majority of the  participants in the project manager focus group said they failed to  consistently put information into the system because they viewed PIC as an  administrative burden that provided no direct benefit to their own day-to- day activities. Additionally, our case studies showed that the project  managers do not always keep PIC completely updated. For example, the  Senate Recording Studio project had a current working estimate listed in  PIC that was nearly double the amount appropriated for the project.  Although we were told that the estimate was outdated, the information had  not been updated in the PIC system. AOC officials recognize the inadequate  data entry into PIC. In response, an OCODC official has recently met with  all of AOC\u2019s project managers to reinforce the importance of keeping PIC  updated and to instruct them on how and what needs to be entered.

Moving forward  with this realignment will require AOC to determine which individuals have  the skills to be dedicated projects managers, as well as to identify the  specific projects they should manage. Officials within OCODC recognize  that not all of the architects and engineers who are currently assigned as  project managers have the requisite skills for the job. With qualified staff,  however, the realignment will ultimately address accountability issues by  clarifying roles and responsibilities and creating true cradle-to-grave  project management staff. Many of the project managers in our focus group  stated that they are currently being asked to wear \u201ctoo many hats,\u201d which  often distracts them from their primary duty to manage projects, and  wanted AOC to move more quickly to a dedicated project management  staff environment. We also observed that the initially slow progress of the  Relocation of the Senate Recording Studio project and the Coal Handling  Modernization project improved once dedicated project managers were  assigned.", "However, a missing component of the realignment proposal is the role of  supervisors in the new project management division.

Defined competencies are important for ensuring that the  right people are employed in the right positions and that they are routinely  held accountable for their work. As a basis for developing these  competencies, AOC can refer to standards developed by leading  professional organizations.

This is because separating a greater variety  of recyclable materials at the source requires more resources for educating  clients and the recycling staff, collecting the recyclable materials, and  monitoring for compliance. The complexity of source separation,  unfortunately, also increases the likelihood of contamination of the  recyclable materials collected (potentially recyclable materials are mixed  together with other categories of recyclables or wet waste), reducing their  value and increasing the volume of waste sent to landfills.

This performance information could  be a useful addition to the set of measures AOC is currently collecting and  monitoring.", "After establishing its mission and goals and building a performance  measurement system, the next key step for AOC is to put performance data  to work. As shown in table 3, steps 4 through 8 and step 10 provide  guidance on ways to monitor and evaluate program performance. AOC has  proposed a quarterly monitoring system. Such monitoring of performance  against goals will enable AOC program managers to identify where  performance is lagging, investigate potential causes, and identify actions  designed to improve performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reexamine Roles, Responsibilities, and Number of AOC Recycling Program Staff Members", "paragraphs": ["The roles and responsibilities of AOC\u2019s recycling program staff members  have evolved in recent years, without the guidance of a clearly defined  mission and goals. In revisiting its recycling program mission and goals,  AOC should also reexamine the roles and responsibilities of its program  staff members to ensure that they are performing the right jobs with the  necessary authority. AOC recently changed the responsibilities of its  recycling program management positions to incorporate a greater focus on  program planning and evaluation. However, according to these staff  members, much of their time is spent in day-to-day program  implementation activities, leaving little time to fulfill their expanded roles.", "The AOC Resource Conservation Manager, originally responsible for only  the AOC hazardous waste program, currently is responsible for planning  and developing policies and programs for an AOC-wide approach to waste  management, analyzing waste removal programs, developing and  presenting briefing and training materials on agency recycling efforts, and  serving as the administrator and technical representative for the recycling  collection contract. However, according to the Resource Conservation  Manager, about half of her effort is devoted to hazardous waste  management activities. She has little time and no staff to carry out the  broad, agencywide planning and evaluation activities required by the  position.", "In fiscal year 2001, AOC replaced its recycling coordinator position with a  Recycling Program Manager position in the House and Senate jurisdictions.  These positions are responsible for working with other Capitol Hill  complex recycling specialists to carry out agencywide recycling, planning  and developing recycling policies and programs, reviewing program  effectiveness and monitoring implementation (e.g., compliance  inspections), and analyzing the financial returns of waste recycling  contracts. However, the House Recycling Program Manager told us that her  current focus has been primarily on implementation activities, such as  providing recycling equipment to offices, limiting the time available to  focus on other responsibilities, such as program monitoring and evaluation.  However, according to this manager, the recent hiring of an assistant to  focus on operations will allow her to devote more time to recycling  program management activities.", "As previously stated, AOC needs to provide a results-oriented basis for  individual accountability. With respect to recycling, AOC has neither  established clear goals nor assigned accountability for achieving results.  Because program implementation occurs in the House and Senate  jurisdictions, AOC needs to incorporate its desired recycling goals into its  performance management system and cascade those goals down through  the jurisdictions to the individuals responsible for program  implementation.", "Overlapping responsibilities for planning, education, monitoring, and  evaluation between the Resource Conservation Manager and jurisdiction  recycling program managers raise questions about the appropriate number  of staff members and mix of responsibilities needed to carry out AOC\u2019s  recycling programs at the central and jurisdictional levels. For example, the  jurisdiction recycling managers focus primarily on the implementation of  the recycling program, including equipping offices, educating participants,  and collecting recyclable materials. Furthermore, the AOC Resource  Conservation Manager has little time and no staff to carry out broad  management and oversight responsibilities. As a result, little capacity  exists to carry out the planning, development, monitoring, and evaluation  of AOC\u2019s recycling programs on an AOC-wide basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although the Architect of the Capitol has managed an office recycling  program in the House and Senate jurisdictions for more than a decade, high  levels of contamination present in the materials collected has prevented it  from fully realizing either the environmental or financial benefits that it  could have achieved.

AOC officials have  indicated that the recycling program will be included in an overall  environmental master plan that it will develop in 2003.

AOC  disagreed with our statement that its 5-year Safety Management Plan was  drafted independent of the broader strategic planning effort.
