In 2014, finding that such agreements confer influence akin to ownership, FCC adopted rules that require that where such agreements encompass more than 15 percent of the weekly advertising time of another station, they will count toward FCC's ownership limits.

This report examines (1) the prevalence and characteristics of such agreements, and (2) stakeholders' perspectives on these agreements. GAO examined publicly available joint sales agreements and interviewed FCC officials and media, public interest, academic, and financial stakeholders about their views. Stakeholders were selected to represent a range of companies and from those who submitted comments on FCC's rules, among other reasons."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agreements among station owners allowing stations to jointly sell advertising\u2014known as \u201cjoint sales agreements\u201d\u2014are mostly in smaller markets and include provisions such as the amount of advertising time sold and how stations share revenue. Some of these agreements also included provisions typical of other types of sharing agreements. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires each station involved in a joint sales agreement to file the agreement in the station's public inspection file. According to FCC, these files are meant to provide the public increased transparency about the operation of local stations and encourage public participation in ensuring that stations serve the public interest. GAO reviewed all joint sales agreements found in stations' public files and identified 86 such agreements among stations. GAO also found inconsistencies in the filing of these agreements. Specifically, 25 of these agreements were filed by one station but not by others involved in the agreements. FCC addresses compliance with this filing requirement through its periodic reviews of station licensing and in response to complaints. However, FCC officials said neither of these approaches has identified agreements that should be filed but have not been, and FCC has not reviewed the completeness of stations' joint sales agreement filings. If stations with joint sales agreements are not filing these agreements as required, a member of the public reviewing such a station's public file would not see in the file that the station's advertising sales involve joint sales with another station. Most multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) stakeholders GAO interviewed said that interconnects exist in most markets. These arrangements allow an advertiser to purchase advertising from a single point to be simultaneously distributed to all MVPDs in a local market participating in the interconnect.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed\u2014including station owners, MVPDs, media industry associations, and financial analysts\u2014said that joint sales agreements and interconnects can provide economic benefits for television stations and MVPDs, respectively. Joint sales agreements allow stations to cut advertising costs, since one station generally performs this role for both stations. For example, some station owners said they used the savings from joint sales agreements and other service-sharing agreements to invest in and improve local programming. Some selected station owners and financial analysts said that stations in smaller markets are more likely to use joint sales agreements because stations in smaller markets receive less advertising revenue while having similar costs as stations in larger markets. Other stakeholders, including public-interest groups and academics, raised concerns about how these agreements may negatively affect local markets. For example, some public-interest groups said that using these agreements reduces competition in the local market and allows broadcasters to circumvent FCC's ownership rules. MVPDs stated that interconnects allow MVPDs to better compete with broadcasters for local advertising revenue by increasing the potential reach of an advertisement to subscribers of MVPDs participating in the interconnect. Some small MVPDs raised concerns that large MVPDs that manage interconnects may impose unfair terms as a condition of their participation in the interconnect. However, large MVPDs said they do not engage in such practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FCC should review joint sales agreements filed in stations' public files to identify missing agreements and take action to ensure the files are complete.

The  Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is responsible for  regulating local stations, has long-standing policy goals to promote the  public interest by encouraging competition, localism, and diversity.  Guided by these policy goals, FCC established media ownership rules  that, among other things, limit the number of local television stations an  entity can own or control in local markets and nationally. FCC is also  responsible for monitoring and reporting to Congress on the status of  competition among companies that provide subscription television  services through cable (e.g., Comcast), satellite (e.g., DIRECTV), or  telecommunications networks (e.g., AT&T), which are referred to as  \u201cmultichannel video programming distributors\u201d (MVPD). Currently, there  are no similar ownership limits on MVPDs, although FCC has attempted  to prescribe limits that were overturned by the courts.", "Local stations and MVPDs both sell advertising in local markets that also  include newspapers, direct mail, and, more recently, Internet-based  media. Some local-station owners have entered into agreements to share  resources with other stations, which may allow stations to realize  economic efficiencies. One type of these agreements is the joint sales  agreement (JSA), under which one local station sells the advertising time  for another local station, usually within the same local market.  Additionally, in some local markets, MVPDs have also entered into  arrangements known as \u201cinterconnects\u201d to pool a portion of their  advertising time to be sold by a single MVPD, often the largest one in the  market. Some policymakers have raised questions about how sharing  agreements such as JSAs may affect competition and programming  among competing local stations.", "By statute, FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every 4  years and determine whether any of its rules remain necessary in the  public interest. FCC completed its last such review in 2007, releasing its  decision in 2008. In 2010, FCC initiated but did not complete a review of  its media ownership rules. In 2014, FCC initiated another review of its  media ownership rules into which FCC incorporated the record from the  review begun in 2010. This review is still ongoing. However, in 2014, in  an accompanying ruling, FCC found that a station that entered into a JSA  to sell more than 15 percent of the weekly advertising time of another  station in the same market could exert significant influence over that other  station\u2014influence akin to ownership. FCC therefore adopted the rule that  in such situations, FCC would count the station whose advertising was  being sold toward the ownership limits of the station selling the  advertising. In its order issued with the new rule, FCC stated that JSAs  should not be used to circumvent its local-station ownership rules, which  are designed to protect competition. The new JSA rules are currently in  effect. However, stations with existing JSAs that would result in a violation  of the local station ownership rules have until October 1, 2025, to come  into compliance. Representatives of the broadcast television industry  brought suit against FCC over the new rules in 2014, claiming, among  other things, that FCC acted improperly by promulgating rules that require  that certain JSAs be counted towards a local station\u2019s ownership limits  without determining whether FCC\u2019s ownership rules remain in the public  interest and without considering the public-interest benefits of JSAs. The  lawsuit is ongoing.", "You asked us to review issues related to local media advertising markets.

To provide assurance  that our review of JSAs was as comprehensive as possible, we also  purchased data on JSAs from BIA/Kelsey, a media research and  consulting firm, which we compared with the JSAs we identified in the  stations\u2019 files; we did not identify any additional JSAs that were not  available in the stations\u2019 public inspection files. We assessed the  reliability of using BIA/Kelsey\u2019s JSA data for this purpose by obtaining  information from BIA/Kelsey about how the data were collected and  maintained and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for this  purpose. We examined the filings of JSAs in stations\u2019 public inspection  files to determine if any JSAs were filed in one station\u2019s folder but missing  from the folder of another station involved in the JSA. We evaluated  FCC\u2019s efforts to ensure completeness of stations\u2019 JSA filings based on  FCC\u2019s rules and stated expectations for stations\u2019 public files and federal  internal control standards related to information and communications. To  determine the prevalence and characteristics of interconnects among  MVPDs, we interviewed FCC officials and the following selected  stakeholders: eight local station owners that we selected to represent companies of  various sizes and those that do and do not have JSAs;  five MVPDs selected to represent cable, satellite, and  telecommunications providers and two companies selling advertising  on their behalf;  five media industry associations selected because they represent  broadcasters, large and small MVPDs, and advertising sellers;  two public interest groups and two academic stakeholders selected  because they filed comments in FCC\u2019s JSA rulemaking or were  recommended by other stakeholders; and  five financial analysts selected based on our prior work and our  research on their backgrounds.", "FCC does not regulate nor collect data on interconnects. Further, MVPD  stakeholders told us that the written agreements that identify the terms of  interconnects are confidential. Consequently, our information about  interconnects is largely testimonial. Our interview results are not  generalizable because we did not select these stakeholders using a  representative sample, and some stakeholders we contacted, particularly  public-interest stakeholders, declined to be interviewed.", "To determine selected stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on advertising sales  agreements among local stations and MVPDs, we reviewed filings in two  FCC proceedings: 1) FCC\u2019s rulemaking on television JSAs and 2) FCC\u2019s  review of a 2014 proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner  Cable. We analyzed filings that stated specific benefits or concerns  related to JSAs or interconnects. We also interviewed FCC officials and  the eight local station owners, five MVPDs, five broadcast and MVPD  industry and advertising associations, five financial analysts, two public- interest groups, and two academics previously mentioned about their  perspectives on JSAs and interconnects. Due to the ongoing litigation  related to the 2014 FCC order pertaining to television JSAs and  ownership limits under the broadcast ownership rules, we did not  evaluate FCC\u2019s efforts related to the JSA rulemaking, nor did we evaluate  FCC\u2019s efforts to review its media ownership rules for this report.", "For contextual information, we purchased and analyzed local media  advertising-revenue and market-share data from BIA/Kelsey.

The advertisements are inserted with the programming that broadcast  and cable networks provide to local stations and MVPDs, respectively. In  contrast, local advertising time is sold to companies wanting to reach a  local audience. This advertising time may be sold to local businesses\u2014 such as a car dealership or restaurant\u2014or it may be sold to a national  business\u2014such as a car manufacturer or a large restaurant chain\u2014that is  purchasing local advertising time to reach a particular local audience.  While local stations or MVPDs often directly sell local advertising time to  local businesses, national advertising sales representatives may arrange  the sale of local advertising time to national businesses.", "The amount of advertising time available for a local station to sell during a  given hour depends on the type of program airing at that time.  Specifically, a local station sells all of the advertising time during the  programming it produces, such as local news. In our 2014 report on  media ownership, we found that advertising aired during local news in  particular represents a substantial portion of a broadcast station\u2019s  revenue. A local station also sells a portion of the advertising time  during programming it receives from its affiliated broadcast network,  generally about 2 \u00bd to 3 minutes per hour, and may sell a portion of the  time during syndicated programming, which is programming such as  game shows and reruns produced nationally but aired on a station-by- station basis. Advertising on cable networks is mostly sold by the cable  networks themselves; however, MVPDs also sell a small portion of the  advertising time on the cable networks that they distribute, about 2  minutes per hour according to MVPDs we spoke to for this report. No  advertising time on the local stations that MVPDs retransmit is available  to MVPDs to sell, nor do MVPDs sell advertising time on premium cable  channels that do not carry advertising, such as HBO. Table 2 presents  example scenarios of how local and national advertising is sold and  shown through both local stations and MVPDs.

FCC\u2019s most recent review related to its media ownership rules  was completed in 2008.", "FCC has also noted that arrangements other than outright ownership  could exert similar influence as ownership. To address such issues, FCC  developed attribution rules to determine what interests should be counted  when applying these media ownership limits. In 2004, FCC sought  comment on whether the use of certain television JSAs warranted  attribution\u2014that is whether the customer-station should be counted or  attributed to the sales-agent station that sells advertising for that station  for the purpose of applying FCC\u2019s media ownership limits. FCC sought  additional comment on this issue in its 2010 media ownership review. In  2014, FCC promulgated a final rule declaring that if a JSA provides that  one station sells more than 15 percent of the weekly advertising time of  another station located in the same market, both stations will be counted  toward the ownership limit of the owner of the station selling the  advertising (i.e., the sales-agent station).

Although there  may be legitimate reasons for a JSA to be missing\u2014for example, if the  JSA had been terminated and removed from one file but not yet from the  other\u2014the extent of missing JSAs raises a concern that there may be  JSAs that should be filed that have not been.", "As previously discussed, FCC\u2019s rules require that all current JSAs be filed  in stations\u2019 public inspection files, which are available online through  FCC\u2019s website. The purpose of this requirement is to improve  transparency of station operations for the public by making documents  more readily available that the public already has a right to access.  Further, according to FCC, the agency required stations to make this  information available so that the public would be encouraged to play a  more active part in dialogue with and oversight of broadcast licensees.  Consequently, if interested parties look at the public file of a station  involved in a JSA, they should expect to find that document in the file so  that they may learn about how a station handles its advertising sales. If a  station involved in a JSA does not have its JSA in its public inspection file,  the transparency over this aspect of the station\u2019s operations is lost. The  standards for internal control in the federal government state that agency  management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating  with, and obtaining information from, external stakeholders that may have  a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals. As previously  stated, FCC\u2019s media ownership rules are meant to serve the public  interest, and FCC\u2019s recent determination that JSAs are a factor in  assessing whether stations are in compliance with the ownership rules  indicates that JSAs could have a bearing on whether stations are serving  the public interest. Furthermore, in October 28, 2014, following the  enactment of its JSA rule earlier in 2014, FCC released a public notice  reminding stations of their obligation to file all current JSAs in their public  inspection files, regardless of whether the station is the sales-agent or the  customer-station in the agreement. The notice stated that a station\u2019s  failure to comply with this rule may result in FCC taking an enforcement  action.", "FCC officials said they do not monitor the contents of stations\u2019 public files  on an ongoing basis and have not reviewed stations\u2019 JSA filings to ensure  they are complete and up to date. They added that they have never  identified or compiled copies of JSAs from these publicly available  sources, either for attributable JSAs or all JSAs, for this purpose. FCC  officials said they typically review compliance with public inspection file  requirements in connection with a station\u2019s license renewal application or  in response to complaints from the public. According to FCC officials,  FCC\u2019s most recent round of license renewal reviews did not turn up any  missing JSAs, and there were no stations self-reporting or petitions from  others alleging missing JSAs. However, if FCC has not compiled a list of  existing JSAs, it is unclear how it would know whether a JSA is missing  when reviewing a file. Additionally, FCC officials said that if they receive a  complaint that a public inspection file is incomplete, FCC may investigate  and take action, such as contacting the station licensee and instructing it  to update the file or issuing an admonishment or fine, as appropriate;  however, FCC officials said they have not received any such complaints.", "According to FCC officials, this compliance approach reflects the  agency\u2019s policy objectives of encouraging greater public participation in  broadcast licensing. However, FCC\u2019s approach puts the burden of  discovering the incompleteness of an inspection file on the public, and in  the case of a file that is missing a JSA, it is not clear how a member of the  public would be likely to know that a JSA is missing without undertaking a  review of all stations\u2019 JSA files, as we did, in order to uncover whether  any other station has put a JSA agreement with that station in its file.  Furthermore, FCC officials said that they take seriously the obligation to  ensure that licensees comply with FCC rules and to vigorously enforce  violations of the public inspection file that are identified as a result of self- disclosure, public complaints, discovery by FCC staff, or in connection  with a station\u2019s license renewal applications. FCC officials said that the  public inspection file is meant to assist the public specifically, rather than  FCC. However, without examining public inspection files to determine if  they are complete, FCC may not be fully aware of violations.", "If the public is to have the sort of dialogue with and oversight of stations  that FCC suggests, then the public should have access to these  documents through the public inspection files. FCC\u2019s rules specify which  documents should be included in the files, and FCC has the authority to  take enforcement action against stations that do not follow its rules.  Although FCC assured broadcasters that the online public file  requirement would not lead to increased FCC scrutiny of the public  inspection files, FCC has already reminded broadcasters of their  responsibility to file JSAs in public inspection files and that FCC may take  enforcement action if stations do not comply. If a member of the public  is examining the file of a station that is involved in a JSA but the station  has not put the JSA in the file, then it would not be apparent that the  station\u2019s operations involve another station as provided by a JSA.  Specifically, this reduces the transparency around the station\u2019s  advertising sales, which is a principal source of station revenue. Public- interest stakeholders told us that lack of transparency regarding JSAs and  other sharing agreements, particularly over what they do and who is  involved, is a primary concern.

Through  technological means, these advertisements are then distributed  simultaneously across the MVPDs participating in the interconnect. For  example, MVPDs told us that an advertiser wishing to purchase  advertising time in a local market on a particular cable-network show  could, through a single transaction with an interconnect, arrange for its  advertisement to air simultaneously during that show on all MVPDs in that  market that are part of the interconnect. Without an interconnect, an  advertiser wishing to reach the same audience would have to negotiate  separate advertising time purchases for the same times and during the  same shows with each MVPD in the local market. Although interconnects  were originally created among cable companies, they have expanded in  recent years to include telecommunications MVPDs. Additionally, MVPD  stakeholders we spoke to explained that while satellite-based MVPDs do  not directly participate in interconnects, satellite MVPDs have developed  a way to insert local advertising into the programming they provide  customers and have begun rolling this capability out in a limited number  of markets. Through an arrangement with a cable-industry-owned  advertising representation sales firm, advertisers can take advantage of  this capability to reach satellite subscribers in some larger markets when  purchasing local advertising through interconnects.", "Stakeholders including two MVPDs, two MVPD advertising representation  firms, three industry associations, one broadcast station owner, and one  financial analyst provided information on the prevalence of interconnects.  Seven of these stakeholders stated that interconnects exist in most  markets, while two of these stakeholders indicated that interconnects are  found mostly in medium- to large-size markets. According to an  association of MVPD advertising sellers, the number of interconnects has  increased in recent years as MVPDs realized their benefits and  efficiencies, which we discuss later in this report. According to several  MVPD stakeholders, there is no industry-wide definition of an  interconnect. Consequently, there are differences in how the term is  defined, making it difficult to obtain consistent information on the number  of interconnects nationwide.", "MVPDs, cable associations, and financial analysts we interviewed  identified the following key characteristics of interconnects:", "Advertising time: According to MVPD stakeholders we interviewed,  interconnects cover only advertising and do not cover other services.  Interconnect managers: According to MVPDs, typically the largest  MVPD provider in the market manages the interconnect. For example,  one large MVPD told us that it created and manages about one-third  of the nation\u2019s interconnects and is a participant in interconnects  managed by other MVPDs. This MVPD also said that creation and  management of an interconnect requires significant investments in  personnel and technology. MVPD stakeholders also told us that some  interconnects are managed by national advertising representation  firms.", "Revenue sharing: MVPDs said that revenue from the sale of  advertising through an interconnect is generally prorated among the  MVPDs in the interconnect based on the amount of inventory provided  for sale and their number of subscribers in the DMA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Selected Stakeholders Said That Advertising Agreements Provide Economic Benefits, but Others Raised Concerns over the Market Effects of these Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Some stakeholders that filed comments in FCC proceedings and who we  interviewed stated that local stations and MVPDs benefit economically  from JSAs and interconnects, respectively.

As previously discussed, a JSA is generally accompanied by a  shared service agreement, and they are sometimes the same agreement.  Further, in discussing their views, a few station owners told us that while  JSAs provide some cost savings, shared service agreements provide  most of the savings and that it generally did not make sense to talk about  JSAs without also discussing shared service agreements. Consequently,  our discussion of stakeholders\u2019 views is based on comments about the  use of both JSAs and shared service agreements, which we refer to  together as \u201csharing agreements.\u201d", "All of the station owners we interviewed said that the savings from these  sharing agreements help financially struggling stations survive when they  might otherwise go out of business, with some owners saying this is  particularly the case with stations in smaller markets. Some station  owners and financial analysts told us that as local stations are facing  increased competition for advertising revenues from other media, such as  Internet-based media and MVPDs, stations rely on sharing agreements to  cut costs. Our analysis of BIA/Kelsey local advertising revenue data  showed that the market share of Internet-based media increased from 11  percent in 2011 to 17 percent in 2014\u2014a percentage comparable to the  market share for broadcast television, which was 15 percent in 2014 (up  slightly from 13 percent in 2011). This share is higher than the market  share of MVPDs, which was about 5 percent in both years. (For more  results of our analysis of this market data, see app. II.) Most media  industry stakeholders and financial analysts whom we interviewed  consistently identified the growth in Internet-based media as a major  change in local advertising markets in recent years, coming at a time  when market shares for other types of media, such as radio and  newspapers, have been relatively flat or in decline.", "Furthermore, two station owners and two financial analysts told us that  stations in smaller markets are more likely to use JSAs than stations in  larger markets because local stations earn less advertising revenue in  small markets than in large markets, while they said their costs are  roughly the same regardless of market size. Our analysis of BIA/Kelsey  estimates of local advertising revenue supports this revenue claim.  Specifically, stations in the 25 largest DMAs had average revenue of  $28.0 million per station in 2014\u2014more than nine times the $3.0 million  average revenue per station in the smallest DMAs (those ranked 101 to  210). According to some station owners and financial analysts, stations  view JSAs and shared service agreements as a means of remaining  financially viable in small markets. In contrast, a local station owner that  has stations in larger markets said that there is no need for JSAs in  markets like Los Angeles or New York.", "In addition to cutting costs and helping local stations remain financially  viable, station owners also told us that the associated cost savings from  sharing agreements enable stations to make investments that help them  compete with other local media and provide benefits to the stations and  their communities, thereby supporting FCC\u2019s goals of enhancing  competition, diversity, and localism. Benefits station owners cited include:  Investments in diverse programming: Some station owners filing in  FCC\u2019s JSA rulemaking (6 of 18) and whom we interviewed (4 of 10)  said that sharing agreements allow them to enhance the diversity of  local programming. For example, representatives from Univision, a  Spanish-language network and a station owner, told us the company  has used JSAs and shared-service agreements with another station  owner, Entravision, to establish and expand Univision\u2019s second  Spanish-language network, UniM\u00e1s. Under this arrangement,  Entravision provides services for Univision\u2019s stations that carry  UniM\u00e1s programming: According to Univision representatives, the  resulting cost savings have allowed it to launch UniM\u00e1s in six  markets, growing the network faster than it could have without sharing  agreements.  Increased local news coverage: According to some station owners  that filed comments in FCC\u2019s JSA rulemaking and that we  interviewed, producing local news is expensive and stations find it  financially challenging to produce local news, particularly in smaller  markets. Most station owners that filed FCC comments (10 of 18) and  most that we interviewed (7 of 10) said JSAs and shared service  agreements allow local stations to air local news when they would  otherwise be unable to or to expand or improve their existing news  coverage. For example, one owner of a small-market station told us  its JSA and shared service agreement with a larger station owner in  the same market have allowed both stations to share resources,  thereby reducing costs and improving their news services.  Improved services: Some station owners that filed FCC comments (8  of 18) and that we interviewed (4 of 10) said JSAs enable stations to  improve service quality. For example, one station owner told us that  savings associated with its JSA allowed the station to upgrade its  broadcast to high definition, which helped the station better compete  for advertising dollars, since many advertisers will not buy advertising  unless it is in high definition.", "FCC itself has acknowledged that JSAs may have benefits. Specifically,  in the order FCC released with its 2014 JSA rules, FCC stated that  cooperation among local stations may have public-interest benefits under  some circumstances, particularly in small to mid-sized markets. FCC also  stated that JSAs may, for example, facilitate cost savings and efficiencies  that could enable the stations to provide more locally oriented  programming.", "Conversely, some stakeholders raised concerns about how JSAs and  shared service agreements may affect local markets. For example, one of  the four public-interest groups that filed comments in FCC\u2019s JSA  rulemaking, as well as the two public-interest groups and one of the two  academic stakeholders we interviewed, said that JSAs do not support the  long-standing policy goals to encourage competition, diversity, and  localism. Stakeholders raised concerns about JSAs in the following areas:", "Undue influence: One MVPD association, one labor union, and two  public interest groups that filed comments in FCC\u2019s JSA rulemaking  and one MVPD, both public-interest groups, and both academic  stakeholders we interviewed said that JSAs and other sharing  agreements create the potential for undue influence over station  operations. Specifically, according to some of these stakeholders,  such influence could occur because the agreements create a financial  interest. With JSAs, this is because the sales-agent station sells the  customer station\u2019s advertising, which is a principal source of the  customer station\u2019s revenue. Furthermore, one MVPD, two public- interest groups, and two labor unions that filed FCC comments, as  well as both of the public-interest groups and one of the two academic  stakeholders we interviewed, said JSAs and other sharing  agreements allow station owners to circumvent FCC\u2019s media  ownership rules. As previously discussed, FCC\u2019s ownership rules limit  the number of local stations an entity can control in a local market.", "Reduced competition for advertising: According to most public-interest  groups (three of four) that filed FCC comments and two of the ten  MVPDs, both of the public-interest groups, and one of the two  academic stakeholders we interviewed, local stations\u2019 use of JSAs  effectively reduces competition for advertising dollars in local markets  because, for example, stations within a JSA may combine their sales  forces and no longer compete with each other for advertising revenue.  Some of these stakeholders raised the concern that this reduced  competition may create negative impacts in the market, such as  allowing stations with JSAs to capture more of the local advertising  market, putting other stations without JSAs at a disadvantage.", "Reduced diversity: Both public-interest groups and one of the  academic stakeholders we interviewed said that sharing agreements  reduce diversity in local markets, including diversity in terms of  programming or station ownership. For example, an academic  stakeholder told us that the use of such agreements results in the  same entity effectively controlling the content of one or more stations.", "Reduced localism: According to one of the four public-interest groups  and the one academic stakeholder that filed FCC comments, as well  as both of the academic stakeholders we interviewed, the use of  sharing agreements can lead to the reduced provision of local news.  For example, an academic stakeholder said in its FCC filing that JSAs  and shared service agreements have negatively impacted the  Syracuse market, because two stations consolidated operations under  these agreements and in the process cut one of the station\u2019s news  operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MVPDs Said Interconnects Allow Their Advertising Time to Reach More of the Local Market, but Other Stakeholders Raised Concerns about Effects on Competition", "paragraphs": ["According to 9 of the 10 MVPD stakeholders we interviewed, a primary  benefit of an interconnect is to aggregate the available advertising time  among various MVPDs in a local market. This enables MVPDs to  collectively reach a greater number of households in that market than any  single MVPD could reach with its advertising time. Six of these MVPDs  said this increased reach enables MVPDs participating in interconnects to  better compete with other local media, particularly local broadcast  television stations, since it enables them to have a market reach that is  closer to that of a local station. Further, four MVPDs also told us that this  increased reach makes MVPDs\u2019 advertising time more valuable to  advertisers. According to some MVPD stakeholders, without  interconnects, the reach of each MVPD\u2019s advertising time would include  only that MVPD\u2019s subscribers, which could be a small percentage of  households in the local market. As a result, according to three MVPDs,  sometimes advertisers would not purchase MVPD advertising time. Nine  of the ten MVPD stakeholders said that aggregating advertising inventory  through interconnects also enhances the efficiency of advertising sales by  enabling advertisers to buy advertising time across a number of MVPDs  in a given local market through a single purchase.", "MVPD stakeholders we interviewed also noted that interconnects can  reduce costs. Two MVPDs we interviewed and two larger MVPDs that  filed comments in FCC\u2019s Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger proceeding  said interconnects allow some MVPDs to cut costs because one MVPD  manages the advertising sales and technological implementation of the  interconnect for all of the participating MVPDs, whereas without an  interconnect, each MVPD would maintain a sales staff.", "In contrast, smaller MVPD stakeholders that commented in the  Comcast/Time Warner merger proceeding and some stakeholders we  interviewed raised concerns about interconnects. Specifically, 6 of the10  station owners we interviewed told us MVPDs have an unfair competitive  advantage over local stations because, for example, FCC regulates  station owners\u2019 JSAs but not MVPDs\u2019 interconnects. Four of these station  owners noted that MVPDs are therefore allowed to take advantage of  efficiencies and savings through their own type of advertising sales  agreement, while local stations face regulatory constraints in doing so.  Additionally, five small MVPD stakeholders and an advertising  representation firm that works with small MVPDs that commented in the  Comcast/Time Warner merger proceeding said that larger MVPDs that  manage interconnects treat smaller MVPDs unfairly\u2014or have the  potential to\u2014by applying conditions to the smaller MVPDs\u2019 participation in  interconnects, such as excluding some smaller MVPDs from  interconnects if the smaller MVPDs use an advertising representation firm  that competes with the large MVPD\u2019s national advertising arm. Four small  MVPDs and an MVPD advertising representation firm that submitted  comments in the Comcast/Time Warner merger proceeding said that  excluding MVPDs from interconnects decreases revenue for the excluded  MVPDs. Two larger MVPDs that provided comments in the merger  proceeding, however, indicated that they do not engage in such practices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While opinion differ on how JSAs among local stations and interconnects  among MVPDs affect the media landscape, FCC has defined JSAs and  required that they be placed in local stations\u2019 public inspection files.  Moreover, in 2014, FCC issued a rule that requires that where a JSA  encompasses more than 15 percent of another station\u2019s weekly  advertising time, the JSA will count toward the local-station ownership  limit. FCC requires that each broadcast television station with a JSA file  the JSA in its public inspection file, including in the station\u2019s online file on  FCC\u2019s website\u2014regardless of whether the station is the sales-agent  station or the customer station. This requirement is intended to improve  the transparency of local stations\u2019 operations so that the public can have  a more active role in assessing stations\u2019 operations in their local markets.  However, we found that a considerable number of JSAs filed by customer  stations were not also filed by a sales-agent station\u2014and that FCC has  not taken sufficient steps to determine the extent to which broadcast  television stations are complying with this rule. If stations that use JSAs  as part of their advertising operations have neglected to file or update  their JSAs in their public inspection files, interested parties may be  unaware that the stations have such arrangements and therefore lack  insight into this aspect of local television operations.

We identified documents  as JSAs if they were labeled as such or if they were a shared service  agreement that included provisions for the joint-sale of advertising. We  excluded duplicate copies of the same JSA in our analysis, a JSA that we  determined had expired according to the date in the JSA, and documents  filed in a JSA folder that were not JSAs, such as local marketing  agreements and shared service agreements that did not have an  advertising component. According to FCC officials, although stations are  required to place copies of their JSAs in their public inspection files, FCC  officials have not independently verified whether each station has done  so, and the officials said that they were not aware of any JSAs that were  mislabeled or misfiled. To provide assurance our review of JSAs was as  comprehensive as possible, we also purchased JSA data from  BIA/Kelsey, a media research and consulting firm. BIA/Kelsey developed  its JSA data by reviewing information in the trade press, analyzing FCC  filings, and through direct contact with television stations to ask for  information such as the presence of JSAs. We compared BIA/Kelsey\u2019s  data against the JSAs we were able to identify in stations\u2019 public  inspection files and did not identify any additional JSAs in this data that  were not available in the file. We assessed the reliability of using  BIA/Kelsey\u2019s JSA data for the purpose outlined here by obtaining  information from BIA/Kelsey about how the data were collected and  maintained and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for this  purpose. We analyzed the JSAs we obtained from FCC to determine their  characteristics such as which stations and owners were party to the  agreements, their date and duration, and advertising sales provisions. We  also analyzed the filings of JSAs in stations\u2019 public inspection folders to  identify if any JSAs were filed in one station\u2019s folder but missing from the  folder of another station involved in the JSA. Where JSAs did not mention  a specific sales-agent station, we identified the probable station by  reviewing publicly available information about television station owners or  contacting another station involved in the JSA and examined the public  inspection files of those stations.
