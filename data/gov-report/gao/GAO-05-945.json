Delta, Northwest, United, and US Airways have filed for bankruptcy, the latter two terminating and transferring their pension plans to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The net claim on PBGC from these terminations was $9.7 billion; plan participants lost $5.3 billion in benefits (in constant 2005 dollars). Considerable debate has ensued over airlines' use of bankruptcy protection as a means to continue operations. Many in the industry have maintained that airlines' use of this approach is harmful to the industry. This debate has received even sharper focus with pension defaults. Critics argue that by not having to meet their pension obligations, airlines in bankruptcy have an advantage that may encourage other companies to take the same approach. At the request of the Congress, we have continued to assess the financial condition of the airline industry and focused on the problems of bankruptcy and pension terminations. This report details: (1) the role of bankruptcy in the airline industry, (2) whether bankruptcies are harming the industry, and (3) the effect of airline pension underfunding on employees, airlines, and the PBGC.

Structurally, the industry is characterized by high fixed costs, cyclical demand for its services, and intense competition. Consequently, since deregulation in 1978, there have been 162 airline bankruptcy filings, 22 of them in the last five years. Airlines have used bankruptcy in response to liquidity pressures and as a means to restructure their costs. Our analysis of major airline bankruptcies shows mixed results in being able to significantly reduce costs--most but not all airlines were able to do so. However, bankruptcy is not a panacea for airlines. Few have emerged from bankruptcy and are still operating. There is no clear evidence that airlines in bankruptcy keep capacity in the system that otherwise would have been eliminated, or harm the industry by lowering fares below what other airlines charge. While the liquidation of an airline may reduce capacity in the near-term, capacity returns relatively quickly. In individual markets where a dominant carrier significantly reduces operations, other carriers expand capacity to compensate. Several studies have found that airlines in bankruptcy have not reduced fares and rival airlines were not harmed financially. The defined benefit pension plans of the remaining airlines with active plans are underfunded by $13.7 billion, raising the potential of more sizeable losses to PBGC and plan participants. These airlines face an estimated $10.4 billion in minimum pension contribution requirements over the next 4 years, significantly more than some of them may be able to afford given their continued operating losses and other fixed obligations. While spreading these contributions over more years would relieve some of these airlines' liquidity pressures, it does not ensure that they will avoid bankruptcy because it does not fully address other fundamental structural problems, such as other high fixed costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, the U.S. airline industry has confronted financial losses of  unprecedented proportions. From 2001 through 2004, legacy airlines (i.e.,  generally, those network airlines whose interstate operations predated  deregulation) incurred operating losses of $28 billion. Since 2000, four of  the nation\u2019s largest legacy airlines\u2014Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines,  United Airlines and US Airways--have gone into bankruptcy. Together,  these airlines provided over 40 percent of the available passenger seating  capacity operated by all U.S. airlines during the second quarter of 2005.  Under bankruptcy protection, United and US Airways terminated their  pension plans and passed the unfunded liability to the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).", "In recent years, considerable debate has ensued over legacy airlines\u2019 use of  chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a means to continue operations, often  for years. Some in the industry and elsewhere have maintained that legacy  airlines\u2019 use of this approach is harmful to the airline industry as a whole  because it allows inefficient carriers to stay in business, creating  overcapacity and allowing these airlines to potentially underprice their  competitors. This debate has received even sharper focus since US Airways  and United defaulted on their pensions. Without their pension obligations,  critics argue, US Airways and United enjoy a cost advantage that may  encourage other airlines sponsoring defined benefit plans to take the same  approach.", "Last year, we reported on the industry\u2019s poor financial condition, the  reasons for it, and the need for legacy airlines to reduce their costs if they are to survive. At the request of Congress, we have continued to assess the  financial condition of the airline industry and, in particular, the problems of  bankruptcy and pension plan terminations. Accordingly, this report details  (1) the role of bankruptcy in the airline industry, (2) whether bankruptcies  are harming the industry, and (3) the effect of airline pension underfunding  on employees, airlines, and PBGC.", "To help answer these questions, we relied on a variety of data sources. To  assess the financial status of airlines, including bankrupt airlines, we used  airline financial and operating data reported to the U.S. Department of  Transportation (DOT). To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed  the quality control procedures that the Department and its contractors use  in collecting and maintaining these data. To analyze the impact of airline  bankruptcies, we relied on two different but complementary databases:   Professor Lynn M. LoPucki\u2019s Bankruptcy Research Database and New  Generation Research\u2019s bankruptcydata.com. We  assessed the reliability of  these data by comparing key elements from the two data sources and also  by comparing key elements with corporate filings with the U.S. Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC).  To assess the effect of underfunding  airline pensions, we relied on PBGC data, supplemented by public financial  reports filed with SEC. We determined that the data we used were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For our work, we also  reviewed academic studies, met with airline and trade association  representatives, government experts, and industry and legal analysts.  Additional information on our scope and methodology is available in  appendix I. We performed our work from August 2004 through September  2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1978, under the Airline Deregulation Act, the United States deregulated  its domestic airline industry. The main purpose of deregulation was to  remove government control and open the air transport industry to market  forces. Previously, the Civil Aeronautics Board regulated all domestic air  transport, controlling fares and setting routes. In this regulated market,  airlines competed more through advertising and onboard services than  through fares. When the industry was deregulated, \u201clegacy\u201d airlines carried  over the cost structures that had been protected by price regulation.  Similar to other highly regulated industries, the airline industry was heavily  unionized, with a highly trained and stable workforce. By contrast, carriers  that started operations after deregulation sought to attract passengers from  legacy network carriers and to stimulate new passenger traffic\u2014and did so\u2014by offering lower fares. These airlines generally paid less for labor, on  a unit cost basis, which helped them keep their overall operating costs low.", "In August 2004, we reported on the financial condition of the airline  industry. High-end demand for air travel had begun weakening in 2000  because of an economic turndown, and demand dropped significantly  following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; the war in Iraq; and the  outbreak of SARS. We found that in response to changing market  conditions, legacy airlines had reduced costs, but mostly by reducing  capacity and not nearly enough to be competitive with low cost airlines.  Low cost airlines experienced significant growth and a fall in their unit  costs as measured by cost per available seat-mile (CASM), whereas legacy  airlines\u2019 unit costs did not improve. In addition, we found that neither  legacy nor low cost airlines possessed much pricing power and suffered  declining unit revenue. As a result of their weak financial performance and  mounting losses, legacy airlines saw their financial liquidity and solvency  seriously deteriorate even as their debt and pension obligations mounted.  Since our 2004 report was issued, losses have continued to mount for  airlines even though traffic levels have returned to pre-9/11 levels. One of  the primary culprits has been record fuel prices, nearly doubling since 2003  (see fig. 1).", "Low fares have affected revenues for both legacy and low cost airlines.  Yields, the amount of revenue airlines collect for every mile a passenger  travels, fell for both low cost and legacy airlines from 2000 through 2004  (see fig. 2). However, the decline has been greater for legacy airlines than  for low cost airlines.  Only during the first half of 2005 has stronger demand  allowed airlines to increase fares sufficiently to boost their yields.", "Legacy airlines, as a group, have been unsuccessful in reducing their costs  to become more competitive with low cost airlines. Unit-cost  competitiveness is essential to profitability for airlines after years of  declining yields. While legacy airlines have been able to reduce their overall  costs since 2001, they have done so largely by reducing capacity and  without improving their unit costs as compared to low cost airlines.  Meanwhile, low cost airlines have been able to maintain low unit costs by  continuing to grow and maintaining high productivity. As a result, low cost  airlines have been able to sustain a unit-cost advantage over their legacy  rivals (see fig. 3). In 2004, low cost airlines maintained a 2.7 cent advantage  per available seat mile over legacy airlines. This advantage is attributable to  lower overall costs and greater labor and asset productivity. Thus far in  2005, airlines have been able to trim most of their nonfuel-related costs, but  high fuel prices and debt interest charges have kept airlines\u2019 costs from  falling.", "Weak revenues and the inability to realize greater unit-cost savings have  combined to produce unprecedented losses for legacy airlines. At the same  time, low cost airlines have been able to continue producing modest profits  (see fig. 4). Legacy airlines have incurred a cumulative $28 billion in  operating losses since 2001. Despite a modest recovery for some airlines  during the first half of 2005, analysts predict the industry will lose another  $5 billion to $9 billion in 2005.", "Owing to continued losses, legacy airlines built cash balances not through  operations but by borrowing. Legacy airlines have lost cash from  operations and compensated for operating losses by taking on additional  debt, relying on creditors for more of their capital needs than in the past. In  doing so, several legacy airlines have used all, or nearly all, of their assets  as collateral, potentially limiting their future access to capital markets.", "Airlines (and other businesses) that are unable to operate profitably over  time may seek recourse under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In general, two  major provisions of the bankruptcy code govern actions taken by airlines  and other businesses:  Chapter 7 of the code governs liquidation of the debtor\u2019s estate and is  often referred to as a \u201cstraight bankruptcy.\u201d  A trustee is appointed to  sell off available assets to repay creditors.  is designed to accommodate complicated reorganizations of publicly  held corporations. Among other things, it allows companies, with court  approval, to reject agreements made under collective bargaining and  renegotiate contracts with other creditors. With the approval of the  bankruptcy courts (which administer the bankruptcy laws), companies  may also modify retiree benefits.", "Airline bankruptcies typically include a large number of stakeholders. The  primary stakeholder is the airline itself, known as the debtor-in-possession.  Federal stakeholders include the bankruptcy judge, who presides over the  administration of the case and decides contested aspects, and the U.S.  Trustee, whose duties include ensuring the integrity of the process and  approving the retention of professionals (e.g., bankruptcy attorneys).   During this most recent round of airline bankruptcies, two additional  governmental entities have become major stakeholders in airline  bankruptcies: the Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB), which  was formed after September 11 to administer a $10 billion loan guarantee  program for airlines, and PBGC, which insures defined benefit pension  plans. Both agencies have taken ownership stakes in bankrupt and  nonbankrupt airlines through ATSB\u2019s loan guarantees and PBGC\u2019s taking  over defined benefit pension plans terminated in bankruptcy. The entities  that provide the financing while an airline is in bankruptcy (known as  debtor-in-possession financing) and upon its exit (exit financing) are also  major stakeholders, as are airline employees, many of whom are represented by labor unions. Other secured and nonsecured creditors and  shareholders are also stakeholders in an airline bankruptcy. The interests  of unsecured creditors (including labor) and shareholders are represented  in the process by committees appointed by the U.S. Trustee.", "Among the largest cost elements for both legacy airlines and low cost  airlines are those associated with employee compensation and benefits. As  part of the retirement benefits offered, legacy airlines have tended to offer  \u201cdefined benefit plans\u201d and supplemental defined contribution plans,  whereas low cost airlines tend to provide only \u201cdefined contribution plans.\u201d", "Defined benefit plans typically provide participants with an annuity at  retirement\u2014a series of periodic payments over a specified period of  time or for the life of the participant. As designed, defined benefit plan  annuities are generally based on a participant\u2019s retirement age, number  of years of employment, and salary. As of December 31, 2004, nine major  airlines sponsored defined benefit plans for their employees: Aloha,  Alaska, American, Continental, Delta, Hawaii, Northwest, US Airways,  and United. These airlines generally offered different pension plans for  different groups of employees\u2014pilots, machinists, and flight attendants,  for example\u2014with varying levels of promised benefits.", "Defined contribution plans base pension benefits on the contributions  to and investment returns on individual accounts. Contributions may  consist of pretax or after-tax employee contributions, employer  matching contributions that require employee contributions, and other  employer contributions that may be made independent of any  participant contributions. In a defined contribution plan, the employee  bears the investment risk and often controls how the individual account  assets are invested.", "PBGC was established to encourage the continuation and maintenance of  voluntary private pension plans and to insure the benefits of workers and  retirees in defined benefit plans should plan sponsors fail to pay benefits.   However, if a pension plan\u2019s assets are insufficient to pay accrued benefits,  the plan can be terminated under certain conditions, and PBGC then  assumes responsibility for paying retiree pensions. PBGC may pay only a  portion of the benefits originally promised to employees and retirees. For  2005, the maximum statutory limit of annual benefits guaranteed by PBGC  is $45,613.68 per participant, for retirement at age 65.

As a result, airlines have  been more prone to failure than many other businesses, and the sector\u2019s  financial performance has continually been very weak. Airlines frequently  seek bankruptcy protection because of severe liquidity pressures, but while  bankruptcy may provide some immediate protection from creditors,  airlines in bankruptcy have not always been able to reduce their costs or  avoid liquidation.

External  shocks such as the Iraq War and the SARS epidemic have exacerbated the  situation. Operating an airline requires expensive equipment and facilities  as well as large numbers of people to operate them. Aircraft are very  expensive\u2014for example, the 2005 list price for a Boeing 777 ranges from  $171 million to $253 million\u2014and, therefore, airlines use outside financing  to acquire a fleet. In the United States, airlines typically use operating  leases, loans, or public financing instruments to fund their aircraft.  Servicing these leases or debt instruments requires considerable and  regular cash payments regardless of how extensively the aircraft are used.  Airlines also rely on specialists like pilots and mechanics who cannot be  easily replaced, making labor force adjustments to changes in demand  more difficult. In addition, the workers of many carriers, particularly those  of the legacy carriers, are covered by multiyear collective bargaining  agreements. While such agreements may provide important protections to  employees, they may limit carriers\u2019 ability to respond quickly to cyclical  changes in demand, much less unanticipated shocks like the September 11  attacks or SARS. Together, these characteristics result in long-term high  fixed costs for an industry whose fortunes fluctuate with the business  cycle.", "The airline industry is very competitive and has become increasingly so  with the emergence of low cost airlines and the relative ease with which  new airlines gain access to capital and enter the industry. It is difficult for  airlines to reduce their capacity because of the high fixed costs and low  variable costs of providing service. Capacity increases by individual  airlines are frequently matched by competitors. Low cost airlines grew over  the last 5 years, from 10.8 percent of domestic capacity in 1998 to 17.5  percent of domestic capacity in 2004. Low cost airlines have been able to  maintain their low costs by continuing to grow. Finally, despite historic  losses in the industry, new airlines are still willing to enter the market. As of  July 2005, seven carriers were obtaining operating certificates, while at  least one other had obtained its operating certificate but was not yet  operating. It is uncertain if and when these carriers will actually begin  service. These carriers plan to provide domestic and international  scheduled and charter service. These new airlines are indicative of the  willingness of capital providers to finance aircraft despite the industry\u2019s  continued losses.", "Demand for air travel is closely tied to the business cycle and is subject to  external shocks. So while airlines\u2019 most prominent costs\u2014for aircraft and  labor\u2014are locked into fixed payments and multiyear contracts, airline  revenues fluctuate because demand is cyclical. External demand shocks  can have a devastating impact on airline finances. For example, beginning  in 2000, an economic downturn precipitated a decrease in high-end demand  for air travel, while the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Iraq War, and  the outbreak of SARS compounded that trend.

A return to profitability that some financial  analysts expected for legacy airlines in 2004 and 2005 has not materialized,  in large part because of historically high oil prices.", "One way to measure the inherent instability of the airline industry is to  compare its operating ratio with that of other industries. The operating  ratio is the ratio of a company\u2019s operating expenses to its operating  revenues. One study found that from 1983 through 2001, the airline industry  had the highest risk in relation to return of any industry sector when  measured using this ratio. This study found that the airline industry had  an operating ratio of 97 percent, well above the average of 83.5 percent for  all other industries.", "Evidence of the volatility and weak financial performance of the airline  industry can also be found by comparing airline failure rates with overall  U.S. business failure rates. For 1997, the last year in which Dun &  Bradstreet produced these data, the overall U.S. business failure rate was  0.9 percent, while the failure rate for the airline industry was three times  greater, at 2.9 percent.

The exception was the first Continental  Airlines bankruptcy, when the airline\u2019s capacity doubled but expenses rose  by only one-third. Typically, cost savings were achieved disproportionately  by cutting wages\u2014in six of the nine cases, reductions in wages were  greater than the overall reduction in operating expenses.

For airlines, 148 of the 162 bankruptcy  filings since 1978 were chapter 11 filings.", "Several sections of the bankruptcy code have played a prominent role in  airline bankruptcies. Section 362\u2014the automatic stay provision\u2014gives an  airline breathing room from its creditors by stopping all collection efforts  and foreclosure actions and permitting the debtor to attempt to develop a  repayment plan. Under section 1121, the airline\u2019s management\u2014or the  private trustee if one has been appointed\u2014currently has the exclusive right  to file a reorganization plan for 120 days following the filing of the  bankruptcy petition; this period may be extended for cause.

This period may also be extended for  cause. Other sections of the code govern actions an airline might take to  restructure its operations and lower its costs in order to emerge from  bankruptcy. For example, section 1113 governs the rejection of labor  contracts and requires that the airline complete certain steps before  requesting that the court abrogate contracts. Section 1110 gives an airline  60 days to accept or reject aircraft leases, which allows the airline to  continue to operate without fear that its chief assets will be repossessed.  Additionally, several subsections of section 365 currently relate to airline  leases of aircraft terminals and gates. For example, an airline that leases  more than one terminal or gate may not assume or assign the leases unless  it assumes or assigns all of them to the same entity, which limits the ability  of an airline to realize the full value of its leases.

Currently, the  debtor has the first 120 days to file a plan, and can obtain numerous  extensions. The new limit will not force liquidations but will give other  parties an opportunity to file a competing plan somewhat sooner, thereby  limiting the debtor\u2019s \u201cexclusive period\u201d of control of the business. One  bankruptcy expert we spoke with indicated that this change would not  affect the majority of business bankruptcies, since most are concluded  within 180 days.

Under the current code, the debtor has 60 days from the commencement of  the case to assume or reject commercial real property leases, and this time  is often extended by the bankruptcy court. The 2005 act increases the  initial decision period to 120 days but allows for only one extension (of up  to 90 days) after that. Therefore, debtors will have a maximum of 210 days  from the commencement of the bankruptcy case to make a decision on  these leases. The court may grant a subsequent extension only upon prior  written consent of the lessors in each instance.", "In addition, the new law expands the grounds on which a chapter 11 case  may be converted to chapter 7 and increases the circumstances under  which a chapter 11 trustee may be appointed. The act also encourages fast- track chapter 11 cases by making it easier for debtors to implement  prearranged plans. Finally, the new law regulates the circumstances for  approval of key employee retention plans and related severance payments  by requiring that (1) the debtor establish that the bonus is essential to  retain the employee, (2) the employee have a bona fide job offer, and (3)  the debtor prove that the employee\u2019s services are essential to the survival  of the company.

According to available data for  19 of the top 50 bankruptcies since 1970, which involved 3 airlines and 16  other companies, the airlines\u2019 assets were 0.8 percent lower on average  after bankruptcy, while the other companies\u2019 assets were 47.2 percent  lower on average. At the same time, the airlines\u2019 liabilities decreased 32.1  percent while the liabilities of companies in the other industries decreased  56.9 percent.", "Outcomes also differed for airline and other industry bankruptcies,  according to Bankruptcy Research Database. The airlines were more likely  than the other industries in our analysis to liquidate. (See fig. 7.)  However,  airlines are also more likely than other industries to start bankruptcy in  chapter 11, which may account for their greater tendency to liquidate once  in chapter 11. For each group, a majority of the companies had  reorganization plans confirmed by the court (i.e., the companies had exited  or emerged from bankruptcy), though for airlines this majority was smaller  because of the larger percentage of liquidations.", "Our analysis of the Bankruptcy Research Database also revealed no  discernable difference between airlines\u2019 and other industries\u2019 likelihood of  reentering bankruptcy within 5 years. The rates at which airlines and other  industries filed again for bankruptcy were just under 15 percent. However,  these rates should be accepted with some caution and perhaps viewed as  conservative because the database captured only refilings that occurred  within 5 years and excluded companies with assets of less than $100  million.

We found  no evidence to support either contention and some evidence to the  contrary. For example, despite many airline liquidations since deregulation  in 1978, some of which were quite large, industry capacity has continued to  grow unabated thanks to the growth of existing airlines and new entrants,  often using the just-liquidated airline\u2019s planes. We also found that capacity  rebounded quickly in individual markets that experienced the liquidation or  retreat of a significant airline, as other carriers quickly expanded capacity  to compensate with little or no increase in overall average fares. Several  studies have also found that airlines in bankruptcy have not reduced fares  and did not harm rival airlines financially. Bankruptcies are not a panacea  for airlines, as some might believe.

In  1993, a national commission to study airline industry problems cited  bankruptcy protection as a cause for the industry\u2019s overcapacity and fare  problems. Airline executives have also cited bankruptcy protection as a  reason for industry overcapacity and low fares. However, we found no  evidence to support these views and some evidence to the contrary.  Notably, both in individual markets and industrywide, the liquidation of  major airlines has had only a very temporary or negligible effect on  capacity, as other airlines have quickly replenished capacity. In part, this  short-term effect can be attributed to the fungibility of aircraft and the  notion that industry capacity is determined by the entire aviation supply  chain and not solely by individual airlines. Finally, separate academic  studies have found that airlines in bankruptcy have not lowered their fares  or harmed the financial standing of their rivals.", "Both a national commission and airline executives have asserted, but  without specific evidence, that bankruptcy protection allows airlines to  avoid liquidation, thus contributing to industry overcapacity and  underpricing that harms bankrupt carriers\u2019 rivals. According to a 1993  report by the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline  Industry, one of the causes of the industry\u2019s financial problems was  bankrupt airlines. Industry executives and some publications have gone  further, stating that bankrupt airlines damage the entire industry. For  example, a former Chairman of American Airlines asserted that bankrupt  airlines contribute to industry overcapacity and are able to underprice  rivals by virtue of their bankruptcy protection. However, very little  evidence has been cited in any of these claims. In 1993, we testified that  claims and counterclaims concerning the underpricing of bankrupt airlines  had not been substantiated or considered in a larger context.", "There is little evidence that bankruptcy protection has contributed to  industry overcapacity, at least in the long term. If it did, then some evidence  that liquidation permanently removes capacity from the market should also  exist. All indications are that this has not occurred. For example, industry  capacity, as measured by available seat miles (ASM), grew two and one-half  times from 1978 through 2004. Growth has slowed or declined just before  and during recessions, but not as a result of large airline liquidations (see  fig. 8).", "Capacity has continued to grow despite liquidations for a variety of  reasons, including the fungibility of aircraft and the ease of entry, but  ultimately capacity in any industry can be traced to the flow of capital into  and out of the industry. For the airline industry, in which the chief asset  (aircraft) is easily resold (fungible) and heavily leveraged, capital flows  have supported the continued expansion of capacity even during industry  downturns. Except for government subsidies to airlines or manufacturers,  capital would flow to airlines only if the providers of that capital received a  return on their investments. Evidence suggests that capital providers have  profited and helps explain why airlines in bankruptcy continue to receive  substantial capital support from other members of the value chain. Experts  have espoused the notion of the value chain in understanding the role of companies in an industry. In the airline industry, the value chain  includes aircraft and engine manufacturers, such as Boeing, General  Electric, and Airbus; lessors, such as GE Commercial Aviation Service and  International Lease Finance Corporation; global ticket distribution  systems, like Sabre and Worldspan; credit card companies; airports;  suppliers; and others. There is considerable evidence that these other  members of the value chain have earned a good return on capital while  airlines have not (see figs. 9 and 10). Those companies further up the value  chain face less competition and are able to impose higher costs on airlines.  Accordingly, these companies have a vested interest in ensuring that  airlines survive and that capacity not leave the industry.", "Data from sources of financing to airlines that are in bankruptcy or  financial trouble provide some evidence of the vested interests of value  chain members in keeping troubled airlines alive.

We contracted with InterVISTAS-ga2, an aviation consultant, to  examine traffic to and from six cities that experienced the departure or  significant withdrawal of service of an airline (see table 4). In most cases,  while total capacity and passenger traffic decreased, the reduction was  largely attributable to the loss of connecting passenger traffic from the  departing carrier. There was little diminution in local passenger traffic for  most of these markets because other carriers increased their capacity to  replace the departing carrier\u2019s capacity. This research provides further  evidence that demand drives capacity and that the departure of a carrier  due to bankruptcy or a change in market strategy does not lead to a long- term decline in capacity. Appendix II contains additional detailed  information on each case study.", "A major study of airline bankruptcies\u2019 effects on air service also found that  bankruptcy generally does not harm individual airline markets. This April  2003 study examined all major chapter 11 bankruptcies from 1984 through  2001 to determine if and how they affected air service. The study found  that the effect of bankruptcies on large and small airports was insubstantial  and not separable from normal fluctuations in air traffic. However, for  medium-sized airports, the study found the bankruptcy of an airline with a  significant share of flights reduced service by amounts that were  statistically significant.", "Two major academic studies have found that airlines under bankruptcy  protection do not lower their fares or hurt competitor airlines, as some  have contended. A 1995 study found that an airline typically reduces its  fares somewhat before entering bankruptcy. However, the study found  that other airlines do not lower their fares in response and, more important,  do not lose passenger traffic to their bankrupt rival and therefore are not  harmed by the bankrupt airline. Another study came to a similar conclusion  in 2000, this time examining the operating performance of 51 bankrupt  firms, including 5 airlines. Rather than examine fares as did the 1995  study, this study examined the operating and financial performance of  bankrupt firms and their rivals. The study found that the performance of a  bankrupt firm deteriorates before the firm files for bankruptcy and its  rivals\u2019 profits also decline during this period.

The fees for United are high  for a company of its size, and they are rising as the company continues to  operate under chapter 11.

Interest rates are critical factors  in calculating the level of plan assets needed today in order to fulfill  promised benefits. When interest rates are lower, projected returns on  assets are lower, requiring more money to be invested today to finance  promised future benefits. At a 6-percent interest rate, for example, a  promise to pay $1 per year for the next 30 years has a present value of $14.  If the interest rate is reduced to 1 percent, however, the present value of the  promise to pay $1 per year for the next 30 years increases to $26.", "Bond yields underpinning the interest rates used to calculate pension  liabilities on a current liability basis have been trending lower since the  early 1980s, causing the value of future liabilities to grow.

When airlines did make tax deductible contributions, the  contributions were often far less than permitted. For example, in 2000, the  airlines PBGC examined could have made a total of $4.2 billion in tax- deductible contributions, but they contributed only about $136 million  despite recording profits of $4.1 billion (see fig. 16).", "PBGC has taken over a number of pension plans that have been  substantially underfunded even though their sponsors were in full  compliance with the minimum funding requirements. Existing laws  governing pension funding and premiums have not protected PBGC from  accumulating a significant long-term deficit and have not minimized the  impact of PBGC\u2019s exposure to the moral hazard arising from insuring  pension plans. The minimum funding rules depend on the plan sponsor  being in good financial health and continuing operations indefinitely; the  rules do not ensure that the plan sponsor will have the means to meet the  plan\u2019s benefit obligations if the plan sponsor meets financial distress.  Meanwhile, in the aggregate, premiums paid by plan sponsors under the  pension insurance system have not adequately reflected the financial risk  to which PBGC is exposed. Accordingly, defined benefit plan sponsors,  acting within the rules, have been able to turn significantly underfunded  plans over to PBGC, thereby creating PBGC\u2019s current deficit. This section  addresses three aspects of the rules\u2014the current liability measure, the use  of credit balances in meeting funding requirements, and PBGC\u2019s premium  structure.", "The current liability measure, which measures the value of a plan\u2019s  accrued liabilities to date for funding purposes, may provide an overly  optimistic picture of a plan\u2019s financial status and the sponsor\u2019s ability to  fulfill its obligations. Such a picture is possible because the current  liability measure tacitly assumes, among other things, that the plan and  its sponsor are financially healthy, viable entities. For a plan whose  sponsor is in financial trouble, a more conservative measure, the  termination liability, is likely to present a more realistic picture of the  liabilities the plan has accrued to date. From 1998 through 2002, airline  pensions were consistently funded above 90 percent on a current  liability basis. By that measure, the plan sponsors were not required to  make contributions because the \u201cfull funding limitation\u201d exemption  applied. In contrast, the funding status of airline pensions on a  termination basis during this time was under 90 percent in each year  except 2000, with a spread of more than 25 percent between the two  measures in 2003. Figure 17 illustrates the difference in aggregate  funding status shown by each measure.", "The result is that pensions often are significantly more underfunded  when plans are terminated than the current liability measure indicates.  US Airways\u2019 and United Airlines\u2019 recent pension plan terminations  illustrate this point. When these airlines terminated their pension plans,  the plans\u2019 combined benefit liability was $24.9 billion. Combined assets  in the funds totaled $10 billion\u2014a 60 percent shortfall.", "The ability of sponsors to use funding credits to fulfill minimum  contribution requirements has also contributed to pension plan  underfunding. Plan sponsors accumulate funding credits when they  contribute more than the minimum contribution requirement in a plan  year or when the plan\u2019s actual experience, including investment returns  on assets, exceed expectations; these credits can then be substituted in  later years for cash contributions. In this way, funding credits can act as  a buffer against potentially volatile funding requirements and allow  sponsors flexibility in managing their annual level of pension  contributions.", "If the market value of a plan\u2019s assets declines, however, the value of  funding credits may be significantly overstated. This overstatement  occurs because credits are not measured at their market value and are  credited with interest each year. For example, a sponsor can accrue a  $1 million credit by making a $1 million contribution above the  minimum contribution requirement. Even if the $1 million in assets  loses all value in the following year, the $1 million credit balance  remains and may be used as a credit toward the plan\u2019s minimum  contribution requirement. In addition, the sponsor would have to report  only a portion of that lost $1 million in asset value as a plan charge the  following year because of smoothing rules that allow losses to be  amortized over multiple years.", "Over the past 5 years, airlines have used funding credits to fulfill  minimum contribution requirements despite significant levels of  pension underfunding. For example, starting in 2000, United used  funding credits to avoid making cash contributions to its pilots\u2019 plan,  even though the true funded status of the plan had deteriorated. The  plan was only 50 percent funded at termination. Similarly, US Airways  avoided contributing cash to its pilots\u2019 plan by applying funding credits  to fulfill its minimum contribution requirements. At termination, this  plan was only 33 percent funded.", "Finally, the premium structure in PBGC\u2019s single-employer pension  insurance program does not reflect the agency\u2019s exposure to financial  risk. Although PBGC premiums may be partially based on plan funding  levels, they do not consider other relevant risk factors, such as the  economic strength of the sponsor or the plan\u2019s asset investment  strategies, benefit structure, or demographic profile. The current  premium structure relies heavily on flat-rate premiums, which are  unrelated to risk. PBGC also charges plan sponsors a variable-rate  premium based on the plan\u2019s level of underfunding; however,  underfunded plans are not required to pay this premium if they satisfy  the full funding limit or another exemption.", "In addition, current pension funding and pension accounting rules\u2014 especially those that permit assets to be smoothed rather than valued at  their market rate\u2014may encourage sponsors to invest in riskier assets and  potentially benefit from higher expected long-term rates of return. In  determinations of funding requirements, a higher expected rate of return  on pension assets means that a plan needs to hold fewer assets to meet its  future benefit obligations. Under current accounting rules, the greater the  expected rate of return on plan assets, the greater the plan sponsor\u2019s  operating earnings and net income.

At the end of 2004, these legacy airlines  reported $23.7 billion in total termination liabilities for their defined benefit  plans, with assets to cover 48 percent of these obligations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of Pension Plan Terminations on Airline Employees Varies", "paragraphs": ["When US Airways and United terminated their pension plans, active and  high-salaried employees generally lost more of their promised benefits than  did retirees and low-salaried employees because of statutory limits. For  example, PBGC generally does not guarantee benefits above a certain  amount, currently $45,614 annually per participant retiring at age 65. For  participants who retire before age 65, the guaranteed benefit amounts are  less; for instance, participants who first receive benefits from PBGC at age  60 are guaranteed benefits of $29,649. Commercial pilots often end up with  substantial benefit cuts when their plans are terminated because,  according to PBGC, their benefits generally exceed PBGC\u2019s maximum  guaranteed amount. In addition, if they elect to begin receiving benefits  from PBGC at age 60\u2014the age at which FAA requires pilots to retire from  operating commercial service flights\u2014their benefits are cut further. While  the loss of a defined benefit plan can be substantial for pilots, they typically  have additional and sometimes sizable retirement plans, such as 401(k)  plans, that supplement their pension plans. Nonpilot retirees are not as  often affected by the maximum payout limits. For example, at US Airways,  fewer than 5 percent of the retired mechanics and flight attendants faced  benefit cuts when their pension plans were terminated. Retirees generally  fare better than active employees because they receive higher priority  when PBGC allocates existing assets at plan termination. For example,  PBGC estimates that the pension benefits of all United\u2019s active ground  employees will be cut, with 71 percent of these employees facing estimated  cuts of between 1 percent and 25 percent. Of United\u2019s retired ground  employees, an estimated 39 percent will face benefit cuts; of these retired  employees, an estimated 93 percent will see reductions of between 1 to 25  percent. Tables 8 and 9 summarize the expected cuts in benefits for  different groups of United\u2019s active and retired employees.", "In addition to reducing pension plan benefits, airlines have made  significant cuts to active employees\u2019 health care benefits. For example,  American Airlines increased its active pilots\u2019 monthly contributions for  family health care coverage by 162 percent and began to require  contributions by disabled pilots for health care coverage. Before 2003,  United\u2019s ramp service employees did not have to make monthly  contributions for family health care coverage; however, these employees  now must contribute $173 a month for their coverage. While active  employees\u2019 health benefits have been cut, retirees\u2019 health care plans have  not changed significantly. Union officials said that reductions in retirees\u2019  health care benefit would not produce the savings sought by the airlines  and were not considered foremost during contract negotiations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congress Is Currently Considering Various Pension Reform Proposals", "paragraphs": ["The decline of PBGC\u2019s financial condition, the expiration of PFEA at the  end of the year, and pension plan terminations at US Airways and United  have prompted congressional consideration of various reform proposals  for defined benefit pensions. Currently, the three most prominent  proposals are the administration\u2019s plan; H.R. 2830, \u201cThe Pension Protection  Act of 2005;\u201d and S. 219, \u201cThe National Employee Savings and Trust Equity  Guarantee Act of 2005.\u201d All three are broad reform proposals that seek to  strengthen the defined benefit pension system in the long term and attempt  to resolve fundamental problems with the system, as highlighted in this  report and other GAO reports. For example, all three proposals contain,  among others, provisions that a) modify the measurement of pension  assets and liabilities, b) increase the premiums paid to PBGC, c) restrict  lump-sum distribution provisions, and d) adjust disclosure requirements.", "From the airlines\u2019 perspective, an important difference among the bills  concerns the length of time over which they can amortize the large  minimum contribution requirements currently due over the next 4 years.  The administration\u2019s proposal and H.R. 2830 would use a 7-year payment  period. According to a document issued by the Joint Committee on  Taxation, S. 219 would extend the amortization payment period to 14 years,  but only for airlines that \u201cfreeze\u201d their defined benefit plans. Table 9  suggests how this provision could significantly reduce the airlines\u2019  minimum contribution requirements in 2006. Amortizing these obligations  over 14 years would have an immediate impact on the airlines\u2019 liquidity.", "The rationale for extending the amortization period is that unless airlines  receive funding relief, existing minimum contribution requirements may  have such an adverse effect on their liquidity that they will be forced into  bankruptcy. The airlines then could terminate their pension plans and  transfer billions in obligations to PBGC. To prevent such terminations,  according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, S. 219 would decrease the  required annual contribution by allowing the airlines to extend their  payments over a longer period. Requiring the airlines to \u201cfreeze\u201d their  existing plans is designed to limit PBGC\u2019s exposure in case the airlines  cannot recover financially and terminate the plans before fully funding  them over the 14-year period.", "Although extending the amortization period would provide some liquidity  relief to the remaining legacy airlines with defined benefit plans, it would  not solve those airlines\u2019 overall financial problems, and the extent to which  it would limit PBGC\u2019s exposure to additional pension liabilities is unclear.  As shown in figure 18, pension obligations are only part of a much larger  set of fixed obligations through 2008. Given these other fixed obligations  and persistent high fuel prices, pension relief alone will not solve those  airlines\u2019 financial problems, nor can it guarantee that airlines will not  declare bankruptcy in the future. Furthermore, there is no assurance that  PBGC\u2019s financial exposure will be limited. According to a summary by the  Joint Committee on Taxation, S. 219 requires pensions to be frozen for the  extended amortization period to apply; however, liabilities could still  increase. For example, liabilities may increase with salary increases for  existing participants because pension benefits are based on participants\u2019  salaries. Even if liabilities are frozen, a plan\u2019s assets could decrease, leaving  PBGC with fewer assets to cover obligations. In the short term, extending  the amortization period might prevent airline pension plan terminations,  allow employees to collect more benefits than they might otherwise  collect, and allow PBGC to avoid taking over plans that are significantly  underfunded. In the long term, however, special treatment of airlines could  potentially expose PBGC to even greater costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["After 27 years, deregulation continues to affect the structure of the airline  industry. Dramatic changes in the level and nature of demand for air travel,  combined with an equally dramatic evolution in how airlines meet that  demand, have forced a drastic restructuring of the industry. Airlines have  experienced greatly diminished pricing power since 2000. Profitability,  therefore, depends on which airlines can most effectively compete on cost.  This development has created inroads for low cost airlines and forced  wrenching change on legacy airlines that long competed using a high-cost  business model.", "The historically high number of airline bankruptcies and liquidations is a  reflection of the industry\u2019s inherent instability. However, these events  should not be misinterpreted as a cause of the industry\u2019s instability. There  is no clear evidence that bankruptcy has contributed to the industry\u2019s  economic ills, including overcapacity and underpricing, and there is some  evidence to the contrary. Equally telling is how few of the airlines that have  filed for bankruptcy protection are still doing business. Clearly, bankruptcy  has not afforded these companies a special advantage.", "Bankruptcy has become a well-traveled path by which some legacy airlines  are seeking to shed some of their costs and become more competitive.  However, the termination of pension plan obligations by US Airways and  United Airlines has had substantial and widespread effects on PBGC and  on thousands of airline employees, retirees, and other beneficiaries. The  recent filings by Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines only exacerbate  these concerns. Liquidity problems, including $10.4 billion in near-term  pension contributions, may force additional legacy airlines to follow suit.  Some airlines are seeking legislation to allow more time to fund their  pensions. If their plans are frozen so that their liabilities do not continue to  grow, allowing an extended payback period may reduce the likelihood that  these airlines will file for bankruptcy and terminate their pension plans in  the coming year. However, unless these airlines can reform their overall  cost structures and become more competitive with low cost competition,  this change will be only a temporary reprieve.", "We have previously reported that Congress should consider broad pension  reform that is comprehensive in scope and balanced in effect. Revising  plan funding rules is an essential component of comprehensive pension  reform. For example, we recently testified that Congress should consider  the incentives that pension rules and reform may have on other financial  decisions within affected industries. Under current conditions, the  presence of PBGC insurance may create certain \u201cmoral hazard\u201d  incentives\u2014struggling plan sponsors may place other financial priorities  above \u201cfunding up\u201d their pension plans because they know PBGC will pay  guaranteed benefits.
