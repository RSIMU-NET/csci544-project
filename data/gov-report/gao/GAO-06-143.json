A CDHP is a high-deductible health plan coupled with a savings account enrollees use to pay for health care. Unused balances may accumulate for future use, providing enrollees the incentive to purchase health care prudently. However, some have expressed concern that CDHPs may attract younger and healthier enrollees, leaving older, less healthy enrollees to drive up costs in traditional plans. They also question whether enrollees are satisfied with the plans, and have sufficient access to health care providers and discounts on health care services. GAO was asked to study the first FEHBP CDHP, offered by the American Postal Workers Union (APWU). GAO compared the number, characteristics, and satisfaction of APWU enrollees to those of FEHBP enrollees in other recently introduced (new) non-CDHP plans, and national preferred provider organization (PPO) plans. GAO also compared the APWU CDHP provider networks and discounts to those of other FEHBP plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The APWU CDHP is a small but growing FEHBP health plan whose enrollees were younger than PPO plan enrollees, and healthier and better educated than other new plan and PPO enrollees. The average age of APWU CDHP and other new plan enrollees was the same (47 years), but younger than that of PPO plan enrollees (62 years), largely because fewer retirees and elderly people selected the new plans. Excluding retirees and the elderly, the average age of enrollees was more similar across the plans. A larger share of nonelderly enrollees in the APWU CDHP reported being in \"excellent\" or \"very good\" health status compared to the other new plan and PPO plan enrollees--73 percent versus 64 and 58 percent, respectively. Similarly, a larger share of nonelderly enrollees in the APWU CDHP reported having a 4-year or higher college degree compared to enrollees in the other new plans and PPO plans--49 percent versus 42 and 36 percent, respectively. Enrollee satisfaction with the APWU CDHP was mixed compared to enrollee satisfaction with the other FEHBP plans. For overall plan performance, APWU enrollees were more satisfied than other new plan enrollees, but less satisfied than PPO plan enrollees. For four of five specific quality measures--access to health care, timeliness of health care, provider communication, and claims processing--APWU enrollees were as satisfied as other enrollees. On the fifth measure, customer service, APWU enrollees were more satisfied than other new plan enrollees, but less satisfied than PPO plan enrollees. In particular, a lower share of APWU enrollees were satisfied with their ability to find or understand written or online plan information, the help provided by customer service, and the amount of paperwork required by the plan. The APWU CDHP provider networks and discounts were comparable to other FEHBP PPO plans. In 21 states, the APWU CDHP used the same networks used by other national PPO plans. In the remaining states, the APWU CDHP networks were among the most commonly used networks nationwide, or were large, nationally accredited, or comparable in size to networks used by other FEHBP plans. Across all states the average hospital inpatient and physician discounts obtained by the APWU CDHP were within 2 percentage points of the discounts obtained by another large national FEHBP PPO plan. GAO received comments on a draft of this report from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and APWU. Both generally concurred with our findings. Regarding the potential for CDHPs to disproportionately attract healthier enrollees, OPM said it would continue to monitor the enrollment trends and take appropriate action to eliminate or minimize any adverse effects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government provides health insurance coverage for over 8  million federal employees, retirees, and their family members through  health plans participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Program (FEHBP), the largest employer-based health insurance program  in the country. Similar to many large employers, the FEHBP has recently  begun offering \u201cconsumer-directed\u201d health plans (CDHPs). A CDHP is a  high-deductible health plan coupled with a savings or reimbursement  account that enrollees use to pay for a portion of their health care  expenses. The high deductibles typically result in lower premiums than  for a traditional plan with similar benefits, because the enrollee bears a  greater share of the initial costs of care. CDHPs may also provide enrollees  decision-support tools to help them become more actively involved in  making health care purchase decisions\u2014such as information about the  cost of health care services and the quality of health care providers, and  online access to the savings account to enable them to track their  expenses and progress toward meeting their deductibles.", "Views are mixed about the potential benefits and risks associated with  CDHPs. Proponents believe the plans can help restrain health care  spending. Enrollees have an incentive to seek lower-cost health care  services, and only obtain services when necessary because unspent  account funds can accrue from year to year within defined limits. They  also suggest that the lower premiums make the health plans more  affordable. Others, however, express concern that CDHPs may  disproportionately attract younger, healthier, or wealthier enrollees who  are less likely to use health care or who can better afford to pay the higher  deductibles. If this occurred to a large extent, premiums for traditional  plans could rise due to a disproportionate share of older and less-healthy  enrollees with higher health care expenses remaining in the traditional  plans. Because CDHPs are a relatively new concept in health plan design,  there is also interest in determining whether enrollees are satisfied with  the quality of services provided and whether the plans provide enrollees  with the same access to health care providers and negotiated discounts on  provider charges as do traditional plans.", "In light of the recent introduction of CDHPs as a health coverage option,  you asked us to evaluate the early experience of the first CDHP offered  under the FEHBP by the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) in 2003.  We examined: (1) the number and characteristics of enrollees in the  APWU CDHP compared to other FEHBP plans, (2) enrollee satisfaction  with the APWU CDHP compared to other FEHBP plans, and (3) provider  networks and discounts under the APWU CDHP compared to other  FEHBP plans.", "To identify characteristics of APWU CDHP enrollees, we analyzed data  provided by APWU CDHP and the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), the federal agency responsible for administering the FEHBP. To  determine age, gender, and family status, we analyzed enrollment data for  the plan years 2003 through 2005. To determine health status and  education, we analyzed enrollee survey data that were available for plan  years 2003 and 2004. To determine how the identified characteristics of  enrollees in the APWU CDHP compared to enrollees in other FEHBP  plans, we compared the characteristics to those of two groups of  enrollees. First, we compared the characteristics to those of enrollees in  all national PPO plans combined. These 19 plans include approximately  75 percent of all federal employees covered through the FEHBP. Second,  because characteristics of APWU CDHP enrollees may differ from the  typical FEHBP enrollee primarily because the plan was recently  introduced, we compared the APWU CDHP enrollee characteristics to  those of two FEHBP plans that had similarly been introduced within the  past 5 years. To control for the effects of a disproportionately small share  of retirees and the elderly in the APWU CDHP plan, we excluded from the  analysis retirees and those aged 65 or older, or both, when comparing  other enrollee demographic characteristics between the plans.", "To assess enrollee satisfaction, we reviewed enrollee survey data obtained  from APWU and OPM for the APWU CDHP and the other FEHBP plans for  the plan years 2003 and 2004. These surveys use a standardized instrument  to measure enrollee satisfaction along several plan quality measures, such  as access to health care, claims processing, customer service, and overall  plan performance. We also examined the volume and nature of appeals  regarding claim disputes filed with OPM by APWU CDHP enrollees and  other plan enrollees for plan years 2003 and 2004.", "To determine how the APWU CDHP provider networks compare to those  used by other FEHBP plans, we examined aspects of the APWU CDHP  networks used in each state and the District of Columbia (hereafter  referred to as a state), and compared them to the networks used by other  national FEHBP plans. We identified the states in which the networks  were the same, and for the remaining states, identified other  characteristics of the networks used, such as their size and accreditation  status. We also compared the average hospital and physician discounts in  each state between the APWU CDHP and another large, national PPO  plan. We had several discussions with APWU CDHP, its plan  administrator, Definity Health Plan, and OPM to clarify our understanding  of the data and materials.", "We did not independently verify the data provided by APWU CDHP and  OPM; however, we performed certain quality checks, such as determining  consistency where similar data were provided by both sources. We also  evaluated information from APWU CDHP and OPM concerning how the  data are collected, stored, and maintained, and determined that the data  were adequate for this report. We conducted our work according to  generally accepted government auditing procedures from November 2004  to November 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal employees have a choice of multiple health plans offered by  private health insurance carriers participating in the FEHBP.

Federal employees enrolled in the FEHBP  can select from a number of private insurance plans. In 2005, 19 national  plans and more than 200 local plans were offered through the FEHBP.  Plans vary in terms of benefit design and premiums. In 2004, nearly 75  percent of those covered under the FEHBP were enrolled in national  PPOs; the remainder were in regional or local HMOs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The CDHP Concept", "paragraphs": ["CDHPs are a relatively new health care plan design. While many variants  exist on CDHP models, such plans generally include three basic precepts:    An insurance plan with a high deductible. Deductibles are about  $1,900 on average for an individual plan and about $3,900 for a family plan,  compared to about $320 and $680, respectively, on average for a  traditional PPO plan.", "A savings account to pay for services under the deductible. The  savings account may encompass different models, the two most prominent  being health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) and health savings  accounts (HSAs). Important distinctions exist between HRAs and HSAs.  HRAs are funded solely by the employer, are generally not portable once  the employee leaves, and may accumulate up to a specified maximum. In  contrast, HSAs may include contributions from both the employer and the  employee, are portable, and may accumulate without limit.", "Unused savings account balances from prior years may roll over and  accumulate, along with the annual contributions from year to year. If the  savings account is exhausted, the enrollee pays out of pocket for services  until the deductible is met, after which point, the plan pays for services  much like a traditional health plan. To avoid the likelihood of enrollees  curtailing preventive care services\u2014such as cancer screening tests or  immunizations\u2014to preserve their account balances, most of the cost of  these services is typically paid for by the plan, regardless of whether or not  the enrollee has met the deductible.", "Decision-support tools. CDHPs may provide enrollees information to  help them become actively engaged in making health care purchase  decisions, such as the typical fees charged for specific health procedures  at participating hospitals, and quality measures for participating health  care providers. In addition, plans may provide enrollees online access to  their savings account to help them manage their spending.", "Proponents of CDHPs assert that the savings account and higher  deductibles encourage consumers to become more price conscious, and  use only necessary health care services to maintain and accumulate  balances in their savings accounts. The availability of information on  provider fees and quality is also expected to enable consumers to select  providers on the basis of price and quality. In addition, the higher  deductibles typically result in lower premiums than for a PPO plan with  similar benefits, because the enrollee bears a greater share of the initial  costs of care.", "Opponents, however, question the underlying premise of CDHPs\u2014that  health care spending is discretionary and will be constrained to any  significant extent by the financial incentives offered through a health  savings or reimbursement account. They cite, for example, research that  indicates that 10 percent of the population accounts for the majority\u2014 about 70 percent\u2014of health care spending. For such high-cost users, a  savings or reimbursement account would likely be quickly exhausted and  provide little incentive for enrollees to change health care utilization and  purchasing behavior. Some analysts have also reported that decision- support tools such as comparative cost and quality information about  providers\u2014important to enable effective consumer participation in health  care purchase decisions\u2014are lacking or not widely used.", "Given the relatively recent introduction of CDHPs, conclusive assessments  of their effectiveness at restraining health care utilization and spending  have not been made. Analysts believe that enrollment in CDHPs should  reach sufficient levels for a sustained period of time before definitive  conclusions about the cost and utilization of services can be drawn."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDHPs Are a Small but Growing Segment of the Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance Market", "paragraphs": ["Employers are increasingly offering CDHPs to their employees.

The  American Postal Worker\u2019s Union (APWU CDHP) was the first to offer a  CDHP in 2003, followed by Aetna and Humana in 2004. In January 2005,  several carriers began offering health plans designed to be coupled with  the newly authorized HSAs, increasing the number of CDHPs in the  FEHBP to 3 national and 13 local plans.

For example, if an enrollee exhausts the HRA by spending $1,200 on basic  physician office visit expenses, and then spends another $600 out of  pocket for extra preventive care services, the enrollee would need to  spend another $600 out of pocket on basic expenses before the $1,800  deductible is met and the plan begins paying 85 percent of expenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "APWU CDHP Enrollees Were Generally Younger, Healthier, Better Educated, and More Likely to Select an Individual Plan Than Other FEHBP Enrollees", "paragraphs": ["The APWU CDHP is a small but fast-growing health plan whose enrollees  on average were younger than enrollees in national PPO plans.
