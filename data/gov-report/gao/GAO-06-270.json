Although federal policy for disseminating information to the public specifically emphasizes accuracy, only four of the six agencies include accuracy as a performance metric in their contracts. With respect to oversight, only two of the six agencies used all four of the accuracy-related oversight practices we identified--regular knowledge database reviews, regular contact monitoring, postcontact customer satisfaction surveys, and validation of contractor reports. Although each agency used some form of oversight to assess the accuracy of the information provided by its contact center, each agency differed regarding how it implemented these practices. There is no governmentwide guidance or standards for operating contact centers--including guidance on specifying accuracy as a contract performance metric or as a key focus for oversight. Some agencies indicated that had federal guidance been available, it would have helped them establish performance indicators and develop oversight policies and practices. Recognizing the need for operational standards for contact centers, an interagency working group recently proposed draft guidelines to OMB and other federal agencies, but OMB has no plans to issue these guidelines or any standards for use by agencies. Additionally, until recently the federal government had not collected data on the universe of federal contact centers. OMB and GSA attempted to collect data on the number, types, and costs of federal contact centers in 2004, but the data collected were incomplete. In addition, no governmentwide procurement information was reported to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) in fiscal years 2000 through 2004 using the reporting code for telephone call centers, which OMB said is the appropriate code for contact centers. The five agencies we reviewed that report data to FPDS used a variety of different codes, some because they believe that the telephone call center code is too narrow to cover the services of their multichannel contact centers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year millions of citizens contact the government for information  critical to their health, finances, or general well-being.

This was demonstrated most recently during the response  to Hurricane Katrina. One of the principal ways the federal government  delivers results, according to the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), is by providing timely and accurate information to citizens.  Improving access to high-quality government information and services is  an important focus for OMB\u2019s current electronic government initiative,  which is an element of the President\u2019s Management Agenda. Information  provided to the public can be evaluated by various measures, including  accuracy, timeliness, completeness, courtesy, and overall customer  service satisfaction.

Recent GAO reports identified high error rates in the  accuracy of policy-oriented responses given to the public through one  contractor-operated contact center. In this context, you asked us to  review how agencies are overseeing their contractor-operated contact  centers to ensure that they provide accurate information to the public.  Specifically, we (1) identified the extent to which the contract terms and  oversight practices for selected agencies\u2019 contractor-operated contact  centers emphasize the importance of providing accurate information to  the public, and (2) determined whether guidance for the operation of  contact centers and basic information needed to provide general oversight  exist.", "To identify contract terms and oversight practices for contact centers, we  selected one contact center at each of six agencies. We selected centers  that handle over 1 million inquiries annually and provide information to  citizens that could significantly affect their finances, health, or safety.  Table 1 lists the contact centers we selected for our review and the main  public inquiry issues they handle.", "For each of these centers, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed  the contract terms and performance measures, as well as the policies,  procedures, reports, and tools used to oversee and evaluate the  contractors\u2019 operation of the contact centers. In addition, we visited four  contractor-operated centers to observe their operations and quality  control procedures. We did not independently assess the operations of the  contact centers or evaluate the effectiveness of the contractors\u2019 quality  control processes.

The  expected results of the E-Government initiative include providing high- quality customer service regardless of whether a citizen contacts an  agency by phone, in person, or on the worldwide Web. The E-Government  Act of 2002 codified the President\u2019s E-Government initiatives and  expanded OMB\u2019s leadership role by establishing the Office of E- Government and Information Technology within OMB. The act also  requires that agencies comply with OMB E-Guidance. One of the 24  presidential E-Government initiatives is developing and deploying  governmentwide citizen customer service using industry best practices  that will provide citizens with timely, consistent responses about  government information and services via e-mail, telephone, Internet, and  publications.", "By congressional direction, OMB also is responsible for establishing and  issuing governmentwide guidelines to federal agencies for ensuring the  quality of the information disseminated to the public. In response to this  direction, OMB issued guidance to agencies in February 2002 that defined  the quality of information to include accuracy as one of its fundamental  elements and directed agencies to develop procedures for reviewing and  substantiating the quality of their information before dissemination.", "Contact centers are one method agencies use to disseminate information  to the public. In the past, public inquiries to the government were often  made by telephone and thus federal agencies began establishing call  centers.  With evolving technology, citizen inquiries to the government  now come through various channels such as e-mails, Web-based forms,  facsimiles, Web chat rooms, and traditional postal mail. As a result,  agencies have established multichannel contact centers to handle these  inquiries. Contact centers rely on automated and live telephone response  systems, Web site technologies, and trained customer service  representatives to provide information to the public. For contractor- operated contact centers, the agency typically provides either scripted  responses or the content from which the contractor creates its own  scripted responses. The scripts are used for the prerecorded telephone  response systems, Web pages, and preformatted responses given by the  customer service representatives. Contact centers are staffed in tiers by  generalist or specialist representatives or a combination of both. Usually,  Tier 1 staff handle general information inquiries and direct more complex  or personal issues to specialized Tier 2 or Tier 3 staff or to the agency\u2019s  subject matter experts.", "One method for obtaining information on the contact centers that are  operated by contractors on behalf of the government is to review data  from FPDS. FPDS is used to report individual procurement transactions,  which include the industrial classification of the goods and services  procured by the federal government. FPDS was implemented by OMB\u2019s  Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in 1978 in response to the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act of 1974 requirement of  establishing a system for collecting and developing information about  federal procurement contracts. Since 1982, GSA has administered FPDS  on OFPP\u2019s behalf. In 2003, the system was revised and is now called FPDS- Next Generation.

Table 3 describes the four accuracy- related oversight practices.", "The first two practices, knowledge database management and agency  contact monitoring, provide direct oversight regarding accuracy of  information, because they focus on detecting inaccuracies in the source  information used to provide responses to the public and in the actual  responses provided by the customer service representatives. The  remaining two practices, customer satisfaction surveys and validation of  contractor-prepared reports, are more indirect methods of ensuring  accuracy in that they review customers\u2019 reactions to the information  provided and independent agency corroboration of the contractor\u2019s  reporting on its own quality procedures. The agencies we reviewed varied  with respect to how they implemented these practices. This variance was  due to a number of factors, such as differences among the agencies in  staffing levels, funding, and the use of guidance specific to the agency.

The only OMB  guidance we found that specifically related to contact centers is focused  on the use of performance-based contracting for such services. This  guidance is dated and limited in its coverage and does not provide  guidance on performance metrics for contact centers or oversight  practices.", "Because of the need for governmentwide standards for operating contact  centers, GSA in consultation with OMB, took the initiative to form an  interagency working group to propose guidelines to OMB and other  federal agencies. Formed in March 2005, the Citizen Service Levels  Interagency Committee is composed of 58 contact service representatives  from 33 executive branch agencies. In addition to relying on their  knowledge in running contact centers, the committee also had a  contractor perform two studies to provide insight on citizens\u2019 expectations  when contacting government agencies for information and current  industry metrics, benchmarks, and best practices for operating contact  centers. The committee submitted a report with 37 proposed standards for  operating contact centers to OMB in September 2005, including four  standards specifically related to ensuring accuracy. The committee plans  to continue to work on additional contact center issues and to help  agencies implement any contact center standards that OMB might  endorse. In October 2005, OMB officials stated that they had reviewed the  committee\u2019s report but did not plan to issue any governmentwide guidance  based on the committee\u2019s recommended guidelines at this time, because  OMB has not identified the operation of contact centers as an area of  concern. OMB stated further that if agencies need additional guidance in  developing their standards, they can refer to the committee\u2019s report.", "The agencies we reviewed each performed independent research to  develop their contracts and formulate a management strategy for  operating their contact centers. Performing independent research resulted  in duplication of efforts across agencies, using limited resources and  taking valuable time. For example, to develop guidance, the Department of  Education performed market research, worked with a contractor on  customer services and related standards, and studied industry best  practices on a limited basis. Similarly, CDC sent out a request for  information to industry to gain insight on the technology available for  operating contact centers before it developed its contract. CDC then  performed market research, reviewed industry practices, and visited other  government contact centers, such as that of the Social Security  Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to  learn about the practices of government- and contractor-operated centers.", "In 2004, GSA created a multiple-award contract called FirstContact to  assist agencies in contracting for contact center services. Under this  multiple-award contract, agencies can issue a task order to any of five  preapproved contractors to operate a contact center.

To date, the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency, GSA, and the  Department of Health and Human Services have placed six task orders  against this contract, and three other agencies are looking to place orders  as well. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  recently used this contract vehicle to quickly provide contact center  services for the influx of calls and applications for government assistance  in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

For this effort, OMB issued a data request to all  executive branch agencies to obtain basic data, such as the contact center  name, volume of contacts, and whether performance and cost metrics are  collected, for every activity that provides information directly to the  public. OMB normally uses data requests as a census tool to acquire a  snapshot of the current budget environment of the government. Agencies  responded by self-identifying over 1,800 activities that currently provide  information to citizens using various communication channels such as  telephone, e-mail, and Internet Web sites. The individual activities  identified ranged in size from a couple of employees who answer  telephone calls as part of their duties to contact centers with staffs of  several hundred employees who handle millions of inquiries through  several channels. Of the 1,800 activities identified, over 500 categorized  themselves as contact centers. Since it was making a nonstandard data  request, OMB performed little follow-up on nonresponding agencies and  did not verify reported results. We noted that some large agencies, such as  DOD, did not report any activities that provide information to the public.", "In an effort to expand on the information collected through the OMB data  request, GSA surveyed 360 activities\u2014approximately a quarter of those  who responded to the data request\u2014to develop a baseline snapshot of  governmentwide activities providing information to the public. However,  GSA\u2019s survey methodology was flawed because the agency selected its  sample from an incomplete universe, had a low survey response rate, and  did not perform a nonresponder analysis. Thus, the survey results did not  provide a representative view of activities across the government. GSA  plans to conduct a follow-up survey of government activities in 2007.", "While OMB and GSA information regarding the universe of federal contact  centers is incomplete, another potential source of information on those  contact centers that are contracted out by the government is the FPDS.  Since its inception in 1978, the FPDS has served as the governmentwide  system for collecting federal procurement data. Five of the six agencies we  reviewed, however, each used a different code to report their contact  center procurement actions to FPDS. Officials from agencies we  reviewed told us that no current North American Industry Classification  System (NAICS) code covers the full range of services provided by a  contact center. Table 5 lists the NAICS codes used by the five agencies  reporting data to FPDS.", "The five agencies that reported to FPDS chose different NAICS codes for  different reasons. Officials from DOL and GSA stated that they chose  alternative NAICS codes because the definition provided for telephone call  center does not cover all of the activities handled in a contact center.  Education and DOD-TMA officials explained that they chose NAICS codes  that encompassed the main work of the contract, since the contact center  is only a portion of the work in a contract for a larger program. CDC chose  its NAICS code based upon the information technology services required  for creating its contact center.", "No governmentwide procurement information was reported to FPDS using  the NAICS codes for telephone call centers in fiscal years 2000 through  2004.

Although officials from three of the agencies  we reviewed expressed the opinion that the definition for telephone call  centers is too narrow to encompass all the work performed by a contact  center, OMB told us that the telephone call center code is the correct code  to use. Specifically, OMB stated that the subcode of 561422\u2014 telemarketing bureaus\u2014was written with the intent to cover all the  functions of a contact center. OMB is considering issuing a clarification to  the description of the 56142 codes to explain that these codes include  more than telephones\u2014such as Web sites, e-mails, facsimiles, and so  forth\u2014in its next update to the NAICS manual in 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Providing timely and accurate information is a key result area for the  federal government. Federal agencies that use contractor-operated contact  centers to meet the public\u2019s demand for information assume the burden of  assuring that the information provided by the contractors is accurate.

Although agencies need flexibility in  meeting the needs of the individuals that contact them, they also can  benefit from the experience gained by their peers operating other  government contact centers. Short of mandating specific guidance,  increased sharing among agencies of successful practices for managing  contact centers may help improve their abilities to write and oversee  contracts for these centers and may avoid needless duplication of effort.  The guidelines proposed by the Citizen Service Levels Interagency  Committee are a step in this direction. However, whether this effort will  result in information sharing across agencies is uncertain. Leveraging  knowledge gained by other agencies through the sharing of effective  practices could be enhanced by governmentwide leadership. OMB\u2019s  leadership of the electronic government initiative, its role in guiding  agency dissemination of public information, as well as its procurement  policy role, put it in an ideal position to facilitate the exchange of  information among agencies to ensure effective oversight of contractors in  meeting the public\u2019s need for timely and accurate information.", "While OMB and GSA have taken initial steps to enhance the oversight of  federal contact centers by gathering some information on the universe of  these centers, it is not clear whether the data collected provide enough  information for governmentwide oversight of contact center operations or  whether GSA\u2019s planned data collection efforts will do so either. With  additional reliable information, OMB may be able to more quickly identify  and act on emerging problems and opportunities.

We also discussed the results of OMB\u2019s 2004  request for information to federal agencies that asked for self- identification of any activities that provide information to the public. In  addition, we reviewed and discussed the results of GSA\u2019s survey of a  sample of agency activities that responded to OMB\u2019s request. We did not  assess the validity of the data gathered by OMB and GSA. However, a GAO  methodologist reviewed the GSA survey methodology and identified its  weaknesses. In addition, we monitored the progress of the GSA-sponsored  working group\u2014the Citizen Service Levels Interagency Committee\u2014as it  developed and recommended standards to OMB for federal contact  centers. We did not assess the committee\u2019s recommendations as a whole,  but rather reviewed how accuracy of information was addressed within its  proposed standards. We reviewed data from the Federal Procurement  Data System for the past 5 fiscal years to determine if any contract actions  were reported using the code for telephone call center services.", "To describe federal agencies\u2019 efforts to ensure accurate information is  provided to the public by contractor-operated centers, we reviewed the  contract terms and oversight activities for one center at each of six  agencies. We selected centers that handle over 1 million inquiries annually  and provide information to citizens that could significantly affect their  finances, health, or safety. The contact centers selected for our review are    Department of Defense TriCare Management Activity (TMA) North  region\u2014Healthnet\u2019s contact center: provides general and personalized  medical benefit and coverage information and processes enrollments  and claims for military families in the North region;    Department of Education (Education)\u2014Federal Student Aid  Information Center: provides general information about applications  and loan issues and personalized information on the status of  applications and loans to the public and academic community;    Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2014CDC INFO contact center: provides  information about health and safety issues\u2014including prevention,  detection, and outbreak control\u2014to the public and medical  professionals;    Department of Labor (DOL)\u2014National Contact Center: provides  general information and referrals regarding job issues, workplace  safety, and pension and health benefits to the public and employers;    General Services Administration\u2014National Contact Center: provides  general information and referrals related to any agency or government  program; and    U.S. Postal Service (USPS)\u2014National Contact Center: provides general  and individualized information on mail delivery and shipping issues to  the public and businesses.", "To complete our review, we interviewed management and staff  responsible for oversight of the contractor-operated contact center at each  agency. We reviewed the performance metrics specified in the agency\u2019s  contract as well as the related reports used to oversee and evaluate the  contractors\u2019 operation of the contact centers. In addition to conducting  discussions with the agencies, we visited four contractor-operated centers  to observe their operations and quality control procedures. Specifically,  we visited locations for the GSA center operated by ICT Group, CDC and  Education centers operated by Pearson Government Solutions, and the  DOL center operated by Datatrac Information Services. At each center we  interviewed management and customer service representatives regarding  the oversight practices used to monitor the accuracy of information. We  did not test the contractors\u2019 internal control procedures or validate any  data from their sample reports.", "We identified industry practices for ensuring the accuracy of information  provided by contact centers, interviewed representatives from two major  contact center industry groups\u2014the Society of Consumer Affairs  Professionals and the Incoming Calls Management Institute\u2014and attended  the 2005 Government Customer Support Conference. In addition, we  reviewed prior GAO reports concerning contact centers. We also  discussed contact center issues with other GAO teams that were currently  reviewing or had recently reviewed other federal contact centers. Our  work was conducted from February through November 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Contact Center Profiles for Six Agencies Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["Medical benefits and  coverage issues,  enrollment, and claims  processing Daily 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.  (eastern time)", "Languages supported  (beyond English)", "Fiscal year 2005 call  volume  from February to September  2005  (estimated at 2.7 million  calls when fully operational)", "Total value of contract at  award (in millions of  dollars) (the contact center is only a  portion of this contract)", "Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. to  midnight; Saturday 9:00 a.m. to  6:00 p.m. (eastern)", "Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. to 8:00  p.m. (eastern)", "Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. to  8:30 p.m.; Saturday 8:00 a.m.  to 6:00 p.m. (eastern time)", "1-year base plus 9 1-year  options  1-year base plus 4 1-year  options  4-year base plus 6 1-year  options  $254.6 (for 4-year base only) (the contact center is only a  portion of this contract)", "Firm fixed price plus award fee3  DOL provides service 24 hours a day for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration toll-free  number and provided service 24 hours a day during hurricane relief efforts; Education extends its  hours during student aid application season; GSA provides service 24 hours a day under emergency  situations.", "The CDC contact center is in its second year of operation and is consolidating the work for 40  different toll-free numbers over a total period of 4 years.", "The contact center is a portion of a larger service contract.
