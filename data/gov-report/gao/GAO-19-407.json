For example, to reduce confusion about introductory phrases on date labels, such as whether the dates indicate food is safe to eat (see figure), and resulting food waste, USDA in December 2016 issued a fact sheet on date labels for consumers. In addition, USDA has funded research on issues related to date labels (e.g., how labels affected participants' willingness to waste food) and developed a smartphone application that provides consumers with information on the shelf life of products. FDA has issued educational materials to consumers about the meaning of phrases on date labels and in May 2019 issued a statement that it supports industry efforts to standardize date labels.", "USDA and FDA have coordinated on some initiatives focused on date labels on packaged foods. For example, agency officials said they were working together to develop information for food banks, food donors, and recipients of donated food on how to interpret date labels so food past the date on the label\u2014but otherwise wholesome\u2014is not wasted. In October 2018, the agencies, with the Environmental Protection Agency, signed a formal agreement to educate consumers about food loss and waste. In addition, USDA and FDA have taken steps to work with some nonfederal stakeholders\u2014such as nonprofit organizations and an international organization\u2014on date labeling. However, USDA and FDA officials told GAO that they do not have a specific mechanism to coordinate with state, local, and tribal officials on creating a common approach to date labels. State, local, and tribal governments may choose to regulate date labels, and the majority of states have date label requirements for certain foods. According to prior GAO work, ensuring that relevant participants are included in interagency collaborative efforts is a leading practice for interagency collaboration. By developing a mechanism to facilitate coordination with nonfederal stakeholders, such as state, local, and tribal officials, on actions related to date labels, USDA and FDA could better assure that approaches they take to address consumer understanding of date labels are effective in helping reduce consumer confusion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that USDA and FDA develop a mechanism to facilitate coordination with relevant nonfederal stakeholders on actions related to date labels.

This lost or wasted food  costs consumers $370 per person each year, according to a 2015 USDA  estimate. Studies have found that some of this lost or wasted food is  attributable to consumer and retailer confusion about the meaning of date  labels displayed on packaged foods. Except for infant formula, date  labels are not required on packaged foods by federal regulations, and  manufacturers who apply date labels use a wide variety of introductory  phrases (e.g., sell by, best by, best if used by), none of which indicate  safety, according to USDA. Consequently, consumers and retailers may  discard food that is still edible because they are confused about what the  dates and phrases on the labels mean, such as whether these dates  indicate the food is safe to eat. This waste of edible food poses a burden  on the American food system, such as when food producers use natural  resources to grow, process, and distribute food that goes uneaten. In  addition, according to advocacy organizations, some of the edible food  that is discarded due to consumer confusion about date labels could be  diverted to feed food-insecure households.", "USDA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the two agencies  primarily responsible for food safety oversight; together, they oversee  nearly all of the U.S. food supply. Within USDA, a number of agencies  have various responsibilities related to food labeling. For example, the  Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for ensuring  that meat, poultry, and processed egg products are wholesome, not  adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged, and the Agricultural  Marketing Service (AMS) provides voluntary quality-grading programs  that may include date label requirements. Within the Department of  Health and Human Services, FDA is responsible for ensuring that food is  safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. Although Congress has given  USDA and FDA responsibility for ensuring proper labeling, Congress has  not specifically given the agencies authority or direction to address date  labels on food packages. At the state and local levels, some governments  regulate date labels on specific products. For example, the state of  Montana requires that Grade A milk sold in the state be labeled with a  \u201csell-by\u201d date that is 12 days after the date of pasteurization, and retailers  must remove that milk from their shelves upon expiration of this date.", "Additionally, industry organizations and individual retailers have acted to  address confusion about date labels. For example, two industry  organizations\u2014the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery  Manufacturers Association\u2014in 2017 announced a voluntary initiative to  encourage manufacturers and retailers to standardize date labels on  packaged foods. Furthermore, advocacy groups and academic  researchers, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)  and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic, have studied the issue of  consumer confusion about date labels and how this confusion contributes  to food waste.", "You asked us to examine consumer confusion about date labels on  packaged foods.

We also interviewed officials from  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); we did not include EPA in  our objectives because while EPA is involved in food loss and waste  reduction efforts, the agency does not have a role in regulating or  overseeing labels on packaged foods. In addition, we interviewed officials  from the Office of Management and Budget and the Council on  Environmental Quality to determine the scope of federal activities related  to date labeling. We also reviewed documents, including studies on date  labeling, and conducted interviews about date labeling and food waste  issues with officials and representatives from a nongeneralizable sample  of 25 nonfederal stakeholders, including officials from seven states, seven  companies and industry associations, six advocacy and international  organizations, and two foreign governments (Canada and the United  Kingdom), as well as four academic researchers (individuals or groups).  Because this was a nongeneralizable sample, our results do not reflect  the views of all nonfederal stakeholders who have studied issues related  to date labeling or who have taken policy positions or steps to address  date labeling practices, but they provide illustrative examples of the views  of some stakeholders.

We also reviewed the formal  agreement USDA and FDA, together with EPA, signed in October 2018  aimed at improving coordination and collaboration on food loss and waste  issues among these agencies, as well as the related federal interagency  strategy the agencies announced in April 2019. We interviewed agency  officials about their coordination with each other and with nonfederal  stakeholders. We also interviewed the officials about their plans for  implementing the formal agreement. Among other questions, we asked  agency officials whether those plans include actions related to date  labels. We interviewed nonfederal stakeholders to determine the extent to  which USDA and FDA coordinated with them on issues related to date  labeling.

Previously, we have reported that the nation\u2019s  increasingly tight budget environment underscores the need for federal  research agencies to set priorities carefully and make effective use of  limited research funding. USDA officials told us that their awareness of  the role of consumer confusion about date labels and its effect on food  waste had increased over time. Furthermore, these officials told us they  planned to consider funding additional research if their process for  determining research priorities indicates additional research is needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Regulates Date Labels on Infant Formula, Has Provided Information on Date Labels to Consumers, and Has Supported Industry Efforts to Standardize Date Labels", "paragraphs": ["FDA has taken some actions related to date labeling, such as  promulgating regulations regarding date labels on infant formula. For  example, since 1985, FDA has required that infant formula display a  specific \u201cuse by\u201d date on each container of infant formula, which specifies  the date after which the formula should not be fed to infants. According  to FDA, this label indicates that the manufacturer guarantees the nutrient  content and the general acceptability of the quality of the formula up to  that date.", "In addition, since 1993, FDA has published the Food Code, a model for  safeguarding public health and ensuring food is unadulterated and  honestly presented when offered to the consumer. According to FDA, it  represents the agency\u2019s best advice for a uniform system of regulation  that address the safety and protection of food offered at retail and in food  service, and, while it is not a federal requirement, it is designed to be  consistent with federal food laws and regulations. The 2017 FDA Food  Code, which is the most recent, contains limited provisions related to date  labels applied by manufacturers of packaged foods sold in retail food  stores and food-service establishments. For example, the Food Code  contains a provision regarding shellfish. It specifies that retailers should  only obtain shucked shellfish in packages that identify the \u201csell by\u201d or  \u201cbest if used by\u201d date for packages of less than a half-gallon or the date  shucked for those of a half-gallon or more.", "According to Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) documents, in response to infant- formula products that were causing illnesses  among children because the products lacked  sufficient nutrients and industry had too much  discretion to decide the appropriate nutritional  content of these products, Congress passed  the Infant Formula Act of 1980. The act  mandates that FDA set uniform standards for  the nutritional content of infant formula. Under  this act, FDA established a range of  regulations affecting infant formula, including a  requirement that its labels include \u201cuse by\u201d  dates. The regulations mandate that  manufacturers determine dates on infant  formula based on tests that prove the  concentration of nutrients is adequate for the  health of children up to the marked date. In  addition to displaying a \u201cuse by\u201d label,  manufacturers are required to regularly test for  the harmful pathogens (disease-causing  bacteria) Salmonella and Cronobacter and  demonstrate that the infant formula they  produce supports normal physical growth.", "Additionally, the Food Code\u2019s provisions regarding the labeling of  packaged foods state that \u201cfood establishment or manufacturers\u2019 dating  information on foods may not be concealed or altered.\u201d However, the  Food Code is voluntary and does not have provisions for the use of open- code date labels. The Food Code establishes limits for the time that a  refrigerated, ready-to-eat food that has been opened or prepared in a  food establishment may be held prior to sale or service. The date the food  shall be consumed, sold, or discarded must be clearly marked; however,  the date is not required to be visible to consumers and is handled  separately from the disposition of packaged foods on which a  manufacturer has voluntarily placed a date label. The Food Code also  specifies how foods prepared in-house using specialized processing  methods, such as reduced-oxygen packaging, are to be labeled to  ensure they are stored, displayed for sale, or consumed within time limits  considered adequate to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.", "In October 2017, FDA issued information on its website for consumers  with food safety tips for foods purchased or received from a charity or  bargain store. For example, according to the information, an expired \u201csell  by\u201d date does not necessarily mean that a food is spoiled or unsafe.  However, in some cases, if food has not been handled safely, illness- causing bacteria may grow. In addition, the information states that  consumers should avoid purchasing packaged foods that require  refrigeration and that are past the \u201cuse by\u201d or \u201csell by\u201d dates because  these foods may be perishable and may have begun to spoil.", "Moreover, in May 2019, FDA published an educational fact sheet for  consumers on reducing food waste while maintaining food safety. This  fact sheet includes information about the meaning of language on date  labels, as consumers may waste food if they misunderstand what date  labels actually mean. For example, it explains that a \u201cbest if used by\u201d date  indicates that a product will be at its best flavor and quality. On the fact  sheet, FDA recommends consumers download USDA\u2019s FoodKeeper app  to know how long various food products will keep in the pantry, in the  refrigerator, and in the freezer.", "Furthermore, FDA has promoted a voluntary industry initiative to  standardize approaches to date labeling of packaged foods and improve  consumer understanding of the meaning of date labels. In May 2019,  FDA issued a letter to industry that described FDA\u2019s position on the  voluntary industry standard proposed by the Food Marketing Institute and  the Grocery Manufacturers Association in January 2017. This voluntary  industry standard called for using the \u201cbest if used by\u201d introductory phrase  in quality-based date labels on packaged foods. FDA said the agency  strongly supports industry\u2019s voluntary efforts to use the \u201cbest if used by\u201d  introductory phrase when grocery manufacturers choose to include a  quality-based date label to indicate when a product will be at its best  flavor and quality. While the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery  Manufacturers Association recommended the use of the introductory  phrase \u201cuse by\u201d to indicate the date by which products should be  consumed or discarded for safety reasons, FDA did not address the \u201cuse  by\u201d product date label for safety reasons in the agency\u2019s letter to industry."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USDA and FDA Have Taken Steps to Coordinate with Each Other and Some Stakeholders but Have Not Coordinated with Other Stakeholders on an Approach to Date Labels", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USDA and FDA Have Coordinated on Some Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["USDA and FDA have coordinated on some initiatives focused specifically  on date labels on packaged foods. For example, USDA and FDA officials  told us the agencies are working together to develop information for food  banks, food donors, and recipients of donated food regarding how to  interpret date labels on packaged foods donated to food banks to ensure  that food that is past the date on the label\u2014but otherwise edible\u2014is not  wasted. USDA officials told us the agencies plan to finalize this  information in 2019.", "USDA and FDA are also collaborating with EPA on an initiative to reduce  food loss and waste. In October 2018, USDA, FDA, and EPA signed a  formal interagency agreement, referred to by the agencies as the Winning  on Reducing Food Waste Initiative. The formal agreement states the  agencies are committed to increasing collaboration and coordination in  existing federal programs in areas of mutual interest relating to the  reduction of food loss and waste, and to developing an interagency  strategy to address this issue. According to USDA\u2019s website, as part of  this collaborative effort, the agencies agreed to coordinate food loss and  waste actions, such as education and outreach, research, community  investments, voluntary programs, public-private partnerships, tool  development, technical assistance, event participation, and policy  discussions on the impacts and importance of reducing food loss and  waste. According to the agreement, the agencies will seek to work  together at the federal level with actors throughout the entire food supply  chain to leverage the private and nongovernmental sectors. Specifically,  the agreement states the agencies will seek to educate these actors on  best practices to reduce food loss and waste in the growing,  manufacturing, transporting, selling and disposing of food, handling,  preparation and storage of food, as well as creating new uses for excess  food.", "After announcing the formal agreement in October 2018, the three  agencies in April 2019 announced a federal interagency strategy to  prioritize and coordinate their efforts as they implement the formal  agreement. This strategy identifies date labeling as a priority action area  and states that \u201cestablishing and communicating clearer, coordinated  voluntary guidance on food date labels and liability protection around food  donation could help increase food recovery and lead to reductions in food  waste and food insecurity.\u201d In the strategy, the agencies state that they  built on information from several sources, including EPA and USDA\u2019s Call  to Action by Stakeholders: United States Food Loss & Waste 2030  Reduction Goal and two reports from nonprofit organizations, all of which  cited clarifying or standardizing date labels as a key element for food loss  and waste reduction efforts.", "Establishing a formal agreement is a positive step and aligns with leading  practices for interagency collaboration.

For example, in February 2019, USDA, EPA, and FDA  met with NRDC and the Ad Council to discuss campaigns to inform the  public about ways to reduce food loss and waste, which includes  consumer education on date labeling. According to FDA officials, the  agencies will meet with the two groups later in 2019 to continue this  discussion. In addition, in April 2019, in keeping with the goal in the  agencies\u2019 Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative to expand  collaboration with nonfederal stakeholders, EPA, FDA, and USDA signed  a formal agreement with ReFED to collaborate on efforts to reduce food  loss and waste. The agreement outlines actions the agencies and  ReFED agree to take, including that the agencies will consult with ReFED  to develop approaches for measuring the success of various strategies  and techniques being deployed nationwide to reduce food waste.", "Furthermore, USDA and FDA provide senior staff and executive  delegates to represent the United States at the Codex Alimentarius  Committee on Food Labelling, among other committees under the  purview of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The commission, an  international intergovernmental body, produces the Codex Alimentarius,  or \u201cFood Code,\u201d a collection of standards, guidelines, and codes of  practice related to food, food production, and food safety. In 2018, the  commission revised its voluntary guidance on date labeling to clarify the  distinction between dates based on food quality and those based on food  safety. Because the Codex Alimentarius is a voluntary reference  standard, its guidance, including on date labels, is not binding on member  countries, including the United States.", "However, USDA and FDA have not consulted with all relevant  stakeholders. For example, state and local officials we spoke with told us  that USDA and FDA had not collaborated with them or consulted them on  approaches to date labels. In our prior work, we identified a leading  practice for interagency collaboration that calls for ensuring that the  relevant participants are included in interagency collaborative efforts.  Such efforts can include other federal agencies; state, local, and tribal  governments; industry; and nonprofit advocacy organizations. Generally,  state, local and tribal governments may choose whether to regulate date  labels on packaged foods. For example, the majority of states and the  District of Columbia have date labeling requirements. Advocacy  organizations and state officials told us that efforts at reducing consumer  confusion about date labels could be hindered without federal leadership,  as states may continue to have varying approaches. USDA and FDA  officials told us that they did not have a specific mechanism to coordinate  or consult with state, local, or tribal officials on creating a common  approach to date labels.
